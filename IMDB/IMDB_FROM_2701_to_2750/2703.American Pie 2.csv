0,Leofwine_draca,Lesser sequel,4,14 September 2021,"A lesser sequel that goes through the motions, hoping for more box office cash by simply repeating the formula of the first. Sadly it's cruder and less funny than before, the novelty gone, the whole thing one big exercise in eating the viewer's brain cells.",American Pie 2
1,SnoopyStyle,Friendships and Lesbians,7,8 December 2013,"The guys reunite after a year of college for their summer vacation. What makes this a good franchise is the friendships. It is more than the average sex romp.Jim (Jason Biggs) is pinning for Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) and get sex help from Michelle (Alyson Hannigan). Oz (Chris Klein) dutifully waits for Heather (Mena Suvari) who's away in Spain. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) can't get over Vicky (Tara Reid) who just wants to be friends. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is still obsessed with Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge). The guys hang out at the beach house and Stifler (Seann William Scott) muscles his way in on the guys.The friendships are paramount in this, but the sex romp makes it memorable. It is impossible to forget the lesbians and the radios. It is funny every time I watch it. Less so is the glue incident. Like the pie incident in the first movie, it doesn't maintain its comedy after the shock value is gone.The production value is improved over the first movie. The parties seem a little bit overblown. I guess when they got a bit more money, they got a few more babes to walk around. The movie is as funny as ever. The shock of some of the pranks isn't as original. However, it's great to see the friendships continue.",American Pie 2
2,jboothmillard,American Pie 2,6,9 March 2005,"The first film was a big box office hit and a highly successful teen movie, and many of the fans must have been thrilled that every member of the cast of the original were coming back for a sequel, from director J.B. Rogers (Say It Isn't So). Basically Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have all returned to their hometown in East Great Falls, Michigan after finishing their first year of college, and naturally they attend the party hosted by still oversexed Steve 'Stifmeister' Stifler (Seann William Scott), but this is cut short by the police. With nowhere to party because of the police Kevin finds out that there is a beach house in Grand Harbor, Michigan, so the four friends, plus Stifler for rent, pack their bags and make themselves comfortable, finding work as painters and decorators to pay the rent and prepare for the big party. Kevin is feeling awkward with ex-girlfriend Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum (Tara Reid) back in town and he feels may want to get back with her. Oz is missing girlfriend Heather (Mena Suvari) who is away in Spain and they keep their relationship going with attempted phone sex. Finch have discovered the sexual art of Tantra to keep in his desires as he waits patiently for the opportunity to possibly get with his goddess, Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge). Jim is worried because Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) will be returning, and he feels his lack of sexual experience will put her off, so he seeks sex tips and advice from his prom date Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan). Stifler is fascinated to see that the painted house owners Danielle (Denise Faye) and Amber (Lisa Arturo) may be lesbians, and with Jim and Finch he breaks in to find his proof, and they return and catch them they decide to mess with the boys, giving them homosexual acts in exchange for them doing it, e.g. the girls kiss if the boys kiss, and for a while they go with it. Jim's confidence problems only get worse when Stifler provides him lubricant, and distracted by pornography he unintentionally grabs super glue he used earlier to masturbate, and he ends up with his hand glued to his penis, the other to the porn video, at hospital, supported by his Dad (Eugene Levy) he is told there will be swelling for a while, and he is shocked to see Nadia arriving early. While preparations for the big party get underway, Jim has Michelle pretend to be his girlfriend until everything is ready and he has all the tips he needs, and with his penis back to normal they fake breaking up on the day of the party. So the party gets underway, Kevin is crushed Vicky has a boyfriend, Finch disappointed earlier that his goddess was not coming spends his time talking philosophically to various women, Oz has Heather surprise him having taken an early flight, and Jim lets Nadia down saying that he realises he has feelings for Michelle. The party is a big success, all the guests drinking and dancing with joy, with Jim and Michelle becoming boyfriend-girlfriend, Kevin and Vicky happy as friends, Oz and Heather still happy together, and Stifler ecstatic in bed with Danielle and Amber who turned out to be bisexual, even Chuck 'The Shermanator' Sherman (Chris Owen) scoring with Nadia. The end sees the boys packed and ready to go home, promising that if they can they will do the same again every summer, and Finch is happy to say Stifler's Mom, real name Janine, pop by and pick him up to go and have sex again. Also starring Natasha Lyonne as Jessica, Molly Cheek as Jim's Mom, Justin Isfeld as Justin - 'MILF' Guy #1, John Cho as John - 'MILF' Guy #2, Eli Marienthal as Stifler's Brother, Casey Affleck as Tom Myers, Joelle Carter as Natalie, Bean's Larry Drake as Natalie's Dad, Lee Garlington as Natalie's Mom and Austin Powers' Kevin Cooney as Doctor. The cast are still as likable as ever, Biggs more foolish than before, Thomas weirder with his holding in of an orgasm, Scott much more foul-mouthed and sex-obsessed, and Levy in his moments still amusing and embarrassing. The story is simple, just teens getting back together to drink a lot, have sex and party hard, but the slapstick and dialogue jokes still work when they need to, the highlights are Stifler being peed on, the terrible trumpet playing, the phone sex scene, the lesbian fun and the super gluing, it is a fun comedy. Good!",American Pie 2
3,Quinoa1984,Funny and sex filled movie,6,15 August 2001,"American Pie, the first one, was one of the best comedies of 1999, it was one of the very few teen movies, comedies especially, to show teens as they are: cursing, horny, animals.  That alone made it a really good movie, but the comedy was a big plus for it as well.  Now comes the sequel to the low budget comedy, American Pie 2.  Does this movie come close to the original, well, sort of.  It has gags galore and it gives good laughs for the money spent.  While it can't match up quite to the audacity, and originality to the original, it still had very good scenes mixed with very good characters. The funniest characters here are Jim's dad (Eugene Levy has one of his funniest characters with these 2 movies) and Steve Stiffler (cool dude). Only one more note here: try to wait after seeing this movie if you want to see it again or else the jokes might get stale.  B+",American Pie 2

5,preppy-3,If you liked the first one...,7,10 August 2001,"The five ""lovable"" morons from ""American Pie"" are back.  This movie is about their first summer after freshman year in college.  They all get together and rent a beautiful cottage to throw parties and have sex.  Naturally supposedly hilarious sexual hijinks occur.  I'm no fan of the first film (I thought it was pretty sick and I don't find sexual humiliation funny), but this is actually better.  The humor is toned down (although Jason Biggs' character gets in some pretty sick situations) and I admit I laughed out loud a few times.  It looks better than the first film and the performances are slightly (only slightly) better.  Unfortunately the film is incredibly sexist (no shock there) and there's an ugly homophobic sequence.  Still, I'd lie if I said I didn't enjoy myself.  It's also kind of admirable for a sequel to actually tone down its raunchiness instead of trying to outdo the original.  And Alyson Hannigan is absolutely wonderful (again) in this film. She was one of the sole saving graces in the first and is again.  As for the guys--Jason Biggs still can't act and seems destined to make a career out of being humiliated; Seann William Scott is absolutely appalling and unfunny; Chris Klein is given the thankless good guy role but pulls it off; Thomas Ian Nicholas hardly registers and Eddie Kaye Thomas actually is a worse actor than Biggs and very annoying.  So, if you like the first one you'll probably love this.",American Pie 2
6,zardoz-13,"This half-baked sequel isn't half as funny as the first ""Pie.""",5,18 February 2008,"""American Pie 2"" delivers only half as many laughs as ""American Pie."" The best thing this uninspired sequel about the sexual shenanigans of college freshmen does is reunite the entire original cast. Sadly, ""AP2"" doesn't make adequate use of its ensemble cast. Jason Biggs returns as Jim the sexual lummox who suffers the worst humiliations imaginable. No, he doesn't defile an apple pie as he did in ""American Pie."" Seann William Scott runs a close second as the cretinous but comical Steve Stifler. Happily, Eugene Levy turns up in more scenes as Jim's Dad. The biggest surprise is band camper Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) joins the group! Unfortunately, director J.B. Rogers of ""Say It Isn't So"" and scenarist Adam Herz neither devote enough time to Oz, Finch, Heather, Jessica, Kevin, and Vicky nor do they put them in farcical predicaments. Not only did ""American Pie"" consistently ripple with fresh comedy, but also it let the girls behave as lecherously as the guys. ""AP2"" confines females to second-string roles. Half of the fun in the original concerned how the gals manipulated the hormone-addled guys.""American Pie 2"" starts well, but it concocts less comedy than its predecessor. The Michigan teenagers from East Grand Rapids High are finishing their second semester in college. Jim is having goodbye sex with a blonde in his dorm room when his well-meaning but clueless father shows up with a six-pack of beer. No sooner has Jim's Dad interrupted them than his mom prances in, screams at the sight of her son naked with a coed, and drops an apple pie on the floor. After Jim gets home, Swedish exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth of ""Tomcats""), the hottie that he tried to seduce on the Internet, gives him a call. She wants to hook up with him at summer's end. Anxiety grips Jim. He fears his lack of sexual experience will repulse Nadia. Oz (Chris Klein of ""Election"") bids goodbye to Heather (Mena Suvari of ""American Beauty"") as she heads off for summer classes in Europe. So much for their romance. They experiment with phone sex, only to find Stifler eavesdropping on them. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Vicky (Tara Reid) spend the entire movie proving to each other they can be friends after sex in ""American Pie."" In ""American Pie,"" a group of sympathetic guys vowed to find girlfriends and lose their virginity on prom night. In ""AP2,"" the guys share a beach house on Lake Michigan and throw an end of summer, ""Can't Hardly Wait"" type, blow-out bash. Our heroes earn money painting houses. Jim sneaks over to band camp to persuade Michelle to tutor him about what women really want. Homophobic Stifler suspects that lesbians live in one of the houses that they are painting. The lesbians catch Jim and Finch in their room trying to rescue Stifler. This amusing scene and Jim's Crazy Glue episode provide the funniest moments in ""AP2."" You'll laugh at ""American Pie 2,"" but you won't laugh as often as you did at ""American Pie.""",American Pie 2
7,Boba_Fett1138,More of the same and that's not a bad thing.,8,6 December 2005,"I liked the first American Pie movie beyond expectations, so I of course was very interested in watching part 2 as well. It's like most sequels; it's more of the same old stuff that was already shown in the first movie. In this case that isn't really a complaint because it's good stuff to watch. It's perfectly entertaining and has some great memorable moments in it to also distinct itself from the first movie.Once more the power of the movie lies in its characters. They are all a perfect bunch of characters and I was happy to see that almost every single actor from the first movie once more returned for this one. All of the actors still look good and comfortable in their roles. The characters are truly the reason why this movie is better than the average teenage comedy.Even though there of course is very little story in this movie it still is a entertaining movie to watch that never gets boring. Once again the story has also a morale in it, which is a good but not an entirely necessary thing for this movie.More hilarious and odd moments in this typical teenage comedy. Basically its more of the same but that's not a bad thing to say in this case.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",American Pie 2
8,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,An OK sequel,7,17 April 2004,"Considering how great the first one was, I'm a little disappointed over this movie. It just seemed like they pretty much remade the first, just taking it a little further, making it more gross and more extreme, which may work for some fans of the first, but I honestly enjoyed the realness and laid-back feeling of the first far more than the gross scenes and stereotypes. Now, the stereotypes and the gross scenes are multiplied, to a point where it just gets a little tiresome. The apparent lack of any real original ideas, rather than just rehashes of the first, was a bit annoying too. But, all in all, it's an OK sequel, and a reasonably good teen comedy. The plot is OK, but it just seems too much like it was made up just in order to make a sequel to the first. The characters are a little too stereotypical, and not as well-written and real as they were the in first one. The humor is more or less the same, too much the same, in fact, as many of the jokes are just reused from the same formula as the first, like several of the scenes. Overall, the movie is not as good as the first, but it's OK. It's worth watching, if you want to see the characters again. I recommend this to fans of the first, and fans of teen comedies in general. 7/10",American Pie 2
9,view_and_review,I never thought pie was funny til now,7,4 June 2007,"I want to say that I was disgusted by ""American Pie"", that it was low brow potty humor only appealing to the lower life forms, of which I am far above. That's what I want to say.But, the reality is that I was cracking up at this movie. Man, I thought only the Farrely brothers did this type of comedy and succeeded.I never saw the first American Pie, but part two definitely reminded me of Porky's Revenge with the sex craving teens. This was definitely a teen movie, but as I've said so many times before: teens are great for comedies and slasher/horror films.",American Pie 2
10,anaconda-40658,Much Rather Watch Jason Biggs Pleasure Himself in Pastry Again.,1,25 August 2015,"American Pie 2 (2001): Dir: J.B. Rodgers / Cast: Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Seann William Scott, Eugene Levy, Jennifer Collidge: Witless story about the final year of college for those boys and girls who taught us so much about sex in American Pie. Jason Biggs is preparing to meet Internet woman Nadia and taking lessons in love from that airhead from band camp. Seann William Scott returns as Stifler who sleeps with two women he originally perceived as lesbians. Directed by J. B. Rodgers who handles the material confidently but lacks the original touches given his other gross humour comedy the same year, Say It Isn't So. His cast pretty much get lost in the vulgarity losing the ideas that worked in American Pie. Biggs returns as Jim and crazy glues his hand to his crotch. Alyson Hannigan is amusing as the band camp girl but it is obvious that she and Jim will hook up. Scott as Stifler steals scenes but he is more or less the subject to much vulgar payoff particularly in a scene where he gets drenched in urine. Eugene Levy returns as Jim's dad but this time the role seems more like a prop for one-liners. Jennifer Coolidge plays Stifler's sexually permissive mother. American Pie is gross comedy but its adolescent sexual curiosity is relating to its target audience. American Pie 2 is complete with drab locations and probably should be drenched in urine. Score: 1 / 10",American Pie 2
11,Wuchakk,"Good, funny parts ruined by sex-obsessed raunch",4,29 August 2016,"Released in 2001, ""American Pie 2,"" features the characters of the first movie (from 1999) after their freshman year of college, having fun during the summer break, particularly at a beach house where they throw the biggest party ever. I like high school and college comedies and I can see the good in ""American Pie 2"" (and the first film), like the quality characters, genuinely amusing parts, the fun rockin' soundtrack and the beauty of some of the girls, like Mena Suvari & Lisa Arturo, but there's just too much raunch. The over-the-top sleazy/vulgar parts ruin the good, for me anyway. It's a shame; what a waste. The movie runs 108 minutes and was shot in Malibu, Long Beach, Altadena & Pasadena, CA, as a stand-in for Grand Haven, Michigan. GRADE: C-",American Pie 2
12,StevePulaski,Tastes as if it were fresh,8,21 March 2012,"When a film is an unexpected hit, it is not uncommon to see a sequel trying to rehash the formula. Unfortunately, while sounding like a clever idea, utilizing the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" motto, only a handful of films can get away with. With comedy films, it's especially rare and difficult, since many thing that existed in the first film are now close to obsolete. Most recently, we can say what an utter disappointment The Hangover Part II was, and for animation, I can see a look of sorrow and woe on all our faces when we paid to see The Jungle Book 2. Also, how many parents felt just a tiny bit cheated when they ventured out with their kid to Home Alone 2: Lost in New York? I bring this up because, being an avid moviegoer and watcher, I experience it a lot, and probably tend to notice it more than other people. I expected American Pie 2 to be nothing but a mediocre rehash of a formula I believed would only form a successful film once. The element of surprise is gone, the characters have grown up a bit, and there just doesn't seem to be a conceivable way to freshen the idea without taking an obviously lucrative turn. Thankfully, screenwriter Adam Herz, who also wrote the first Pie film, has made me eat those words along with his second helping of pie. American Pie 2 is one of the few comedy sequels I've seen that efficiently redoes what the original paved out, yet still includes that new movie smell.The plot revolves around the same bunch of characters we loved in the first film, only this time they're not naive high school Seniors days away from graduating, but less naive College kids on summer break. Jim (Biggs), Kevin (Nicholas), Oz (Klein), and Finch (Thomas) all return and plan to throw an unforgettable bash at a Grand Harbor lakehouse in Michigan. Not a whole ton has changed with the guys, Jim hasn't gotten over foreign exchange hottie Nadia (Elizabeth), Kevin is still desperately seeking Vicky (Reid), after cutting their relationship short to attend separate colleges, Oz is still dating the adorable choir girl Heather (Suvari), and Finch still has not gotten over his fling with Stifler's mom (Coolidge).When Jim learns that Nadia will be returning from Chicago to see him during the summer, he seeks the advice of quirky but lovable Michelle (Hannigan), whom he took to Senior Prom. The chemistry between the two is electric, and you almost crave to hear Hannigan recite the famous six words I doubt you need repeated. Also, some of the funniest work comes from Eugene Levy, reprising his role as Jim's father who continues to be supportive and understanding of his son's bizarre sex accidents. It seems Levy exists as the satirical character in a world where the kids are in a comedy movie. The unexpected mix works perfectly with the overall feel. The only character I feel is still painfully underused is Natasha Lyonne's Jessica, who seems like she could deliver more if the screenplay let her. Maybe she is supposed to be mysterious and subtle in her presence.There is a bit more of a focus on gross-out gags here than in the first film. One scene involving potential lesbian neighbors is stretched out a bit too long, and loses some of its humor over time. There is also a scene involving urine which isn't very funny, but we're thrilled to see these characters back again, cherishing and embracing each of their sitcom personas.Like in the original film, there is a nice blend of sweetness and wit to compliment a lot of the gross antics, making for a nice hybrid. We've only spent two movies with these characters, but somehow feel we've personally connected with them in a way that makes us crave more events involving them. It's so rare we get characters like this, and everyone here seems to be determined to make a great, fun movie. So many people just look at the original Pie trilogy and see it as nothing but a reviled sex romp and nothing more. Many don't pay attention to the intelligence and spirit that makes these films so delightfully enigmatic and cheery. That's what the Pie is all about.I just have one tiny question for the gang this time around. We are informed of the ""rule of three"" where if you ask a girl how many guys she has slept with, you take that number and multiply it by three. Okay. Fair enough. We then learn from the girls that when you ask a guy how many girls he has slept with, you take the number and divide it by three. So what if a guy says he has slept with five girls. He has slept with 1.7 girls?

13,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Not a big fan of it, but it was better than the first",5,1 November 2004,"I have only met one person who didn't like this film. So, I decided to give it a shot, even though I disliked the first ""American Pie"". I have to admit, I had a couple laughs. But there were still a lot of jokes that were too close to the first one. The plot was also the same. I don't mind that too much. But if you didn't enjoy the first one, you won't get a big kick out of this one. I did enjoy some of the jokes. And the story was a point above the first one. So, if you loved the 1st, be my guest. If you didn't enjoy the 1st one, still give the 2nd a shot. You don't know what you may get. Some may actually just enjoy the 2nd one alone. Who knows? Maybe I'll even watch ""American Wedding"". 5/10",American Pie 2
14,MovieAddict2016,Why does everyone hate this so much?,7,31 August 2005,"I'll be first to admit that I hate teen comedies in general and typically frown upon most of them - I didn't even like ""There's Something About Mary"" too much, although I'm not sure it's really a ""teen"" film.I own all three ""American Pie"" films on DVD because they are one of the few teen series whose characters seem real and you actually feel empathy for. They're not awkward characterizations of real people without emotions - the movie takes time setting up their personalities, quirks, etc., and then places them in embarrassing situations. For example, the movie ""Swingers."" That telephone call Favreau makes is a painful experience for the viewer. Would it have been so painful if we hadn't gotten to know him throughout the movie? ""American Pie"" is kinda like that. It works well because of the characters. It's crude, yes. It's crass, very. It's sexist, maybe. But that's how guys are. It doesn't exploit these elements as many teen sex comedies do - some are moderately entertaining (like the Johnny Depp film ""Private Resort"") but unbelievable and basically just lots of skin. ""American Pie"" is better, one of the best of its genre.Everyone seems to hate the first sequel, which was released in 2001, a couple years after the original. Jim (Biggs) returns from college and hangs out for the summer at a beach house with his best pals. But with Stiffler (Seann William Scott) there, it's not too easy because they soon end up in more embarrassing situations.This movie is very similar to the original and normally I have a problem with this. Basically all the scenes are ""updates"" on scenes that existed in the original. E.g. the lesbian strip over the walkie-talkies, the incident with the glue, the whole thing with Stiffler's mom and Finch.Nevertheless it is effective, entertaining and funny. The characters are given more room to develop and believe it or not, I think I like this better than the first film. (The third is probably my favorite, if only for the focus on Stiffler and the introduction of Fred Willard, one of the great character actors of our time.) ""American Pie 2"" is somewhat recycled and some people may find it one of those ""pointless"" sequels, but I liked it, and this is coming from a guy who typically loathes these films - so considering I'm giving this seven stars, that says quite a lot. Either I'm out of my mind or there's something about these films that's just more accessible and likable than others in their genre.",American Pie 2

The plot takes place right on a beach(yeah, girls) The script was not as good as the first, but the jokes are absolutely hilarious. Biggs once again lives up to the heat as he appears in many funny scenes(lesbian scene, glue scene, band camp scene, etc.) Once again, some adults over 40 might not understand many of these jokes.

16,ericstevenson,Serviceable,7,22 January 2017,"As someone who found the original ""American Pie"" to just be passable, I found this one to be the same way! I think a fault is that a lot of this movie is pretty boring. Still, I think the good outweighed the bad. I especially liked how realistic the film was. I can totally see myself being put in situations like this. We all knew what it was like to be this old (well, at least those who are that old). Pretty much anything with the dad is good. I'm disappointed that they didn't use him more. He's probably the funniest aspect of the whole movie.The joke in the middle might be the best one. I really do appreciate its setup and how silly it is. I was hoping I'd get some goofy gags with this and I did in the end. At worst, these movies are just okay. I really do like the main character and I find him pretty easy to relate to. He probably is the nicest character in the whole bunch, somewhat reminding me of myself, hee hee. Some of the jokes are pretty juvenile, but it does have a fair amount of heart in it. That's weird to say about a raunchy comedy, but I believe it to be true. ***",American Pie 2

21,Floated2,Not as great as the original but still good,7,24 October 2009,"American Pie 2 was good but it wasn't better than the first one. This was funny but not as funny as the first one, the plot in this was kinda lame. In American Pie 2 they decide to get even closer, by spending the summer together at a beach house. They decide to hold the biggest party ever to be seen, even if the preparation doesn't always go to plan. Especially when Stifler, Finch and Jim become more close to each other than they ever want to be and when Jim mistakes super glue for lubricant.When the 'American Pie' gang returns, everyone knows that they will be expecting gross out humour and wild characters, and this movie doesn't disappoint. All the wonderful characters are back, including Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad, who steals every scene he is in. Stifler is his usual self and Finch is more entertaining this time. A lot of the female side of cast have a reduced role in this movie. Alyson Hannigan's (Michelle) role is expanded, whilst the others only appear in a few scenes. The jokes again are well written, but like the first film, are not the most cleanest of jokes. Funniest scenes include lesbians that make Jim, Stifler, Finch do what they say, Jim gluing his dick with glue then being rushed to the hospital ""You guys are not team players"" - Stifler (Seann William Scott)",American Pie 2
22,TheMovieDiorama,American Pie 2 doubles the amount of crude toppings but lessens the characterised filling.,5,24 October 2019,"A sex comedy can only be pushed so far before it miraculously transfers to soft-core pornographic territory. The original American Pie, whilst an influential milestone in the sub-genre, was a satirical take on high-school life by hyperbolising the quest for losing one's virginity. How would Rogers and Herz continue the saga? Well, shoving a trumpet up one's filthy anus, using super-glue instead of lubricant during an awkward masturbation sequence and the longest ""lesbian"" endeavour ever. Suffice to say, the misadventures of these four friends do not retain the freshness of the original. After their freshmen year at college, the boys regroup for a party held by Stifler at a rented beach home, where they intend to spend the summer getting laid and participating in cringe-inducing phone sex (twice!).The cast are back, ready to precariously thrust beds, the tainted air and Stifler's mother in a luxurious car (no pie though...). Yes, the aroma of crusty semen and raging hormones plague the summer season. Whilst that may be sufficient comedy for fans of the original, there's no saucy masquerading of the narrative structure. It's a complete retread of its predecessor. Almost identical! The characters go through the exact same scenarios, only heightened by a writer who clearly couldn't produce any enticing material. The equivalent of an adult magazine. Used once, thrown away shortly afterwards.The elongated and repetitive scenes of comedy, while slightly funny initially, tire themselves by never ending. The ""lesbians"" persuading the guys to play with each other? That was essentially thirty minutes of the runtime, and as a homosexual, horrible to endure. God bless Hannigan though for stepping up her game, she was an absolute delight with an equal balance of comedic timing and heartfelt peculiarity. The remaining cast members, aside from Reid who was predicting her 'Sharknado' future, all performed consistently as expected. And by that, I mean with the overwhelming smell of mediocrity. I do not want to see Klein touch himself again whilst talking provocatively on a phone! The padding in the pants was too much *starts to heave*.Oh, and the lack of basic mathematic knowledge. Right, simple arithmetics here, the whole ""Rule of 3"" scenario. Pens and paper and the ready, please. If Kevin stated he slept with three girls, and this ""Rule of 3"" means you divide the number by three, how many did he actually sleep with? Take your time now...! Got it? Well, the result is not zero. It's one. Why the hell are these college students objectively stating the answer to be zero? Are they mad? Fine, Vicky isn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but Kevin? C'mon man. Arithmetics! Of course, it isn't an American Pie film without the alternative rock soundtrack. Blink-182, Sum 41, Green Day and Alien Ant Farm all make an appearance and give life to the teen angst shown on screen.Just a shame this sequel gave me unnecessary angst for never surpassing the original's hilarity. If you adored its predecessor and appreciated its exaggerated satire, then this sequel will only be viewed as watchable. If you just want crude comedy and are content with elongated phone sex sequences, by all means give this second pie a taste. It's not piping hot, but lukewarm at best.",American Pie 2

24,Anonymous_Maxine,"Hey, at least it wasn't WORSE than the first one.",3,13 May 2002,"American Pie 2 starts off its rehash of the first film with the ever-present trailer gag. The trailer gag, of course, is one of the many gags that was played and played and replayed in the film's trailer(s) and is therefore completely without effect when seen in the theaters. The barrage of teen sex films/thrillers of the last decade or so are plagued with trailer gags, and some of those movies (Sorority Boys) contain little else. Here, we see Jim's (the unbearable Jason Biggs) father walk in as he and his girlfriend (if she could be called that, since they evidently have not even had `friendly hello sex') are having sex. This intrusion is followed by that of Jim's mother, who has the obligatory fit, and then, mysteriously, both of Natalie's (Jim's `girlfriend') parents. So within the first minutes of the film, we are given a stolidly unamusing scene involving the exact same sexual awkwardness that was present in every scene that Eugene Levy (Jim's father) and Jim shared in the first movie, and we're left wondering why Natalie's parents walked into the room at all.The rest of the movie is more of the same. In the movie's defense, however, I must say that Seann William Scott was just as hilarious in every scene that he was in as he was in the first movie. The characters in both movies are hugely stereotypical caricatures of what, according to Hollywood producers, the typical college kid looks and acts like, and Stifler is the only one in either film that turns out even slightly amusing. It's no secret that films of this type tend to feed relentlessly off their original films in order to provide most of the laughs (Austin Powers 2), or lack thereof (Scary Movie 2), but it can at least be said that that was done at a minimum in the case of American Pie 2. There is, thankfully, no `pie,' for example. On the other hand, the film does manage to feed off of other successful comedies. We see, for example, the introduction of Stifler's Mini-Me, as Stifler's younger brother enters the film, and is literally a miniature version of Stifler.For the entire film that doesn't contain Stifler, however, just about every single comedic scene falls completely flat, as was also the case with several of the scenes that Stifler WAS in (anything involving urine or, theoretically, lesbians, for example). Jim is once again cruelly thrown into every kind of awkward and embarrassing situation imaginable, leaving the audience not laughing, but also feeling awkward and embarrassed. There is, for example, the completely tasteless scene in which he is mistaken for a retarded trombone player - did NOBODY at that damn band camp know what this Petey looked like?! And the statement that Jim utters at the abrupt end of his performance (branding him by far the most moronic character in the film for the rest of the movie), will have your jaw on the floor in disgusted shock before you can say, `Oh my good God, you're KIDDING.'
And all of the characters are back, too. Oz is back with his sickeningly sweet relationship with his insufferable girlfriend Heather, Finch is back in one of the more amusing roles in the film, having become so obsessed with his reunion with Stifler's mom that he meditates almost constantly, and Kevin is back again, having long since broken up with Vicky (Tara Reid). There is a curious interaction between Kevin and Vicky throughout the film. It's obvious that there's a lot of sexual tension and weirdness between them, but it's impossible to care whether they get back together or not. There's a scene early in the film in which they almost kiss, and Vicky is put off, reminding him that they're just friends in what I hope to no end is the worst scene that Tara Reid has ever acted. If it gets worse that THAT.There is an interesting paradox that comes with movies like the American Pies and the Scary Movies and Road Trip and Sorority Boys that, logically, should reduce the films to complete failure almost immediately upon release. They are clearly jam-packed with the kind of humor that amuses 4th grade children (and even THEM for no other reason than because they know their parents would hate it), yet they appear to be aimed at a late high school or (gulp) early college age audience. I was going to say that films like this can be watched just for a little fun, but then I wondered how much fun it is to watch a film in which a girl like Nadia falls completely in love with idiot after idiot, and I began to wonder what it is that made the film's producers and writers develop such an abysmally low opinion of their audience. Is it because we made their first film such a huge success? Could it be that they are sending a message with this movie? If they are, it's probably something like this, `You LIKED that garbage?! Well, take THIS!!'
There is a clear lesson to be learned here, people, and I hope that everyone has been taking note of it. If we all keep paying to see this trash that is constantly cranked out by Hollywood, then we are only asking for more trash to be put on the menu. I think I said in my review of Scary Movie 2 that it's a lot of fun even to watch films that are so bad that they are virtually un-enjoyable, if only to tear them down later in my review. I won't say that American Pie delves to the unspeakably awful level that the Scary Movies both sunk to, but even writing reviews of the best bad movies gets old. A second sequel in this series is something that I would be more than happy to never see.",American Pie 2
25,taylorkingston,Better than the original...,8,26 September 2014,"At first, after seeing the original American Pie, and not liking that much, I was a bit reluctant to watch this, but I thought I'd at least give it a chance. And I honestly have to say, this movie is totally better than the original. It has better character development, even though, you know no one is paying attention that sort of thing. It is, to sum it up, a better movie with better lines and a better plot. Being at a beach-house-thing, so much funnier than just the guys at high school. And Stifler still cracks me up. Every single line he says is just pure gold. Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",American Pie 2
26,dfranzen70,Horny pie served up smashingly well,7,8 September 2001,"Raunch used to be so simple! You'd go see Porky's, you knew you were gonna see some T&A. Oh, and maybe a small heartfelt lesson about how people are generally good, even those who are different from us, as long as we have the same goal of getting laid in mind. Those were such wonderful days! Now, everyone's more jaded, even (especially) the kids. You show a kid the shower scene from Porky's, and he'll love it, but I bet after the first few viewings it won't be as much fun. Kids need something new all the time. Now, American Pie is an R-rated film, so at least the intended audience isn't the teen crowd, exactly, but then neither was Porky's (or any of its knock offs). The cast from the original American Pie is reunited. The time is now one year later, and the gang's home from college for the summer. Jim (Jason Biggs) still has his sexual hang-ups. Remember Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), the band-camp girl? Jim went to the prom with her, and she didn't talk to him after that. But don't worry, she's at band camp again and figures prominently in this movie. It seems Nadia, the exchange student whose escapades with Jim made the Internet, is back in the country and is ready to hook up with our hapless lead character. What to do! Jim still has no experience. The guys try to help him out by renting a lakeside cottage for the summer. Meanwhile, Stifler's (Seann William Scott) still trying to hump everything in sight; Oz (Chris Klein) is remaining celibate while his girlfriend Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) is in France; Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is still lusting after the legendary mother of Stifler, after their much-talked-about union at the party in the first movie; and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is aching after his breakup with Vicky (Tara Reid). There have been no drastic character changes, either; everyone's as you'd expect after a year of college. Which means, of course, that all the guys are hornier than a sex addict in a penny whorehouse. But that's what drives raunch comedies - the testosterone of single-minded males.   As in real life, although the males in the movie have grown up, they still think like high school kids. (And someday this nubile cast will learn that that particular characteristic never really leaves the male of the species!) But while the theme of the movie is sex, sex, and sex, hidden under the layer of bombast and teenage oversexdrive is a theme of tenderness and fallibility. When kids graduate high school, they think they know it all. ""Bring life on!"" they chortle with glee. ""We know it all!"" But there's a certain vulnerability that everyone feels at some point, and that's the issue of sexual conduct for the first time. And here's where American Pie 2 deviates from other raunch films. In those yesteryear movies, there was always tremendous pressure for one schlub to get lucky once and for all. I'm talking huge peer pressure! But in this movie, while all of Jim's friends want him to get laid, they never, ever make him feel like he's below average or beneath them because he's not experienced what they have. And that, to me, makes this a very special movie - although, rest assured, it's still as raunchy as the first one.   In addition, the ending is so unlike those earlier raunchfests that you actually sit there and admire the screenwriters for not, for once, pandering to the least common denominator.   But hold on! Don't look at me like that! You're thinking that if it has good intentions and good messages, how much fun could it really be? Trust me, if you enjoyed the pastry coitus in the first movie, you'll get a kick out of Jim's misadventures in this one, too. The writing is way above par for movies in this genre, and the cast is both lovely to look at more than capable in their deliveries and actions.",American Pie 2
27,dee.reid,"Nostalgia, Part II",8,24 April 2021,"In ""American Pie 2,"" the 2001 sequel to the enormously successful ""American Pie"" (1999), you do feel a sense of deja-vu: the film repeats many of the same sort of plot devices, situations, and character motivations that helped to make ""American Pie"" such a phenomenal teen-comedy hit only two years earlier.While this is the most obvious fault with the picture, as a whole, it is not a bad follow-up (as far as sequels go). It's still pretty fun, funny, and moving. Pretty much the entire main cast from the original film returns here - Jim (Jason Biggs), Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Jessica (Natasha Lyonne), Vicky (Tara Reid), Stifler (Seann William Scott), Heather (Mena Suvari), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy), and Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge).Set one year after the first film, Jim and company have all returned home for the summer after their first year of college, and are determined to have the greatest summer ever - one full of booze, parties, girls, and sex. But somewhere in there, despite a repeating of some of the same key plot devices from the first film (including Jim's embarrassing visit to a hospital emergency room, and the guys' encounter with two beautiful women in their bedroom), the characters do find some room to grow and mature, showing that screenwriter Adam Herz (working with director J. B. Rogers) does have more on his mind than just the usual teen-comedy gross-out antics.The characters find room to learn from their past experiences, to realize that things have changed, that people have changed, and look forward to the future. And also, there is some room for some pretty tender romance, as well (try to guess who, if you haven't watched the two sequels made after this one).All in all, ""American Pie 2"" is just another fun, sexy, party-hardy slice of pie.8/10.",American Pie 2
28,meeza,A Bit Tasty!,8,26 May 2002,"`This one time' like 3 yrs ago i saw a very funny movie called `American Pie', and then,,,, ( Ok! I will not do the band camp girl thing). However, I will ask you if you are hungry for more american pie. Well, lick up those taste buds again, cause `American Pie 2' is just as hilarious as its predecessor. The movie is set in the summer after our crazy kids' first year of college. They come back home and more of the insaneness starts all over again. This time in the itinerary include: 1) a lesbian `you do that, we do this' scene that is no `les' hilarious than any other scene in the movie 2) Stiffler's sexual cracks that have grown more stiffer with time 3) More of the band camp's girl irritating but yet zany band stories 4) a trumpet that definitely needed more `Preparation H' before blowing, and last but not least 6) Jim's `so-called' lubricant that will definitely make you be glued to the screen with belly `master' laughs. All the same actors from the first one are back, and were just as good except Tara Reid & Mena Suvari. Their characters were very non-existent throughout the film, and maybe these actresses should have `reided' other parts that were more `menangful'.

29,GiraffeDoor,Generic teen comedy.,5,17 April 2019,"These movies always seem to carry a certain vibrancy and gay abandon that really entices me but they don't really do much in terms of real comedy or story telling.Our narrative is mostly a series of sketches of youthful hijinks that can get pretty excruciating. I mostly watch these kinds of movies as soft core pornography since they scenarios and production are better and it's more magical thinking that the sexiness isn't the main point of the movie.The first movie really had something to say about the experience of being a youth trying to enter that world of sexuality. But now it's been said and there isn't really anywhere for it to go except a bunch of desperate sex jokes, fappable misadventures and some trite romantic subplot. I'm not saying I don't like these characters but there's just nothing here beyond a fairly unadventurous teen/gross out comedy.It has its moments of satisfaction (...she's got it going on, yeah!), but there is so much better you could watch even if you're after dumb comedy.",American Pie 2

There is one crass part I can remember, though. That part is when Stifler (Seann William Scott) got urinated on while he was laying on a patio chair in his backyard on the night he had a party at his house while a girl was standing behind him! When Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) performed her flute solo at band camp, I thought she did a good job. If you ask me, the setting was perfect for a film released at this time of year, especially the beach house. That was a nice place. That makes me wish I had taken a summer vacation like that when I was younger. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I thought the ending was sweet and funny. This was because Jim arrived at the band camp and ran up on stage and kissed Michelle while the 3 Doors Down song was playing. In case you're wondering, it's called ""Be Like That."" Now, in conclusion, if you liked its predecessor, you should see this movie, that is, if you haven't seen it.

32,aidanratesmovies,"A Good Comedy Sequel- No, Seriously",9,18 January 2021,"Yes its juvenile, yes its raunchy, but American Pie 2 is easily a very enjoyable sequel- nearly on par with the quality of the first film. This time around I did feel a little better with Jason Biggs in the lead role. His awkward antics can be hard to watch at times, but they make for a more fulfilling and well done storyline that I couldn't help but enjoy. The other actors are fine, Seann William Scott being a very raunchy but very funny joy to watch on screen. A few of the bits may go on for a bit too long, but for the most part, the film is quite clever, very entertaining, and very funny. It does seem to rely a bit on the first film to propel it into future events, but the film does do a good job at showing the struggles of growing up- and how it isn't easy as it may seem. I did feel the role of Oz was nearly pointless for the film, as his character arc was long done in the first film, but i'm also glad they didn't try to do the forceful thing that sequels do that ruin his character in order to give him more screen time. In the end, American Pie 2 is a excellent little sequel that has its flaws, but proves to be nearly as enjoyable as its predecessor.

34,Spleen,Don't buy this American pie,2,13 April 2002,"I looked at the figures for ""American Pie 2"" because I knew they would appall me.  To save you the trouble, the box office gross was $145 million in the United States alone (the rule of thumb is, assuming this isn't one of those films that does disproportionately well in North America, as I suspect it is, that you double this figure to get the worldwide grosses; then you double it AGAIN if you're an Australian and want to convert the figure into local dollars), and it cost $US 30 million to make.  Although the latter figure is unusually LOW as Hollywood budgets go, you have to wonder where the money went.  (Well, we know that most of the budget always finds its way into the pockets of disgustingly overpaid actors - but even so.)  Neither of these figures makes any sense.  This is THE most perfunctorily made sequel I have ever seen.Made solely for people who know and love the original (which had some spirit, even if it too was mediocre) - we're expected to titter at the very sight of a flute - it wastes more time than it can afford telling us what has already happened.  Since there's no story and the characters have been boiled down to their skeletons, the ""zany antics"" this time around have no point other than as ballast.  Ninety per cent of the proceedings are flat and joyless and lifeless.  None of those involved, not even the actors, who wouldn't be here if they didn't have at least this much skill, can bring themselves pretend that they care.  (A possible exception is Eugene Levy, but he's cast adrift.  I love his schtick - at once cool and dorky and matter-of-fact - but he needs energy around him to make it work, and there's none to be found.)Are these guys attractive?  For the sake of the female half of the audience I hope so.  But we males have been given a raw deal.

36,eric262003,Repeated Comedy But Still Enjoyable,7,23 May 2021,"Sure the old saying is that sequel can never measure up its predecessor can be held true to this sequel of the 'American Pie"" sequel with the same characters and roughly the same jokes and gags repeat themselves which means that the surprises are gone and the shocks are not as fresh. When Stifler's (Seann William Scott) mom (Jennifer Coolidge) showed up it was heaven send. In ""American Pie"" her presence has been reduced as an inside joke. In the first film Jim (Jason Biggs) and Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) are oblivious in that they were having sex while being streamed on the Internet. In the sequel, strangers caught onto a sex scene by way of CB radios.In spite of the eat, sleep, conquer, repeat scenario we get in ""American Pie 2"", it's still an enjoyable raunchy comedy in which the characters are the perfect comic archetypes and they all play their respected roles like I would've expected in a movie like this. Aside from the raunchy comedy elements with a plethora of sexual innuendo used for humour, the characters depicted here offer sympathy due to their overall likable nature. It's great that Eugene Levy is back as the world's most level-headed father of Jim who always has his son's back no matter what sticky situation he's in (pun intended). There are so many memorable scenes that you wish you were part of the action and taking part in the gang's many sexual misadventures just for the thrills.It was refreshing that the gang was back for the second serving of pie. Not because they were all obligated to return due to their contractual stances, but simply because they all enjoyed the first outing and because the film needed a bit of continuation of closure to some of the subplots. So after a year of graduating from high school, the gang just finished a year of college so they decide to get a sigh of relief by spending their summer hiatus partying at a summer cottage by the lake in Grand. Haven, Michigan.We can take a great deal of empathy for Jim due to the many disasters he encountered in his last outing. Getting his sex scenes exploited on the Internet, his fist sexual encounter was one major miscalculation after another, and his prom was a night he'll never forget, though he wished he would. When he gets the news that Nadia is returning for the summer, he hires Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) to offer him some types on getting proper intercourse with her. Sure she might be a little wacky at times, but has a good heart and takes it upon herself to teach him the basics.The biggest flaw was that the most fleshed out scene is not the most interesting. It involves the gang imprisoned in the cottage and are now subservient by the.two occupants of the house who may or may not be lesbians, though the gang thinks they are. The girls (Denise Faye and Lisa Arturo) blackmail the boys by putting on show for them if the guys engage in uncompromising activities in exchange to watch them engage in sexual activity. There are some funny moments, but this scene wears out its welcome progressively. There's some poor taste in humour when Jim enters band camp pretending that he's a special needs trombone player.Even though with the exception of Michelle, the female characters play smaller roles than their male co-stars, they're not just vulnerable sex kittens used as trophy prizes for the guys. They have just as much raunchiness too like Heather (Mena Suvari) gets her boyfriend, Oz (Chris Klein) to engage in phone sex while she's studying overseas in Spain. Meanwhile Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and ex-girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) lie to each other about the myriad of sex partners they encountered while in college. Sure after this movie, they launched two more installments after this one, with the gang now married with kids and then almost a decade later, they reunited for a reunion. And through the wrinkle, receding hairlines, and progressively growing grey hairs, the one thing that had never changed all those years, their hunger for sex.

There's isn't really a coming-to-age theme anymore, and pretty much all the characters seem way more distant than they used to be. But it's still funny as hell. The first one was so well-written this sequel just works by following in the slipstream. All they really did was change the location, and it's so damn simple it actually does the trick. The new sitcom-like embarrassing situations are really top notch, the jokes are probably as good as they were in the original. That scene with the super-glue is just awesome on so many levels. The only problem is just that it doesn't really go anywhere. They do bring in a party to have a point to work up to, but really, they've already lost their virginity, they can't do that again.

I'd assumed it would be a sub-par sequel that needlessly rehashed the original in an attempt to milk it for more profit; in the end, I was only partially right. The film does rehash some material from the original but it adds enough to keep it funny. The film begins at the end of the freshman year of college and the crew from the first film decide to rent a house on Lake Michigan in hopes of having the most memorable summer ever, while each dealing with their own issues. Jim seeks bedroom advice from Michelle in anticipation of Nadia's impending visit. Oz and Heather are made to spend the summer apart while she studies overseas and must overcome the distance to keep their relationship strong. Kevin is forced to cope with Vicky's desire to be ""just friends"", and Finch spends all summer preparing for his moment with the one that got away...Stifler's mom.This film is directed by the original's first assistant director J. B. Rogers, and I have to give him credit for a decent job. Granted, there are more difficult movies for one to jump into directing with but I've seen so many film sequels picked up by non-directors fail that I commend Rogers for a decent job here. Writer Adam Herz returned to pen the sequel, which allowed for the same sense of humor and understanding of the characters. The film does a great job of bringing back that same raunchy yet occasionally heart-warming humor of the first; at points I almost felt as if the filmmakers were reaching a bit with the gags, but I still found myself laughing.The entire original cast returned for American PIE 2 (which is good because I doubt if it ever would have worked otherwise). Jason Biggs is back in the role that jump-started his career and retains that awkward presence that keeps finding Jim in the worst situations. The rest of the cast don't have as much of a presence, as this film definitely feels like Jim's story, but the supporting characters have some great moments. I loved Eddie Kay Thomas in the film; Finch has taken up Eastern philosophy and tantric studies and he had some of the funniest moments in the film. The absolute best, once again, is Eugene Levy as Jim's dad. He isn't given as much to do this time and pretty much disappears after the first act but Levy is comedy gold. Both of the first American PIE films were some of the best teen raunch comedies in recent years and, as long as you were a fan of the first, you shouldn't have a problem finding something to laugh at this time around.",American Pie 2
41,mjw2305,Another Brilliant Slice of Pie,8,15 January 2005,"I don't think this movie would work, if you haven't seen the first. It relies too much on characters and story from the first encounter set one year earlier. This said it is a great sequel that simply picks up where the last film left off, it retains all the characters from the first film and places them in equally embarrassing and hilarious situations.Slick, funny and entertainingIf you've missed it, then check it out, but see American Pie firstIf you like it then see 'Road Trip' and 'Old School' as well8/10",American Pie 2
42,DJAkin,I laughed out loudly!,8,17 March 2002,"American Pie 2, to me, was better than the first one!!  Stiffler has more of a role in this than he did in the first one.  Everybody knows a stiffler. He is extremely typecast as the party animal.  He is great.  The entire movie was one laugh after another.  The trumpet scent with Jim was really great.  That red head girl really showed some acting talent in this movie. The fact that she and Jim dug eachother as time passed was rather cool!! Ozzy does not have much of a role.  His character and the American Beauty chick's characters could have been left out.  They didn't add much at all. The highlights were Stiffler, Jim and Jim's Dad.  There were so many funny scenes in this movie that I can't list them all.  It's a great movie and it made my Saturday Night much more enjoyable!!!  I give this 8 stars for humor!!!",American Pie 2
43,btreakle,Party,9,13 October 2020,You have to be a complete moron not like this party movie. Jason Biggs and Sean Williams got were excellent in this film everything you would expect in a college party filled I have a recommend this one,American Pie 2
44,baumer,"The best summer movie, thus far, of 2001",9,14 August 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** There are two genres that have had a healthy recrudescence in the last two or three years.  One being the horror genre due in large part to Scream and the other is the teen comedy and that is due in large part to the overwhelming success of American Pie in the summer of 99.  This revival has inspired mostly inferior films like Tomcats and Whatever It Takes but it has also given us some gut-busters like Road Trip.  But nothing has come close to understanding the sheer audacity and gutsy bravado that American Pie demonstrated.  I can think back to another time in the early 80's when films were trying desperately to imitate Porky's and Fasttimes at Ridgemont High. There were a few good ones like Wild Life and Mischief but more often than not you got a sad film like Hot Dog and we had to wait until Porky's 2 was launched before we laughed hoarsely again.  Well here we are some 20 years later and this comedic revival of the teen genre is now in full bloom. American Pie was damn funny, American Pie 2 is damn funnier and it pushes the envelope in the area of raunchiness.  There are films that don't know what to do with their raunchy scenes and they are played strictly to gross you out.  But not American Pie 2.  Every scene that disgusts you, every scene that makes you cringe in guilt is done so with a punch line waiting for you at the end.  The creators of American Pie 2 have outdone themselves and they have created one of the funniest films I have seen in quite a long time.Spoilers ahead!!AP2 begins on the last day of classes for our four friends in college. Kevin, Stifler and Oz are all at Michigan State ( I think) and Jim is somewhere else.  Finch has travelled abroad so we don't get to see him until they meat up at Dog Years about ten minutes into the film.  Jim is still trying to learn to relax when it comes to sex, Finch is now a master at sex, Oz is still with Heather and Kevin is not with anybody.  After Stifler's party gets busted, the boys, after Kevin calls his brother, decide to rent a cottage on Lake Michigan.  Stifler is invited because they would not be able to afford the place on their own.  The rest of the movie is basically about the boys trying to get laid and the difficulties and hilarity that ensues.One of the things that makes AP2 so successful is that almost every character that had a speaking role in the first movie is back for more in the second.  And not only are they nice to see for familiarity sake, each one has a funny line or a few funny scenes to keep us laughing.  We all know the major ones that return but also back for more laughs is Sherman, or as he likes to call himself, the Sherminator.  Then there is also the two guys that were drunk in the first one and kissed Stifler's mom's picture, and then called her a MILF.  Stifler's little brother makes his return and utters his famous line ""F*****s, F*****s, F*****s!"", which got a good laugh from the audience.  Also the monkey and the Internet boys make a brief cameo.  This was smart bringing back these minor characters because when I told some of my cronies at work that most of the major characters were back, they asked me if that included Sherman and the MILF guys.  People remember AP1 really well and it is the smaller roles as well as the starring ones that made it so funny.But besides these smaller more quaint details, what makes AP2 so good is the story and the progression or regression of characters.  Stifler stays the same but the others have differed in some ways.Finch is still obsessed with Stifler's mom and he is now learning the art of Tantra so he can channel his sexual being even more than he did at the conclusion of first one.  Of course him and Stifler have some memorable bantering about his mother and this is just another areas that plays out well for laughs.Oz and Heather have to communicate through the phone for the summer as she is spending it abroad in Paris so they try risque things like phone sex, to no avail.  Everything from Stifler to call waiting interrupt their time together.Kevin is still hooked on Vicky and Jim is still trying to get laid. Michelle and Nadia, Jim's girls from the first also make some memorable appearances with Michelle stealing most of her scenes, regardless of who she shares them with.  Jessica and of course Mr. Levinstein (Jim's dad) round out the cast of AP1 veterans.Adam Herz has written one of the funniest films I have seen.  Not only does he build off AP1's humour, but he creates new situations and some you seewill probably shock you.  We have seen a few of these in the trailer, but believe me when I say that you are only seeing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the payoff.  Stifler is by far the funniest character and he delivers some of the best one liners.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.  Stifler reminds me of a cross between Jeff Spicolli and Walter Gibson ( John Cusack's character from The Sure Thing).  As crude as he is, and he is, there is also a vulnerable side to him that just peaks it's head out.  And finally, not only does he get the girl in this one, he ends up scoring what is considered to be the Holy Grail amongst guys and their campfire and beer stories.There is enough humour and story to go around in here easily for another AP. I would like to see that but at the same time, they have laid it on pretty thick for this film and to try to out do this one may result in a situation similar to Porky's 3.  Maybe they can churn out another but if they left it at this, then I would be more than happy.  It's always good to go out on a winning note.  And there are an abundance of franchises that went one step too far and blew it, that should be fair warning to the makers of AP. Jaws, Rocky, Porky's, Superman and Friday the 13th, all had winning franchises on their hands before they went out and insulted us with insipid and dull efforts like Jaws 4, Friday 7-9, Rocky 5 and Superman 3 and 4.  Let's just hope that if there is an AP3, they take their time and write another film with this much panache and humour.  As it stands, this is the best film I have seen so far this summer and probably this year.  I could continue this review for a few more paragraphs and mention some of the funnier parts of the film, but that should be left to your imagination.  Hearing too much about the film would ruin many of the surprises the film has to offer.9.5 out of 10-  If you liked this first, you'll love this one.  Watch out for cascading champagne scene, the lesbian scene and anything involving Michelle or Finch.  The accolades are endless so I'll stop here.  Just see this movie!!",American Pie 2
45,DunnDeeDaGreat,Funny as hell,10,22 October 2001,"Amercian Pie 2 was one of the funniest films to be relased in the summer of 2001. Once again, Seann William Scott &Jason Biggs make this movie funny as hell. The film's only down point was not enoungh nudity. I can't wait for the DVD.",American Pie 2
46,muamba_eats_toast,Almost as good as the original!,8,21 July 2020,Couldn't stop laughing one of the best sequels in a long time! The original was marginally better but still very much worth watching!,American Pie 2
47,mattymatt4ever,Decent sequel,7,1 February 2002,"I saw the movie in theaters and laughed out loud.  Now, I rented the DVD. I can't say I got as many laughs as the first time, though, and I started to notice more flaws.  At first I thought this movie was better than the original.  Now I'm not sure.  They both have great redeeming qualities that pretty much balance the scale.The two films movie at a similar rhythm.  In the original, we opened with Jim's Dad walking in on him while masturbating.  In the sequel, he walks in on him while he's having sex, only it's taken to the next level with the girlfriend's parents walking in as well.  And we have the keg party, with a Steadicam shot following Stiffler around, who yet again gets into a mishap with bodily fluids.  And of course, in homage of the famous Nadia scene from the original, we have the guys walking in on two lesbians.
The laughs are still there, and there are some genuinely funny moments.  I don't want to give them away, though the previews and some of the other reviewers probably already did.The cast still got it.  Eugene Levy steals the show yet again as Jim's Dad. I do have to say, Stiffler's character got a little too obnoxious at times. It's often funny to hear his foul-mouthed insults, but by the hundredth time you hear him use the word ""f**kface"" it gets kinda old.
I'm always going to hold the ""American Pie"" movies several notches above the standard gross-out teen comedies, because they have zest and originality. Not to mention they're done in a professional manner.  The gags are as intelligent as they are crude, and delivered with exquisite timing.  And to top it off, it's a heartfelt film that is not literally all about getting laid.  I thought the original had more heart to it, but the sequel also has its heart in the right place.The music is great.  The soundtrack is full of really cool songs, including ""Smooth Criminal"" by Alien Ant Farm.  And be sure to check out the unrated DVD special edition.  The commentary is cool and--unlike with the first ""American Pie"" unrated edition--there is some bonus footage worth checking out.  The lesbian scene is extended significantly.  In the theatrical version, there was only a brief nudity, but you get to see much more in this version.I'm still not sure if I would consider this movie better than the first, but it is one sequel that lives up to the original--and that's saying a lot!My score:  7 (out of 10)",American Pie 2
48,hall895,A satisfying second slice,8,9 September 2005,"Well here we are, back for more of the same antics we got in American Pie. There may be a sense we've seen this all before but somehow American Pie 2 really works. All the characters we know and love (or hate) from the original are back and they're constantly being placed into outrageous situations which will inspire gut-busting laughs. Even though we're going back over much of the same territory, the sequel is more consistently and explosively funny than the original. What could have easily been a pointless, unnecessary sequel actually manages to be something fresh, funny and appealing.As with the original the Jason Biggs character of Jim is the glue holding the film together. Everything revolves around him in one way or another. Where in the original film each of the main male characters came with his own romantic storyline this time around Jim takes center stage. Most of the female characters have been shunted to the sidelines here with Shannon Elizabeth, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Natasha Lyonne being mere bit players. Their absence doesn't hurt at all and may actually help by making the story more focused. This one's all about the boys with Jim and friends renting a summer home following their first year of college. Back for more hilarity are Chris Klein as Oz, Eddie Kaye Thomas as the increasingly bizarre Finch and Thomas Ian Nicholas as the comparatively dull Kevin. And even though none of the others like him the script finds a way to contrive to get Seann William Scott's juvenile, vulgar, obnoxious Stifler tossed into the mix. Where the other guys might go to the edge of what is appropriate Stifler is always willing to go careening over the edge and his antics are a hoot.If you thought nothing could be more embarrassing than what happened to Jim in the original film, just wait. And along to heighten the embarrassment is Jim's father, played wonderfully by Eugene Levy, who in trying to help inevitably just makes things worse. And the one female from the original who actually has a major role here, Alysson Hannigan as Michelle, also does a great job. Oh, the wacky things that go on at band camp. With a slew of familiar characters moving from one hilarious situation to the next, all backed by a winning soundtrack, American Pie 2 succeeds in equaling and even surpassing the original.",American Pie 2
49,CharltonBoy,Pants,3,9 June 2002,American Pie 2 is a film that was made simply because of the success of the first film. The problem with this is that they forgot to write a script that was either funny or interesting. In fact this film is a total bore that copies jokes from 100 other teen comedies. It is predictable and pointless. I remember looking at the clock on the DVD player and it said 61 minutes before anything remotely funny happened (The lesbian scene) and this could have been done much better. I am completely sick of films that involve American teenagers calling themselves dudes and leering over siliconed boobed teenage girls. i suspect neither really exist in the states. If you liked the first film the best way i can describe this is that it is just the same with the funny bits taken out. 3 out of 10.,American Pie 2
50,jon.h.ochiai,Mmmm...Good Pie,8,13 August 2001,"""American Pie 2"" is tasteless, over the edge, totally funny, and somehow manages to be a sweet romance. Amazing. Amazing too, that ""Pie 2"" is better than the original ""Pie"". Director J.B. Rogers along with writer Adam Herz, generated an accomplishment in movies-- a crisp sequel. ""Pie 2"" delivers the goods: hot babes, phone sex, ridiculous sexual predicaments, and more hot babes like returning Czech student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). Rogers and Herz never disappoint, and they also surprise us. The dudes, Jim (Jason Briggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Smith), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Stifler (Seann William Scott), have returned from their freshman year at college. After losing their stated party address, Stifler's parent's house, the dudes decide to rent a beach house for the summer. Life is good. Beach. Beer. Babes. Though there is tension abound. Nadia informs Jim that she wants to hook up with him at summer's end after traveling abroad. Jim panics, because he sucks at sex... and he has proof. Oz's girlfriend, Heather (Mena Suvari) is spending the summer in Europe, and he promised fidelity.Seann William Scott as Stifler has the standout role. Stifler is horny, offensive, and completely funny. There is a show stopping scene when he believes that the two great looking women at the beach house are ""really"" lesbians. Chris Klein does well as the responsible, good-looking stud, who has a girl friend abroad, keeping in mind that his buds only want to get laid. Jason Biggs' Jim has got to be the most sympathetic guy on the planet. Biggs' charm actually keeps Jim from being the most pathetic guy on the planet. He has a scene that out does the ""pie"" from the first movie. Better than ""Something About Mary..."" Alyson Hannigan returns at ""band camp"" girl Michelle. Given Jim's sucking sexual prowess, he turns to Michelle as his sex mentor/ coach. Their relationship is ridiculous and graphic, though it never loses a sense of sweetness. Eugene Levy as Jim's understanding Dad is warm, humane, clueless, and funny. Forget Ward Cleaver. Much the same can be said about ""American Pie 2"". It is an over the top gross out raunchy R-rated comedy that delivers everything you want , and still cares about it's characters... like the audience does. ""Pie 2"" is a pleasant surprise.",American Pie 2
51,stephenchase-63504,Sean William Scott's greatest sex comedy!!,10,9 February 2021,The greatest sex scene is where 2 of the greatest American Pie characters hump around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,American Pie 2
52,stamper,Not as flat as some may think,8,2 December 2001,"First of all, this is (of course) a film for people who want to laugh (mainly at others screwing up). Especially Jim (Jason Biggs) seems to get himself in the most embarrassing situations over and over again. But there are other funny moments too, with the Stifmeister (Sean William Scott), Ozzy (Chris Klein), Kev (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finchy (Eddie Kaye Thomas). Mainly the film is about what moves people my age and any other age most, the opposite sex. All that obsessing and wondering about the other (does he / she like me, do I love him / her?) is really greatly portrayed and realistic. Of course the people in the film are all not too shabby looking and there are some sick and perverted moments in the film, but you really have to look at the bigger picture. You have to look past the babes, the booze and the parties. You have to look past that every guy's perfect summer' and see that this film is not about sex, it is not about being sexy and cool. This film is about being whoever you are, being true to yourself and your friends, but most of all it is about love. I mean the latter thing may not be true for all characters in the film (e.g. Steve Stifler), but it sure concerns the main characters' life (Jimbo's life). The rest of the film is however pure fun and freedom, that any college student hopes to get. I sure hope my first summer of being in college will rock like that. Can't wait to see the sequel. And again, I do not think I have to force someone to make a sequel.8 out of 10",American Pie 2
53,fernandoschiavi,"Except for the expected clichés of the genre, especially at its end, this second part did not risk, kept his formula of scatological jokes and more memorable funny scenes",6,1 May 2021,"For a film made with the budget of $ 11 million, and could raise pel least 20 times more in the world, American Pie obviously earns a sequel two years after the original, and manages to keep the laughs constant and another time please.This time directed by the first assistant director of the first film, JB Rogers (Say IIt Isn't So), the plot takes place one year after the events of the previous film, in which five friends, Kevin, Jim, Oz, Finch and Stifler end the first year of college, and during the summer vacation, renting a beach house where they intend to make their achievements. Jim gets a call from beautiful foreign exchange student Nadia, and she reports that returns to the United States for the holidays and want to see him again. Jim thinks he needs more experience to face the girl and her friends will help you to make him feel more confident when I receive it. Stifler still partying, foul-mouthed, perverted and trying to play up their labia of women, and that's what banking summer of friends, so others take you with him. Oz now has to resist temptation and remain faithful to his girlfriend Heather, who is studying in Europe during the holidays. Kevin discovers that remains in love with his ex-girlfriend from school, Vicky. Finch continues its way sophisticated and studying tantric sex and when assumed by a link Stifler's mom will go to the house they rented, he is preparing to receive his ""goddess"".Interestingly, this sequence was to see a greater maturity of all the characters. Before all were eager to lose her virginity, now they are calmer and having to face with another look at some situations in life, how to move on and leave the past behind, fall in love for real by someone with whom we identify and learn to appreciate that SEPRE our aid in times when we most need.Despite this aspect, the great merit and strength of the series is to support the eschatological scenes and shame others. Here they abound once again, but we see some repetition of situations. Replacing the webcast of awkward situation by Jim lived with Nadia in the boy's room, we see friends participating in an embarrassing situation with two possible lesbians, transmitted via radio. The scene where the kids take the radio and the mother questioning the toy that his father had bought for them, and other people who were traveling on the road, the band rehearsal and many places could hear, are priceless. Not to mention what they all did in exchange to see the girls doing what they wanted. The probed buttock kissing and masturbation are the culmination of this film and cause beyond expensive of disgust, lol. That scene with the trio Finch, Stifler and Jim, in fact, marked time, with the right to display the category of Best Kiss at the MTV Movie Awards that year.Besides the scene with the girls mentioned above, Stifler, as in the first film, the protagonist situations worse. If the first film he made ""beer named"" in this he is flawless being urinated on his face. The way he delights in thinking it was the girl who was with him to drink and threw her face, and then feels his expression of disgust when he realized that it was another thing to roll with laughter.We again Jim's father and his conversations inappropriate and embarrassing. First he surprises her son to visit him at college in the opening of the film. After he helps the hospital to solve your ""problem with superglue."" The scenes of him screaming speaking of the problem of child without having the slightest idea for everyone to hear his son leaving red in shame, in addition to his conversation with the doctor in the room are great. Speaking of ""problem with superglue"", this is another scene worth mentioning. Very entertaining. Not to mention the scenes of the camp where Jim was Michelle: he glued linen band and being mistakenly placed on the stage, trying to play something on trombone pretending to be someone else, when she puts the trumpet in it during lessons of conquest a person and then after they left the place, put in your mouth. He also learns how to take Michelle with a bra and win a woman. In this film we see the two coming well after what lived in one year before graduation from high school, and as they realize they are enjoying each other.Despite being well used in the scene probed with friends, preparing Finch that he will ""storing everything"" to find the mother of Stifler, culminating with the outcome of the character in one of the funniest scenes. The least utilized were Oz and Kevin. The first shows that was the most matured group being passionate and sure of his relationship with Heather even from a distance, but some scenes where the two try to have sex on the phone did not work as well as expected. Already Kevin realizes that he still loves to Vicky, who introduces him to the party is going to happen in the house, the boy who it is coming out. He realizes it's time to move on and accept the situation in a mature way.Again we see a good pace in the long dad by editing Stuart Pappé and Larry Madaras and a great soundtrack by David Lawrence. The cast once again crushes. Impossible not to look at the face of Jason Biggs, Eugene Levy, Eddie Kaye Thomas and Seann William Scott especially now without a smile. One downside was the low participation of girls in this sequence. If they shone in original along with the boys until they are part of the plans for them to lose their virginity, they hardly appear in this and are left completely in the background. They could be better exploited.Except this aspect and now expected clichés of the genre, especially at its end, the second part did not run risks and kept his formula scatological jokes, scenes of shame in others memorable scenes. Made for the teen audience, the film entertains as much as the first and it is always a good thing. Fun guaranteed.",American Pie 2
54,Ruskington,We need to talk about Kevin,5,21 April 2020,"Undoubtedly the weakest of the four American Pie movies. This first sequel is still very enjoyable but lacks originality and purpose. The vulgarity is abundant and there are plenty of great moments (superglue incident springs to mind) that keep it ticking along. However, it all feels like it's trying to capture the magic of the original without asserting itself as a story in its own right. The awful Kevin needs to just vanish from this franchise- he is one of the most painfully draining characters I have ever had the misfortune to watch. The rest of the cast are fine but struggle to make anything out of this fairly predictable script.",American Pie 2

While the first film was plain original, this one is a bit of a rehash, which is to be expected considering the main characters are doing almost exactly what they did in the first film. The only difference is that they are returning from their first year at college instead of graduating high school. Regardless, it's nice to see Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Chris Klein, and especially Seann William Scott as Stifler and of course Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad! If are going to watch this film, watch the original first and then American Wedding immediately after this one. A funny 7 out of 10.",American Pie 2

It stars all the original cast who are back for some partying and fun. This movie will always be one of my favorites it is truly hilarious.This movie is about Jim and his friends who go away for a summer to a beach house. The plan for the summer is to party as much as they can and have as much sex as they can( I know what else is new) funny misadventures happen along the way and it really is a fun ride.This movie is really good it had me laughing all the time. The cast does a great job and the writing is hilarious if you are a fan of the first one give this one a watch or even if you a big fan of comedies.,American Pie 2
59,FlickJunkie-2,"Not as charming, but still good fun",7,26 January 2002,"As sequels go, this isn't too bad.  Most sequels underperform the original by a good margin, but this one falls off only slightly.  In many places the comedy in APII is better than the first.  However, it is mostly just raunchier.  What is missing here is any attempt at creating a plot.  The first film had a clear and consistent plot that revolved around `The Pact'. It also had a candor about it that was very representative of high school life with all its braggadocio, bravado and hidden insecurities.  With the exception of Jim (Jason Biggs) who retains his performance anxiety from the last film, all the innocence is gone from this film and with it much of the charm.  Most of the cast members are back, but the cohesiveness is missing and with it some of the synergy.That doesn't mean it is without laughs because outrageous sex skits will always be funny (as long as they don't get too gross, like Scary Movie) and this film has them in abundance.   Some miss but most hit.  You could see the super glue bit coming a mile away, but it is still hilarious.  The phone sex scene isn't.  The best scenes in the film are not the raunchy ones, but the sex lessons given to Jim by his friendly band geek Michelle (Alyson Hannigan).Jason Biggs leads the ensemble with another terrific performance of a guy obsessed with performance.  Biggs is the actor with the most nuance in the cast, capable of both outrageous and subtle humor.  Shannon Elizabeth is sidelined as the Nadia, being more of an object than an active participant in this film.  Chris Klein is also marginalized with very few scenes worth mentioning.  Seann William Scott is back as Stifler, more outrageous than ever.  This time he goes too far making the character's crudeness and untamed libido so obnoxious that it stops being funny.  Eddie Kaye Thomas isn't given much to work with the way Finch was written this time, being more bizarre than comical.  Once again, Alyson Hannigan steals the show as Michelle, the queen of band camp.  Her wide eyed facial expressions are priceless and her comic timing is impeccable.  Hannigan and Biggs have fantastic chemistry and play off one another so well that they could have been a vaudeville act.  Eugene Levy is marvelous as Jim's well meaning but hopelessly square dad.This film meanders a great deal and misses the freshness of the first film, but is still packed with plenty of fun.  I rated it a 7/10.  For those not offended by crass language and sexually explicit humor, it will probably be a great time.",American Pie 2

The people we fell in love with in the first movie are back for more outrageousness, and while it's not as good as the first, it's still funny, and at times VERY funny.Jim, Kevin, Oz and Finch have finished their first year at college, and are getting ready to spend the summer together. They decide to rent a house on the beach and host a wild party at the end where they will be reunited with the girls.Everyone has returned, although the film focuses on the boys, while the girls mainly stay on the backburner (girls are not the target audience for movies like this). There are no new additions, surprisingly, but the movie still culls a lot of humor from the characters we all know and love.The problem with this sequel is that the first film told a complete story. The first film got its best laughs from the awkwardness from exploring sexuality. Now that everyone has taken the plunge, what's left? Surprisingly a lot.

I went and saw the movie downtown Seattle the night it opened at the Cineplex Odean at midnight...that was the best crowd I've ever seen a movie with. I could usually tell what was coming, but I was still shocked when it actually happened. I'm usually pretty conservative when it comes to movies, but the American Pie movies have been two of my favorite movies ever. The second movie takes over at the end of the first year of college. The first scene can be figured out by seeing the previews, but there were still a lot of surprises in the movies.There are a lot of great scenes at Stifler's party, and I was surprised to see that not only were the main characters back, but most of the supporting characters were back as well (remember the two guys from the M. I. L. F. scene?....they were in the second movie as well). Even Stifler's brother is in the movie.The movie is pretty shocking, but still very funny, I think my favorite part involved Petey. I think everyone needs to see this movie, from junior high aged and older...its destined to be a classic.",American Pie 2

63,departed07,More gags and laughs than the original!,8,23 June 2003,"""American Pie"" was the sleeper hit in 1999 where it was the young version of ""Porky's"" but without having too much dilemma of making it either a drama or a comedy. Unlike Porky's where people in their mid-thirties portrayed high school kids, American Pie had young people portraying teenagers in awkward situations that any teen would be in.The gang is back in ""American Pie 2"" where after graduating high school as non-virgins, Jim (Jason Biggs), Stifler (Sean William Scott), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Oz (Chris Klein) finish their first year of college where everything is more or less the same. Jim is still having bad luck with girls despite being used by Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) in his first time; Oz is more mellow and doesn't have much to say; Stifler is still a party animal who loves parties and seducing babes; Finch wants Stifler's mother in the sack while Kevin realizes that after a year of college everything is changing as he fears that after breaking up with Vicki (Tara Reid) and the party raid at Stifler's house, he gets advice from his brother (Casey Affleck) where a vacation at a beach house would make things better at least.Everybody has plans during the vacations in which Jim wants to prepare himself after getting a call from Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) to get wild in the sack but not before getting help from Michelle, Oz and Heather (Mena Suvari) try to talk in long distance, Stifler wants all the babes, Kevin still wants to be Vicki while Fitch is part of the gang's plans.""American Pie 2"" is funnier than the original where there are even more gags to make you laugh hard on the floor while at the same time doesn't try to be a pushover.

65,FilmFanInTheHouse,Slight Decrease In Comedy,7,9 January 2008,"American Pie 2 (2001, Dir. James B. Rogers) The whole gang are back and shows that they are as close as ever. They decide to get even closer, by spending the summer together at a beach house. They decide to hold the biggest party ever to be seen, even if the preparation doesn't always go to plan. Especially when Stifler, Finch and Jim become more close to each other than they ever want to be and when Jim mistakes super glue for lubricant.When the 'American Pie' gang returns, everyone knows that they will be expecting gross out humour and wild characters, and this movie doesn't disappoint. All the wonderful characters are back, including Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad, who steals every scene he is in. Stifler is his usual self and Finch is more entertaining this time. A lot of the female side of cast have a reduced role in this movie. Alyson Hannigan's role is expanded, whilst the others only appear in a few scenes. The jokes again are well written, but like the first film, are not the most cleanest of jokes. If you saw the first movie, then you would know what kind of adult material is found in this film. Although, the film holds up well alongside it's predecessor, it had a slight decrease in the comedy. Still, it's a fun and entertaining movie to watch.""The force is strong with that one."" - Stifler (Seann William Scott)",American Pie 2
66,jhaggardjr,SURPRISE! A sequel that's better than the original.,9,2 October 2001,"""American Pie 2"" is a sequel that surprised me. It surprised me because I found it to be funnier and better than the original 1999 hit comedy. That's a rarity to find in movies these days. Sequels usually don't surpass their predecessors, but this one did (in my opinion). I laughed out loud quite often while watching ""American Pie 2"". Plus, that sweetness that I liked so much in the first film is here as well. This time out, the entire cast from the original reunites for a second helping of crude jokes, embarrassing situations, and sex scenarios. Only the setting is new. Instead of the high school where most of the first film took place, the setting here is at a house on Lake Michigan. It's a year later, and those kids, who are now in college, set off to have a summer to remember. And it'll be a summer they'll never forget. The one thing that I liked best in the first ""American Pie"" was that relationship between the characters played by Chris Klein and Mena Suvari (who play Oz and Heather). That relationship is reunited here, but ends up taking a back seat to focus on another relationship that I thought was just as funny and touching. Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan have great chemistry as Jim and Michelle. If you will recall, Michelle was the girl who deflowered Jim in the first movie, and Jim comes to Michelle for advice as he prepares for a big reunion with foreign exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). Once again, the inept Jim finds himself in plenty of odd situations, and Biggs plays this character to perfection. Hannigan is very funny too giving Jim some pointers on how to handle situations with girls. But once again the big scene stealer in ""American Pie 2"" is Seann William Scott, who reprises his role of sex machine Stifler. This character has got to be the most obnoxiously hilarious movie creation that I've ever seen. Most obnoxious characters tend to get on my nerves, but not Stifler. He's a guy that I could be good friends with. Scott is just hysterically funny everytime he's on screen, and he provides the biggest laughs in the film. A few of the characters here aren't given much to do here like in the original, but for me that was a minor quarrel. Everybody seems to have had a great time making this. ""American Pie 2"" was the funniest comedy of summer 2001. ***1/2 (out of four)",American Pie 2
67,Ddey65,Unfairly bashed by moralists and AP fans alike.,7,26 October 2005,"The beloved cast of American Pie returns for a sequel. But unlike the original movie involving the attempt to lose one's virginity before leaving high school, this one takes advantage of the strong personality traits of the characters we loved from the first movie. In fact, the only thing AP2 inherits from the original blockbuster, besides the cast & characters, is the raunchiness of the original movie that uptight moralists hate so much. Among these uptight people are neo-confederate columnist Charley Reese who thinks that Hollywood didn't produce movies like this 20 years earlier. What planet was he living on when ANIMAL HOUSE, MEATBALLS, and PORKY'S came out? Better yet, where was he when AP1 came out?To tell you the truth, it's a good thing that the sequel has these cast & characters, because the idea of their goal being the ultimate party, seems a little thin for a plot. But it's the events that take place before the party that make this movie so good. Stifler is still a jerk, Kevin still longs for Vicky, Oz and Heather are trying to stay faithful to each other, Vicky is getting more advice on men from Jessica, Sherman still thinks calling himself ""The Sherminator"" impresses the ladies, Finch still longs for Stifler's Mom(despite his own sexual escapades), Jim is being embarrassed by his dad, getting a visit from Nadia, and decides to get sex tips from none other than that lovable nerdy flutist horn-dog Michelle. As I stated earlier, the events leading up to the party are what makes this sequel so good. When one of Stifler's parties finally gets raided by the cops(something which happens more often at other parties according to two guests), Kevin calls up his big brother for advice and he suggests holding another one at a rental house on Lake Michigan. Once this party goes down, Kevin is supposed to be able to ""see the big picture"" whatever that is. Prior to the Lake Michigan blowout, Finch learns the secret of Stifler's Mom's skills in the bedroom, and tries them out himself, which makes him an easy target for ""The Stiff-meister."" And when he's not insulting Finch(or Jessica), Stifler does everything he can to get Oz to be unfaithful to Heather while she's on a trip to Spain. But no, he just won't budge! To pay for this future party, the kids decide to get a job painting houses, including one owned by two young ladies who live together, and are assumed by Stifler to be lesbians. Of course I'd be lying if I said that Adam Herz tried to make EVERYTHING about AP2 different from AP1, because the mutual bi-sexual foreplay being broadcast all over every CB & two-way radio in AP2, is identical to the internet/video-cam scene from AP1. And while Kevin still wants both the body and heart of Vicky again, Michelle gladly offers to provide lover's tips to Jim so he can score with Nadia. Of course, her REAL motive for helping Jim becomes clearer as the movie progresses. A lot of people were upset about the fact that Jim dumped that Central European brunette bombshell Nadia for that nerdy, naughty flute-playing Michelle, but I was upset about the fact that Kevin and Vicky didn't become lovers again. Kevin truly loved this girl, and we're supposed to believe that unless he stops feeling this way he's too immature to be a high school graduate? I say that's more disgusting than any jokes about bodily functions and masturbation mishaps. Other than that, it's still an adequate sequel, which is something you don't always find coming out of Hollywood.",American Pie 2
68,dockerykelli,This SEQUEL is GREAT!!!,10,6 July 2019,"American Pie 2 is such a wonderful, hilarious movie and basically picks up from where we were left in the 1st movie.

69,bix171,Just As Bad,1,2 May 2002,"A really lousy sequel to the original dud. The first film is essentially reprised here, with similar jokes (bodily fluids disguised as other liquids, intercourse being interrupted by parents) and with the same unusually bogus characters, a bunch of rich white frat boys. Everything seems so contrived and convoluted that it's impossible to sympathize with actors like dweeby Jason Biggs, who can't get laid properly but still has the most gorgeous woman trying to bed him. And the other principals are either so outsized (like Seann William Scott as the obnoxiously unfunny Stifler) or lame (the impossibly good Oz, played by Chris Klein) that there's no possibility to connect and no reason to try. Only Eugene Levy, as Biggs' father, has some mildly humorous moments, but they're in his appearance and not in his lines. Teens will like the gross-out humor--this is who it's designed for--but it's a case of `been there, done that' and even they probably won't be clamoring for a trilogy.",American Pie 2
70,flicklover,"Finally, a good sequel this summer!!!",8,14 August 2001,"American Pie has often been refered to as the Porky's of the 90's, the comparison is justified, but having grown up with Porky's I think that American Pie is better, and certainly, the new film is infinitely better to the almost unwatchable Porky's 2. American Pie is a good sequel, it repeats with good success the feel of the first film. Yes the first film and this one get their laughs from raunchy humor, but it is done well and the actors fit well into their characters. AP2 basicly has the same structure as the first film, the five friends Jim,Oz,Kevin,Finch and Stifler find new and very hilarious ways to humiliate themselves in the quest for sex. Especially Jim, as in the first film he is very insecure about his abilities,and the results are hilarious!!! Also the first film had a sweetness to it that balanced out some of the raunchy stuff. Jim looks to his bandgeek friend Michele for help with his problem, a cute relationship develops between them develop. But the movie really belongs to Stifler(Sean W. Scott), in the first film he stole almost every scene he is in, this time he is in the movie more and gets the most laughs. Most critics hate sequels because they argue that they only exist to cash in on the original, of course that is why sequels are made! But this sequel does what a good sequel should do, it entertains as much as the original, yes it repeats the formula to a tee, but it goes for big laughs and gets them.

71,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Best Party sequel of college guys ever good as the first one,10,14 September 2019,"Good as the first one American Pie this sequel in my opinion is the best party sequel about college guys ever. This was my favorite movie of the first two movies in high school at the time. I was in senior year before I transher to other school. This in my opinion is good as the first one. All the gangs are back and they decied to make their own party since Stifler party was busted by cops. Great comedy, sexy, friendship, intelligent and smart. It is my third favorite in the ""American Pie"" franchise.American Pie 2 pick's off where the first one left off it is been one year since the guys loose their virginty and they attendet collage. Some couples are together some broke up. The first year of college is over for Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas). Reuniting back in East Great Falls to trade stories about sexual escapades and university life, the boys find themselves having to deal with the women (Tara Reid, Alyson Hannigan, Mena Suvari, and Shannon Elizabeth) they rudely left behind. Determined to make the most out of the promising summer, the guys, along with their revolting but affluent friend Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), decide to rent a beach house to help sort out their confused, combustible lives. Running into mischievous lesbians, masturbation sessions stymied by Krazy Glue, the wonders of band camp, Jim's Dad (the invaluable Eugene Levy), Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge), and parties galore, the four young men learn valuable life lessons as they awkwardly navigate all the tomfoolery of their summer break.This movie is about party on the beach house and the boys decide to make one of the best summer ever. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Vicky (Tara Reid) are no longer together weird, I did not like that. Jim (Jason Biggs) is still deeply in love with Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), but asks Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) the band geek to help him out, so he could get better in sex. Oz (Chris Klein) and Heather (Mena Suvari) are still together but they are MILES seperated because Heather goes to study to Europe. Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is still horny about Stifler's mom MILF (Jennifer Coolidge). Stifler (Seann William Scott) is still a dick and he is brother Matt (Eli Marienthal) is funny.The film is outrages laughable I have the VHS home and I do have to Blu-ray disc which contains Unrated version of the movie diffrent from the teacrical cut I used to had. The movie has jokes like Jim glues him self, I really like Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) defending his son after a older woman attacks JIm about his sex orientation, when he had a VHS tape glue on his hand. I would stick up for my son that way too. Shannon Elizabeth is still gorgeous in this movie she is great and sexy as Nadia. Gorgeous Tara Reid is awesome in this movie. Mena Suvari is hot. Sherminator (Chfris Owen) is back in this movie and he lands up with Nadia funny. We have two lesbians in this movie who force the boys to jerk off Stifler's private part. Denise Fey and Lisa Arturo were great as Danielle and Amber as two lesbians.Love the soundtracks: Blind Spot by Transmatic, Want You Bad by The Ofspring, Blink 182 - Every Time I Look For You, Good For a Woman by Alien ant farm-smooth criminal and more songs. James B. Rogers directed well this sequel so it is one of the best comedy's of 2000's. They don't make em like this anymore. My third favorite ""American Pie"" movie.",American Pie 2

Also, Stifler (Seann W. Scott) is tagging along with the bunch and he hasn't lost his sense of being off-the-wall.  I'll be wise here and not even dare to throw away any of the hilarious moments that the movie provides.  Unlike the first one, this film deals with rekindling or keeping the relationship from becoming bitter and unpleasant.  The performances here are acceptable at best and the movie doesn't skip a beat.  It's just as shrewd and wicked funny as the original.",American Pie 2

So don't expect any deep meanings from it, and you'll be fine.It plays pretty much like a Monty Python movie: it has a couple of definite sketches (the party, the lesbians, the glue, etc.) interwoven with some weak connectors. Then again, I enjoyed it. I wasn't looking for anything more.Also, watch out for Alyson Hannigan. If you hadn't noticed, she is one beautiful girl.

77,carlos37andre,Great sequel,8,12 June 2020,"Idk how to describe, but I kind of like the ""feel"" of this movie for some reason. I know it's a full of sex jokes teen movie, and well, who went to see this with a different expectation? Cause I didn't. But I love the vibe of it, it's at the same time similar to the first one, but also has its own style.Knowing what we know tho, I think this movie explores a lot of stuff I thought they missed the opportunity to do in the first film. Like Jim, for example, he has a much better arc here, than in the first one. I love his relationship with Michelle, and it builds up naturally. Even Kevin, who was probably the only one of the main characters I didn't care much about in the first film, I like his arc too! It's great that you can kind of relate with him in some way, at the end he's just a dude who is afraid of leaving his dork teenager life behind. And who wasn't?I definitely think they took some time, to explore more some characters that they didn't in the first one (like Jim and Kevin), instead of Oz, for example, who we had time to learn a lot about in the first film. And that's great.Of course, you definitely have some familiar beats here, Finch and Stifler's mom thing, Jim using something weird to masturbate, and the guys spying some girl (or girls this time) naked. Still tho, I think is an honest film, with funny jokes still, and in this one, you kind of have a story of leaving your teenage years behind (somewhat, if you really wanna reach for it).I almost forgot: I love the soundtrack!At the end of the day, American Pie 2 is another great comedy, that to this day, still holds up pretty good (and this one, gladly, doesn't even have some of the offensive humor the first one had at times).Obs: Just pointing out some of my favorite moments. 1) Jim gluing his hand to his dick, again, even tho as I said is some what of a throwback, is so freaking funny, and again, the scene with his dad in the hospital is priceless, ""well maybe you do!"" lol 2) I love the weird cute moment between Jim and Michelle and band camp at the end. 3) The whole opening sequence is awesome (again, Jim's dad, man lol).",American Pie 2

The screenplay is good, the dialogue is great, as are the jokes, but the story is still very similar to the original and that could have been changed. The acting is great, just as good as the original. This is one of the best acted stupid comedies ever. The direction is good, but I really wish the directors from the original had come back.

79,Old Joe,"The gang might be back for a second helping of the 'pie', but I am sorry, it was not too my liking!",2,28 April 2004,"I have been and will continue to be criticised for not liking this movie, and although I understand almost all young people around the world loved the 2001 sequel 'American Pie 2', I was one person who was not that impressed by it. The major fans of this film will be sex-crazed teenagers, who love this sort of rude crude stuff. Unfortunately this sort of sex comedy has started to lose its appeal on a movie watcher such as me.A year has passed and the gang is back home after their first year of college. They are now ready to party hard all the way through summer. But the group is also taking `the next step' into the fringes of adulthood. The guys (Kevin, Jim, Oz, Finch and Stifler) rent a beach house, vowing to celebrate their friendship and make this the best summer ever. But as always, whether their dreams come true or not is ultimately up to the girls (Vicky, Michelle, Nadia, Heather and Jessica). Through one boisterous summer of ear-splitting parties, side-splitting mishaps - and yes a trip to band camp - the gang discover that times change and people change, but friendship last a lifetime.The script for American Pie 2 for me personally was good and bad. On the good side, I like how the gang sticks together through thick and thin, helping each other when they feel down. The other good elements include the introduction of 'band camp' which was fun to see at times. Then the storyline showing how hard it is for people from past relationships to remain just friends would be one of the biggest highlights of the film for me, as I totally get what the movie is trying to show. Yet the script goes too far at times, which bought the film down a fair bit for me. The script for the movie was written by Adam Herz (also an executive producer).
These sorts of films will never win awards for great acting, but it is these performers who make the fans so happy. Jim (Jason Biggs) is back doing more crazy stupid antics, which make Jim look like an even bigger idiot. While Jim's Dad (Eugene Levy), is a total embarrassment to his son. Levy is terrific in his role here, as he is truly funny how he handles his varying predicaments. Stifler (Sean William Scott) is still as sleazy as he was in high school, college if you would believe has made him worse. While Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is now into Tantra, in the hopes of scoring again with 'MILF', aka Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge). Oz (Chris Klein) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols) bring a serious side to the story, as they are the mature guys in the group.The girls are also back in a big way in American Pie 2. 'Band Camp geek' Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) was fun to see in this film, as she is trying to help Jim become a better lover. However some of her techniques are in my opinion a little over the top. Jim was questioning them at times as well. While Vicky (Tara Reid) looks stunning in this film, which I believe is a deliberate move by the film to show difficult it will be for Kevin to see Vicky again, and control his emotions towards her. Yet the other girls like Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) and Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) are not as good the second time around, as they have 'bits and pieces' type roles, which add nothing to the film.American Pie 2 had some disgusting scenes attached to it. Firstly, we get to see Stifler have a rather 'p*** weak' drink, secondly Jim gets his hands stuck to embarrassing parts of the body and to some rather crude audio visual material. While the film's most degrading scene includes the boys trying to see their homosexual fantasies come to life, which were not funny in the slightest for me. Also the jokes this film had were not funny, and are a bad influence on the young people of today, who use them to bad effect in real life.Director of American Pie 2, J.B. Rogers certainly goes all out to make this film even stupidier than the first film, and at times he succeeds. But even he goes too far, which is something I cannot excuse. The soundtrack to this film is made of songs that were popular with the teen at the time of release, which suit the film'. I really like the song 'Everywhere' by Michelle Branch from it.I was told that I was not watching this film in the right frame of mind, which is to relax and not take it to seriously, but I am afraid I could not get that way to like what it was showing as a whole. Obviously fans of the film can and that is why they are obsessed by it. American Pie 2's theme is that `this summer is about sticking together', which is nothing that bad on the surface. However, I found that theme only comes through in certain sections of the film. This movie was basically another sick look at a theme which has been overdone - sex. Really sex is overrated in today's society if you ask me and needs to start having a lot less attention placed upon it. If you have not got the gist, I was not the biggest fan of American Pie 2 and believe younger people should demand more from a movie than what this delivers.CMRS gives American Pie 2: 2 (Ok Film)",American Pie 2

The gags made up for it and made it a funny movie. Here, we have a stronger story, but some of the gags seem a little ""been there, done that"" quality to it, so I suppose I like American Pie 2 a little less than the first film. The idea of 4 friends coming back from their freshman year of college, trying to reignite that bond that brought them through high school is a real idea, one that most people who go to college have to deal with. While some of the friends live in the past, others live for the future, and others, just happy to be back together again. The four friends, Jim, Paul, Kevin, and Oz go along with Stifler to a lake house for what is supposed to be a summer of fun and overall debauchery. While there is some fun, the guys tend to find solace things other than their friends, even if it is lesbian neighbors of a painting job they picked up. By the end of the movie, everyone comes to grips with who they are, and who they are supposed to be with, and it is a very profound and satisfying ending. I was surprised how much people have learned by the end of this sequel. The gags are a little repetitive, so the film loses points there, but the overall story is much stronger.

American Pie 2 is the follow up to the box office hit American Pie (which I have not seen yet). The movie is about Jim (Jason Biggs) and basically his whole summer life with his best friends. The movie was funny. Personally I thought Jim's father was the funniest in the film. This film is 100% aimed at a teen audience. I'm 14 but did not find it to be one of the funniest movies this year. The jokes are mostly consisted of sexual humor. Not my type though. But this was certainly funnier than Bubble Boy.8/10,American Pie 2
84,CMTiago,My favorite slice,10,7 October 2014,"American Pie 2 is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and my personal favorite from the series. Not only does it deliver great comedy, but also showcases the evolution of the characters and how they face their first summer back from college. This is something that I think resonates with a lot of people and it was one of the reasons why I loved it. So 1 year later, we see Jim, Kevin, Oz, Finch & Stifler get back to hanging out and looking to spend the perfect summer by partying their asses off. For this they will have to move to the lakeside and rent a beach house in order to end their holidays with a memorable farewell party. Friendships will be tested, realizations will arise, as well as love, and in the end we get to find out if these group's bond was made stronger from the experience. For starters, this movie once again delivers in its trademark raunchiness with hilarious moments mainly involving Jim, but also Stifler. Storywise, we see the maturity most of these characters have garnered. I think the one that truly sees this in the best way is Kevin, as he is still clinging on to his old life, trying to be with Vicki and hanging out with his group. But Vicki only wants to be friends, and so Kevin learns that he must not live in the past, while also accepting the promising future he has. For me American Pie 2 is a great sequel to an already great movie. In fact, for me, it eclipses the original and makes for an even better experience. It's funny, disgusting and most of all entertaining in every aspect. Rating: 10/10",American Pie 2

86,atzimo,Better than the first,10,3 August 2002,"I am not a fan of American Pie. I believe that it abused the Farelli humor just for the sake of going to extremes. This time around I expected even less, taken that this is a sequel.Fortunately for the movie, there was (and still is) room for improvement as far as the actors' performances are concerned due to young of their age. So, everyone is now more experienced and even funnier, especially Seann William Scott who is the new Jim Carrey.The movie starts slow and without rhythm, like a soap opera episode. Events of the past are told for about 20 minutes and everything looks like that the sequel tries to explain its existence by using the first movie. But when the guys move to the beach house, it's all crazy from there!American Pie 2 is a lot more confident in every way, compared to first movie. Everyone in front and behind of the camera seem to know what they're doing. No more Farreli influences, just laid back, yet strong humor.Anyway, a much better movie than I expected, American Pie 2 is a great way to spend a couple of hours.8/10",American Pie 2

89,matija-trost,Better than the first part...,8,31 August 2001,"...what is a little bit surprising, since the sequels are in 90% worse than originals.Anyway, these days you can hardly find a good comedy with some original jokes in it, and luckily these movie includes some. One of the things welcomed in sequels is, that they don't try to change the original casting. The stars of part one are all in here although some of them became meanwhile quite a stars (Mena Souvari and partly Sean William Scott).What is also surprisingly is, that there are some quite hot scenes, which is quite rare, especially for puritan Hollywood, where sexy scenes are tabu. If only there was an European version, whoa...Can this movie qualify as a classic? Sadly, NO, since the plot is too shallow. But hey, who cares about that...The movie gives enough laughing scenes and that is all that counts in a light-weight comedy, which will surely won the title of best comedy for 2001.Well deserved 8/10.",American Pie 2
90,tex-42,"Nice film, lives up to original in some ways",7,10 August 2001,"Taking place a year after the first film, American Pie 2, in some ways surpasses and in other ways fails to live up to the original.  While all the original characters return, it seems that most of the female cast was given the short shrift.  Jessica (Lyonne), Vicky (Reid), Nadia (Elizabeth) and Heather (Suvari) are basically given extended cameos.  The only real female lead in this movie is reserved for Michelle (Hanigan) whose role has been incredibly expanded from what it was in the first film.  THe plot revolves around the guys moving into a beach house for the summer to cement their friendship and have the perfect summer.  Jim (Biggs) of course goes through a number of sexually embarrasing situations.  However, the real comic standout in this movie is Stifler (Scott), he lives up every scene he is in, and makes the movie perk up during its slow periods.  Overall, a fairly good sequel to the first film.",American Pie 2

98,poem,THE teenage movie ?,10,24 October 2001,"I really hated the original American Pie, but its sequel American Pie 2 is just excellent, genial, unbelievable !Why ? Because the people in the first movie where not at all believable, realistic, or in any way sympathetic, while in the second part everyone suddenly has his own personality. In part one, the boys just want sex, and had no ideals or dreams beside that. They where just anonymous stereotypes. How realistic is that ? I'm a little bit older, but I know exactly that I never had more dreams and ideals than at that age !But now, here, in part two, everyone suddenly really has a personality with dreams, ideals, strange projects, and so on. And these personalities are all very original ! The jokes are as tasteless as in the first part, but suddenly I can laugh about them ! I've seen it now three times, and every time I could laugh about them again. If it stays in cinema, I guess I'll watch it another time.I don't know if I can recommend this movie to any non-teenager, even if I myself are far older.

99,Cephyran,Second slice...,7,20 September 2003,"While not as potent as the first, the second slice serves up a new batch of humor. The characters are consistent, the general motivations never lose their appeal, and the mishaps of poor Jim really make the movie. I felt the big difference here was the lack of emphasis on Kevin and Vicky. In the first we saw a blossoming relationship encountering the typical speedbumps of romance. Now it was an awkward, jealousy driven issue that didn't really appeal to me. But, of course, Kudos for the lesbian scene, respectably played out. While appealing in an immature sort of way, the humor level is lower than the first.",American Pie 2

I thought this was gonna be a sequel made to capitalize on the success of the first one in which they'll make a horrible movie that tried too hard o be the first one but it really wasn't. I was quite surprised. The parts that I'll remember the most are the scene where the two hot women are playing games with Stifler, Jim and Finch. My favourite character is of course the Stifmeister(the older one). There are also a tonne of other hilarious characters which are back from the first.

Where so many movies these days bombard the audience with tasteless gags that reek of desperation, American Pie sits above the rest with what, I just don't know.  The first one really pushed the line, but the sequel totally crosses it, but manages to retain that air.There are so many laughs in this movie, you'll most likely be laughing from start to finish.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, it was worth the price of admission and certainly worth a rent when it comes to video.

105,evilmatt-3,Surprisingly good,7,26 August 2001,"After I saw the first American Pie film, pretty much all I remembered was an hour and a half long dirty joke.  What I didn't recall was that the film actually had some rather mature and wonderful sentiments about sexuality, youth, and romantic relationships.  In my mind, though, the raunchy jokes kind of pushed the more pleasant elements aside.I was similarly surprised with the sequel.  I didn't go into the theatre expecting very much, and what I got was a funny yet sentimental comedy that was well done and extremely enjoyable.  I did think that the gross-out humour of this particular installment was toned down a bit from the first (superglue scene aside- and that one just hurt me rather than make me laugh).  Still, it was a little grosser than it had to be, but my guess is that's why this film was so successful.The performances were also above par for this sort of film.  Jason Biggs did what he does best: play the awkward guy.  Sean William Scott really steals the show; he reminds everyone of that one obnoxious person in their lives and does it scarily well.I was really pleased with the character development in this film, particularly with ""band camp girl"" (whose name escapes me just now).  Not to sound condescending, but to me her character in particular showed a level of emotional understanding that I really wouldn't have thought this film capable of.Anyway, I'd recommend seeing this one.  You'll laugh (even if you don't really want to) and you get the bonus of a well-done comedy that doesn't just rely on sick humour.",American Pie 2
106,EdYerkeRobins,"Better Than The First, But Still ""Just OK""",7,17 August 2001,"There's no doubt that American Pie 2 is better than the original, but that's not saying much.  Amongst my peers, I am the only one who didn't love American Pie.  There's nothing wrong with the film, I just didn't enjoy it during repeat viewings, after the initial sensationalism was gone.  Of course, the same problem might occur with this movie, since I've only seen it once as of this review, but thats not the point.Set a year after the first film, everyone's favorite teenage male stereotypes are returning home after their freshman year of college.  The 5 friends decide to have a summer blow-out by renting a beach house, but, being unable to afford it, they bring along Stifler, who was little more than a footnote in the first film.  Stifler is given a much greater role, and this is a good thing; Sean William Scott is just so good at playing the chauvinistic jerk that I really hated him (up until now I considered this a bad thing - but now I realize I should be applauding such fine acting!). Another character with a huge role increase from the first is Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), whom Jim visits for advice (at the legendary ""band camp"" no less!) and shares several ""mishap scenes"" with.  Michelle is, just like in the first film, the only memorable female character, and it's great to see that she was given a bigger part.The promotion of these two minor characters to major is such a good thing because, aside from Jim, the other main characters became incredibly boring. Just like in the first film, the funniest sexual mishaps always happen to Jim, which makes him the only character worth caring about.  Oz' girlfriend is in Europe for most of the film, and he's too sweet of a guy to try anything behind her back; this makes him a likable character, but a dull one nonetheless.  Finch's character is totally killed, as he is left wanting nothing but Stifler's mom; he appears every now and then, but seems for the most part to be written out, appearing every so often in a scene with his new tantra gimmick, which really goes nowhere.  Finally, there's the other guy, who, though being the most realistic character and suffering from the most realistic problem of not being able to be ""just friends"" with his ex, is so unsensational compared to the others that I can't even remember his name (this film, like the first, relies on sensationalism - realism in a character is actually a bad thing).The same gross-out sexual mishaps that defined the first film are back, and so over the top that even a self-proclaimed ""mature"" viewer like myself can't help but laugh.  As unbelievable as some are (at least those from the first film could conceivably happen to someone), its hard not to laugh at them, even though most of them can be easily foreseen by any viewer remotely familiar with the first film.  As enjoyable as these scenes are, they present the major problem with this film: there is really no substance to the film besides these scenes; the rest of the film is just filler.  The overall flow of the film is much too inhibited by how weak the filler is compared to how great Jim's screw-ups are.  If any of the other characters from the original were developed further, instead of being sacrificed for Stifler and Allison (great as these 2 characters are now, they can't save all the filler), no doubt the between time would've dragged less.  But really, the only reason I paid my $8 was to see what happens to Jim anyway.",American Pie 2
107,thehardyboyz2043,"Better than the first, though..",5,12 August 2001,"that's not saying much on my part since I didn't really care for the first ""American Pie"" either. In the sequel, there are fewer gross out moments, but that doesn't make those moments any less disgusting, the plot is pretty non-existent, whereas the first one seemed to be about something at the very least.   But to it's credit, the sequel is funnier than the first, but not by much. Some of the characters are good, in fact the main guys in the film all have an unmistakable chemistry on screen, they all work really well together. Then there are some bad ones, Mena Suvari is rarely seen during the film, except in about 5-6 scenes and Shannon Elizabeth (sporting one of the worst hairstyles I've seen in a long time) is just plain annoying, plus she doesn't look that great in my opinion (which will likely get many bad comments sent to me, just for saying that). But anyway, the sequel is okay, it's nothing bad, and like I said before better than the first, just not all that good. I give it ** out of 4 stars.",American Pie 2

110,RJBose,Stale,3,8 February 2002,"""American Pie"" was a dopey movie but did surprisingly well at the box office as it had a few good laughs milked from the antics of hormonally beset teens.  The success of the original prompted what appears to have been a twenty minute writing of a sequel script, and the rapid reassembling of the cast to crank out another version while the memory of the first was still reasonably fresh.AP1 dealt with a group of (male) high school seniors in an affluent community in Michigan who have made a pact to address their as yet untried sexual yearnings. AP2 now finds these young men at the end of their freshman year at college, and seeking to expand on this body of knowledge.  Off to a summer house rental on Lake Michigan to spend the summer earning money by painting houses and pursuing sexual conquests away from the confines of their hometown and possible identification as college losers hanging out at high school parties (a true enough concern).  With some thought and wit the movie would have had some promise (or what passes for such in this genre anyway), but the film was just carelessly thrown together, apparently based primarily on which of the original cast members had the two days to spare for filming; (Mena Suvari, who went on to stardom through ""American Beauty"" seems to have had only an hour or so to read some lines and might as well not have been there at all- the same goes for her ""boyfriend who served essentially as a prop in this movie).What the ""pie scene"" was to AP1, the ""super glue"" scene is for AP2.  As slapstick it is quite funny, but after seeing the trailers and commercials on television, everyone knows what is going to happen anyway.  The obnoxious character, Stifler, is still obnoxious, the fellow with the steady girlfriend (Tara Reid) must accept the fact that she has a new college boyfriend, and the erudite fellow who had experienced the assignation with ""Stifler's Mom"" in AP1 seeks to prepare himself through Eastern philosophy for another meeting (it's even less funny than it sounds).The main plot deals with the geeky Jason Biggs character (the only type he seems to play) trying to ready himself for the pretty exchange student with whom his first unsuccessful experiences were disastrously broadcast over the internet to the delight of his schoolmates.  She is conveniently back in the USA and will come to visit at the end of the summer. For advice on technique he reaches out to his old prom date (she of the ""Band Camp"") who is conveniently band camping nearby.  The resolution of this plot is surprisingly sentimental, though not wholly unexpected.  The other plots meander uselessly to no particular end, with the other characters generally as window dressing.  There is no need to really examine any of this in any detail (how did the band camp geek get to be such an expert on sex anyway?) because it is meant as nothing more than a mildly humorous diversion.  If you liked the first one, it's worth a look, but just barely.",American Pie 2
111,rams_lakers,Much worse than the first,1,19 April 2006,"Here is a dumbed-down sequel that is definitely worse than the original. The first American Pie was very funny, introducing new characters in humorous situations. The second was a feeble attempt to recreate the fun from the first. It fails miserably! The social situations seemed very awkward, like the actors were struggling with dialog. It's almost like they were handed a blank script. The lowlight was Jim's talk with Nadia as they ""struggled"" for something to say in the lighthouse. The writing was terrible! Another bad scene was Jim trying to play in Michelle's band. The video tape getting stuck on Jim's hand was funny, but the rest of the movie reeks of bad conversation from the actors. There was too much of attempts to tie things up from the original. No, we didn't need Jim to ask Michelle why she was suddenly gone in the morning. It's funnier unexplained and they ruined it by having him question her on it. Jim's dad even looked lost, like he was trying to overdo his own character. Even American Wedding was funnier than this. Now there are horrible sequels like Band Camp and others as the producers try to whore out the American Pie name, desperately hoping they can attract viewers to bad films.

My only word of caution, leave the kids at a friends house or send them to bed early.  This one is not for kids.  It also only have a few weaknesses. There are a few scenes which don't flow two well but they are minor. 
Over all, a good comedy for a change (8 out of 10).",American Pie 2

117,Car316,More entertaining than the original.,10,16 January 2002,"American Pie 2, in my opinion, is funnier than the original. The original was very funny, but dragged at times. In this sequel, the comic mischief rarely lets up, and for that, it's more entertaining than the original. Some of the more uninteresting characters of the original, like Kevin, Oz, Vicky and Heather, are given less screen time, and it works. Stifler is given more screen time, and he is absolutely hilarious. I also found Finch more enjoyable this time around, too. Overall, American Pie is faster, funnier and more entertaining than the original. *** (out of four)",American Pie 2

AMERICAN PIE 2 relies heavily on bathroom humor and pushes the limits of decency (""can they really show THAT on the movie screen?""). There are a bunch of sub-plots rather than one main plot. Not as bright and original as AP1, this sequel nevertheless remains true to its characters. We see how they've progressed over the course of a year. Through it all, its characters are still sweet and likable. AP2 has no explosions or car chases, and only one monkey.Dave",American Pie 2
119,the-evil-cult,Not as Good as the Original,3,15 April 2005,"When a sequel is made usually the writers try to pick out what worked in the original and reuse it again in a different way. The problem with American Pie 2 is that it seemed like the writers tried too hard to follow the original American Pie instead of letting the sequel be its own story. This results in a choppy film. For example at the beginning of the movie the boys are in college and there is a sex scene involving the Jason Biggs character and his parents (as well as the parents of the girl he has sex with) walk in. Then there is a major location shift from college to the boys' home town. Just when you're getting comfortable with one location the movie moves to another location. And this is how the whole movie is. Just when you're getting comfortable with one character all of a sudden the character changes to suit a pre-made scene written because it worked in the original. The writers of American Pie 2 most likely wrote all the funny bits beforehand, using the original as inspiration, and then wrote a plot connecting all these funny bits together. As a result there is no coherence or unity in the movie, just bits and pieces of the original all stuck together.",American Pie 2
120,taikman,A second helping of Pie still tastes good.,7,7 April 2002,"I think you can divide humour into three different kinds: wit, absurdity and stupidity. Wit makes you laugh because it's clever and often satirical (think most of what was funny in the dialogue of 'Shakespeare in Love' or 'Pulp Fiction'), absurdity because it turns our rules about how life, society and the universe works upside down (e.g Monty Python and the 'Wayne's World' films), stupidity because, well, stupid and/or gross things happening are often funny (prime examples are 'There's Something About Mary' and 'Scary Movie'). American Pie and it's sequel fit firmly into the third category of humour. They're not smart, they're not subversive (unless you're prudish about sexual morality), but who cares: they're good, dumb fun.American Pie 2 is a sequel, so we get the same group of characters doing roughly the same thing: four young men, and arch-jerk Stiffler this time, having mainly very embarrasing experiences in their quest for sexual glory. The lads are at the lake for the summer, preparing for a massive party before they go back to university, and they've all got women troubles. It's more predictable than the original, and the subplots involving the characters Oz and Kevin are rather lame, but the outrageous situations the guys get themselves into still make you roar with laughter and that's the main thing. I'll never be casual with superglue again.
It's unusual for a sequel to measure up to the original, particularly if it's a comedy, but this one does. RATING: 7/10",American Pie 2
121,TexMetal4JC,"Better than the original, is this possible?",9,14 August 2001,"It's very easy for a sequel to be better than the original, if the original is only mediocre comedy filled with lots of gross-out gags. Even so, I went into AP2 expecting an even more mediocre version of the first. And I was very pleasantly surprised.Granted, it's not high art. It's still a movie about 5 guys trying to get laid. But it's a much funnier version than the first, and even though the trailers seemed to be planting tongue firmly in cheek by referring to AP2 as a film about friendship, the movie actually did provide a sense of deeper meaning that was completely absent in the first.Obviously, this film doesn't run very deep, but American Pie 2 even throws in a potentially tear-jerking scene and the director actually strives to make the audience feel for the characters. Most summer movies don't even go that far.Although it didn't have to do much to surpass American Pie, AP2 is not only one of the surprisingly better movies of the summer, it is also one of the few sequels to blow the original away.9/10",American Pie 2

Stand Alone-Good.,7,14 November 2013,"So I love the first American Pie, and I stand by what I said in my review of the first that that these are not sex comedies, and that they have a lot of heart, but i felt that this was a little overly sentimental. I love that these movies have heart, and a good plots but i feel like this one tried a little too hard to remove itself from that culture. That being said this movie was hilarious and as a sequel, it's just about the best we could have expected. It has numerous good laughs, good writing, good acting, and it's another great bromantic comedy. I have to say that Jason Biggs delivery of the---well, let's just say ""I glued myself to uh....myself"" scene(in the trailer too, not a spoiler.) was terrific. If you're looking for a good laugh that is not at the expense of somebody, or just constantly going for the easy laugh this is your movie. It has a lot of gross out humor, but it also has a lot of more situation humor and complex humor. Is it as good, or influential as the first? Not a chance.

The biggest guffaw was when Stiffler breaks into the room of 'Potential Lesbians' and finds 'Steve'(wink wink) and is ecstatic and comes out swinging with 'Steve' in  his hand. I have already bought the movie. This is definitely kind of movie that can be watched over and over.
My advise to all who like fun-movies to ignore the comments and analysis of those who were expecting to see a movie where the problems of teenagers are seriously analyzed and solutions are proposed. There are even people complaining about kids not shown solving 'Math' problems. For people like those, there are many movies like 'Schindler's List' and 'American X' etc.",American Pie 2

The stars of the first film are present, but in many cases, it is hard to see why. Number three (American Wedding) loses most of the actors with strong outside careers, but frankly, is a better film.On the positive side, while this movie is lackluster, it is not a painful sort of flop. We all have seen films where the directer and writers attempted something that failed, and failed in a way annoying to the audience. In this case, one mainly gets the impression that the writers didn't try very hard. The funny scenarios that a movie like this is built around are actually fairly well done, although they are a bit contrived.The real problem with this movie is that it is built around such a simple, nay primitive plot, that the movie becomes dull. Watch this if you absolutely must see all of the characters in the first film, but otherwise, number three (American Wedding) and distant relative ""Band Camp"" are superior.",American Pie 2

129,paul_tremblay,How to make a successful failure,3,13 May 2002,"How to explain what went wrong with, say, American Pie 2, The Mexican, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Captain Corelli's Mandolin? And more, and more. More or less recent American movies which each cost more than 20 independent productions. Incredible casts lead by seasoned directors and producers, working from sometimes sophisticated scripts. The sad fact is that these movies couldn't even survive their original first week end hype, deservingly with that.It is hard to pinpoint a common ailment for those creations, but a listing of their respective shortcomings could at least point in a general direction.Of course they were vehicles of some sort. Whether they were sequels attempting to cash in the success of their illustrious predecessors, a visual version of a recent literary triumph, or, simply, an established star medium (or a combination of two of the above), most of the recent dismal failures were rarely an example of an original conception. Not to say, naively, that all copies are doomed to trash and any new ideas should garner laurels; after all, as all newcomers know, most first movies look and feel clumsy and rarely see the light of day in a theater if they're ever filmed in the first place. There are probably more Ed Woods out there than you have Tim Burtons, but at least these productions don't cost $50 millions and don't attract (inter)national attention.American Pie 2, for example, followed on the steps of the hugely successful #1, which was funny although predictable, pleasant and charming despite (or because of being) conservative in tone and idea. AP2 was absolutely none of the above: rarely triggering a laugh (unless smearing your privates with Crazy Glue is an idea that never ever even crossed your mind: what kind of individual are you?), the comic rhythm was so off and the jokes given so much more time than needed that it was like watching Sharon doing stand up with Arafat: embarrassing and you wish you skip to the next sketch. The radio communication/2 lesbians joke (wrong word) reminds you of a joke told by a 5 year-old: lumbering towards some kind of a punch line which will never come. The cast and the production are just going through the motion, knowing perfectly well that the movie will make money whether the stupid lines they utter hit the funny bone or not: a following is there, waiting to disburse their hard-earned $10.00 (plus soda, popcorn, parking, babysitter, and the internet connection to make their opinion known to an awaiting public). I'm not anymore prude than the guy next door, but when will Hollywood understand that the simple fact of saying the `F' word does not, repeat not, provoke general laughter.Then comes the VHS/DVD street date where the good citizen rents (or, God forbids, purchases) the small black box (plus soda, popcorn) and then turns the viewing into a religious experience, thanking the powers that be they he or she didn't pay the $10.00 at the plex.Of course, for all the existing sequels/prequels/remakes, you have exceptions: it is my understanding that Spider-Man is both a critical and popular success. But with movies like AP2, Hollywood is turning itself into its worst enemy, sabotaging its own efforts at luring future audience into the big house.",American Pie 2
130,nunyerbiz,Flawed... but still funny!,6,16 August 2001,"I only recently saw the first film on DVD and was very pleasantly surprised. Despite it being tagged as a ""Gross out sex comedy"", I thought the plot, pacing, character development and emotional moments were all very well done. The story had a good premise (getting laid before prom) and the major male leads were all fleshed out very well. You had Jim (the confidence lacking nice guy), Oz (the sensitive GQ guy), Kevin (well rounded average guy) and Finch (the eccentric). Each of them had their own story line that progressed during the film and tied up somewhat neatly in the end.
This is where the major flaws of the sequel come glaring out. AP2 lacks pretty much all of the plot, pacing and character developement of the original. The paper thin plot is just filler to get from one joke setup to the next. The characters which really pulled you into the first one are pretty much abandoned. The only exception being Jim (Biggs) as the movie pretty much revolves around him. Finch gets stale rather quickly with his Tantric / Stifler's Mom routine. Kevin, Oz and all the returning female leads could have been left on the cutting room floor without making any impact on the movie. Although, it was nice to see some of the funnier bit players return for cameo type appearances (The Sherminator, The M.I.L.F guys, and despite being slightly annoying, Stifler's little brother)On the bright side, two supporting characters from the first movie are given much bigger parts in the sequel. The ""band camp"" girl and Stifler are given alot more lines and screen time and both deliver! Pretty much every laugh in the film that didn't come from Jim came from those two!
While this review might seem negative, I really did enjoy AP2 for what it was, a silly sequel. I don't think that it compares very well to the original in most respects, but the big joke sequences all manage to deliver without feeling too forced. You'll have a good time if you don't expect too much. Despite the lame plot and about 10 characters too many, I was consistently laughing. I guess when the credits roll and the lights come on, that's all that matters....7/10",American Pie 2
131,kmberger,A healthy second serving of screwball pie.,7,29 January 2002,"'Be wary of a sequel,' says the wise moviegoer.  Even if you liked the original, even if it was a surprising laugh riot reliving the baser humor of mid-80s teen sex romps, even if it had a classic scene involving a pie, even if it had memorable lines (""This one time, in band camp..."") and memorable characters (Stifler's mom) - even if it had all that, be wary of a sequel.
That said, American Pie 2 does a fine job of following up the immense success of the original while living up to somewhat lowered expectations the second time around.  Here, we have the same gang of horny teens from the first movie, fresh off a year at college and hoping to rekindle some of the wild and crazy times of their youth.  Yeah, their youth.  All last year of it.Anyway, the four lads (Kevin, Oz, Jim and Finch), rent a summer house on the beach with Stifler (still as hopelessly vulgar - and hilarious - as ever), and the shenanigans begin.  This time, the set pieces kick it up a notch, beginning with Jim being interrupted in flagrante dilecto by his parents (and the girl's parents) before the credits even start; adding in a laugh-out-loud funny sequence involving the lengths some men will go to in order to fulfill their lesbian fetish; and of course, hapless Jim having a major malfunction with some superglue and a porn tape.  Throw in the band camp scene and the 'Stifler's experience with bodily fluids' scene, and you've got a good collection of very funny bits to wind the movie around.
The use of the cast is also very much uneven, but gives more emphasis to the funnier (and more talented) cast members.  Given big chunks of screen time are Jason Biggs (hopeless Jim), Seann William Scott (ever-sophomoric Stifler), Alyson Hannigan (band camper Michelle), Eddie Kaye Thomas (refined before his time Finch), and Eugene Levy (ever-understanding and patient as Jim's Dad).  Everybody else melts into the background, and is more or less swept under the rug, which is just as well.  The five mentioned above are more than capable of carrying the movie whenever they have to.It's no masterstroke of comic genius, and not nearly as surprisingly funny as the original, but American Pie 2 is a worthy sequel; a title that is all too fleetingly earned.

146,jennifer-99,Uninspired....,7,3 September 2001,"That's the best word I can come up with to describe this sequel to 1999's hugely successful, and largely superior, American Pie.
Alas, this is another case of a sequel that made it to the big screen not because of a raw, edgy script or a unique, intelligent plot, but simply because the first installment made the money counters at Universal Pictures extremely happy. From the first frame through to the last, this film appeared to be desperate to match the outrageous hilarity and vulgarity of its forerunner. American Pie was fresh and raw with a definate edge that left the audience in stitches even though the subject matter was more than a little crude. Pie 2 relies heavily on overused gross-out sight gags, incidents involving some main characters heavily testing the boundaries of heterosexuality and a ridiculous scene with a band instrument and likely some petroleum jelly. The humour is almost entirely forced with the majority of the scenes included in an obvious desperate effort to generate laughs based on the shocking raunchiness of the material. While the shock value worked extremely well in the first picture, it falls flat here, due largely in part to the skeletal plot which serves only as a device to present the aforementioned raunchy sketches. And as if the second rate humour wasn't enough, the script writers decided to throw in some good ole fashioned Hollywood Cheese to really make us cringe. If the jokes in this movie don't quite work, the attempt at a sappy cheesy romantic moment fails miserably. While all of the actors from the first film have returned for the sequel, most of them have been relegated to smaller roles with the majority of the screen time focusing on the wooden Jason Biggs, the sometimes cute sometimes annoying Alyson Hannigan and the admittedly funny Sean William Scott. They all do as well as can be expected, given the material they had to work with, with the standout being Scott's Stifler, whose infectious smile and outrageous personality generate laughs all on their own. Even Mr. Levy, who was fantastic in Pie 1, doesn't come close to recreating the laughs from the first film. I will admit, I laughed. This certainly was NOT a terrible movie - it had funny moments. Simply not to the same degree nor with the same edge as American Pie. Save your $12 and see this one when released on video. Not even seeing this movie in a room full of laughing movie goers can save it from its fate of being just another poorly planned inferior sequel.

Again as the first American pie, we are treated to an all star cast, and a fun movie, full of laughs. This is exactly what you would expect from writer Adam Herz, as a follow up to the original American pie. If you saw the first movie than of course you must see this one, move along to ""the next step"" and get caught up. And if you haven't seen the first movie, definitely go ses it before this one..... rent them both and watch them back to back another classic addition to the first10/10",American Pie 2
148,SFLYNNLV,American Bi,3,31 January 2002,"C'mon folks this is just a huge cover-up for four guys attempting to deal with their homosexuality, or bi-sexuality.  One of the most impressionable scenes in the film has two of the college boys french kissing and then very willing to fondle each other supposedly because two girls demand such in exchange for normal sex.  Pleeeassseeee!!!! All of the main characters are baby-faced, bright-eyed studs.  They are sure to bring in the teeny-bopers who croon to such boyish, photogenic charm.  I managed to catch the first American Pie and found it mildly amusing - enough to rent part two.  And, part two is very interesting, but it is a plain old screenwriters cover-up for his homosexual instincts and so be it.  The producers should have been bold enough to explore the very real drama that lies underneath American Pie II and then we would have had a truly interesting experience. Allison Hannigan as Michelle the ""sex-master"" hands in about the only interesting and thought provoking performance as the girl who teaches the star (Jason Biggs) Jim Levinson about sex and then, of course, falls in love with him. Moments of real comedy do exist in the film and yes, I know it is a farce. But, farce or not it remains a curious exploration of human need repressed. Some may think that I'm making a mountain out of an ant farm or that this is how college guys deal with their summer. Or, perhaps my college summers - working the night shift prohibited me from experiencing what these fellows - who have a magnificent house on the lake - did with their time away from the ivy.  I can not believe they were in constant need of sexual pleasure and NEVER getting it.  All they can do is talk about it and fantasize about the babes on the beach.  One of the dudes wants his friend's mother and spends the entire summer waiting for her - sorry, another dead giveaway of the screenwriter's actual intent. Jason Biggs manages to smile through every scene and his character pretty much carries the entire film.  He is a reasonable actor and I look forward to his future work.  The other fellows are good given the material, which they never rise above. If American Pie III is in the works maybe the screenwriter can push the envelope and have these guys pursue what they really want, which is each other, now that would be interesting.",American Pie 2
149,buddhadan-1,"Great movie, but better series",8,20 September 2006,"As I noted in my review of the first movie, this movie is hilarious by itself but better in the movie series.The first movie helps to set up the characters, brings us a lot of humor, and can truly be watched by itself without seeing any of the sequels.But, to truly get the most out of the three movies (I don't count the direct to DVD movies that came out later), it's best to see each of them in order.The first movie has our characters as young and still fairly stupid as far as life is concerned. They learn a bit at the end, grow a bit, and we all get to go along for the funny ride.This movie has at least one of the group (no spoilers, just see it) already maturing from his role in the first movie and the rest of the characters either resisting the call to adulthood or working their way through their own twisty hilarious paths to maturity.Again, if you are going to see them, I strongly recommend watching them in the order that they came out in so that you can not only enjoy the humor in each, but so that you can notice that the characters are growing into adults throughout the series, ending in the American Wedding movie.",American Pie 2
150,gregmovies,Quality sequel,7,24 August 2008,"I actually thought this one was just as good as the original. Like the original, there is plenty of nudity, sex, and gross out gags. Even so, the film's heart is in the right place. The dialogue is equally funny and Stifler is just as hilarious as he was in the original American Pie. Jim's Dad continues to walk in on his son at the most inopportune times, providing the best jokes in the movie. Though not really original, the film entertains, which is all a comedy needs to do.Fans of the first should see this one, and everybody else should probably pass. My vote, 7/10 (I saw the unrated), one of the better comedies out thereIf you liked this film try Road Trip, Euro Trip, Old School, and Superbad",American Pie 2
151,oceanave,Sequel supersedes original,10,4 March 2006,"The first ""Pie"" movie was good, and a sequel seemed inevitable. Evidently the writer of Pie 1 (Adam Herz) wasn't overly excited about doing another but it's fortunate that he did, because he surpassed what was done in Pie 1 on many levels. Herz and the supporting story editors gave the characters and giving their lives more dimension. We see them all again here one year later (although produced two years after Pie 1), having all gone through the pivotal first year of college. In some ways, we're seeing a re-vamp of the events of Pie 1...but now we go a few steps further. For instance, the character of Michelle Flaherty was seen ever so briefly in Pie 1 and Pie 2 and now we get to know her almost completely. Steve Stifler is his usual obnoxious self, and he's become even more-so in a year's time. Then of course, there's the principal character, Jim Levenstein - no longer a virgin but still quite innocent - and by the end of the movie, he's pretty much come full circle. The acting is pretty superb all around, and the director got the best out of the actors. Jason Biggs is not a big talent, but he has many small-but-bright moments throughout, and his adeptness at physical comedy is given a good display here. Seann William Scott's comedic range over the two flicks is huge, and it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the part of Stifler. The supporting actors (who all returned from Pie 1) are at their best as well, with splendid newcomers George Wyner playing the Senior Counselor at band camp, and Denise Faye & Lisa Arturo playing the house owners. The subplots in Pie 2 (Band Camp, the guys' summer job of painting houses owned by beautiful women, and so forth) bring hilarious results. Adam Herz has a unique ear for dialog and characterization - I hope we see more of his work in the future. Personally, I think Pie 2 would've been a good place to stop. Pie 3 was a bomb and Pie 4 bears only a tiny resemblance to Pies 1, 2, and 3. The greatest aspect of Pie 1 and 2, but especially 2, is that they appeal to a surprisingly large audience, like ""Animal House"", ""American Graffiti"", and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" preceding them by 20 years and longer.",American Pie 2
152,Pelagia,Best film of 2001,8,11 August 2001,"After suffering through all the bombs that have been put out this summer, I must say that Pie 2 was the best film I've seen this year.  Hands down. That says a lot about the quality of 2001.Some of the actresses have explained in interviews that they are now against nudity and explicit material, and apparently the filmmakers punished them by giving them small roles that border on cameo appearances.  Also, notice the obvious intros each of the male cast members get, perhaps for audience reaction?  The material is consistent with the original as it is full of casual sex, underage alcohol consumption, and high levels of machismo... the kind of stuff that politicians and censors gnarl at.Essentially, the film is basically centered around the gags, the spaces in between filled with some crude semblance of plot.  Anyhow, I came in, had a good time, had a good laugh, what more could you ask for?8 of 10.",American Pie 2

154,Lori_ruelo,The Second Part is not Funny!,2,21 September 2018,"It goes on with the top boys from the school the young clique now come to college and the whole urge to jump into bed with new acquaintances becomes more reality every day. Of course, many stumbling blocks and fat wells are put in the way. What was still successful and funny in the first part of the ""American Pie"" series is unfortunately only copied in the second part. The gags no longer really ignite and it remains quite superficial and rehearsed. With a few little gags, you have to chuckle, but that's all there is to it. With isolated, embarrassing scenes, you can no longer laugh, but just shake your head. My favourite scene is already where the boys turn the hobby lesbians and they can only watch the action of the girls when the boys themselves also participate. That's a good situation comedy. Conclusion: The charm of the first part is already completely evaporated and one wonders, is you even so, at a young age on it?",American Pie 2
155,DanielWRichardson,This is the best slice of pie.,8,22 July 2008,"This is my favorite American Pie movie. Even though I've seen this when I was in high school, I relate to it more now. My favorite theme of this movie is that things will change no matter what, but it's all in how you handle it that matters. Now that I'm done being deep I'll tell you the other thing that makes this the best slice of pie. The juvenile hilarious comedy. I was laughing all the way through this. Like when Jim super glues his hand to his junk. Classic. Or the scene when the boys are trying to get the girls to kiss each other. Eugene Levy was great as well. I mean any scene with him and Jason Biggs was funny. Another thing that I really like was that Stifler got a bigger role. I don't care what others say, the dude's funny. The one con to me was Tera Reid. I just don't think she can act and I really didn't like her character. I didn't like her character in the other one either, but you know. It was great to see all the cast back including the small, side, and bit roles (The MILF dudes, Shermanator, Stifler's Mom). And I'm not one for romance but it was nice to see Jim and Michelle end up together. This one had a lot of heart as well and was never mean spirited. I've read this once before and totally agree with it; that, no matter how bad on of the characters mess up or embarrass themselves, their buddies are always supportive. Sure they'll bust your stones a little, but they never make you feel bad or unwelcome in the group. Which is kind of nice to see in a ""teen movie"". Well I'm running out of things to say, so watch this if your a fan of comedy or the Pie series. Trust me, it's just good stuff.",American Pie 2
156,watchhawk,A twisted sequel takes the buck,5,6 September 2001,"From the fresh Am Pie 1 comes a lame rebirth that had some of the niceness of the first film but sagging in ideas or characters.  The only fresh awkwardness was Stifler.  He kept the film floating with his hilarious shameless ""go-n-get-it"" attitude.  Jason Biggs character was the other half of the movie but again ""gluing it"" and the typical ""getting sex lessons"" is a total wash out. The other characters were mostly a bore.  Sorry but this ""get together again"" all-smiles flick was hardly worth while doing (except for the big buck, of course).",American Pie 2
157,mattdvs,Reheated Pie,6,13 August 2001,"I expected exactly what I got.  I expected more of the same gags from the first film at a cost of it's originality.  ""American Pie"" was a hilarious, but still truthful, look at teen sexuality.  It was clever, well written, and accomplished the rare feat of not treating it's audience like dullards. ""American Pie 2,"" on the other hand, is just basically warmed-over gags seemingly left out of it's predecessor's script.  Yes, many of these gags are hilarious and fun to watch, but gone is the original's creative writing and plot.  This film just seems to be the writer saying, ""Hey, let's do the exact same thing, but this time at the beach!""  As far as the cast goes most of the actors do an honorable job staying true to their original characters, with the glaring exception of Chris Klein, who exudes this cheesy ""sensitive"" act of a pretty-boy with zero acting chops.  However, Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, and Eddie Kaye Thomas, most notably, have the potential to become great comic actors, and Eugene Levy (the best part of the first film) is just as hilarious.

However ""AP2"" does not come close to exceeding the accomplishments of the first film.  The first installment was a landmark in the comedy genre.  It was an attempt at the great American sex comedy.  The second installment is not even close to being a self-contained sequel, as most of its raunchy jokes are dependent on the audience seeing the first film.  Even the ""new"" jokes are recycled in a way, i.e. Stifler and urine, and Jim's dad walking in on him.

On the other hand there are some nice twists and turns and definitely some nice jokes which made the whole theatre laugh. To be honest I have always had some caveats about Stiffler (played by Seann William Scott). In this movie he uses the f-word as a way to convey all kinds of meanings - much like the smurfs do with their smurfastic expressions. But this starts to be obnoxious to say the least. Some of the geekiness is just way of the chart (Sherminator), some of the acting is very original (once again Alyson Hannigan is brilliant as Michele). Overall it's a nice get-together with some nice actors in a nice set-up. If you enjoyed the first movie immensely (e.g: I did) then you'll like this one.The story is not that original either. It's summer, holidays are comming, what to do? Once again Kevin's brother comes to the rescue with one of his ""secrets"" (like the secret ""How to give your girlfriend a good time"" book in the first movie). This time they go to this wonderful beach house.If you don't know what the first movie was about, save yourself from seeing this one. This is just for the fans.

But the first three AP films - this one and ""American Wedding"" in particular, are surprisingly well-made, well-acted films. They aren't constantly and consistently hilarious masterpieces like ""Airplane!"" or ""The Naked Gun"", but they are occasionally quite hilarious.I won't give out any plot details; not because the plot is so brilliant that I might spoil it (it isn't, I'm afraid), but because you probably already know it and/or have read it before. If not, wikipedia is your friend. Don't waste your time with ""Band Camp"", ""The Naked Mile"", ""Beta House"", etc. (the list goes on), which are quite honestly trash, watch the first three. You know, the ones that are actually worth watching.While ""American Wedding"" will always be my favourite of the three, American Pie 2 really is a thoroughly enjoyable film.

Peppered with some suggestion about how to be a better lover, it had a point in there somewhere.""2"" does not.  At all.  Ever.  It is gratuitous, stupid, juvenile, and crude.  The jokes (the ones that aren't blatant repeats of the first movie - e.g., trumpet in butt vs. flute in female genitalia -or- penis in pie vs. hand glued to penis) are more toilet humor than guilty chuckle.  The worst moment was the ""Petey"" scene, during which I was mildly amused until Jason Biggs proclaimed ""and I have gigantic balls!"".  It was as if the record stopped.  It made no sense, and was ridiculous.Also note that the women are conspicuously seldom in this film.  Could it be that they saw the script, and gave little time to it?  Could it have been that they thought a sequel was lame enough?  For whatever reason they all but passed on this film (I assume they must've had obligations to appear, and so made the least of it), they were right in doing so.

And anticipation isn't funny enough to sustain an entire movie. American Pie 2 certainly could have been stupider and more offensive than it actually was, and I appreciate the fact that it wasn't, but it still doesn't make it worth the experience. Once in a while, there is a truly surprising, actually laughable moment, but not nearly enough to fill a movie. And most of the funny moments are killed by dragging them on endlessly, long after everyone's got the gag. I could go on with the problematic aspects of this movie, from the grossly uneven character use to the red light that a number of cars roll blithely through, but the bottom line is that this movie failed to hold itself together, which is really quite sad, considering how little it would have had to do to fulfill its somewhat limited promise.",American Pie 2

That's not to say that this is a  perfect movie: It does run a little long, and a pivotal part of the original ""Pie,"" the notion that the sexuality of teen girls was as important as that of the boys, is mostly missing here.

The fact that he was a bigger character in the second one was outstanding. The first one was funny but only really the physical humor. In the second one all of Stiffler's dialogue had me rolling and Jim was way more funny in this one also. I hope the third one includes Stiffer a lot i'm glad they dumped the rest of the crappy actors especially Klein who did nothing funny at all in the first two. American Pie 3 or American Wedding should be promising.,American Pie 2

182,Gavin59,One of the greatest comedies ever!!,9,5 October 2008,"This is an excellent sequel to the hillarius American Pie. The original cast is back(Jim, Stifler, Oz, Jessica, Vicky, Kevin, Michelle, Finch, Sherman, Heather, Jim's dad, and even Stifler's mom and Stifler's brother) and funnier than ever. It starts off right where American Pie left off. The gang has just finished there freshman year of college and they have "" Twelve weeks of imortality"". Stifler gets peed on at his own party,then Kevin's brother suggests renting a summer lake house and they do. They reluctantly bring Stifler along to help out with there summer painting job. They end up painting two girls house that say there lesbians. Jim and Stifler kiss, Finch gets his but slapped in the most outragesly hilarious scene of the movie. Later Jim was trying to use a lubricant while watching a porn and accidentally picks up some super glue and uses it instead. He also got his hand super glued to the porn tape. Near the end of the movie Jim realizes he is in love with Michelle instead of Nadia (Following an eventful trip to band camp). To sum it all up it's an excellent movie with great acting and great comedy. Much better than your average teen sex comedy. Don't miss it!!!!!!!!",American Pie 2

The plot is simple after the first year of college the gang from the first film get back together and after having their parties stopped at Stiflers they rent a house at the beach and have a big party! thats the film and its great fun, loadsa jokes and good cast.",American Pie 2
185,Andy C-2,Doesn't live up to expectations,6,31 October 2001,"Having not seen the much loved first American Pie - I wasn't 100% sure what to expect, so I went into the Cinema with an open mind about the film, but realising sequels are often disappointing and expecting something along the same lines as 'Road Trip'.This film has its moments, and its not ever boring - but it is filled with cliched storylines, and toilet humour. The 'watching video in bed scene' is funny - but still toilet humour, although the Mum humour has to be the best in the film. The characters have some depth (although obviously exaggerated), and are quite likeable. But the storyline is dire. Every twist and turn is blatantly obvious, and subsquently frustrating and the typical Hollywood style ending (along with 'the best party ever attitude' -like that ever happens in real life) just take the biscuit.In summary, I hope they don't make any more, so my friends will avoid quoting them - and talking about them as 'classics'. But nevertheless this is ok film, altough theres nothing new here, just formulated comedy - But thats all the general public seem to want.....and it brings in loads of money - so who can blame them.",American Pie 2
186,Nuno_Reis,The Pie is getting better,4,22 October 2001,"This piece of pie is getting sweeter but unfortunatelly although it's a great movie, it's still a teen movie and it can't be understood by the general public as it should. The movie is in very aspects equal to the first (why changing??) and most important than having the same kind of jokes, it has the same cast and for a cast with this size its very hard! They re-hired a lot of actors and some of them had created a career (Shannon Elizabeth, Sean William Scott, Chris Klein, Mena Suvari and Tara Reid) but this is a thankfulness for the boost that AP has given to their career, almost all nowadays' teen stars were on that movie.Let's hope that someone will have a great ideia for keeping doing pies for some more years, if they don't mess a lot because this story can be easily spoiled if they try to force the sequel. This second pie is very tasty and the ending, like in the first, makes the sequel possible but not predictable.",American Pie 2
187,Evil is back,Have you ever wanted to a film so badly you did not go to the bathroom during it.,10,27 September 2001,"Well I saw this film anticipating only a laugh riot from Stifler. I was wrong. Finch was hilarious as the tuntra boy who wanted his jerk friends mother to have sex with him. Kevin was funnier than the second time around but was not in the film long enough. Oz was funny in this one. He made me laugh with the phone sex scene. Jim was really funny always learning about sex from the band geek. Sherman was so funny saying what the terminator said in the film the terminator except he said it sex wise. All the girls were hot except for Natasha Lyonne. they had small parts. Ok the best part of the film belonged to Stifler. I was right he would be the funniest but not that funny. Here is a quote ""holy s**t dude I found a dildo"" enough said. He is the funniest character I have ever seen. This film was funny almost because of him. If you have seen the film you know what I am talking about when I say ""oooohhhh I can taste the bubbles"".............9.3/10",American Pie 2
188,RyeOfTheDead,My piece on this 'Pie',6,10 August 2001,"A week after seeing Rush Hour 2, I embarked on a journey to the multiplex to see yet another sequel, to yet another comedy.  This one was American Pie 2, the sequel to the 1999 teen-sex-comedy.  And like Rush Hour 2, it is one of the better sequels out there.  Personally I did not feel that it was as good as the original, of course one reason for that is because American Pie is a neo-classic.  AP is one of the movies that is used when comparing other movies.  American Pie is to today's teens and twenty-somethings, what Porky's was to our predecessors. I will say that American Pie 2, is no Porky's 2: the Next Day.  American Pie 2 is as funny as the original, and is true to the characters.  No one has ""turned over a new leaf"" at college, and yet they do show some growth since the original. I will also note that despite the return of all the original main characters, American Pie 2 seems to focus more on Jason Bigg's Jim. Though he was also the main character in the first movie, it is often viewed more as an ensemble comedy.  In American Pie 2, everyone else's storylines seem to be reduced to B-plots.  The movie really focuses on Jim's lack of confidence in his sexual performance more than anything else, as he awaits the end of the summer, when he will be reuinited with Nadia, ""the one that got away.""Screenwriter Adam Herz really had a task ahead of him in attempting to outdo his own outrageous scenes from the original movie.  From the infamous pie scene, to the tainted beer, the original really made audiences stomachs turn and their mouths erupt with laughter.  Herz came through quite well with the sequel, with some champagne that may have gone bad, and Jim's encounter with super-glue.  I have to add that this is a sequel that really needs the original to florish, unless you've already become familiar with the characters from the first American Pie, you won't really know them in this one. The American Pie movies seem to hit the chord missed by so many other Gross-Out movies, as while yes, many of the jokes are crude and without taste, they are jokes first, and not just an attempt to make you wretch. The trend has been, with movies like Scary Movie... to just stick something gross on frame and shock the audience.  ""look! a penis."" The American Pie movies seem to be better at just infering something has happened, but not sticking the entire thing (so to speak) in your face. My comment is, if you liked the original American Pie, you'll like this one. If you didn't like it, or haven't seen it, go see something else.",American Pie 2
189,tehfro,A sequel better than the original? Yep!,9,13 August 2001,"It says something about this summer when this movie was the one I've enjoyed the most this summer.  It easily trumps the original in terms of laughs as they keep flowing throughout.  Nothing is really spoiled in the trailers that have been running except the opening scene. As in the first one most of the situations are believable and true to life.However this movie does have a few flaws as Kevin/Oz/Victoria/Heather's parts are all more or less pointless subplots that make these characters come across as very unlikeable and just sort of ""there"".Making up for this are their roles being taken over by the rest of the cast, and quite frankly, they do a much better job than diminished characters. Alyson Hanningan as Michelle has a much larger role as does Steve Stiffler (Seann William Scott) who turns in a movie-stealing  and possibly star-making performance.  Nearly every line out of his movie had the audience bursting with laughter.  He really carries most of this picture and his future seems to be bright if he can get out of being typecast in this role.The scenes not involving him, Jim, or Jim's Dad drag, but luckily they're scarce.The main plot is probably more meaningful as we actually have a central character now as opposed to a group picture.  The serious scenes are certainly better acted and just generally better for the most part. 
Everyone is back, even the bit characters such as the MILF guys and the Shermanator.Some have commented on parts of this movie being homophobic, which is pretty ridiclous as what is depicted in the movie is what the vast majority of straight college-aged kids would react like in that situation.In short, if you're aged 17-30 I suggest you go see this movie now.  If you're easily offended by sexual talk/situations or didn't like the first one stay away (although I think if you're offended you're simply not in touch with the reality of how people act in college.)9/10",American Pie 2
190,Skinny-Cartman,My Favorite Pie,6,10 July 2006,"This movie was pretty good. Its a lot of the jokes from the first one used over. I agree with the others in saying, WATHC THE FIRST ONE FIRST! Otherwise you'll be asking questions the entire movie. Plus, so many things are ruined if you haven't seen the first one.This movie is about the Four dudes, (Jims, Oz, Kevin, and Finch)...(and Stifler) and they have all changed since going to college, but re-unite to party in Michigan for the summer. Basically, even though it says they have changed, they really haven't. Jims is still the geeky dude who tried desperately to get laid, but has all sorts of mis-adventures. Oz is still the sensitive jock, who talks all softly to his girlfriend. Kevin is still the ""not-so-heterosexual"" friend who wants to do everything together. Finch is still weird and obsessed with Stiflers mom. Stifler is still very annoying, says the ""F"" word every other word, and gets lots of chicks.We also see some, and meet new, minor characters. Such as Jims Dad, who is there for all his misadventures, Stiflers brother, who like this little 8 year old and extremely annoying, and Oz's girlfriend, who has become a little more kinky since the first Pie.Well, this movie has its funny parts, its corny parts, and its cliché parts, but overall, its pretty good.",American Pie 2

Pie 2 rates right up there as a good complement to the first.  It didn't try to do anything much different, but managed to pull off the old formula from the 1st movie. The audience was laughing so hard that I missed at least 5 minutes of dialogue. There were plenty of nice touches from the last film, and plenty of new laughs.  Sure, some of the best lines were in the previews, but it still didn't stop me from laughing again and again. A great summer flick. A solid 8.",American Pie 2

The jokes in American Pie 2 seemed forced. The great thing about the 1st one was that the jokes were fresh and hilarious. Number 2 they seemed so forced that they tried to hard to make this movie as good as or better than 1. But all is not lost. The thing I liked the best was when Jim realizes his True self and falls for Michele. And of course Stiflers Mom. I do not think they need to another one. I feel that this franchise has run it's course.,American Pie 2
193,marcus40mast,"Funnier, Weirder, Sexier",7,22 October 2001,"The first American Pie was a good film, it was funny in places, weird at the right moments and a generally diverting film. But it was far too sentimental. American Pie 2 is just BETTER! The whole cast is reunited for this film and it is pulled off with a humour that Road Trip and DWMC? both failed to hit. From the return of The Sherminator to Stifler(Sean W Scott) wanting to 'take one for the team' (you'll see what I mean when you see it!) this film is the shining example of what a teen comedy should be.The start of this film is superb, I was laughing almost immediately at Jim's Dad's attempts to play it cool when he finds his son in a 'compromising situation'. I thought that this film had something which the first one lacked in some respects and that was spontanaity and timing. Don't get me wrong, American Pie had these two qualities, but they weren't use to the perfection that Pie 2 does. A superb example is Stifler's final words of the entire film, used just when the audience thinks its all over. But far be it from me to ruin the fun...watch it yourself and see.",American Pie 2

All the original actors return, and look much more mature and comfortable with the camera. Jason Biggs lives up to expectations and delivers like a true comedian. Tara Reid looks absolutely stunning, and that's pretty much enough for me. Shannon Elizabeth turns in a nice short performance, and is extremely fun to watch. The others turn in good performances, all except for Thomas Ian Nicholas who dissapoints and is definately the weak link in the entire movie. For whatever shortcomings Thomas Ian Nicholas puts up, they are more than made up for by stellar performances by Sean William Scott [Stifler]and Alyson Hannigan [Michelle] who in my opinion steal the show.Eugene Levy turns in another brilliant performace as Jim's Dad and touches everyone at just the exact needed time. Overall the movie is a lot of fun to watch and has tremendous replay value. It combines laugh out loud rip roaring humor with splashes of emotional touches which are definately a nice touch.",American Pie 2

197,johnston.scot,Seconds? No Thanks.,4,2 April 2002,"I actually found the first movie in the series to be an okay coming-of-age comedy that was mischaracterized by many viewers and reviewers as solely a gross-out piece. The first one wasn't; this one is.While the first movie featured a set of interacting story lines that complemented each other, this one has no story line at all. What plot there is exists solely for the purpose of stringing together a few random skits. ""I'll just pop over to band camp for a few minutes a do some funny business with a trumpet!""In fairness, some of the skits are amusing. Others remind me of those awful mid-period SNL skits where you could see the actors waiting desperately for the commercial. The twist with the ""band camp girl"" in the first movie was funny. But somebody on the screenwriting team here doesn't understand the concept of a ""joke."" You've got your set up, then your punch line. Then you move on to another joke. It's really not that funny to stand around and repeat variations on the punch line (unless your sense of humor is in the ""Ha ha! she said f---!"" vein).More fairness: the actors and the director here are capable. For the most part, it's a craftsmanlike piece of work, but an uninspired one.A year of college hasn't matured any of the characters. One wonders what future sequels will be like. I suspect ""American Pie 9"" will wind up as something similar to the slide show Jack Nicholson presents near the end of ""Carnal Knowledge.""",American Pie 2

There were characters that weren't needed in the movie, although they were originals; these people just didn't show up enough.It's about the boys in this one.  Hanging out, summer jobs, old flames.

With this movie, though, they didn't.American Pie 2 was probably the weakest of sequels in a summer full of sequels.  The jokes are the same, maybe changed just a little.  The characters have nothing no new motivations- they are all just battling the same things as in the first movie.  From Stifler's mom to parents catching Jim in personal moments, the sequel steals, er, ""borrows"" from American Pie 1 without a second thought.The result?  One dumb movie.  First of all, Jason Biggs (Jim) is horrible to watch.  You just want to punch him for being so stupid.  The scene where he plays the trombone?  Not the least bit funny.  People laughed- WHY?  Finch is annoying as ever, constantly speaking like he is 50- not in a funny way- but in a really bothersome way that sees him featured for a good part of the movie when he is better as a supporting character- a very small supporting character.  Kevin is a pointless character, he doesn't do anything except talk to his old girlfriend Vicki the whole time, constantly asking her to ""Catch up and hang out.""  This also means Vicky is a waste of time, as is Oz, who somehow became a complete neutered male from the beginning of the first film.  He is an entirely different person even from the end of that one- does anyone care?  Jessica and Heather- great to see people from the first one, but do they add anything?  No.The only thing this movie does is play Stifler well.  He essentially has to strap the movie on his back and carry it because everyone else is boring. How does he do this?  He says the F-word- a lot.  This even loses humor after 50 times, so by the end you wish you never spent the 6.50 to watch this junk.  The worst part is when the opening scene runs and people have seen the previews and still laugh very hard- why, people?  It doesn't make sense.  Out of all of the scenes in the movie the audience has definitely seen that before.AND YET, between the predictable script, the rerun jokes, the low brow bail out humor (guys kissing, football down low, little kid swearing, monkey drinking alcohol), and the painful acting of Jason Biggs, American pie 2 will somehow make a lot of money.  It makes you wonder....
IF they make a third one, I hope they invest a little time in writing characters that we care about and get rid of characters we don't (Shermanator, Jessica, etc.).  Be new and inventive, just don't insult us by showing us the first movie with a different title.  1.5 STARS",American Pie 2

If you plan on watching a movie similar to the first one, you're out of luck.  THe theater that I saw it in was full of rowdy teenagers fresh out of high school who wouldn't stop laughing at the stupidiest parts of the film.   Most of the characters in the first film show their faces in this one. The same old group of friends come back home from their first year of collage and decide to spend their summer vacation in a beach house. Stifler's dad shows up through somewhere in the middle of the movie and from there, this movie turns into one of those old cheesy eighties loving romance movies about proving your manhood by getting laid, but falling in/out of love doing so.  It also shows the affects of a long distance relationship between two people in two countries and the trust  factor involved.It seems as though the script writer ran out of ideas a little more than halfway through and let a feminist finish it off; it seemed this like the ideas were running out once a trumpet was shoved in an anus. The high school is what ruined the movie.  I walked out of the theater at the point when that issue gets resolved.The acters look older and more uglier and the actresses look hotter and tastier.

Yes, call me crazy, I was one of those who thought it was going to be a rehash of Porky's, a great coming of age movie from years ago.  I was pleasantly surprised by the first one and found myself trying hard NOT to laugh.Just tonight, I caught a sneak preview screening of American Pie 2 in Washington, DC.  As a critic in the Washingtonpost once said ""It's a summer sequel ok!""  Truly this one had some laughs and once again I found myself in certain parts laughing hysterically.  BUT, there were an equal number of parts that I found myself trying TO laugh but instead feeling myself wishing the movie were over.So as not to spoil anyone elses fun about this plot, let me just say that I felt there was nothing new and refreshing about the sequel except for a few jokes.  The story takes place in the first summer after college and the characters learn to deal with life as they grow older.  While I enjoyed the movie nonetheless, this movie was really a continuation of the laughs we all enjoyed in the first American Pie.",American Pie 2

The follow-up, American Pie 2 seems hell-bent on destroying the good work of its predecessor.The first 15 minutes are particularly painful and it is almost as if the director has rounded everybody up again and just felt laughs would somehow 'shine through'. Unfortunately it doesn't quite work.In a smart move American Pie 1 superstar, Stifler is given much more to do here and with the help of Jason Biggs they bring to the screens nearly every laugh. The scenes involving all the other characters are particularly painful and hardly a chuckle do they conjure up. I really do not know what American Pie 2 was trying to be, whatever it was it failed dismally.Yes I had a few laughs, but I think I was trying way too hard.",American Pie 2
229,hazzers,History Repeats Itself (With A Cheesy Ending Tacked On),4,2 January 2002,"After American Pie, what's left in it for the sequel? As is often demonstrated by these films, they don't reckon with what happens when there's nothing left to build an actual sequel on. Still, didn't stop them with Carrie 2, Speed 2: Cruise Control, or Home Alone 3. The basis of American Pie 2 was much the same as the first. Only, this time, it was one year later, and they were 'college guys'. Did this make much of a difference? Not really. They were still trying to satisfy their sexual urges throughout the entire film. Why anyone thought this would be an interesting enough subject to make a film about in the first place is quite beyond me. Still, it's a year later - the boys and girls are coming home from college to have a reunion. Jim is still bad in bed, Kev is still lusting after Vicky, Oz is still with Heather, Stifler still believes himself to be God's gift, and Finch has taken an interest Japanese cultures in a vain attempt to impress Stifler's Mom. Nothing new here then.For me, the opening sequence says a lot about a film's content, and this one certainly said a lot. We have Jim in bed with some random blonde, coaxing him into some ""friendly goodbye sex"". It also happens to be the day that college is over for the summer. So commences the crosscutting between Jim's room and his parents. Already you can guess what's going to happen. Seeing as though it's so blatantly obvious, we may as well litter it with strikingly transparent clues as to what is going to happen in the rest of the film. Here we have Eugene Levy commenting on how he's prepared to give his 'son' the big ""you're a man"" speech. Oh, does this mean he's gonna do various things to embarrass his son throughout the entire movie? Probably. Does this also mean that he's going to catch him in further more compromising positions? Just like the last? I expect so. Anyway, let's cut to the chase. In steps Levy with a crate of beer, ready to give that ""big man"" speech he'd been talking about. Oh yeah, did I mention this is supposed to be a surprise too? No? Well, it is. But - oh no - disaster! ""Can't bring alcohol in the dorms."" That's okay - he's no match for Levy, ""I'm just here to surprise my son Jim. Maybe you could help me out?"" Wink. So, remarkably, Levy finds his way to Jim's room, and bursts in yelling, ""Where's my big guy?"" Groan. You'd have thought these media types would've realised that surprising people just never works. Probably why real people don't do it, then. Still, he dropped the beer for effect upon the site of his son naked, in bed with that aforementioned random blonde. Of course Jim's instant reaction is to jump out of bed and scream at his father to get out. Right. So in steps Mom shouting ""I made your favourite!"" She too then drops the pie she'd been cradling on the floor in horror. The pie. The apple pie. Nudge. Could it get much worse? Oh yes. In step the parents of the random blonde ready to surprise (this technique must be catching) their darling daughter. Although how they gathered she'd be in some random bloke's room is quite perplexing. Then Blondie sums it up for us all: ""Thanks Jim. What, do you not believe in locks?"" Yes Jim, don't you believe in locks? Is it not customary to lock the door where you come from? Or is it just not customary in cheap, tacky comedies where the old gags are, obviously, the best?As for the rest of the film, it didn't get much better. The opening sequence had already been littered with references to the previous. That didn't change throughout, either. In the next scene, in Jim's bedroom, the second shot was focussed on that infamous webcam from the first film. Then it changes to focus on a picture of Nadia. ""Who's Nadia?"" I hear you cry. That's okay, I wouldn't have known who she was either if I hadn't seen the first. Actually, I do think that was a major weakness of this film - it relied too much on people having seen the first. Although I think you could've guessed what went on, a great deal of it probably wouldn't have made a lot of sense. At least, if you hadn't seen the first film, you wouldn't have noticed all the boring recycled jokes.Although the film was largely based around Jim and his sexual problems, one thing baffled me about this film: why was Mena Suvari even in it? For the duration of the film I was waiting for her to do something; a twist in the tale - nothing happened. We saw a few brief scenes of her missing her beau, but that was about it. She deserved about as much credit for this film as Drew Barrymore did for Scream. Her appearance in the film couldn't have totalled more than about 10 minutes. A shame really, as her character, Heather, was one of the more bearable ones.I found a majority of the scenes in this film ridiculous, predictable, and wholly unfunny. The more memorable of these being mistaking urine for champagne, mistaking glue for a lubricant, and mistaking two heterosexual women for lesbians. Although you can hardly blame them for the latter - as it goes in all these films, women always undress together and do it in front of a window.I'll admit, one or two things did make me laugh in this film. But one or two just isn't enough.In short, I thought it was marginally better than the first (only marginally, mind). As with the first, I couldn't even begin to understand how anyone liked it. The storyline was awful, the characters were rubbish, and the jokes just weren't funny. I suppose the acting couldn't be faulted. However, none of the characters seemed all that intriguing or challenging roles for the actors.To conclude, I'll give it a four out of ten.",American Pie 2

Its my favorite from the american pie series by far, its just endless fun from start to finish, if you dig highschool flicks this is the movie for you. i recommend watching the first AP before this one though as you'll enjoy it a lot more since loads of the jokes refer to the stuff from the first. no oscar winning performances, mouth watering cgi or heart breaking scripts, AP2 is a great movie with a good cast, an ok storyline and some of the funniest stuff you'll ever see, have fun. 9/10PS.

While there was an extensive use of the same jokes as in the first movie, they seemed funnier this time. The first movie caused me to feel more embarrassed for the characters than anything else. This time though the situations were more cohesive and the story seemed a lot smoother. American Pie 2 was much more a movie than a series of vignettes like the first movie.

It's all about Jim wanting to be cool with girls and Stifler doing what he does best, i.e. making a complete fool of himself but all in good fun. Too bad we don't see much of Heather, I guess Mena Suvari wanted a break from this franchise, though her absence did highlight how mature her relationship with Oz is. The plot between Kevin and Vicki was so lame, you can ignore it without missing anything. The gags pretty much followed the same order as the first movie, i.e. Jim and his dad, then Stifler's party, then the broadcast goof (Internet in the first movie, CB radio in the second), then the guys deciding to throw a party to get girls, and finally everyone ends up happy in the arms of his (naked) girl. And in the end, it's all about Jim becoming a really believable and likeable character, not that he isn't already.",American Pie 2

238,andynicholas_uk,"More of the same, laugh out loud funny!",10,11 October 2001,"I didn't think that the original would possibly be topped, but here is a sequel that is genuinely on a par with its predecessor. The four protagonists from the original are back home after the first year at college to party for the summer. The first 20 minutes feels like a re-write of the original, embarrassing situation, followed by a party at Stiffler's. However, when the police drop by, they need a new place to party. So, with Stiffler in tow, the four rent a beach-house, painting by day, and partying hard at night. Or so their plan goes. Jim is still hopeless with girls. So when Nadia calls to say she will see him, he seeks out Michelle to help him out. Cue band camp sequences of total hillarity! Meanwhile, the others still pine after their loves from the previous film. In truth, there is not a universal plot, just a series of intertwining stories. This is by no means a bad thing, as it gives the film a good flow. Aside from that, it is incredibly funny. There are less 'memorable' scenes than in the first movie, but there are lots of gags inbetween these to keep you interested. The characters are as lovable as ever, the soundtrack is incredible, and there is plenty of scope for a third film. Some of the scenes wear a little thin, but this is a nit picking quibble. Go see this now unless you are easily offended, in which case go see it anyway!!! 10/10",American Pie 2
239,Maverick131,Good (not clean) fun!,8,18 January 2002,"I don't think it is necessary to have been born after 1976 to fully enjoy this movie, but it helps immensely.  The comedy is obviously geared toward the younger crowd.  Being a member of that crowd myself, I found this sequel to the original film from 2000 to be very entertaining.  This is a comedy, plain and simple.  Don't go looking for moralistic messages or any inspiration from this film - just enjoy it for what it is.  The creators of this film and films like it have two goals - the first being obviously to make absolutely as much profit as possible and the second being to make people laugh as much as possible.The film does have some pseudo-dramatic moments, but the actors and writers did a good job in keeping them to a minimum.  Few things detract from a film of this type more than an attempt by the creators to fuse drama with mindless comedy; you don't want to have mixed feelings about the film's message and intent - either make me laugh a little and cry a little (Sleepless in Seattle), make me cry a lot and laugh very little (Saving Private Ryan), or make me laugh a lot and not cry at all!That's what makes this film great, whatever dramatic elements may exist are quickly swept away in the very next scene by something ridiculous.  Good, not very clean, fun is what this movie is all about.  Comedies of this type have always been ridiculed as exploitive in one way or another.  In this film, I suppose some would argue that it exploits women.  Well, watch closely - what may appear to be an exploitation of women simply for the pleasure of men is actually a demonstration of the absolute power women have over men in most aspects of life.The majority, if not all of the scenes in this film portray young men in their quest for young (and in some cases, older) women, and how the girls have the power to make or break their often helpless and hapless pursuits. The film shows, as so many in this category have before, how the apparent dominators of society are actually dominated; what drives a young man more than a woman?  TWO women!My advice: watch this movie, but first, rent American Pie.  Watch them back to back and just enjoy yourself.  Critics generally scoff at movies like this because they don't require much work on the part of the creators (including the actors in most cases).  Intellectuals will turn their noses up to it and say `mindless garbage, too bad so much of the contemporary culture follows such rubbish!'  To them all I say: go rent an independent film you don't truly understand and pretend to completely relate to a painter from 1809 who commits suicide; meanwhile, the mindless lower layers of society will be laughing themselves silly and feeling pretty darn good about just being alive!",American Pie 2

I went and saw the movie downtown Seattle the night it opened at the Cineplex Odean at midnight...that was the best crowd I've ever seen a movie with.  I could usually tell what was coming, but I was still shocked when it actually happened.  I'm usually pretty conservative when it comes to movies, but the American Pie movies have been two of my favorite movies ever.  The second movie takes over at the end of the first year of college.  The first scene can be figured out by seeing the previews, but there were still a lot of surprises in the movies.There are a lot of great scenes at Stifler's party, and I was surprised to see that not only were the main characters back, but most of the supporting characters were back as well (remember the two guys from the M.I.L.F. scene?....they were in the second movie as well).

In fact, I think I enjoyed this one even more than the original.To me, the entire movie just felt smoother than the original, with less lulls.  The other comments I've read note that some felt it was a little long and that the plot just kind of clunked along, but I disagree.  Of course, I didn't really have too much time to mull over the intricacies of the film since I was laughing so hard the entire time.  At any rate, I found myself laughing more often, for longer periods of time than I have in quite some time, and any movie that can do that is ""A-Okay"" in my book.Go see it.

247,bocci666,"Not as good as the first, but still had its moments",6,13 August 2001,"Few movie sequels can equal the greatness of The Godfather or Indiana Jones.  Most sequels have unoriginal story lines and rehash the same plot, jokes, and/or characters from the first movie.  American Pie 2, unfortunately, is the norm and not a gem. Although American Pie 2 is not a bad movie and I still enjoyed it very much, I share the sentiment that many viewers of the first have:  This movie is not original by any means.  The problem with AP2 is that it fails to live up to the hype created by the first one.  AP2 lacks the spontaneity and shocking humorous lines and scenes that we were so accustomed to in the original.  After seeing the first one, its not so shocking to see Jim's dad walk in on his son while he's in bed with another girl, or when Jim superglues his hand to his private parts, or hearing most of Stifler's one-liners.  Although these scenes did make me and most of the audience laugh, it was not the same ""fall out of my chair"" humor that American Pie was able to bring. What made this movie better than mediocre in the end, is the larger presence of the flute-toting band geek, Michelle, played wonderfully once again by Alyson Hannigan.  Although she doesn't produce the memorable lines we will all remember from the first one: - the repetitive ""And this one time, at Band Camp..."" - the unexpected ""Say my name BI*&H!!"" she still delivers some of the best lines: - ""I get violent when I'm horny"" - ""One time at Band, oh wait, here..."" (when she is talking to Jim during Band Camp) Michelle's character is also developed more in-depth, which gives her more screen time.  Definitely a plus for all Michelle or Alyson Hannigan fans, like myself.  My rating for American Pie 2 is a 7/10, (I gave American Pie a 9/10).",American Pie 2

The tantric thing was funny the first time, but grew tiresome real fast.  Stiffler?  I found him funny-rude the first time, but just annoying-rude this time around.  Only Jason Biggs was funny, and that's because they gave him all the best lines/scenes. Oh, there was another guy in the movie, right?  Jeez...I guess he was completely forgettable.

A lot of people also think that its a horrible movie for your kids to be seeing, well then be a good parent and don't let you're kids see it.  I certainly would not let my six year old watch AP2!  It's just a movie, and don't think that your kids have never been through some of the things that the gang went through!  Everyone goes through some of the things that they have!Go see it, laugh your butt off, sit back and enjoy!  As a matter of fact I am going to see it again this weekend.",American Pie 2
251,phisher33,Not the first dull moment!!!,10,12 August 2001,"American Pie 2 defines the word comedy in itself.  The first movies humor was well surpassed in the much anticipated sequel.  I only wish all sequels could be as good as this one.  I was rolling on the floor the whole time I was at the movies, I could barely breath I was laughing so hard.  This is a must, GO SEE IT!!!",American Pie 2
252,tvleis,It sucked,4,13 August 2001,"Wasn't that funny. Stupid humor. Actors looked too old for their part. I wouldn't watch it again. It was like a bad soft porn. The first one was much better because everyone had a common goal, to get laid. They didn't have any motivation in this one. Get laid again? how boring.",American Pie 2
253,tb1000,better than the original in my opinion,7,11 August 2001,"American Pie 2 was just non-stop laughter until the end, when it was basically time to finish the story.  But there are numerous gags that were hilarious, that I won't divulge.  Stifler's role was seriously upped this time around, and Seann William Scott makes the best of it, as almost every line is funny as he works the player/asshole role perfectly.  Alyson Hannigan's role is also a lot bigger than before, trying to help Jim's sexual performance but actually becoming attached to him in the process. Jason Biggs' character is basically the same, but actually learns something about himself in the end of it all.  Tara Reid's and Mena Suvari's screen time is seriously cut down, compared to the first one.  Natasha Lyonne's character is back again with basically little to no screen time and once again is a nothing role pretty much; offers some obvious advice and isn't that funny at all.  Chris Klein is equally somewhat annoying as he was in the first one, but he has his bright spots.  Eugene Levy, once again, is really the gem in the movie, hitting each line and situation right on, as far as comedic timing and everything goes. Pretty funny throughout the entire movie, and once again tries to have a little heart towards the end.",American Pie 2
254,STAINLESS,"A fun summer movie, not to be taken seriously, BARELY more classy than scary movie 2.",8,11 August 2001,"American Pie: 2 is a lot like the first film in that it is very juvenile humor (nudity, sex jokes, dildos)and yet not all of the film is one big joke. The movie has it's serious moments involving Jason Biggs, and his decision on what constitutes the girl he desires, and also Thomas Ian Nicholas'(kevin) trying to cope with letting go of his first love.  The movie has some seriously funny moments as well, including a trombone playing simpleton named petey, and others that were spoiled by the previews, but hey, it's always that way. Overall, this is a movie to be taken lightly, and laughed at heartily, so go see it and try to enjoy it without disecting everything because, afterall, it IS only a summer comedy.",American Pie 2

256,Animerican004,The pie's better than ever!,8,29 August 2002,"I have to admit, I was a little nervous about seeing the sequel of a movie so well done in such a flat genre, that I almost didn't see it. I mean, could they really top the first pie? No, but they came pretty damn close! This movie is packed with laughs from the minute Jim's dad opens the door to Jim's dorm room and gets an unexpected surprise. Later Stifler gets a shower, and meets two lesbians (this is probably the funniest scene in either movie, and it shows why you should never use CB radio frequencies). The entire movie focuses on our five anti-heroes: The pie-loving Jim, The Vicki-desperate Kevin, the sweetheart-who-never-gets-some Oz, the Mom-boner Finch, and the horny-as-hell Stifler. In the movie, Jim sees Michelle again at...oh you know (wink wink) where he gets sex advice. Jim, and the audience all learn the importance of musical instruments here. And boy is it important! So see this one time in the theater, we all saw two lesbians and saw Jason and Seann do some stuff, and it was really cool, and we laughed, and we thought it was the funniest movie ever. Skip band camp this summer, the pie's where it's at.",American Pie 2
257,kelandwood,Do the ends justify the means?,9,22 March 2013,"Sequels tend to be weaker than the originals. Even if they are still good movies, they can never recapture the magic that was seen the first time around. That is with a few exceptions. American Pie 2 is one of them. Not only is it funnier than the original but it allows for much more characters development and drama. Kevin's story about not wanting things to change from the way they were is incredibly relatable and and touching, the love story is much sweeter than most of the awful romantic comedies these days and you end up feeling emotionally satisfied by the end. Is it a powerful film? Not at all but the light drama in American Pie 2 really does make it shine. As for the comedy itself, I think what makes it funnier is that we are more familiar with the characters and seeing new things happen to them is very entertaining. Jim's Dad especially has more charisma than he ever has. Overall American Pie 2 is the perfect way to make a gross- out comedy. It almost gets a 10/10 but it's not exactly anything clever or profound so that's why I brought the rating down a notch. If you enjoyed the first than you have to see this movie. If not than it's probably best to stay away.",American Pie 2

I mean scene after scene of non-stop laugh riot material. I enjoyed the first film, and I have seen, in some cases even suffered through the other films in the series. They are all pretty funny but nothing really compares to this one in my opinion.There are just so many hilarious parts to this movie, it's one of the few films I find myself coming back to again and again. Why? Laughter is good for the soul, so if you care about your soul on any level you owe it to yourself to watch this if you haven't already.As a side note this is probably the best date movie of all time as well.",American Pie 2

AP2 still has the same crude humor that was found in the first, but the characters were developed further than previously.

263,joshcurley,A true letdown; same jokes only this time: not funny,3,11 February 2002,"I can't believe this sequel is rated nearly as high as the original by imdb.com users (and well respected critics).  Where the original was fresh and often hilarious, this unfunny movie breaks no new ground and beats the ""been done"" jokes from the first into the ground.  Sure, you may THINK it's a funny movie because you'll be remembering the funny scenes from the first one, but in reality this movie just retreads the EXACT SAME JOKES in a stale and much less funny way (Finch and Stifler's mom; Jim's dad and dealing with Jim's embarrassing masturbatory fiasco; Stifler's obnoxiousness; the band camp geek).  All very funny characters and situations from the first movie but not funny this time around -- just stupid.  And, when the first one had an interesting point to it: the boys' pact to lose their virginity; this has no point other than to come up with a forced situation where the hijinx can continue.  Please see the first one again rather than waste your time with this pointless garbage.  I gave the first one 7 out of 10; this gets 3.",American Pie 2

265,ugett,"Almost as good as the original, but not quite",8,31 August 2001,"What American Pie 2 is lacking is the nuances and freshness of the first feature which at first appeared to be your standard teenage sex flick with the occasional joke.  The first American Pie went farther than most comedies out there but it was also  able to give us characters we can relate to and feel for while enjoying their escapades and following their journey.Although American Pie 2 is treading on rather familiar ground, it is still fresh although it was interesting to note the difficulty of getting the cast back together.  This is obvious in the cases of Shannon Elizabeth and Mena Suvari who seemed to have appeared for two days of shooting and look like they wanted to be somewhere else even in their limited scenes.  But it was refreshing to see Alyson Hannigan reprise her role as the band geek and once again providing the most memorable laughs in the film.    It is rare to enjoy a sequel almost as much as the original, but in this case, I was pleasantly surprised as finally a sequel has lived up to the hype of it's predecessors.Now all we have to do is forget Jurassic Park 3, Scary Movie 2, Mummy returns, and Doctor Dolittle 2.

269,AgentSmith2000,"When you mix teenagers with sex, it has to be funny!",9,13 August 2001,"While it was mostly panned by the critics, American Pie 2 proved to be an entertaining teen sex comedy. Fueled by the same dynamite cast that made the first film the hit that it was, the film in turn used many or similar jokes that were lauded in it's original. Somehow, the humor never runs dry. Basically, sex is always entertaining, and in the case of Jim and several others (Sherman especially) the pursuit of sex can be embarrassing but it all pays off in spades when you score with Nadia or the one that Jim loves (Michelle). The most exuberant performance definitely came from the energetic Seann William Scott. Stifler never gets old, and lucky for Finch, neither does his Mom.",American Pie 2

Cleverly, this sequel relies heavily on the running gags associated with each character from the earlier film, and uses the pre-built history to introduce even funnier, more embarrassing situations.The great thing about American Pie 2 is that it's laughing at itself. If you don't find yourself laughing with the movie's jokes, then you can be assured that you'll be laughing at some of the sheer corniness or stupidity of the scenes, so either way, you're enjoying yourself.Basically, don't put this on your movie blacklist.

I really can't understand what kind of a movie is it...just a flip, or does it have an ambition to become a cult film for teenagers all over the world? The script is terrible, cast, not so bad for this type of movie, but all dialogues and jokes are so boringly predictable. I can't say that I expected something of this movie, but it really gives a sad picture (and of what I seen, untrue) of the American youth. If you're 20, then everything has to be about sex, right?

In that respect, it relates to me. I just could not stop laughing through the movie. There were so many funny scenes. Of course the opening was funny when dim's dad caught dim in bed with another girl but now that's funny enough and it is so surprisingly funny when the parents of the other young lady walk in. Other scenes I found hilarious were when the two girls tried to get the guys to make sexual advances towards each other and when dim glued himself to himself and I also liked the hospital scene that resulted from dim's little glue problem. I was also impressed to see Eugene Levy in this movie because he is from Hamilton Ontario Canada as so am I.

283,uofa99,Truly disappointing...,4,30 August 2001,"...I'm trying to understand why AP2 is still #1 at the box office but...Let me begin by mentioning that I was one of the multitude of viewers who enjoyed the original American Pie.  As such, I was very much looking forward to seeing the sequel, American Pie 2.  I can't begin to tell you how incredibly disappointed I was upon exiting the theatre today.
In my humble opinion, the thing that set American Pie apart from the seemingly never-ending parade of gross-out films was the ability of the writers to establish character development within the context of a film of said genre.  In watching AP1, one couldn't help but get a little caught up in the voyage these four young men were embarking on -- the slow realization that sex is not the be all and end all of existence.  I will grant my detractors the fact that neither of these films was meant to stimulate the intellectual parts of the brain, however, it seems to me that in order to truly love a film, the audience must be able to identify with the characters.  There is very little opportunity in AP2 for the audience to do that, unfortunately.  The storyline involving Jim and his belle is interesting, if not predictable, but the all the rest is simply filler -- more opportunities to throw in more gross-out humour ad nauseum.As for the gross-out jokes, they are humourous, to be sure.  Eugene Levy is brilliant, as usual.  As for the rest of the cast, can any of them actually act (other than Alyson Hannigan)?  Granted, in a movie such as this great skill is not necessary, but I don't think it would be too much to ask for.
All-in-all, AP2 has its funny moments and is worth seeing, but don't make the mistake I made and see it in the theatre -- wait for the DVD!4/10",American Pie 2

This doesn't seem to be a new movie at all, but simply a run-on extension of the first movie.  The potential of the new setting is overcome by too many inside references that are hit again and again.  It seems as if the writers (who looked so promising before) just played off of the popularity hot spots in the first film, as previously minor characters such as Stifler's brother and Michelle from band camp return to beat their roles to death.  This movie had its moments, but for the most part it was predictable and a little too sentimental for a raunchy teen flick.  I guess sequels are never really as good.",American Pie 2

291,bottlerocket99,Return to teen classics,8,21 August 2001,"Being a year shy of being able to officially be called a ""thirty-something"" I feel that original American Pie, and the sequel have managed to tap into a beloved movie market that has otherwise been dead and buried since the mid to late 1980's: the teen classic.As a teen in the mid-80's my generation (does that term now classify my as ""old""?) was treated to the best of the best in teen films with the fabled John Hughes trilogy - Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, and Pretty in Pink (not to mention Weird Science and Ferris Bueller's Day Off). These movies have not only become classics, but integral parts of the overall 80's lexicon. I feel that American Pie and American Pie 2 have signaled a triumphant return to this market.What I consider the true brilliance of these movies is the almost undetectable blend of silliness and quick wit. Unlike what I would call ""idiot humour"" (see Scary Movie, any Saturday Night Live spinoff), the American Pie movies keep the movie goers entertained with amazing dialogue, excellent character development (kudos to the casting crew for getting the entire original cast back), and the element of teen fantasy.This is the kind of movie that anyone from 15-35+ can identify with and ultimately adore.

295,badyfird,A new way to see what is in college,7,4 August 2020,"I liked this movie and got a bunch of laughs out of it. I couldn't say it was as good as the original, most sequels aren't. This movie is basically several funny skits all thrown together. And some of the jokes are just repeats from the original student life, but others are new. It works.But, why did they even study the girls back from the original except for Michelle. Vicky, Nadia, Heather, Jessica added nothing to learn something new. Each one of them only had a couple of lines as we learn it in school. No special things. The scholars are what makes it work. Jim and Stifler are the funniest of them all. And Jim's dad is awesome.FINAL VERDICT: It's funny. It's raunchy. To get and learn more it can work as it definitely helps you to get more knowledge about not ideal adult and college life.",American Pie 2
296,Chris626-1,Pretty good flick alot like the first one.,8,12 August 2001,"This was a pretty good film. I was expecting it to be a real terrible sequel but it was rather funny. It was definitly better than the first one . Even though you couldn't picture the ending. ( I leave that up to you ) Overall it was full of laughs , I would defintly see it again..",American Pie 2
297,Bob Klein,The recipe pulls through again.,10,11 August 2001,"When I first saw AMERICAN PIE, I was shocked. I completely thought it'd be another goofy teen flick with everything spoiled in the trailers. I was wrong. Just like with the first, I was wrong about AMERICAN PIE 2.Nowadays, trailers usually spoil everything funny about the movie, and most sequels are falling apart. This movie definately held strong. It didn't have quite the same feeling as the first, but the characters reminded you of everything Pie.The strongpoint of this movie is definately SEANN WILLIAM SCOTT. He pulled this movie with his halarious antics, and made me enjoy the movie ALOT more than I would before.Bottom Line: If you liked the first, you'll love this one. Memories will take over your mind. Halarious movie.4 of 5 stars",American Pie 2
298,blindfoldedstd,Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan shine...,7,11 August 2001,"Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan steal the movie. Their interaction carried the movie. They are surrounded by mostly one dimensional charachters. Very little Chris Klein or Mena Suvari. Overall it was entertaining, some very funny one liners and situations, but I still loathe Stifler.",American Pie 2
299,dmbsol,One man alone makes this movie a 10... Stifler,10,12 August 2001,"First off, I was skeptical about this movie for two reasons.  The first being that it is a sequel, and by that I thought the directors were going to make too many retarded references to the first American Pie.  But James Rogers did a great job on staying focused on making us laugh a new better joke than AP 1.  Second, I though the press was going to blow this movie. Too many punch lines being revealed in the commercials is my number one pet-peeve, but once again there were many more opportunities to laugh my ass off in AP 2.  Plus Seann Scott is the shit once again.  S***ing out the eight bucks just to stifler for an hour is worth it.",American Pie 2
300,saulman04,Great flik,10,12 August 2001,This is one funny movie.  It was even better then the first one.  I laughed from start to finish.  Saw it twice in 2 days.  Stifler made the movie.  He was so funny with the lezb's and the p**s shower.  I highly recommend everyone see this movie,American Pie 2
301,randmcguire,Funniest Movie in Years,10,12 August 2001,"I just saw this movie on the first day it was released.  I really liked the first one, and so I decided to go ahead and give the dreaded sequel a chance.  Boy am I glad I did!  Great movie!  It is so much better than the second.  Anyway, if your debating on whether to go or not than don't.  You don't want to miss this.  Warning!  if you have any health problems than you better skip this one, because you will be laughing so hard you won't be able to breathe!",American Pie 2
302,emkixass,A hilarious way to revisit the old cast from AP 1,8,12 August 2001,"American Pie 2 is a great way to revisit the old cast that we loved in American Pie 1. It's a nostalgic experience as well as a new and funny movie. However, if you haven't seen American Pie 1, the movie will make absolutely no sense and will seem really stupid. I recommend seeing the first movie right before so you can remember all of the jokes that are used again in American Pie 2.Not that it's all about the first movie. The same actors who were great in the first one (Jason Biggs as the nice-guy Jim, Allyson Hannigan as band geek Michelle, and of course Stifler!) are even better. However, Tara Reid (Vicky) and the guy who plays Kevin are both terrible in this one and (in my opinion) the first one.The movie is full of great laughs, old and new, so I definitely recommend it, but only if you rent American Pie 1 first!",American Pie 2
303,cyber1,damm the professional critics,10,13 August 2001,"Many of the reviews I have read in the papers have said this movie is a lousy movie.  All I have to say for those critics is ""you need to get laid"" and ""your fired!""This movie is funny as anything out there, and I enjoy a lot of comedies. Much of its humor is sophmoric, but even sophmoric humor has it's place. One thing I did like very much is that I did not get the feeling that this movie was ""corny"" like the naked gun or airplane series.American Pie 2 makes it into my top 10 movies of all time, displacing Spaceballs out of the comedy slot!",American Pie 2
304,logger64-1,Almost rolling on the floor!!!,10,18 August 2001,"I was a major fan of the first one. I watched it constantly and still didn't get bored of it. So when I heard that the sequel was going to be made I was so! excited. I finally was able to go see it on my day off and I had so! much anticipation for this movie. And I must say it was better than I thought it would be. I have never laughed sooo hard for a movie before. The jokes were just all out hilarious. And there was a great turn out of other viewers and that made the funny parts even better...I totally recommend this movie if your feeling really stressed and need a couple laughs or for this movie a bunch of laughs, cuz you'll be leaving with a smile on your face from the comedy fest this movie is....",American Pie 2
305,chewie604087,Mike's Review,8,20 August 2001,"Wow, this was actually a good movie. I was expecting to hate this movie i really did not expect to like it. It was extremely funny and entertaining. I never saw the original for the same reasons I didn't wanna see this one but now I wanna see it. Definetly not recommended for squeamish viewers. Some frontal nudity. The underlying love story was cool too. Definetly a must see.",American Pie 2
306,x THE STIFFMEISTER x,BRILLIANT !,10,29 August 2001,"Absolutely brilliant,when i saw this movie it was non-stop laughter all the way through,every side splitting scene led to another.Also all the original cast are back for a second helping e.g.Jim,Oz,Kevin,Finch,Stifler,Victoria,Michelle and Heather also Nadia makes a comeback.You will also recognize a hole host of characters from the first American pie. Usually sequels dont hold up as good as the first movie,but this is different,if you saw the original you have to see this ! The movie takes place one year after college and summer is just up ahead...fun,parties,booze and sex. This summer it's about sticking together !",American Pie 2
307,cbsmall3,Better than the original!,10,3 September 2001,"I must admit that I did not see the original in the theater because it seemed like just another teen flick. When I later saw it on video, I regretted not seeing it when it came out. I made sure that I did not make the same mistake twice...and was greatly rewarded! Granted, if you are familiar with the original, the style of humor is what you'd expect but even given that, AMERICAN PIE 2 still managed to push the boundaries of off-the-wall humor-and almost broke them! There was only one plot development I did not like (and even one audience I was in booed when it happened) but for purposes of suspense I will let you make your own judgement when you see it. Overall, I have to say that I laughed all the way through everytime I've seen it. You can be sure this will end up in my DVD collection!",American Pie 2
308,secretgarden,the tantra book Finch is studying all summer,8,4 September 2001,"I went to see AP2 because I heard my book THE ESSENTIAL TANTRA appears several times in the movie.In several scenes at the summer cabin you see Finch studying and carrying a large book with a black cover. That book is by me, Kenneth Ray Stubbs, Ph.D. I never saw the title clearly, and it does not seem to be referenced anywhere.I thought others might be interested in knowing that that truly is an instructional book about tantric techniques and philosophy, written especially for people living in the modern world. The book was published last year and is available at Amazon.com.In tantric philosophy, there are no sacred cows. AP2 truly pokes fun at many sacred cows. I laughed so hard I had tears.Also, one scene shows the book lying open. That is at the tantric massage section. I have produced a video on this topic, entitled TANTRIC MASSAGE VIDEO and available at Amazon.com.",American Pie 2
309,thatymm,Surprise!,10,25 December 2001,"Just wonderful! I have no words to express how much I love this movie! Is it better than the first one? I don't know. What I know is that it is as funny as the first! To tell the truth, I went to the cinema with no expectation at all 'cause normally the continuations of movies are not as good as the first ones. ""American pie 2"" has surprised me!",American Pie 2
310,fireman11016,this movie rocks!!!,10,2 February 2002,this is the new best teen movie of all time!!!! the only other one that ever even came close was the Breakfast club.  i dont care what anybody says it was a true fun realistic and funny movie.                             p.s. stifler rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,American Pie 2
311,pointy_badgers99,Funny,10,19 March 2002,For me this sequel is up there with Aliens and Terminator 2 as far as out-doing their originals go. It was funnier and more entertaining than the first with Stifler stealing the show!,American Pie 2
312,valoneti,"What happened after, not what happened next...",5,14 April 2002,"It was always going to be almost impossible to make the second as big as the first, for one; the novelty was gone. The film was more of a what happened after, not what happened next. By this, I mean that there is not an event which or a goal in the second, unless if you call what the trailers are advertising(Nadia's coming) a plot. The movie is showing each character adjusting and who they're with. I am not discouraging you from watching it, but just don't buy it.",American Pie 2
313,abtalark,Great Sequel,10,25 March 2002,This movie is a riot and I believe much better than the first (which was awesome).The humor is slap stick but very well written and enjoyable to watch over and over..,American Pie 2
314,LkDrry,This film if full of laughs from start to finish,10,8 March 2003,"This is a great film full of laughs.  I found that this film didn't have much of a story line, but this is why i thought the film worked so well. It is just about a group of friends who go on a summer break and is just full of laughs. This film is well written, well acted and is something you could imagine happening real life. I recommend this film to anyone who likes having a good laugh.",American Pie 2
315,honeyfacechristina,I'm in love w/ Seann William Scott,10,12 December 2005,"This movie was absolutely positively totally hilarious , funny , HOT and one of the best movies I've ever seen in my entire life !!!! Seann William Scott is so hot funny and a great actor over all !!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think that this is one of his best movies ( except for the one he did w/ the Rock and the one he did w/ Jonny Knoxville ). He's one of my personal favorites. He never lets me down when it comes to a comedy . That's why whenever there's a movie coming out that he's in at all,even w/ the smallest bit part,I go see it b/c I know he's gonna deliver . He never lets me down when it comes to comedy (and being hot!) But I especially love him in the American Pie movies because he's so funny , hot and HORNY and so 'm I !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",American Pie 2
