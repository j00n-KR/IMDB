0,MartinHafer,You'll enjoy it...until you start to realize the serious shortcomings in the script and characters.,5,3 November 2019,"""Paradise Hills"" is a visually arresting film with a great basic plot...that, unfortunately, pretty much falls to pieces by the time the story ends. Sad...as the film initially hooked me and it had the potential for greatness.Uma's family wants her to marry a man she hates. The marriage will save the bankrupt family...and they are essentially willing to sell Uma to save their fortunes. How do they arrange to have her agree to marry this man who she feels is responsible for her father's death? Well, it all begins with Uma awakening on a strange otherworldly island where lots of uncooperative rich girls have been sent ostensibly for reprogramming.The notion of 'bad girls' being drugged or mind-altered to make them 'nice' really caught my attention and I loved the film....at least for a while. However, towards the end, the story became sloppy and insane. Insane? Yes, the island turns out to be run by some sort of weird creature. Huh?! Was this necessary? No...in fact it was pretty dumb and annoyed me to death. It's a shame, as up until this goofy ending, it was great....and PARTS of the ending were also great. But the monster bit....UGGH!!! It was as if you were watching ""Gone With the Wind"" and in the end Rhett Butler boarded a UFO and left planet Earth!!In addition. the amazing sets and costumes, while initially arresting and amazing, simply DON'T make any sense once you learn the fates of the girls on the island. Imagine spending many many millions to make a cool looking island...only to kill them by the end of their stay. Why are these props even necessary?? I especially say this about the bizarro carousel horse...which you simply must see to believe. All style...but no substance.Now these are NOT the only problems with the film. My daughter watched the movie with me and she really, really hated it. When she explained why, I was also pretty made. After all, the story is about four girls. The bisexual (or perhaps gay) character, the fat girl and the Asian girl were all killed by the end...and only the super-skinny white straight girl survived. What sort of message is this telling kids who see the film?! You'd think they would have avoided these cheap bits of formula...but they didn't.",Paradise Hills
1,SnoopyStyle,fine premise loses ending,6,23 October 2020,"In a future world, Uma (Emma Roberts) has been sent to Paradise Hills, a finishing school for the girls of society's elite families. Uma is refusing to give up her inferior boyfriend for an arranged marriage. It's an island retreat run by The Duchess (Milla Jovovich). The other girls include overweight Chloe (Danielle Macdonald), allergic Yu (Awkwafina), and singing star Amarna (Eiza González). Being imprisoned on an island gilded cage is not the end of the horror.The general premise is fine but the intensity is never raised to a higher level. It reaches the first level of story telling and doesn't go further. There are two conflicting reveals at the end. One is a sci-fi ending and the other is a supernatural fantasy ending. They don't mix well together. This reminds me of an earlier 70's big idea sci-fi movie but it fails to grasp a big emotional payoff.",Paradise Hills
2,nogodnomasters,I am me,7,25 December 2019,"The film takes place in a futuristic two-tier society and mentions ""Brave New World."" Uma (Emma Roberts) doesn't want to marry a rich man and is sent to the island of Paradise Hills to be reprogrammed into loving him. She makes friends with other girls who are there for various reprogramming. The island is run by Milla Jovovich who is kind and cruel. The island contains a dark secret which is the fun at the end of the feature.I liked the characters and the opening clip lets you know Uma marries the rich guy.Guide: F-word. Brief implied sex. No nudity",Paradise Hills
3,kosmasp,Smells like Teen-vana,6,4 December 2019,"There's no such thing as Teen-vana of course, I just made this up to come close to the song title or rather the group singing it. Now there is quite the interesting story hidden here. It does get a bit soften up to reach a wider audience. At least that's the feeling you get, including romance and other relationships. Though to its credit it is more powerful to that.But even that can be seen as a cliche overall. Whatever your point of view is, there is a Brazil and other Science Fiction themed movies here. And there is violence to a degree, but it could be more explicit in its depiction. Still the acting is decent and the story alone really holds itself.",Paradise Hills
4,Sleepin_Dragon,Trash.,3,2 April 2020,"When you wake up in Paradise, but all is not as it seems, do you go along with the artificial status quo, or fight back?If I were a very young teen, I may just about enjoy bits of it, but alas not, on a positive note it looks sublime, terrific sets, costumes, it is a visual feast, they could have had something here, alas not.Sadly the message didn't land, the film got too caught up in its own cleverness, the acting talent was wasted, even experienced performers seemed to have difficulty breathing any life into some of the characters.I was reminded a tiny bit of A cure for Wellness, but this wasn't a patch on that, it needed some subtlety, and at least a bit of balance.Was there a single positive Male character here? No, how much better to have had Milla Jovovich's character as a man, then you'd have had all men bad, all women good.This was awful 3/10.",Paradise Hills
5,westsideschl,Poorly Written & Implemented Script,2,8 March 2020,"This script was just all over the place w/lots of borrowed from other movies ideas just tossed together in an incoherent messy mishmash.
1. We've got some ballroom scene w/singing on some island in the middle of the ocean (supposedly). Added nothing to the story.
2. Was presented that escape from this island in a small open rowboat in open ocean (no experience/strength in rowing) was possible.
3. You have a vast heavily populated odd group of overseers running the island. Done before in movies. Who paid for it all, who built, who feeds?
4. You have some very poorly & cheaply presented genetic/medical/surgical subplot of surrogate creation. Done before.
5. You have some unknown plant woman capturing some unknown essence of people. Done before. Gawd!
6. Usual romance hook. Poor acting. Jump around editing; lots of plot explanation holes.",Paradise Hills
6,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,6,13 September 2019,"Paradise Hills was a better fantasy that I was expecting. They handled the fantasy dystopian elements perfectly and the visuals were stanning. However, the story was predictable and that ruined most of the fun. Still, the performances were quite good.",Paradise Hills
7,Tweetienator,Wasted Talent,5,13 September 2019,"Nice and interesting looks/visuals meet slow plot and a too obvious/blunt metaphor to our modern society (or the critic of) - some of the twists are rather flat (the resolution) or the nature of the Dutchess (how does that make any sense) is out of place. The more you watch the inflation of movies one realizes that writing a good book or script is an art of its own that not many really master. That's in my opinion the weak spot of most movie productions in recent years - the script/story. Anyway, like said, Paradise Hills got nice visuals, a pro production and good acting but lacks heavily any quality regarding the story told. Also I must say (just an example), the rather ""well build"" girl did - despise the rigorose diet in Paradise Hills - not lose one pound of weight in the movie, but that's the difference a dedicated actor makes - sometimes you gotta do more than just talk and act to fit into or fill a role. To sum it up: mediocre, okay if you wanna some balm for your eyes. Paradise Hills reminds me a lot of The Dead Don't Die - both movies are rather a waste of talent and means and a missed opportunity to make something good and memorable.",Paradise Hills
8,jtindahouse,"Dull, slow moving and poorly structured",5,24 February 2020,"The art of beginning your film with a scene from later on in your movie is a tricky one. The best way to do it is the way films like 'The Hangover' and 'The Gentlemen' did it, where you have no context for the scene and it naturally reveals itself later on. 'Paradise Hills' fell into a trap in this respect. It had a nice little secret up its sleeve that it wanted to be smart and give the audience a sneak-peak at it early, but in doing so it implies something else that kind of ruins the enjoyment of the movie. It falsely gives away the movie, but because we don't know that, it just destroys our interest in the movie because we feel like we know where we are headed. The film was too smart for its own good in that respect.The biggest crime this film commits though is just how boring it is. For a decent cast the characters somehow manage to come across extremely bland. The dialogue is just so safe and by the book. So by the time the third act rolls around and things actually start to happen its hard to care, because everyone is so unlikeable.The third act is a breathe of fresh air though. The film finally advances forward after stagnating for over an hour and the way the ending was done was actually mildly clever. The damage is already done though sadly and I have to put this down as a very forgettable experience that I couldn't recommend.",Paradise Hills
9,kwenchow,"Another worst film of the year! Too slow, not intense and too many overuse scene! Not recommended!",1,28 November 2019,"This film start with a girl ""Uma"" singing at her marriage ceremony, her husband copulate with her on a bed, and flashback of two months earlier scene! As turnout, this film is about a therapy center lead by ""The Duchess"" by name is to cure a bunch of rebel girls, but instead she have a plan to clone them and eliminate them! Entire film quite many overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the pass out scene, overuse of conversation while dining scene, overuse of riding on a artificial horse scene! Bored to death! The singing scene in the film also quite annoying! Barely intense scene is, Uma and Chloe saving Yu from a treatment lab! This scene have some choking and stabbing scene! At the end, Uma and her clone self defeat The Duchess and The Duchess turn into a plant! Uma and her clone self setup a plan to kill her husband! That's it! Another boring film! Wasting time to watch!",Paradise Hills
10,ks-60500,Best dress or effect in Oscar ?,7,31 October 2019,It's outstanding for the visual effect and dress in the movie. Story itself is not boring and ending is good.,Paradise Hills
11,Kamurai25,"""Family is What You Make of It""",7,20 November 2020,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.This is (almost) a spiritual successor to ""The Island"", and in most respects is about as good. There are certain aspects that under cut the aspects that make it good, but I can't mention them without ruining the movie before you watch it.The oddest bit (not said lightly) is honestly the mix of the cast. Milla Jojovich and Emma Roberts are proven entities that could carry a movie (fairly easily), but then there are also Danielle Macdonald (""Birdbox"") and Awkwafina (""Jumanji: The Next Level"") neither of which give a good performance or do I consider quality actors.I'm not sure higher quality actors would serve the movie any better. Any real problems are in the script itself. The movie has a ridiculously high production value as it is intended to represent the overly wealthy.There is a great little mystery / survival story here, but I'm not sure it will endure through multiple watches.",Paradise Hills
12,Sergiodave,Not as clever as it thinks,4,17 August 2021,"Watched this on Netflix not having read review or plot. In a nutshell a young adult dystopian Sci-fi movie reminiscent of Stepford Wives without the intelligence, acting, script or direction.",Paradise Hills
13,muamba_eats_toast,Frustrating,6,24 April 2020,This is one of the most frustratingly ambitious films I've seen in a while yet ultimately I was left with a sense of being underwhelmed. Visually the film was beautiful the cast was magnificent but it just didn't quite work. One main problem was despite the quality of the case the story on a whole was quite weak and their was little if it all in tens of character development/arc. I gave it a 6/10 because in terms of the general idea and visually it had a lot going for it and the ending was better than I though it would be for most of the film. Despite this there are still a number of flaws in the movie and while I enjoyed it to an extent the frustration of thinking what could have been is the feeling that sticks with me.,Paradise Hills
14,saptesh786,How to groom a bride !,5,30 April 2020,"Story of a bride to be married to an unwanted man, but her mother takes her in a paradise type treatment centre where various brides also are grooming. But real thing is different and to write here it could be not fair with movie plot. However 3 part of movie has nothing happened. No ups and downs till then, only climax is interesting and end is remarkable. You never guess for such end. That is only plus point of the movie, otherwise it looks wasted and boring. Emma did good acting in her curious bride's role, whereas Milla Jovovich seems wasted. She should have more footage. Eiza also in different role instead of her bad ass roles in many action movies. Overall not much for recommendation",Paradise Hills
15,jrarichards,"Most of what you can say is that ""it looks good"" and establishes a vaguely interesting dystopia",6,19 December 2019,"Since Director Alice Waddington (not as ""Anglo"" as she sounds) works on the premise of an exclusive future finishing school at the titular ""Paradise Hills"", you'd early on be a bit surprised to find that it's actually located on an offshore island with not too many hills in sight (presumably the title ""Paradise Island"" had already been taken too many times!!)And that would be just the first of a number of incongruities, of which at least 25 are associated with the pretty basic question of ""what on Earth is this?"", or even more precisely ""who is supposed to watch this?""While the film rarely ceases to be stunning visually (i.e. botanically, architecturally, clothes-wise and so on), even for example building on those paintings of ""impossible structures"", it starts as it DOES NOT mean to go on, with a rather scarily made-up bride singing a slightly-naughty song, then told not to keep her new husband in the bedchamber waiting, and hearing from the latter in the marital bed that she is now far more pleasingly compliant than she used to be.Now, leaving aside the dubious moral nature of such a scenario, it has to be suggested that this is a film setting itself up as erotic or even kinky in some sense, and the finishing school with pretty presentable females wandering around in white leather (or plastic?) dresses hardly moves away from that contention. And since Eiza Gonzalez's lovely Armana rather early on starts giving some very ""meaningful"" glances at Emma Roberts's pretty-cute Uma, this just further turns the screw, as it were.Yet, despite fully (at times gratuitously) adult language and an actually quite scary dystopian scenario (ostensibly involving brainwashing, for example), the movie is pretty much as straight-laced in erotic terms as the dresses those school attendees are wearing, with the whole thing ""peaking"" with a single on-the-lips kiss between the stars, as well as just a hint of male-female ""activity"" between Uma and her pseudo-beau (real love of her life), who actually turns out to be a traitor (hence his having a British accent, of course).This is then just one of the ways in which the film lacks the courage of its convictions, and this is further shown in the failure to fully expose and put in clear terms what is actually taking place under the control of the evil ""Duchess"" played adequately well though as pastiche by Milla Jovovich. The latter's comeuppance takes us from sci fi into pure fairy tale, and again this is as impressive visually (albeit in a very plastic kind of way) as it is strange in terms of the need to at least vaguely associate this film with a genre ... and a more closely-defined audience.Presumably in sum this is a teen or young-adult film, if it is anything at all; but it falls hopelessly between stools and - relying on what it probably feels is a rather sophisticated ""impressionism"" - rather tragically fails to fully present the (actually somewhat interesting) dystopian society and policy it purports to be offering.",Paradise Hills
16,silvermistvio,I didn't expect to be good. But it turned out great.,8,13 September 2019,"Paradise Hills is a kind of film that is very different from the other films. It's packed with mysteries, doubts, friendships, fake relationships and lesbian love. The plot is simple but it's so interesting and very exciting to watch. I must admit that the film started with boring things, but it gets heat up at the nearly end. So, it's a kind of cool film.There's only one thing that I don't like. It's that they only let one to survive. I kind of like Amarna. If she could survive too, it'd be better. And about the final scene, I don't really get it. Uma wants to find Amarna. But isn't she already dead? I mean if only they made sure that she was dead, they would have released the substitute into her surroundings. We all saw on TV that she's back to where she was before, so, the real Amarna is already dead. If so, how could Uma find her? That's really confused me. And also that girl died in the vines who Uma was staring at. I don't really recognise who she was. So, yeah, I don't get why Uma was staring at her.The reason why I watched this film is because Milla. I really like her and her performance is great in this film. The other actors' and actresses' performances are also good too. Because of their great performances, this film becomes a very good film to enjoy.I hate to write long reviews, so, I'm going to conclude now. So, as for conclusion, the plot is kind of simple, but it can give so much excitement and hence, I really liked to watch this film. Although it really went quietly, I mean there's no action or something like that, but the plot is really different from the others and thus, it's totally a great film and I could finish it even when I'm half sleepy. It was worth to spend time with and I've fully enjoyed.",Paradise Hills
17,Snootz,Well-executed movie with some issues but a decent story,7,21 November 2019,"The story has been semi-done before, but that is nothing unusual with movies. The issue is: how well is the story done?In this case I would say very well. The sets and scenery are superb. The characters are decently fleshed out and the acting excellent. Directing is spot-on as is the script, which is always the essential foundation of the film.The reason I give it 7 stars rather than 10 is two fold, both of them conceptual:1) The question is (without spoilers), WHY would this situation occur in the first place? There is no logical reason that this extreme a step would be taken when much less drastic options are available.2) There is a scene near the end that is out-of-sync with the entire movie, jumping from pure sci-fi to inexplicable fantasy. While interesting in presentation, it makes no sense, is not explained, has a rather hokey resolve.Other than that the movie is well-done in every way, from the cinematography to the soundtrack. Decently executed movie with enough of a twist ending to make it worth the watch.",Paradise Hills

19,bshaef,Why do They Insist on Making Crap Like this.,4,19 May 2020,"No story, no acting, no nothing but boredom, sheer utter boredom. Showtime struck out on this and I predict it may or may not have a full season. I'm not sure what audience they are playing to, but I'm not part if it. Showtime gets a big fat F in my books. Good thing they have Billionaire on. It helps some to make up for this claptrap.",Paradise Hills
20,jmbovan-47-160173,Mishmash of old ideas in paeudomodern setting,6,31 August 2020,"Comparisons abound with other films and books doing it much better than this. Even so, there is a certain charm to the struggle of oppression that is overcome by fidelity. The visuals are captivating, and while sometimes they can be heavy handed (i.e. the bondage elements in the costumes), the overall approach makes it a visual feast. No new ideas here and with a slight uptick in the feminist elements. Still, enjoyable overall, just not as great as it seemed they were trying to be.",Paradise Hills
21,trinaboice,Not as good as it thinks it is,3,3 September 2019,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This Sci-fi horror/thriller is Allice Waddington's directorial debut. The film debuted at this year's Sundance Film Festival and quickly afterward, Samuel Goldwyn Films acquired the distribution rights. Unfortunately, it's not as good as it thinks it is.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Some crude language and 1 F-bomb.
Some violenceTHINGS I LIKED:
I'm a sucker for Milla Jovovich.
I've been seeing Emma Roberts all over the place lately. Good for her. She sings in the movie too. A-lister Julia Roberts must be one proud auntie.
The young cast includes Danielle MacDonald, Awkwafina, Jeremy Irvine, and Eliza Gonzalez.
Fun and creative costume design.
The fantastical set designs were intriguing.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The sound kind of drove me nuts.
Some of the acting wasn't very good. I've seen many of the actors do much better in other movies, so I was disappointed. It had everything to do with the poor script.
I feel terrible saying this, but I was bored.
Some of the scenes take place in dim moonlight, so it'll be hard to see what's going on if you watch this on a small device once the film goes to streaming or DVD.
It takes itself way too seriously.
Many things are totally random and just don't make any sense at all. If they're symbolic, then I totally missed it. Everything just seemed really dumb and self-indulgent to me.

22,namstonk,Nicely shot but pompous,2,15 September 2019,"Very much like a perfume advert, crossed with a fairy tale, but wholly unoriginal nor well acted. As if a bunch of happy clappers have got together to say how bad men are and how amazing women are. The actors are normally on point but the director, well too much possibly. Dont fall for the high score, it's employees giving the ratings. The end is appalingly bad, like a scene from the Simpson's or Family Guy. Nod, nod",Paradise Hills
23,jwscott-home,Eiza Gonzalez,6,8 February 2021,"Having seen her in several other movies I think we're seeing a superstar in the making. She's still very young yet has a ton of shows and movies to her credit. Having such poise and flexibility in the roles she's played shows her potential. And yes this will probably be considered sexist but men are men and I can't help but think she may be the most beautiful lady ever on screen, she's a goddess star in the making. Right up there with Penelope Cruz and a few other sinfully gorgeous women. But she has such mature screen presence and at such a young age is surely only going to get better. I thought at first having seen her on Baby Driver she was just another beautiful face but I assumed she was in her late 20s given her confidence and presence... she's definitely has a full chance at super stardom ahead of her if she chooses her roles carefully. With her beauty and that poise, she can carry a movie all by herself. Let's hope we see a lot more of her.. no pun intended...",Paradise Hills
24,januszlvii,I Hated Every Second Of This Movie,1,17 May 2020,"Maybe I am not artsy or female so I did not get the logic behind Paradise Hills, but I hated every second of this picture with a passion, it should have been called Nightmare Hell instead of Paradise Hills. The only reasons why I put it on was to look at Elsa González ( Ana), and because I am a big Milla Jovovich ( The Duchess) fan.) this along with Stone are the only pictures of hers I disliked ). What did I like about the movie? Nothing. It was a bad fairytale: Alice In Wonderland meets The Stepford Wives. Spoilers ahead: The concept ( if you can call it that) is poor girls are made up to look like other women, and the originals are killed off ( Elsa González being made to look like Emma Roberts ( but Roberts does survive)). Milla was especially bad: Not only the worst vampire I ever saw, but the most unrealistic in more then one way ( that includes her demise). How bad was it? It actually made me angry that I saw it. Finally it goes without saying that it surpassed Machete as my most hated movie. I give it one star because the zero star option is not offered under IMDB

I thought I was going to be watching the emergence of a great surrealist director... but then the story starts and it's very pedestrian. It's really the same as any number of ""rebel girl in the creepy boarding school;institution"" movies out there.It's really disappointing because the director, Alice Waddinton, creates a totally believable and stylized world. There are a number really great sequences and the film is peppered with incredible cinematic ideas. However, the plot seems like a spec script that was written to prove she could deliver a mainstream thriller. This is an artist who obviously has her own voice.

31,Stoshie,All That Was Missing Was Katniss,5,4 September 2021,"The other reviewers here pretty well nailed the problems with this movie, but I'll add a couple my own observations.Paying homage to other movies or styles is fine, but this movie is nothing but homages. There needs to be some originality mixed in, or a film falls flat, as this one does. Quentin Tarantino is famous for showing respect for other films and styles in his movies, but he adds his own flavor to his work, so the homages are evident but also not the only aspect to his films. That works; in this film those homages do not.Part of the reason for that is the number of films and styles paid tribute to here. There are too many, creating a confusing mixture, with no single theme binding everything together. An example of that would be the final resolution with the character The Duchess. What happens is inconsistent with the world of the rest of the film, seemingly thrown in just to pay homage to another famous film (I won't say more because I don't like putting spoilers in my reviews).The script is also a problem. We've seen the dystopian, ruling class vs underclass thing many times in other films. To stand out, there would have to be something new and original added to the genre. There was not.Finally, the ending was telegraphed. Once the ""twist"" was revealed, it was obvious what was going to happen at the end. That took away any suspense or surprise that I would imagine the filmmakers wanted to give audiences.So why did I give the movie 5 stars, which is higher than other people did, in spite of my harsh review? The set designs were somewhat interesting, and the flaws in the movie, while evident throughout, were most obvious after watching it. I was somewhat engaged while watching the film, but most disappointed afterward.",Paradise Hills
32,theenigma129,Beautiful,7,11 November 2019,"Just finished paradise hills, it is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I'm so happy eiza gonzalez is in it and FINALLY was more involved and had lots & lots of screen time!!! I still wish that amarna (the real amarna) live & survived so her and uma can be back together again them and the rest of the girls. I'm just extremely more fed up when special characters that stand out from the crowd (in this case, eiza's characters amarna from paradise hills and darling from baby driver) get killed off!!! That makes me MAD!!!. But still, I love amarna very much & is still my most favorite character in this whole movie. At least amarna's killer was taken and destroyed!!! That made me feel better. And at least amarna is with ima in spirit. also EIZA SHOULDVE WON AN OSCAR FOR HER PERFORMANCE!!! EIZA GONZALEZ IS THE REAL OSCAR WINNER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!!! SHE DESERVES IT!!! And a Grammy too.

33,josenelias,It was ok until the 5 minutes of non-sense fantasy,4,14 December 2019,"It was ok until the 5 minutes of non-sense fantasy. Well the movie is a metaphor for how society forces girls into being someone they are not. Like if boys don't have to conform to norms also, many times enduring brutallity... Going on... So the film is a dystopian/sci-fi type and the story keeps you relatively interested, because the outcome of the treatment is not clearly foreseeable for a long time, despite growing suspicions it does have an element of surprise.The problem is the 5 minutes of completely out-of-the-blue and unnecessary element of fantasy. It does not add anything to the story which is completely ""realistic"" sci-fi and distracts a lot, downgrading the film. In fact is completely tacky. Imagine the last fight between Deckard and Roy in Blade Runner being made riding dragons and magic wands and then everything returning to the normal reality as the rest of the movie!

39,influxtwo,Great for Nap fuel,5,30 March 2021,Other reviewers pretty much nailed this. It perhaps would have been better if it came out in the 1970s. It just feels too contrived and underdeveloped to be taken seriously. It is style over substance. It is not realistic or developed enough be convincing and the writing doesn't do it any favors either. Just falls short as the plot itself is presented in a way that is a little unbelievable and lacking. Watching this nearly put me to sleep. I didn't hate it but I was just very underwhelmed. I liked the colors and aesthetics but the plot was like a 70s anthology episode of some kind that is more of a snack than a main course meal. Nothing very interesting is established and the ending was kind of beyond ridiculous. Seriously? Lol is this supposed to be empowering for women? Did not hate it just had mixed lukewarm feelings and I usually love dystopian scifi. I think this just could have been executed better and had it been it could have been iconic and groundbreaking and generated a lot of buzz.

45,jadediamond,Pretty to look at,6,22 September 2019,"This movie was very pretty to look at, but beneath it the plot was very simple. A young woman named Uma ( Emma Roberts) doesn't want to marry the guy who led to her Father's suicide so her fiance and mother send her to an island to correct her defiance and make her more obedient. She meets other young women too who families and associates send them there to mold them into their image. Arnama (Gonzales),a pop star,who wants to control her music. An obese woman named Chloe (McDonald) whose family want her to be skinner. An Asian woman named Yu (Awkwafina) who family want her to act proper or faces being disowned. She also has a cute love interest named Markus (Jeremy Irvine) who conveniently gets a job on the island. And of course Milla Jovovich as The Duchess is very beautiful. Yet it's pretty to look at but there's nothing there but feminist propaganda, LBGT agenda, toxic masculinity, and other SJW tropes. It's a simple movie about rich women feeling forced to be someone they're not, so their families send them there to be rehabilitated. Whether their families know it's a program to study their loved ones mannerisms so poor young woman can get plastic surgery to look exactly like them and replace them in their individual lives. And after the ladies are done been studied and having their identity stolen, The Duchess turns out to be an evil snake or succubus who eats them. Why I don't know since everything gets reveal in the last twenty minutes with no explanation. Markus turns out to be the bad guy and a part of the scheme because he's weak and a man. Arnama is hinted to have feelings for Uma and this is confirmed when Arnama kisses Uma goodbye on her final night on the island. Every man except Uma's dead father is bad in this movie. Markus did one redeeming good thing and that's it. The deaths of two of the children were dumb. If Uma and Chloe's process were complete and they were still alive, why not just wait until they were finish processing Yu? And Uma was so busy looking around and staring at a dead Arnama that she literally let Chloe die? The Duchess' death and reveal was so anticlimactic and ridiculous. Yet, the final scene was a nice reward after the confusing opening scene. I also like the nice twist on classicsm with their replacements. It wasn't a horrible movie but it was kinda all over the place and the third act could've been more interesting but it seemed rushed through. Wasn't a horrible movie but it could have been better. Overall, a pretty movie to look at about a not so far off dystopian world about affluent women being copied, killed off, and being replaced into their loved one's ideal version of them.",Paradise Hills

I was also quite disappointed by the lack of a solid plot explanation about this ""reorientation center"", the how and why it works, it's patrons - both their motives and their awareness, and who - or what - is this headmistress, where do these ""substitutes"" come from, and who exactly is in on this little secret process?

I understand what the writers wanted to portray; class differences, poverty, oppressed women, enforced marriages but it's so clumsily done.an example of this is token fat girl Chloe complaining that her family have sent her to the centre to lose weight, but she cheerfully declares that she's just fine with the way she is and shouldn't be changed. I would have had more respect for this film if they would have had a diverse cast with plus size actresses and didn't mention weight. They contradicted their own point by only having one overweight girl in a sea of Victoria secret models, so clearly the casting team were focussed on the aesthetically pleasing skinny white girls. They even flirted with the idea of a lesbian relationship, but didn't commit in the end, which just made it pointless and another ""taboo"" box ticked.

The obvious appeal is visual, from couture costuming, makeup and hair styles, to interesting cinematography and visual effects; for Alice Waddington's first time as director she managed to tie those elements together in a way that maintains interest, and keeps the plot succinctly controlled. Solid performances from Awkwafina, Danielle Macdonald, Milla Jovovich, and Danielle Macdonald keep the audience engaged, and Emma Roberts is eccentrically interesting, though her character confuses.I like the overall plot concept, which reminds of Stepford Wives with a sci fi twist that has a good level of plausibility. However, a secondary inexplicable ""supernatural"" layer mars what could have been the more believable story line, and the last 10 minutes either need a lot of additional information for the viewer or, in my opinion, should have been cut completely. While the end adds ""excitement"" to the finale, for this viewer, it was a futile attempt to add a blockbuster fantasy element that was completely unnecessary. That doesn't make the movie less interesting in the end, and the last moments of the film tie back to the start making a reasonably satisfying story arc. I would have enjoyed learning more about the class distinctions in this society, which would have been far more interesting than spending time on the baffling plot lines aforementioned.Generally speaking, a movie worth watching; it's a pity the movie didn't have good US distribution; and I'll keep an eye out for Waddington's next.",Paradise Hills

It is a slow burn that ultimately leaves you wanting to know what happens next.I ranked this movie a 5 and not higher because I do not like movies about being institutionalized, especially against your will or unjustly. It makes my blood boil, I get angry and it distracts me from the movie. Aside from that Mila Jojovitch tries to be a Meryl Streep or Angelina Jolie, probably the latter, but fails. While it was nice to see her outside of Raccoon City, that's probably where she belongs and not playing some character that has.... Well.. character. The plot is heavily borrowed from, which is fine, but it was an original take on the idea, though, not as original as ""Get Out"" which also falls into the ""Stepford Wives"" category for me. The costuming and hair sets are supposed to be futuristic but are mostly distracting, who dresses like that as a patient in Any hospital? Also I have questions about the ""Reveal"" ...

The mannequin-like crowd can't get enough of the show. Later, in a boudoir scene, the bride is swathed by more maribou feathers than Mae West ever wore in her life, and a strange Germanic groom marvels: ""The treatment worked so well! It's like that girl never existed!""We flash back to ""the treatment"" which occurs in an island environment that is beautiful and artificial. It's a lush paradise filled with flowers and tulle that looks like Princess Diana, George Michael and a deranged Victorian woman designed it. The uniform of the patients, the bride played by Emma Roberts, a girl with a Southern accent, and Awkwafina, includes a neck ruff, puffed sleeves, tulle, white Victorian boots, and BDSM buckles. The orderlies are handsome square jawed young men in origami buckled white outfits. The treatments are all very calm, yoga type things, and the bride, Uma, reveals she is an ""upper"" in love with a ""lower"" named Marcus and that her mother wants her to marry an upper she despises. Uma also meets a troubled pop star and discovers secrets about her surroundings.The film may be a deranged music video, but Awkwafina delivers more energy in her performance than most of her contemporaries combined.

88,matrix11001,Not all places are the Paradise it appears to be,6,4 April 2020,"I think unless your interested in Indie style films that are slow burners this film isn't for you.From the start almost until the last half hour it's quite a slow film, it confuses you at every point. I quite enjoyed the film, but the pay off I don't think was really worth it and it could have been made so much better.Both Emma Roberts and Mila Joviovich both acted well in both their roles, but was ultimately wasted. The twist at the end for Mila's character seems highly implausible and unrealistic - they could have developed her character a better way than the way they went.I found it worth watching, but wouldn't watch it again - the visuals were fantastic, it's reasonably sinister in it's presentation and is quite a good version of a dystopian future. But, it just becomes unbelievable and kind of ruins at at the end with the supposed big reveal.It's still worth a watch as you can root for Emma's character and the friends she shares a room with.Tread with caution if you watch this film as it really is quite a hard film to get into and enjoy, but for those like me who enjoy Indie style films will enjoy it and watch it to the end. Most people I can imagine will switch it off after 20 mins/half an hour because it still is a bit haphazard. It tries to almost be a psychological thriller or insight but fails on both counts.Even if you watch it just once - go for it. I found it enjoyable and glad I watched it but the silly twist with Mila's character kind of ruined it for me.",Paradise Hills

If you don't, then don't bother. I can best describe it as one of those movies Hollywood makes in its weird little insulated world without a thought for 99% of the population. I say this because if there were any normal, regular people working on this movie, they would've said ""What are we doing?? This is awful and nobody is going to like it!""

91,fannyelisabethdahlin,a feminist fairytale with important themes,9,13 November 2019,"Okay so first off: I loved this movie. The visuals! The costumes! The setting! The story!""Paradise hills"" is a feminist fairytale with so many important elements that's just so valid and can never be shone upon too many times: sisterhood, pressure from family and patriarchy, society's female ideals, same-sex love and admiration, rebellion towards authorities, self respect, and not being afraid to stand up for yourself. Many of these are classic themes, but they're classic for a reason, and that's because they'll always be relevant.I liked how the women really carries this story. The men are there and some of them have plot-vital parts, but they're not leads, they're not central, they don't even have that many lines. It's not a film about them, not even for them. It's refreshing for a change. The cast is stellar, and they complement each other.Sure, there are a few things I would've loved if this film dug a little deeper in, like the characters backgrounds and more about the island. I realize I'm contradicting myself about appreciating how men are not that important in this film but I actually would've liked to know just a little more about Son (Arnaud Valois). I can't really grasp his person(ality)? perhaps he's a symbol for toxic sociopathic masculinity? If he's meant to be a person and not a symbol, I would've liked to know just a little more about him.I've read reviews that were not too impressed by ""Paradise hills"", even disliked it, but when I left the cinema I felt inspired, and as a young woman I even felt empowered, in all of the little messages that at least I need to hear again and again as a reminder: I'm enough just the way I am.Does it sound cheesy? I don't care.I need more beautiful films with female leads and female director and feminist themes. And quite frankly: even if this film didn't have a great storyline I'd be enamoured because of the visuals. They're simply stunning.",Paradise Hills

93,EndeavoursGirl,"I thought this would be fluffy, but still watchable with wine. Wrong.",3,22 April 2020,"Turns out no. I read the reviews on Kanopy, where I watched this, and thought, well I'll just pour myself a glass of red and expect some Alice in Wonderland meets Resident Evil... with lots of fluff. No no... it's worse. Bad.
As one reviewer said, just watch the first 5-15, and the last 15.. and you're good. You can save yourself over an hour of your life.
It looks amazing (sets/dresses), perhaps I would have enjoyed if it was a foreign film with subtitles. But the ladies sound real young (grammar/conversations... what conversations?). Perhaps this was a (pre) teen movie? As another reviewer said, it's very feminist (is there any man, other than her deceased father, who actually is a good/nice/kind/decent man in this movie?)? And why do they swear? They don't need to. Why is there a lesbian love interest? That was strange, as there was never a back story to it, nor closing or follow through? Then again most if not all the ""relationship"" stories weren't really fleshed out, no character development, because they are all like paper dolls.
Very flat movie. Looks pretty but that's it. Whoever wrote the script, should either stop or grab a thesaurus.
I'd rather watch Clueless 10 times in a row, then have to sit through this again.

Thought it was gonna be somewhat good considering the cast but sadly it's a total waste of time. The first scene was ok, I was mildy intrigued coz the fashion and style was somewhat hunger games-type avant garde but when it came to the ""two months earlier"", the movie just went downhill from there, at first it though ""ok, some flash back scenes"" but noooo, the whole movie takes place on that ""two months earlier"" part.The movies was only about an hour and a half but the scenes felt like it took forever to end. It's long and boring. You can just watch the first 15 mines then skip about 45 minutes or so and you won't even miss a thing. It's a 30 minute short with an hour of fillers, my wife gave up after 20 minutes and decided to sleep coz nothing was literally happening. I decided to stay just for the sake of finishing itAlso, the big reveal wasn't that much of a ""big reveal"", more like a meh. Also wtf is with Milla Jovovich's character? Her true ""identity"" doesn't freaking make sense! Imagine watching Harry Potter then suddenly an Avengers visits Hogwarts. It's like the writers and the director can't freaking decide what genre this movie will be in so they decided to include everything. Sci-fi, mystery, thriller, supernatural, slow-burner(too slow if you ask me), horror, drama, romance, steam punk.

At times the story was weak and there was a half assed attempt at 2 love storyline's but neither went anywhere .

In my opinion though, Art direction by itself makes the movie very enjoyable and whereas the story tells nothing new, it gets very entertaining once you give in to the camp, hyperstylised atmosphere. The fantastic performances of all the cast are what keep you interested in the fate of (most of) the characters. This teen new take on The Stepford Wives is enhanced by over the top fantastic elements besides the sci-fi that take the movie a bit further than the very funny version of Nicole Kidman.

Like am I supposed to root for Uma and Amarna or Uma and Mark (Mike?,Marcus? whatever). The disappointment was even deeper when I realised this movie also went the ""kill the gays trope"" road. Until the very end I hoped that amidst the terrible writing Amarna and the girls will somehow wakeup after the Dutchess was killed, would that make a lot of sense?no but this movie has not made a sensible plot point since the start so it was possible.
The ending is even weirder and completely unexplained, where is Uma going? We dont know.What does she want to do now? We dont know.What was that safe place she was talking about? We don't know.Is she going to get together with bland white boy Mike? We don- Yeah, probably.
