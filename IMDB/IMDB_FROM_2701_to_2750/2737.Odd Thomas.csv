0,MartinHafer,Very familiar but excellent nonetheless.,9,4 July 2014,"When I began watching ""Odd Thomas"", I sure got a strong sense of déjà vu. After all, so much of this movie is familiar to me. It's because a couple of Bryan Fuller's television shows (""Pushing Daisies"" and ""Dead Like Me"") have very, very similar story lines. Now I have no idea if Dean Koontz's novel from which ""Odd Thomas"" is based was inspired by Fuller or vice-versa, but the similarities are so strong, I cannot imagine one not influencing the other. So what's similar? Main characters who can see the dead walking about, who are detectives that solve the deaths of these folks and the weird invisible beings who are behind all the 'accidents'--and they sure look a lot like each other (the gravelings and the bodachs). So, my advice is that if you like one, you'll probably like the other--though ""Odd Thomas"" is a much more serious production and has much more action--and it isn't a comedy.Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin) is a young man who sees dead people walking about from time to time. However, he mostly keeps this ability to himself, as he doesn't want everyone to think he's crazy. However, when these dead folks are crime victims, he works with a local detective who knows his secret (Willem Defoe) to solve the cases. His long-time girlfriend also knows his secret and sometimes helps him.One day, Odd sees something really...odd. Instead of the usual bodach here or there, Odd sees many, many of these vicious invisible creatures. So, he knows something horrendous is going to happen--and many, many people are going to die. However exactly how and who are both things he must work on with his detective friend. Most of the film, despite all the death, is pretty light and enjoyable. The end, however, is like a kick in the gut...so you might want to have some Kleenex handy.As I said above, if you like these two Fuller shows, you'll really like ""Odd Thomas"". I am a HUGE fan of them, so I naturally enjoyed the film. However, if you aren't a fan, still give the film a try. It's clever, very unusual and kept my interest throughout. The film is based only on Koontz's first book and his fans probably all know that he has written several Odd Thomas novels. Considering that this film didn't exactly set box office records, I seriously doubt if we'll see follow-up movies--though I would sure love to see more. My guess is that you'll feel the same after you give it a try. If you're interested, it just debuted on Netflix's streaming service.",Odd Thomas
1,Leofwine_draca,More like attack of the CGI effects team,5,31 July 2016,"ODD THOMAS might as well have been called ""attack of the CGI effects"" for all the depth and breadth of the storyline. It's an adaptation of the popular novel by Dean Koontz about a young man gifted with psychic ability who can see manifested evil around him as well as ghosts and who finds himself drawn into a plot involving impending tragedy.The film has a family-friendly feel to it despite some dark elements in the narrative, and there's plenty of jokey humour that doesn't really sit well with the rest of the material. I never really warmed to the late Anton Yelchin as the lead either, as he gives a cold performance that lacks charisma. When you don't care about the film's lead character it's difficult to care about the film full stop.Yelchin's loner hero is slightly annoying and never stops talking. He reminds me a bit of Shia LaBeouf in DISTURBIA. The storyline is kept light and there's never a chance for proper characterisation so the likes of Willem Dafoe are wasted in support. The direction isn't bad although there is some silly slow motion on occasion. However, as an effects-fuelled adventure this isn't too bad. The CGI work is pretty decent and the fast pace helps you to take your mind off the problems with the story. It's certainly a forgettable production but one that nonetheless holds your attention throughout.",Odd Thomas
2,SnoopyStyle,Prefer an origin story and wackier style,6,25 October 2014,"Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin) is a fry cook in Pico Mundo, California. His mother claimed to have special abilities and was locked up when he was 12. He has secret abilities to see dead people and the wrongs that are done to them. He fights bad guys. Chief Wyatt Porter (Willem Dafoe) knows his secret and covers it up. He has a vision of a mass shooting and he goes about searching for the coming evil. His girlfriend Stormy Llewellyn (Addison Timlin) knows his secret too. There are apparitions called bodachs that only Odd Thomas can see. Whenever one shows up, bad things happen. Now a large number of them show up and he knows that the town is in serious trouble.Stephen Sommers is trying to bring some wacky fun to a supernatural thriller in an attempted comedic horror. I like the idea but I don't think he's pulling it off completely. The quick banter dialog needs more funny sharper jokes. The look of the movie needs more wackiness. The bigger problem is the story. For a new unknown character, the movie needs to go back to the beginning. This is one of those stories that is better served to have an origin story. The audience can learn about his abilities as he discovers them himself. Also there is the tension of nobody believing in him. An origin story would work much better. The best thing in the movie is Anton Yelchin. He fits this character perfectly. Even his inner monologue fits well. Addison Timlin is a pretty girl but quick banter isn't her forte. I'm sure they could get another young actress who can speed talk much better. The material has potential that the movie doesn't fully realize.",Odd Thomas
3,Prismark10,The Frighteners,6,15 July 2016,"Anton Yelchin is the oddly named Odd Thomas, a short order cook who has the sixth sense to see dead people and usually do something about it, like some kind of supernatural detective who can cookA geek, freak and an oddball in the small town of Pico Mundo, his ability to see evil spirits which he calls bodachs to solve or prevent violent crimes with the help of his pretty girlfriend, Stormy Llewellyn (Addison Timlin) and the chief of police (Willem Dafoe.)However he notices a swarm of bodachs infesting a stranger known as Fungus Bob and realises there is a conspiracy for mass slaughter which he needs to stop.The film is directed and adapted from a novel by Dean Koontz by Stephen Sommers who hit pay-dirt with The Mummy franchise but this is a little going back to his roots with small scale quirky horror with some comic touches.There is plenty of CGI here and there, some left turns and a climax to the action which is bit on the far fetched side especially with the truck scene.Yelchin and Dafoe have a good rapport and Yelchin brings a lot of charisma to pull off an off beat geek like Odd. An actor who started in movies as a child, Odd Thomas is the kind of film that showcases his talents which will be sorely missed.",Odd Thomas
4,claudio_carvalho,Destined to Be Together Forever,7,28 February 2014,"In Pico Mundo, a small town near the desert, the fast-food cook Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin) has the ability to see and talk to dead people. He is in love with his girlfriend Stormy Llewellyn (Addison Timlin) and they believe that they are destined to be together forever. Odd Thomas uses his abilities to help the Chief of Police Wyatt Porter (Willem Dafoe) to solve murders.When Odd Thomas sees the creepy Fungus Bob Robertson (Shuler Hensley) surrounded by the fiends bodachs, he is sure that the town is in danger and threatened by the possibility of slaughtering people in a massive destruction. His further investigation with Stormy discloses that Fungus Bob worships the Prince of Darkness and he is plotting to kill many people in Pico Mundo. Will Odd Thomas and Stormy succeed in avoiding the bloodshed? ""Odd Thomas"" is an entertaining movie, with a story that uses the idea of ""The Sixth Sense"" with ""Ghost"". Despite the use of CGI, the acting is good and Addison Timlin is among the most beautiful young actresses that I have recently seen. There is a surprising plot point near the end, sad but perfect to the story. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Estranho Thomas"" (""The Odd Thomas"")",Odd Thomas
5,kosmasp,Koontz did it,6,25 December 2013,"I have to admit, I discovered Dean Koontz late. A friend of mine gave me a few of his novels (Phantoms being one of them). I haven't read the Odd Thomas novels though). But I did watch this movie and I have to admit, I felt it was trying too hard to be cool. While it did achieve it at some points and has some very funny puns, it also feels detached from me as a viewer.If every character has a quip, a funny line and always something witty to say, it doesn't feel like a movie to me. I want different characters with different trades. If they are the same in that respect, how can I differ between them? It's just not possible. If that doesn't bother you, go on ahead and enjoy a fun ride! Because that is what the movie eventually is",Odd Thomas
6,gavin6942,Pleasantly Surprising,6,10 May 2014,"In a California desert town, a short-order cook with clairvoyant abilities (Anton Yelchin) encounters a mysterious man (Shuler Hensley) with a link to dark, threatening forces.Although ""Odd Thomas"" received negative reviews, or mixed reviews, it has grown on the average viewer. As of this writing (May 2014), critics seem to give the film anywhere from 3 to 4.8 out of ten, while the overall viewer sees it as a 6.8. Indeed, the film is better than the average release and deserves recognition for its bold moves and creative adaptation (which is quite accessible for those who have not read the book without angering those who have).The editing is something that may be hard to adjust to. More inventive than ""MTV editing"", but still quite fast-paced and unconventional, it takes a bit to settle in to. However, it does effectively allow the film to convey a large amount of background information while using small amounts of time. Stephen Sommers has had his hand in several successful films over the last two decades, but this may be his greatest coup yet -- writing with style, producing and directing with an excellent eye... and even bringing along frequent collaborator Arnold Vosloo for a small role.Anton Yelchin is excellent in every way, and his career is clearly on the rise after already being a quick success. Addison Timlin is harder to accept. While certainly charming enough, she seems to have graduated from the Alexis Bledel school of acting... and that only works for Bledel. Maybe Timlin will redeem herself in ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" (2014), but for now she must be regarded as the weak link of this movie's chain.A brief note should be addressed the the special effects crew. With the large presence of the bodachs, the film could be made or broken on how they looked on screen. Frankly, they look great. While obviously CGI, the blend is smooth and some of the best work out there. One goof an this would have been a glorified SyFy film, but luckily this never occurs. Keep this crew working -- they have the touch.",Odd Thomas
7,paul_haakonsen,An interesting supernatural mystery thriller...,6,23 November 2013,"I can't claim to have read the Koontz books, so just how true to the books or how far the movie strays I cannot even guess about. But sitting down to watch ""Odd Thomas"" was actually time well spent.The movie is fast paced and has an interesting story, and there weren't really a dull moment throughout the course of the entire movie.The story is about a young man named Odd who have peculiar abilities which allows him to see the dead and also see strange creatures that are drawn to death, known as bodaks. Living in a small town, Odd comes face to face with an unfurling event that he believes is going to be catastrophic on a grand scale.I will say that the characters in the movie were nicely detailed and rather believable. And the actors and actresses in the movie portraying these characters were doing really good jobs. Anton Yelchin (playing Odd Thomas) was really well-cast for the lead role, and as always, then Willem Dafoe (playing Chief Wyatt Porter) did a great job.The effects in ""Odd Thomas"" were quite good as well. Now, this isn't a Hollywood CGI fest that focuses more on effects than story. But the effects used were great and to the point. And I found the creature design on the bodaks to be rather interesting.""Odd Thomas"" is a great mystery thriller, though you shouldn't set yourself up to be blown away. Sure, the movie is great, but it is not overwhelmingly so. There were some nice small twists to the story along the way.But what makes the movie entertaining is the way that the story is told and presented to the audience.I am giving ""Odd Thomas"" a 6 out of 10 stars rating.",Odd Thomas
8,Hey_Sweden,"""If 'strange and suspicious' were enough to put someone in jail, you'd already be there.""",7,4 October 2021,"The talented, sadly short-lived Anton Yelchin stars as the title character in this adaptation of a Dean Koontz novel. (Yes, his name really IS Odd.) Odd is a short-order cook who has an extraordinary gift: he can see dead people. But unlike Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"", he really does something about it, by God. Like going to great lengths to apprehend a killer, no matter how much private property is destroyed. Odd gets the sense that something BIG and *terrifying* is going to go down soon, with the arrival in town of a true weirdo, ""Fungus Bob"" (Shuler Hensley). You see, swarming around characters like Bob are translucent beasts called ""Bodachs"" which only Odd can see. The appearance of Bodachs ALWAYS portends doom.Marked by some of the irreverent humor you can often find in the films of screenwriter / director Stephen Sommers (""Deep Rising"", the first two ""Mummy"" movies), ""Odd Thomas"" is quite agreeable, wacky fun, even though it does feel pretty familiar. Upon reflection, the ""twists"" that occur in this rather simple mystery don't come across as particularly Earth-shattering.Sommers gives the story great pace & action, and the plethora of CGI isn't actually too much of a distraction. There's also an appealing romance at the center of the tale between Odd and Stormy (Addison Timlin), the love of his life. In fact, a great many of the characters are engaging in their own way (""Fungus Bob"" is such a blatantly seedy creep that the role is a hoot). Willem Dafoe (as the local police chief), Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Nico Tortorella, Kyle McKeever, and Patton Oswalt comprise an able supporting cast, although Oswalt is only seen briefly in a cameo role as the character Ozzie. Also turning up in a hilarious cameo is ""Mummy"" series villain Arnold Vosloo, as a goofy spirit. Yelchin is winning in the lead role, and he and Timlin have real chemistry as a screen couple.The ending unfortunately goes on too long in its attempt to manipulate the audience, but does ultimately do its job in setting up further adventures for the Odd Thomas character. But it looks like the movie seriously under-performed at the box office, which would have curtailed those plans in a hurry.Seven out of 10.",Odd Thomas
9,utgard14,One of the Best Movies to Come Out in 2013,7,3 December 2013,"Refreshing blend of supernatural mystery and superhero movies. One review here I read seemed to think less of the movie because it didn't follow the familiar formula of an angst-ridden young hero with lots of problems; an emo kid who is hated by all and longs for a girl he can never have. The same old tired Spider-Man knock-off stuff, in other words. I, for one, enjoyed the freshness of this movie. Here we have a character who deals not only with having a supernatural gift but also deals with death daily. He sees things no one should see. In 99.9% of stories written about anything even in this ballpark, the lead character would be wracked with self-pity and guilt, would have no stable relationships, and would have no sense of humor unless it was dipped in bitterness. He would also seldom bathe.By contrast, Odd Thomas is a likable popular guy with a beautiful, understanding girlfriend, a friendly relationship with a sympathetic police captain, and a healthy attitude about doing good things with his gift. Anton Yelchin as Odd and Addison Timlin as his girlfriend Stormy are perfectly cast. They have sparkling chemistry and the loving banter between the two of them is the movie's strongest point. Willem Dafoe plays slightly against type as the fatherly police captain but it's a great fit for him. The stunning Gugu Mbatha-Raw has a small but important role as a friend of Odd & Stormy's.The writing is crisp with some fun dialogue. The characters are written and acted well. The movie moves at a good pace and never leaves you bored. My only criticisms would be some slightly obvious plot twists, especially where one villain is concerned, and a mildly dissatisfying ending. Still, it's an enjoyable movie with a little bit of action and effects that is driven by character. It's miles above any of the other young adult-oriented sci-fi/supernatural movies I've seen in recent years.",Odd Thomas
10,view_and_review,If Seeing Dead People Wasn't Scary,6,11 February 2016,"Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin) is a quirky young man that can see dead people. He doesn't see all dead people; with some exceptions he sees those wrongly killed with no justice served. I know that's not original but ""Odd Thomas"" took the comedic approach.The movie is very akin to ""Zombieland"". I know you're thinking that my brief synopsis is nothing like ""Zombieland"", but I assure you it has a very ""Zombieland"" overtone to it in that 1.) Odd Thomas narrates most of the movie and 2.) it takes a horror movie theme and makes it somewhat humorous.The story is pretty good as are the special effects. Odd Thomas has to try to prevent a pending massacre using the clues of his abilities. We follow him from one potential clue to another in Pico Mundo, California as things get more and more tense.The biggest detractor was the lovey dovey routine between he and his main squeeze, Stormy (Addison Timlin). The constant sweet talk and kissy face was so much all your teeth could get cavities and rot out then you'd die of diabetes. On top of that the girl couldn't act. Her lines were delivered so timely and robot-like it was as if she was trying not to forget them.Her role added yet another knock against the movie: predictability. The ending had some twists to it but it also had a very predictable ""twist"". Still, the movie was enjoyable and a welcome slant on the I-see-dead-people topic.",Odd Thomas
11,neil-476,Excellent,8,5 June 2018,"Odd Thomas (first name Odd, surname Thomas) is a griddle cook in a small desert town. He is fated to be with the love of his life Stormy Llewellyn (a fortune-telling card told them so). He is also fated with being able to see the dead (while they have unfinished business and before they move on) and creatures called bodachs, harbingers of doom. And an explosion in the bodach population indicates that something awful is about to happen: can Oddie track in down and prevent it?The first of Dean Koontz' Odd Thomas novels is the best, and this is a good adaptation of it. Odd is an engaging character, naïve and knowing at the same time, and driven by his abilities - unwanted but accepted - to try to do the right thing, even in the face of personal jeopardy.Anton Yelchin is a personable Odd and Addison Timlin is a delightful Stormy - their individual quirkinesses intertwine nicely. The rest of the cast are also good in a plot which is possibly a little too serpentine.But the set pieces are fun, the location works, and the kicker at the end is gut-wrenching, as it was in the book.Of its type, this is one of the best.",Odd Thomas
12,phd_travel,Worth one watch,5,4 July 2014,There are some aspects of this movie that work and some that don't. It seems strange that a well made movie in the comedy horror genre should go straight to DVD. Firstly what worked: 1. Anton Yelchin is quite good in this kind of role just as he was good in Fright Night. 2. The darkly comic mood and situations are funny: especially Robert Robertson and what happened to the body. 3. The Sixth Sense reference and twist is funny and poignant in turns and makes the ending. What went wrong: 1. The mall shooting. With recent incidents involving mass shootings it's not right a scenario for entertainment. By the time the book made it to screen what was acceptable then no longer is today. 2. Addison Timlin isn't quite special enough for the love interest. Someone more unique would have added some needed spark to the movie. 3. It feels a bit familiar and mish mash of other similar movies. Overall worth one watch but you will see why it couldn't have been a hit.,Odd Thomas
13,Wuchakk,Quirky black comedy/horror/mystery features an outstanding depiction of demonic activity,7,4 November 2017,"RELEASED IN 2013 and written & directed by Stephen Sommers based on Dean Koontz' novel, ""Odd Thomas"" chronicles events in a small California desert town where the eponymous young man (Anton Yelchin), a short-order cook, has the paranormal gift of discerning of spirits wherein he can see into the spirit realm. Not only can he see dead people, ghosts stuck on this plane, he can also see the activities of evil spirits, which he calls bodachs. His gift informs him that there's going to be a mass murder in town and thus the wicked bodachs are gathering in droves. The police chief (Willem Dafoe) is aware of Odd's psychic gifts and works with him to prevent the carnage.I didn't know anything about this movie or the Dean Koontz series before viewing and was pleasantly surprised by this eccentric black comedy/mystery/horror. While it's not necessarily great overall, it has elements of greatness. For instance, the depiction of evil spirits and their activities, the way they're drawn to evil & fear like flies to dog doo-doo, is easily the best cinematic portrayal of demons I've ever seen. The movie's nigh enlightening on this front.Petite cutie Addison Timlin plays the hero's girlfriend and her beauty is well highlighted (no nudity or sleaze).THE FILM RUNS 97 minutes and was in shot in New Mexico (Santa Fe, Albuquerque & Pecos).GRADE: B",Odd Thomas
14,siderite,Low budget Constantine meets Eerie Indiana?,7,7 April 2014,"Written, directed and produced by the same guy and based on a Dean Koontz book, Odd Thomas is a combination of the concepts ""guy who can see dead people"" and ""geeky and articulate weirdo"", so it reminded me of Constantine a little, with the feel of Eerie, if you remember the show. Unfortunately, it wasn't half as fun as either of them, even if I did like the actors.I mean, I liked Anton Yelchin in a lot of movies and who doesn't love Willem Dafoe, even if in secondary roles that make little sense? We even had a five minute appearance of Arnold Vosloo, who I always thought was underrated. The only horribly bad casting choice was Addison Timlin, who maybe can act, let's not be mean, but in this film was just utterly obnoxious and lacking any charisma. But even with these guys and a script made from a book, no matter how dubious, the film was bland and going through the motions like a broken automaton. I mean, ""Booo!"" scenes that were supposed to keep me glued to the chair and then make me jump up were the times when I chose to pick up my glass, knowing perfectly well when and what was going to happen.But it wasn't only that the film was predictable, but that all of its parts were wrongly assembled, like someone had used force to solve a puzzle instead of putting the right pieces together. The entire plot was centered on the main character, everybody else, including his trusted sidekick and girlfriend, were extremely secondary, yet still the guy was inconsistent, jumping from odd to funny, from weird to sexy, from geeky to action hero. He was all over the place. The story itself was reminiscent of a police procedural, only the entire procedure short circuited by psychic abilities.Bottom line: I really wanted to like this movie. With a title like Odd Thomas I expected to see some intelligent indie movie with a good script and a low budget. Instead I got a bland and lazy story on an average budget; just like the main character, neither here nor there. Too bad.",Odd Thomas
15,thesar-2,"Murder, He Spoke",8,1 July 2016,"Orhe saw dead people and became Johnny Smith Jr.Let's begin with stating I have read probably 5-6 Dean R. Koontz novels and pretty much loved every line of them. Until today, I've pretty much hated all the adaptations. Part because of how they sh|t on the books, part because they're lousy filmmaking and all-but sought out to sabotage Koontz. Luckily, I have not read Odd Thomas (or, I'm told there is a series based around O.T., so none of the follow-ups either) so I can watch this movie clean.Maybe because of that, I can praise this as the best of all Koontz's books adapted into film. Perhaps, I should do that from here on: see the movie first, and then read the book. I'll get a good experience for a couple of hours and then an even better joy when I dive into the literature.But, I digress. After having an incredible time with the more recent Green Room, also starring Anton Yelchin, I was recommended this film I never thought I'd see. I'm happy for the recommendation.The movie isn't perfect by any means – way too many plot holes, too much voice-overs to explain the characters and plot (felt like post- insecurities) and a tad overkill on the clichés/jump-scares. But, those are minor to the fun atmosphere, solid acting, chemistry between the lead couple and interesting premise.Odd Thomas is haunted, literally, by the dead who point out their murderer and he helps (the always fantastic, Willem Defoe's) cop solve crimes. That cop, plus a few others know the Odd'ssecret and when a huge conspiracy takes place in their small town, the Odd gang put the pieces together to hopefully save lives.This takes place and is contained in what appears to be a small California desert town and they must be the unluckiest small town in the world. People seem to be murdered left and right and if not for the ""gifted"" Odd Thomas, they would have no peace. I guess.I believe the movie is trying to be harmless, light and fun, and it is. It's best to just try to suspend most disbelief and jog along for the ride with Odd as he's trying to be the hero he's afraid will get him in the looney bin for.Despite liking the adventure Odd, his girlfriend and Not-Commissioner Gordon friend is having, the ending I never saw coming truly teared me up. That shot this movie way up for me.Highly recommended, and I guess, even more so before you read the book(s.)***Final thoughts: 1st off, R.I.P. Anton. You just passed 12 days ago at the time of this viewing and review. You truly had talent and I wish I could've seen more of you.But, the whole scheme the bad guys were planninga little too close to home. No spoilers, but the baddies here are planning something that the Odd and the Beautiful are trying to prevent, and sadly, in real life, it's occurring far too often. Plus, it only feeds the paranoia that every citizen truly needs to be armed and ready to shoot back at a potential terrorist. Politics and gun-debates aside, I wish they wouldn't have gone with a too-real scenario and give us false hope that it can ""magically"" be prevented or stopped.",Odd Thomas

Before I begin I should say that I have never read the book so I didn't know what to expect from this going in. The movie itself wasn't that bad but it did have one problem. A movie like this with this subject matter shouldn't take itself as serious as it did. Movies like Dylan Dog, Dead Before Dawn and R.I.P.D. all have the same basic idea and they were all more comedy then anything which made them cheesy but watchable.

18,atlasmb,A Stylistic Telling of the Koontz Novel,8,16 September 2014,"Somehow I never saw this film advertised. I just happened on it later. I have read most of the Odd Thomas books by Dean Koontz. When I saw this title, I wondered how they might convey the quirky tone of the novels. But the director managed!Odd is a young guy with some psychic powers. But he is not a superhero. He can bleed like anyone else. He can see some spirits, good and bad. He lives in an average town called Pico Mundo, a place where you might not expect other-worldly occurrences or major catastrophes. Odd's abilities place him squarely in the center of things as he tries to decipher what might be ready to occur and how he might stop it.The story is a blend of comedy, horror, suspense and romance--just like the books. The director combines all manner of special photographic effects, voice-overs, flashbacks, etc., to achieve the quirky tone of the story. If you like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or ""Men in Black"" or ""Ghostbusters"", you might like this film. They also combine comedy with horror.The romance revolves around Odd (played by Anton Yelchin) and his girlfriend, Stormy (Ashley Sommers, the daughter of director Stephen Sommers). Both actors play their parts well, as do the rest of the cast. The film plays as the pilot for a series or the first in a series of films. Unfortunately, since the film received little attention, a sequel is probably not in the stars. Too bad, since it would be fun to follow this story into the other Odd tales by Koontz.",Odd Thomas
19,851222,Descent flick,7,31 July 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Odd Thomas"" (2013) is definitely not bad supernatural, action, thriller, comedy, mystery flick. Acting was OK for this material from all involved and the late Anton Yelchin. It's a kinda crossover between ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Supernatural"" and ""Man in Black"", and although it is not on the same league as those titles, it is still a descent flick which at running time 1 h 30 min wasn't boring or dull. Sure, there are some pacing issues here and there, but overall package was more then OK.Overall, while ""Odd Thomas"" is nothing very special, it is still a not bad flick at all. Some nice ideas and execution makes this worth watching for one time.",Odd Thomas
20,paulclaassen,I love this!!,8,20 June 2018,"The film is indeed very unique in its presentation and telling of the story. The camerawork is incredible, as well as the visual effects. The film blends humor and suspense seamlessly without being slapstick or gory. Anton Yelchin is perfectly cast as Odd Thomas and the chemistry between him and Addison Timlin is wonderful! The acting and the dialogue were great, and convincing. The film had some real funny moments, and also some genuinely nail biting moments, and also disturbing at times. The overall theme of Odd Thomas trying to solve a mystery in order to avoid a disaster in itself was quite tense. The final moments was heart wrenching - sadness and happiness entwined.

21,Floated2,Odd Thomas is Unsure of its Genre,3,20 January 2015,"Perhaps not being an avid fan of the novel series, may have had effects who those who did not enjoy this film. Odd Thomas doesn't come across as a jaunty entertainment, what with the main character privy to murders and assaults, burdened with the task of sorting out ugly business occurring around town. Sommers doesn't buy into the torturous qualities of the story, instead attempting to amplify its escapist elements, utilizing CGI to build smooth transitions and sinister enemies, while the screenplay is diet Thin Man, with finger-snap banter working to maintain momentum. However, Odd Thomas isn't a simple assembly of genre pieces out to sustain a mood of mystery and horror, but an elaborate narrative of motivations and explanations that eat up much of the screen time. Sommers is locked in expositional mode throughout the effort, with Odd's narration filling in the details when screen activity fails to illuminate everything. Born with a gift, out to solve crimes, tormented by Bodachs, chasing Fungus Bob, interacting with the locals, and romancing Stormy is a substantial to-do list for the helmer, who rushes to fit all the tangents together, keeping the feature breathless. There are supporting characters to tend to and an overall arc of criminal activity, leaving little room to simply enjoy the premise and grow comfortable with its eccentricities. Odd Thomas tends to shift in its uncertainty between different parts of the film.",Odd Thomas
22,filipemanuelneto,"A very good film, better than I expected, capable of entertaining and moving us.",9,6 September 2020,"This film is partly based on a successful novel by Dean Koontz. The film revolves around Odd Thomas, a young man who can see and communicate with the souls of the dead and uses this to solve crimes and homicides. For this, he collaborates with the police through a detective whom he is friends with and who knows his gift. He also has a longstanding relationship with Stormy, a young woman with a strong personality and who also helps him.In this film, Odd Thomas is seriously apprehensive when he sees an enormous amount of evil spirits around a repellent-looking man. Knowing that they tend to be attracted to places where a lot of violence is going to happen, he decides to investigate the man and try to stop whatever is about to happen.The film works quite well and, despite the supernatural theme, it was not conceived as a horror film but as a light adventure film, with touches of comedy, for a young audience. The script works quite well although I cannot say if it is true to the original book because I never found it in my mother tongue - Portuguese - and therefore I never read it. But the film successfully establishes an emotional link between the characters and the audience, and we are happy to follow Odd and his girlfriend in their investigations. The ending is good, truly surprising and it's hard not to feel sorry for the characters.The cast is led very effectively by Anton Yelchin, who in this film has one of the most interesting roles of his career (which, as we all know, ended with a very early death, a few years ago). Beside you can see the beautiful Addison Timlin, also very good in the role of Stormy. The chemistry established by the two actors works really well. There is still room for veteran Willem Dafoe, who does his job well.Technically, it is an effective and discreet film, which gives space to the script and the work of the actors to shine and knows how to put itself in the right place. It bets a lot on good cinematography and good special and CGI effects, particularly in scenes with the spirits and in some very well done action and fighting scenes. The sets and costumes also work very well.",Odd Thomas
23,leonblackwood,Surprisingly good watch! 5/10,5,12 July 2014,"Review: I quite enjoyed this fast paced supernatural movie about a teenager who can see dead people. I liked the way that the movie was written and the fact that the main character didn't have to try and convince everyone about his special gift. The director just got straight on with the core of the movie, right from the beginning and the mixture of wit worked well with the whole with the intensity of the movie. Don't get me wrong, some of the scenes were pretty corny, but I liked the CGI and the ending had a great twist. All of the actors put in an average performance, especially the leading character who had the difficult task of making it seem real, even though no one else couldn't see what he could see. The whole 24 hour scenario kept the movie fresh and full of suspense. I was expecting it to be one of those predictable Frighteners type of movies, but it turned out to be quite enjoyable and worth a watch. Watchable!Round-Up: Anton Yelchin's claim to fame has to be his role as Chekov in the new Star Trek franchise, which he plays quite well. He has also starred in movies like Fright Night and Terminator Salvation but they weren't leading roles like this one. He did bring some intensity to his role, but I think that he needs a few more movies under his belt before he can be taken seriously. I liked Willem Dafoe's character, who plays the detective who believes in the main characters gift, and I liked the banter between the 2 loved ones. In all, it's a well put together movie which would have blown up at the box office if it had Will Smith and a top director behind it.Budget: $27million Worldwide Gross: N/AI recommend this movie to people who are into there supernatural movies about a teenager in a small town who can see dead people. 5/10",Odd Thomas
24,Stevieboy666,I'm surprised by all these glowing reviews,5,29 April 2021,"Odd Thomas is a popular guy - he works as a cook, has a nice girlfriend called Stormy and can see dead people, a gift which he uses to help the police catch murderers. The late Anton Yelchin plays Odd, good actor, and Addison Timlin looks great as Stormy. Willem Dafoe should need no introduction to film fans. The movie starts off by being narrated by Odd, quite a common practice around this time, Zombieland being another example. Personally I am not a fan of this style. Odd Thomas is a combination of horror, comedy and romance but it is not terribly scary or funny, I found the romantic element to be the strongest (it could make an OK date movie). The ending is actually quite sad. Lots of CGI, again something that I'm not a big fan of. There's a lot of high scores for this movie but I found it to be pretty average, a once only watch.",Odd Thomas
25,Fluke_Skywalker,Truth in advertising,7,28 June 2014,"With its sometimes wildly disparate tones, the quirky and aptly titled 'Odd Thomas' could have very well turned into a nightmare comparable to those experienced by the title character. However, thanks to a very solid cast and some tight, energetic direction by Stephen Sommers, it instead manages to be a deft blend of horror and comedy, drama and action and romance and loss that both entertains and moves.Unfortunately, it doesn't look as if we'll ever see a sequel, as the film was plagued by a series of lawsuits and was unceremoniously dumped onto DVD with little or no time on the big screen. Hopefully some enterprising TV executive sees this and realizes the potential it has for a weekly television series. Until then, the movie will have to suffice, and thankfully it does just that.",Odd Thomas

27,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Overlooked gem of a film,9,24 June 2015,"Stephen Sommer's Odd Thomas slipped by literally unnoticed in 2014, over two years after it was actually made. No one saw it. No one even noticed it. But that's why your friendly neighborhood Natey does these reviews, so y'all can learn about films you may have missed. Based on Dean Koontz acclaimed Brother Odd novels, it stars the extremely talented Anton Yelchin as Odd, a spunky New Mexico line cook who has a unique set of talents passed on to him by his mother (Leonor Varela), namely, the ability to see the dead, as well as demonic creatures whose appearance heralds disastrous events events. As the paranormal goings on reach a climax in his town he is forced to take action to find out what's wrong and essentially prevent the apocalypse. Along with his adorable girlfriend Stormy Llewellyn. Their casual yet passionate relationship is the best on screen romance I've seen I years. You REALLY care what happens to these two, and there's a scene near the end of the film that had me gushing tears for a good 15 minutes. Odd Thomas is a film that despite its macabre subject matter, is just a total blast of fun to watch. Director Sommer's also helmed The Mummy, one of my favourite movies ever (don't you dare talk shut about The Mummy), so this film has his snarky, theme park style popcorn movie enchantment. It's like if someone made a movie soup with Ghostbusters, Indiana Jones, The dead Zone, Men in Black and Ferris Buellers Day Off. It's that much fun. Willem Dafoe is hilarious as the sarcastic Sheriff, and there's a priceless cameo by the mummy himself, Arnold Vosloo. It's a crime that hardly anyone has seen or heard of this film, as it's way better than anything else of its genre that played in theaters last year. Yelchin anchors it with his grounded yet off the wall performance,  and the romance mixed with the goofy supernatural effects are a winning combination.",Odd Thomas
28,3xHCCH,Fun Unexpected Thrills!,8,9 July 2013,"I had no idea what this was going to be a very entertaining movie. It is locally released as ""Odd Thomas and the Army of Death"" with a terrible-looking poster showing a spider-like Dementor. It also had no big name stars in it to attract attention. I had pretty low expectations going in.""Odd Thomas"" is also the real name of the lead character, who can see ghosts. These ghosts usually go to him to bring their killers to justice. One day, he notes a strange-looking man he calls Fungus Bob because of his weird hairpiece. This man had these ""death demons"" crawling all over him. Based on his previous encounters with such demons, this warned Odd of an impending event which could cost many lives. Odd fights against time to try to figure out and stop this catastrophe from happening.Odd Thomas is played by Aaron Yelchin. This is the actor we best know as Chekov in the new ""Star Trek"" films. He gets to play the lead character here and he does very well indeed. His wry style of humor and good guy vibe worked very well for him in essaying the story's protagonist with special powers. Odd's pretty (hot) girlfriend Stormy (cute name) is played by Addison Timlin. I have not seen her in anything before this film, but apparently she got her break in showbiz playing ""Annie"" on stage years back. She is strong-willed and sassy, a perfect partner for our hero. Addison and Aaron have good screen chemistry together.Screen veteran Willem Dafoe plays Odd's father. He is a no-nonsense Chief Porter, head of the police department in their community. Arnold Vosloo of the ""Mummy"" films had a cameo paying a ghost with a severed hand and stupid sense of fun. The rest of the supporting cast are not really familiar names.However, from the get-go, this movie entertained me with the charismatic lead actors, the quirky yet likable characters, the stylized computer- generated visual effects, fast and light pace of storytelling and its morbid sense of humor. Director Stephen Sommers, who had brought us films like ""The Mummy"" and ""Van Helsing"" before, succeeds again in making these films with dark themes very entertaining for the mainstream audiences. Highly recommended!",Odd Thomas
29,peterp-450-298716,"""The Sixth Sense"" ... Koontz style ...",8,16 September 2014,"""I may see dead people, but then, by God, I do something about it ."" I am a big fan of Koontz's books. However, I can't really remember myself reading ""Odd Thomas"". The fact that I devour a lot of books has something to do with that I guess. The qualities Koontz has and excels in, are the cadence of his stories, the quick storyline which sucks you as it were into the story and haunts you. The masterful dialogs which are built up with short sentences, provided with subtle humor and packed with witty quips, is a feature Koontz uses and which I've always appreciated.And all of this you'll find in this movie. It's a mixture of crime, thriller and horror (there's one scary moment after which my wife almost jumped against the ceiling). The solving of a crime case by using the supernatural. The fact that there are relatives who are aware of his gift, gives it a different turn than most films. The minimal special effects that were used for the Bodach's, aren't groundbreaking, but they fit perfectly with the whole.Odd (Anton Yelchin) seemingly is a dead normal boy (despite his unusual name) who has lived all his life in this unsightly small dusty town called Pico Mundo. His name was the result of an error during the registration at the town hall and his name should normally be Todd, claims his mother. His father on the other hand claims that he got that name on purpose because he really was weird already since his childhood. Odd is a master in baking hamburgers and has a sweet-looking girlfriend Stormy (Addison Timlin). So he's actually an ordinary teenager, were it not that Odd also has a gift. He can see deceased people. ""I see dead people"" immediately comes to your mind. The classic movie quote. This gift has become as obvious to Odd as making sure the burgers are nicely brown fried on both sides. He makes use of this gift to solve certain crimes and at the same time he also gets a little bit of help from police officer Wyatt (Willem Dafoe). Wyatt and Stormy are also the only one who know about his gift. Suddenly Odd sees an awful lot of Bodach's, which feed from the suffering and pain of a future victim, and he realizes that his little town is in big trouble. The whole story then degenerates into an epic battle between good and evil.Just as Cole Sear in ""The Sixth Sense"", Odd helps the restless souls of the deceased to the other side by clearing up unresolved issues for them. The way he does that looks a bit more violent and action-packed as in ""The Sixth Sense"". Yelchin is perfect as Odd and knows how to charm you with his sarcastic humor. Addison Timlin, who recently played in the less successful (to me) comedy ""That awkward moment"", is a cute appearance who fits perfectly with the absurd character of Odd. She's that type of girlfriend who has the flair to handle a weirdo like Odd and feels that all-encompassing love for him. And also she looks stunning in that pink lingerie ... Together they form an endearing couple who, despite their limited experience, manage to support the complete film.""Odd Thomas"" is an entertaining film. The special effects aren't exactly overwhelming and groundbreaking, but the film on its own makes you feel as if you're riding a roller coaster. A series of action-packed scenes interspersed with fairly humorous dialogs. Like many other film versions of a book, it will be criticized by fans of the original book. This is what I've read on the internet about it (since I haven't read the book). The film doesn't differ that much from the book, but it goes forward in such a rapid pace that most profundity is lost. Apparently, some interesting side figures who appear in the book, are omitted. And the bond between Odd and Stormy is worked out broader in book form and rather superficial in the film. However, it doesn't matter for those who haven't read the book. The film guarantees a relaxing hour filled with supernatural action, supported by an impressive sound. The end was even for me moving and emotionally portrayed.Final conclusion: I really should read that book. And for those who like a ""Hardy Boys""-like story interwoven with a bit of ""Ghost"", this movie is highly recommended. Yet there was the predominant feeling as if it was just a pilot episode of a new television series.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",Odd Thomas
30,Amari-Sali,A campy film which feels like an hour and a half summary of a cult-hit TV show's first season.,8,8 September 2013,"Anton Yelchin is one of those actors who, I feel, have a sort of Tom Cruise or Will Smith appeal. And while I haven't seen his two biggest films, Star Trek and Terminator Salvation, I am quite a fan of Like Crazy, Charlie Bartlett, House of D, and a few other of his movies. Alongside the appeal he brings to the film, we also have Willem Dafoe and Addison Timlin, mostly known for her work on Californication. Together, these three create a film which seems like a cult-hit that is either about to get canceled or was recently canceled.To begin, let's talk about the characters. Our lead is the character Odd (played by Anton Yelchin) who would have been named Todd, but there was an issue at the hospital. Odd has medium like abilities and fits his name quite well. However, rather than present some weird socially maladjusted guy, we get this strange, yet charming, young man who is highly likable. Alongside him is Stormy (played by Addison Timlin) who is his childhood sweetheart and, sort of, his partner in fighting crime. Together they make such a cute couple to the point where they are so cute it is 50's sitcom corny. The last person to note is Willem Dafoe's character who is Wyatt Porter, chief of police, who works with Odd in an unofficial capacity to solve crimes in the town of Pico Mundo.The film's story, overall, feels like a summarized version of a show's first season and even so, it really gets you into things quickly. This is done primarily through Odd breaking the fourth wall and talking to you directly throughout the movie as he introduces himself, his friends, his powers of being a medium, and his life as a short-order cook and detective. The main thing the story focuses on, outside of Odd's relationship, is his medium powers which: allow him to see the dead who have not moved onto the next life; give him clairsentience; find people he is looking for; possibly have visions of the future and see these demon-like beings known as Bodox, which remind me of the demons from Dead Like Me. Now, these Bodox play an important role for they are what gets the story rolling. You see, Bodox usually only appear as individuals when someone is going to die, but one man known as Fungus Bob Roberston (played by Shuler Hensley) has an obscene amount of them around his person. This leads to Odd trying to piece together his dreams, as well as co-worker Viola's (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw), while using his gift, in order to try to solve a series of murders, and one main mystery, which all could lead up to an utter massacre.Being completely upfront, this film is very corny and campy. The dialog has a 50s sitcom style at times, with cursing, which will make you not take things seriously, but thanks to Yelchin's charisma, and Odd breaking the 4th wall, you are kept engaged throughout the film. But, perhaps, the most interesting about the film is the story. The way Odd Thomas is written, the mystery doesn't really get all that complicated, but still has the ability to throw some twist and turns in there which make you think ""why didn't I see that?"" All the while, it tries to balance a tone of seriousness when handling death while trying to keep its campy quality consistent. Also, just to note, despite how corny their relationship was, I greatly admired Odd and Stormy's romance and how the movie used it to get you further invested into Odd as a character.But, in many ways I feel the corniness and campiness of the movie works against itself as it creates a sort of appeal. For one, Stormy and Odd's relationship is so lovey dovey that it really feels like a superficial romance. Also, as much as characters may yell and look serious when there is a murder or something similar, the campy tone of the movie makes it so that it never holds the weight you think the scene should. Add onto that, the mystery and investigation itself feels almost rushed to truly make it feel like this wasn't really written to be a movie, but perhaps a pilot or a season summary as I mentioned before. I would even compare this to Drinking Buddies, in terms of how it is written more to be a series than movie.Overall: Possible BuyThis film has the type of appeal which makes it feel like it has the makings of being a cult-hit, if it was a TV series. The reason I say that is because, as campy and corny as it is, it remains highly likable. Odd as a character shows how come Anton has the ability to do films like this and then go do blockbusters. He has the type of persona which made people like Will Smith and Tom Cruise stars, and his role in Odd Thomas is no different. Odd is eccentric, charming, and has that Veronica Mars way of looking for trouble and then when you add on Dead Like Me's campiness, it makes it so each character feels setup like you are going to see them past this movie, fall further in love with them, and ultimately it makes the film feel like a pilot with the commercials cut out. At the same time though, with it being so campy, it makes ever event which would otherwise create a deep seriousness, feel like when someone died on Dead Like Me or Pushing Daisies. Yeah, it's serious, but only really for that scene. So, overall, I think this is a possible buy for this is the first film in sometime I can imagine watching again, if just to show other people it. The ending though, I swear to you, may make you cry.",Odd Thomas

32,raulfaust,Odd feeling,3,24 August 2014,"First off, I'll start this review by saying how much I disliked this picture. The story is extremely out of sync, given that situations are bizarre and very imaginative. For some moments, it reminded me of ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"", even if the main character's thoughts were, here, a lot more insane. There is nothing to enjoy about this trip; there's no likable character or interesting situations. I know that the guy from the videostore has told me right away: ""This is a very crazy movie, be aware of that"", but the fact is that I DO enjoy crazy films, as long as they have something different, new or entertaining to offer. ""Odd Thomas"" had none, reason why I turned it off before it completed one hour of length. This is, definitely, not my cup of tea, for whatever that means.",Odd Thomas

The hero narrates and speaks with other good characters in a wisecracking way that becomes a bit twee. He's played by a really good actor, so it's still entertaining.The movie opens at full pace, and may even pack too much information in. But the ticking clock element seems to get turned off half way through, so the tension drains away, and the plot is Scooby Doo standard. Plus Willem Dafoe could do without those ridiculous lines in the sentimental ending.The only attempt at a jump scare is ... the closing the fridge door trick. I kid you not. Also the killings are sanitised - any potential scare or horror is glossed over or reduced by another wisecrack. It's entertaining, well acted and produced, but feels like it's made for a TV audience.",Odd Thomas
34,bob-rutzel-1,"Falls Flat, but Watchable",5,6 September 2014,"Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin) is clairvoyant, and can see dead people. He knows his town is in trouble when ghostly Bodachs (predators) show up as they portend very grave happenings. Odd is the only one who can see them, but if anyone can see them and looks them in the eye, they are killed. He needs to save the town. This is based upon Odd Thomas books by Dean R. Koontz and that is probably why Direct TV Movies charged $10.99 to watch. I waited until Red Box came up with $1.27.In the story Odd is his first name. Of course, when you say his full name out loud it will always seem like you are putting him down. See? Stormy (Addison Timlin) and the Police Chief played by Willem Dafoe know all about Odd's abilities and trust what he confides in them without question. I do not know Anton Yelchin but he was okay providing a narrative thru the entire story. Also, I do not know Addison Timlin who played Odd's girlfriend, Stormy. Together they had good chemistry except that their banter was weak at times. But, they looked good together. Okay, okay, she is hot. This could have been more of a comedy but the narratives and dialogues in general fell flat and didn't help the cause. So no funny moments. I did enjoy seeing Willem Dafoe playing a good guy for a change. What could have been funny, but wasn't: every time Odd contacted the Police Chief, he was always in a romantic clench with his wife. More flat moments. Odd's telephone gave off a very loud ring, and he always jumped as did I. And the music was very loud at times almost like a cannon going off for dramatic effect. It worked. I jumped then too. Doors seem to be the prop of choice in here. Many, many scenes with doors tried to be somewhat spooky with a closed door about to be opened. As I said ""tried to be."" Those scenes fell flat too. All in all this really didn't have much to do with demons as we were led to believe. So nothing scary here either. The CGI showing these Bodachs was exceptional. Near the end, these Bodachs left the scene and were probably getting ready for the next movie – remember I said ""books"" above? Their disappearance was not explained and we'll catch up with them in the next movie, I am sure. This is watchable and could have been a made-for-TV movie that falls flat. The ending was a complete surprise for me as once you come to believe Odd can see Dead People, you will not understand this ending. You'll see. Perhaps this was an ending for unlimited class discussion. You'll see. Oh, even so, you may need keep a Kleenex box handy at the end. You'll see. (5/10)Violence: Yes.

Can he dimension shift, cast spells, or round house the bad guys in the face Buffy style? No he drives from location to location having premonitions then calls the police if he finds a bad guy.The film is quirky and glib so it's not like you can expect any great performances or great plot.

Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" (2009)), who also wrote the screenplay, based on a Dean Koontz novel by the same name. It's a supernatural mystery thriller which stars Anton Yelchin as the central character of Odd Thomas, with Willem Dafoe and Addison Timlin also starring. Released in 2014, this film was made with a budget of $27 million, but was a major bomb at the box office only grossing $1.1 million. This was contrary to the writer of the source material, Dean Koontz, stating that he enjoyed the film - unfortunately though fans and critics felt that it didn't feel dark and macabre enough to be a Koontz inspiration, and the film lacked depth and development.""Odd Thomas"" lives in a small town in California. He has a psychic ability which allows him to see dead people, but he is inspired to do something about what he sees - helping people move on or out of the way. One day Odd dreams about some faceless people being ginned down by a faceless gunman, it is a dream that wear heavy on him while he's living his day-to-day life working in a local diner. One day a strange man comes to the diner, he's surrounded by 'bodachs', which are evil spirits that feed on evil and carnage. Odd can see them, despite wishing that he couldn't see them. He follows the strange man who he has nicknamed 'Fungus Bob' on account of his hair. He finds apparent evidence which suggests that Fungus Bob is going to do something bad. Odd reports this to the local police chief, played by Dafoe, who promptly has Fungus Bob followed. Lots of strange events begin to happen, some of which have been prophesised in dreams, other which are happening because of supernatural activity in the area. As people slowly start to get killed off it seems that only Odd Thomas has the ability to save the town and the people who loves, but it's not going to be easy.Anton Yelchin is great in this role; he is a perfect mix of emotions that allowed me to emphasise with his character. Prior to this I had seen him as Chekov in the ""Star Trek"" reboots (the first reboot being in 2009) and as a young Kyle Reese in ""Terminator Salvation"" (2009); both of which are roles I enjoyed his delivery in. This was really the first role I had seen him in as the main central character, and he did not disappoint. Alongside Yelchin was Leonor Varela, who I remember from ""Blade 2"", she played Odd's mother. Willem Dafoe appeared as Chief Wyatt Porter, who, as I'd expected, managed to almost steal every scene he was in with his pristine acting performance. His character knows about Odd's abilities and he tries to assist and guide Odd where possible, he comes across as wide and loving, but with a definite air of authority about him still. Addison Timlin plays ""Stormy"" Llewellyn, Odd's love interest. She does well and is convincing, she is also confided in regarding Odd's powers, and she too tries to help him as much as she can.I felt that the plot of the film was decent enough and the screenplay delivered was good. Based on work by Koontz, you would genuinely expect the story to be rich with depth and development - and I found that to be the case. Having not read the book though, I can't be sure if the film lives up the standard of the book, which in most cases of book to film doesn't always appear to be the case. The visual effects in the film were enjoyable and engaging, there are times that with a combination of the vfx and Yelchin's delivery you can really feel the fear. This is a fast-paced film which kept me hooked throughout, and with a good few twist at the end it is easy to get thrown off the scent of what is going on and how everything is going to end.If I had to pick fault, it is that at times it feels like there could be a light-hearted teen romance aspect to the film. Odd and Stormy's relationship does not seem that deep and entwined, more light-hearted and fun. From all accounts this is explored more in the book than the film. Perhaps this was one of the reasons why it did not do as well as the box office; with other book-to-film teen-supernatural action thrillers coming out regularly between 2005 - 2015, maybe this wasn't as powerful a love story as your average 'shadowhunter' experiences; or perhaps it was a darker theme than other sparkly vampire based films; or more complex than your average dystopian gameshow-for-tributes kind of film.I enjoyed this film and though it was delivered well. With a runtime somewhere between 90-105 minutes (depending on which cut you get), I would be happy to recommend this to friends. The fact that it received a 15 rating means that it is suitable for a wide range of family members. Sure, it has dark themes of supernatural, but other than that it's clean enough that you can sit a teen in front of it without too much worry.",Odd Thomas
41,gregsrants,John Dies at the End Meets The Frighteners,7,22 October 2013,"Novelist Dearn R. Koontz hasn't exactly had a stellar run at the in Hollywood. While fellow horror writer Stephen King has seen his works of The Shining, The Mist and The Green Mile all win over audiences, Koontz has had to endure seeing inferior films such as Watchers, Phantoms and Shattered carry his name in the opening credits.Things look a little more promising for Koontz with Stephen Sommers' (The Mummy) adaptation of his novel, Odd Thomas which had its Canadian Premiere last night at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival.Fright Night's Anton Yelchin stars as Odd Thomas, a young man with the ability to see the evil that surrounds us. The dead communicate to Odd Thomas and he has used this ability to assist the local police chief (played by Willem Dafoe) to solve crimes and, in some instances, stop crime before it even begins.But when stranger Bob Robertson (Shuler Hensley) comes to town, his presence is surrounded with evil – a signal that a mass killing involving the outsider is about to take place. With the town on the edge of potential ruin, Thomas and girlfriend Stormy (Addison Timlin) must quickly put together clues, one of which includes a portal to hell, in an effort to thwart the evil forces threatening the community.Best described as John Dies at the End meets Peter Jackson's The Frighteners, Odd Thomas was a very entertaining movie that had elements of fantasy, horror and thriller all wrapped up in a Koontz ball of fun.The movie benefits greatly from the experienced directing of Sommers. Having handled big action effects such as The Mummy and Deep Rising, Sommers is able to direct CGI moments with precision and the effects in Odd Thomas are top rate. The story is fairly involving as well. Subsequent research has revealed that some characters in the book have been excluded or have changed in features, but for those without a direct comparison to the source material, Odd Thomas is sure to be a film that when most catch up with it on DVD or VOD will be speaking highly of its merits.www.killerreviews.com",Odd Thomas

43,abisio,It is unbelievable this movie never got a wide release !!!!,9,7 January 2014,"Stephen Sommers has directed a few blockbusters and in my opinion he knows his game perfectly well (making a decent movie out of GI JOE is not an easy task). Dean R. Koontz is very well known writer with many movies under him. Anton Yelchin is not an A list star; but a good actor with a with a mix of sympathy and innocence. The movie has a decent budget and very acceptable FX (not like THE MUMMY or GI JOE; but do not need it either).So with such good pedigree this movie never got a proper release is completely illogical (or perhaps quite logical for Hollywood's executives standards that allow any kind of crap everywhere but blacklist everything or everyone that does not follow their rules).Odd Thomas is a young guy that can see dead people and other things of this realm. He tries to use his skills for good by helping his friend; the local police chief (Willem Defoe; always solid even with a small role) finding killers and criminals (but hiding his perception powers).One day, because of certain dreams and later events; Thomas realize something terrible is about to happen in his small town. With the help of his girlfriend and the police he will do everything possible to stop it even when things can become really tragic.The movie has an almost non-stop pace from the first scene to the surprising ending. Even people no fond of supernatural movies get tied up; because of the suspense and the way the story evolves; from funny, to violent, to romantic, to sad and back again.Yelchin; always present, carries the movie easily with his smile and this almost always funny off screen comments. Addison Timlin as his girlfriend is fine and humble like the character requires. However, it is Summers who really shines getting a lot more than expected.In brief; it is really fun, and it could be seen with kids (aside from a few disgusting scenes) there is not really gore in it.",Odd Thomas
44,kuarinofu,Solid movie,8,30 April 2018,"As I understood, this is based on a book or a series of books I've missed. So I was watching this without knowing anything beside the short synopsis from IMDB.
As the headline goes - this is a solid movie. The pacing is very reminiscent of Edgar Wright's style. It is very minimalistic, some necessary narration, but not much, lots of dialogue, but fast and always on the move, clever use of flashbacks etc. Such an approach gives the movie a good flow. One thing that was somewhat a miss was the introduction of a character 40 mins in. I guess he was important in the book and it seemed like they had no scenes for him but they still needed to feature him. The performances were handled well, especially by Yelchin, it is so sad we will not be seeing him any more.
I'd rate this 6-7 for being a solid movie, but the ending pulled a string inside me and I have to give a little more just for this.",Odd Thomas
45,ersinkdotcom,Dean Koontz's 'Odd Thomas' film is a diverting supernatural who-dun-it,8,6 March 2014,"RLJ/Image Entertainment brings Dean Koontz's best-selling supernatural thriller ""Odd Thomas"" to life for the big-screen. Judging the movie on its own merits without having read any of the novels, the low-budget movie is an entertaining ""who-dun-it"" featuring ghostly and ghastly guest stars. It feels like it might be better suited to being a weekly television series.Odd Thomas is a short-order cook in the seemingly lovely little town of Pico Mundo, California. However, both Pico Mundo and Odd Thomas harbor dark secrets. Odd has a ""gift"" for seeing dead people and sensing evil. The town is a haven for brutal murders, supernatural mayhem, and a feeding ground for the festering demonic specters known as bodachs. Odd teams up with his girlfriend Stormy Llewellyn and Detective Wyatt Porter to solve a string of killings that somehow tie together.While I was watching ""Odd Thomas,"" I was jolted by my recollection that Stephen Sommers directed it. The SAME Stephen Sommers who produced and directed the blockbuster ""The Mummy"" movies and helmed ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra."" You'd never know it from the independent atmosphere this carries.You can tell ""Odd Thomas"" was a labor of love for Sommers and the proof is in the credits. Not only did he direct, but he produced and wrote it. There are rumors of a lot of drama in production, but the director saw it through to the end and worked with the budget put before him.Although the budget might've been small in comparison to Stephen Sommers' other franchise films, the special effects of ""Odd Thomas"" are actually close to on par with those blockbusters. In comparison to the CGI seen today, they're a tiny bit aged but get the job done. The only noticeable digital creatures are the bodachs and they actually look a heck of a lot better than the Scorpion King did in ""The Mummy Returns.""""Odd Thomas"" isn't rated, but does include violence, gore, adult situations, and language. For all intents and purposes, it should hold a PG-13 rating at the most. There's nothing too graphic and no nudity is included.I felt ""Odd Thomas"" reflected some Christian beliefs well. The character speaks about how he believes in Heaven. The bodachs are obviously demonic forces that are attracted to evil, much like the fallen angels read about in the Bible. Odd also tells the killer's victims they're going to a better place. They dissolve into either glittering dust or flowers and float off after they've made peace.""Odd Thomas"" might not be as good as it should've been had it been given more financial backing. For what it is, I found the movie charming, gleefully campy in places, and ripe for another entry in the series if this one can just pay back its budget. It's not often Dean Koontz has liked the movie adaptations of his books, but he actually likes this one.""I'm just happy. You never know if anything's going to be a success or not, but I can watch this again. And the rest of them I couldn't watch again. Some of my movies I couldn't watch the first time,"" Koontz told website io9. If anyone knows if his book was adapted correctly, it would have to be the author that created the world and its characters. I still think it would work great as a weekly TV series, but I'll settle for a movie every year.",Odd Thomas

So much heart, just a joy to watch",9,8 January 2014,"Truly just bubbling over with heart, this movie really took me away, and I could not have Enjoyed myself more. Odd Thomas is just such a perfectly developed character, and the people of his town, have formed such a wonderful symbiotic relationship with him. To imagine what that bond could build to is quite fun. This movie is smart, and suspenseful, with a great mystery floating through the main story that you would not expect to work with such an observant fellow, but it does all work, and it makes for a fun ride from start to finish. Great narration from Anton Yelchin, who I really had not been a big fan of until this picture. He gives Thomas the life that he needs the expressions are perfect, and all of the cast supporting him are excellent as well.

49,dfa120374,A Really Good Entertaining Movie,7,18 January 2015,"Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin) is just a regular, small town guy....regular except for the paranormal ability to see dead people. This ability includes being able to see Bodachs - spiritual predators who show up when someone is about to die. Working with Chief Wyatt Porter (Willem Dafoe), Odd helps the police to catch different types of killers, but when his attention is caught by a stranger, and starts to see much more Bodachs than normal, Odd starts to investigate and soon realises that the small town in where he lives is in grave danger.Odd Thomas is actually a very good, supernatural thriller that has the same kind of feel as The Frighteners. After watching the start, you do feel that you may be in for a bit of a cheese-fest like The Mummy and Mummy Returns, but thankfully Odd Thomas doesn't go down that route. For one, it's actually a MUCH better film than the aforementioned films, and secondly the way that the movie unravels as the story goes on keeps your interest. Even the humour in the movie is pretty good and, again, its very much along the same kind of dark humour that is in The Frighteners.The special effects are pretty impressive and while they are done well the movie doesn't become overly reliant on them as the story is strong & interesting enough to carry the film along, which also has a few good twists along the way, especially at the end.I've not read any of the Odd Thomas books so I suppose the end won't be a surprise to anyone who's read them, but even still, if they are as enjoyable as the film then I may put them on my list of books to read.Really good movie and very much recommended.",Odd Thomas
50,billygoat1071,Joys of the Genre,7,25 July 2013,"The local distributor promotes Odd Thomas as a typical B-rated horror film. If you're not familiar with the Dean Koontz novels, Odd Thomas is actually a mystery thriller which involves supernatural beings. There are many things to be fascinated in the plot. Even for a small scale journey, the movie tends to be action packed all the way. There isn't much visual quality to impress, however it is able to be much exciting than what any major generic blockbuster would offer. Still, it's pretty conventional at the mystery and somehow too focused more on the action, but it's a fun experience when you're seeking for an adventurous ride.It's not really hard to understand every detail of the plot. The film takes the easiest way of narrating, but it may also keep your attention because Odd's little world does look like something you would root for. There is no denying how charming the setting and the characters are. The concept around it is just fascinating. Simply exploring this world already makes it enjoyable. When it proceeds to the actual plot, the investigation is quite intriguing for a while, but the film seems to be afraid that the audience might think too much through the mystery. When there's an unraveled revelation, they redundantly show off some flashbacks to make it painfully clear. It still provides some surprises, but it could have been thought-provoking in the second act.Well, the film itself is more into the aesthetics and the action, we shouldn't be blaming the filmmakers' fascination by its ghostly themes. The action may not be as physically convincing as any bigger blockbuster out there, but it tends to be all naturally ridiculous. In other parts, there's the romantic subplot between Odd and Stormy. Both of them got the charm that they needed. Even though it gets a little corny, it's also kind of hard to dislike it. The performances gave plenty of life. Anton Yelchin isn't a stranger for these kinds of roles, especially the fact that his character here is a bit similar to another role he's played in Fright Night remake(hunting monsters with his girlfriend). Yelchin did what he does best which makes the film even more entertaining.The filmmaking has its low budget feel, but the technical quality didn't underestimate the film from being fun. Yes, the special effects are not that magnificent; beyond that, the whole experience is such a thrill ride. Director Stephen Sommers doesn't really have the vanity in showing how absurd his action gets, the entire film is extremely stylish. The CGI monsters has the sense of camp, if not scary.Odd Thomas is oddly a solid film(no pun intended). The film is not really into glossy embellishments. Despite of the absurdities and the contrivance, the direction is full of energy and the performances bring delight to the story. Thought, it's definitely not for the ones who are spoiled by today's better effects, but if you can look beyond the visuals, you will able to enjoy what's charming about this vision. The choices it took is probably too crazy and corny, but there are worse things you can think of. At least it stays true to what it should be, a mystery that will make the audience curious about everything it discovers.",Odd Thomas
51,bgar-80932,Good but never great,6,6 June 2018,Odd Thomas is a good movie to me that had potential to be great. The main character to see dead people as well as see death coming to an extent. The rules aren't fully developed and it seems like it varies a little bit how everything works but that's death for you. He has a girlfriend who knows his gift as well as a detective that he helps solve crimes. There are weird creatures that show up that tell him something really bad is going to happen. The rest of the movie involves him trying to figure out where/when this bad thing is going to happen. It all comes together pretty well in the end but nothing ever stood out big time to me. The dialogue could have improved it but it felt a bit clunky at times.,Odd Thomas
52,ArchonCinemaReviews,Great acting and complete characters makes for a fun and exciting mystery,7,18 April 2015,"With so many parts in play, Odd Thomas should not work as well as it does, and that is thanks in part to the stellar acting and casting of this Dean Koontz adaptation.Odd Thomas, and yes that is his real name, leads an interesting yet ordinary life, with the exception of one secret: he has paranormal abilities. He tries to keep this hidden, but when a stranger in town brings with him a slew of ghostly bodachs (predators that feed on pain and foreshadow carnage and bloodshed) he is the only one who can see and therefore stop it.Anyone who has read a Dean Koontz novel will recognize the style immediately in this film. A bit dramatic and twisty for the sake of suspense, Odd Thomas integrates many sub-genres into this fantastical mystery. With paranormal baddies, ghosts of the whispering persuasion, and an unknown terrorist plot, Odd Thomas should not work as well as it does. And yet, it is entertaining and gripping and downright fun.Much of the success of Odd Thomas is thanks to the casting of well known faces known for acting and up and comers trying to make a name for themselves. Anton Yelchin brings a vibrancy to Odd making him feel like a real life person. And what is a protagonist without a paramour? Addison Timlin matches Yelchin's energy and their soul mate love affair transcends the screen. The supporting cast is also equally successful at bring fully formed characters and tons of chemistry into the film in a believable manner.Odd Thomas is fast paced and engaging, with an entire fantastical world explained flawlessly with the rest of the exposition. And what is a thriller without a few twists? Viewers will travel with Odd as he desperately tries to deduce and stop the imminent mass casualty that looms in his sleepy California town. This film is surprisingly more entertaining than initially expected though may be more of a hit with the younger crowd.Please check out our website for complete reviews of all the recent releases.",Odd Thomas
53,blackmamba99971,Great Detective flick,10,25 December 2013,"For some Psychic detective films this one had me very interested. Dean Koontz who has written every kind of thriller/horror novel since his career began never fails to amaze me. Odd Thomas (Anthony Yelchin) a young man who's destiny lies in seeing dead people becomes his niche in life to save those who might be destined for death. In the wake of his hidden talents creatures known as the Bodacks are demons who filter out those who dwell in evil, then find a way to get them to hell earlier if they cause so called coincidental accidents. Odd however finds out that in the midst of his dreams or visions a new kind of evil lurks within the police force where Chief Porter (Willem Dafoe) also investigates some brutal murders in the small town of Pico Mundo. The chief also thinks of Odd as a sort of surrogate son he never had and both become very close friends in order to stop the grisly murders. Together with his all time love Stormy Llewellyn (Addison Timlin) who believes in his abilities they start a chase to hunt down suspects who will be responsible for the deaths of thousands of people. All in all, I thought it was a great story, with some laughs, danger, mystery, and good music. Fine ingredients in a movie adapted from Koontz who to me is one of the all time greats of horror mysteries. I especially liked the fact they used a narrative, which to me makes for a good dick tale. Not a lot of them left with the narratives, which makes them more authentic in essence. The books are also of fine quality. The Odd Thomas series always manages to keep me riveted until the very last page. When evil lurks in the shadows only the few chosen to be knights of the light can be victorious. And with Odd Thomas you can bet he will give the best fight he can in Las Vegas.",Odd Thomas

Painfully simplistic. I am, however, now very happy that I never wasted time reading a Dean Koontz novel, which this is based on.The lead character has no consistency. A problem like that is not acting related. Odd goes from wise to retarded as the film progresses, then back and forth purely to try to create drama/thrills/tension. It looks like Stephen Sommers did what he could do with a horrible story, although there are some shockingly obvious scene cuts that someone who wasn't operating as writer, director, and producer would have caught and fixed. Another easy fix/failure was the narration by the lead character.A better name would have been Nonsense Thomas. The title was probably the result of the book marketer trying to cover up a failed character and story. Koontz is too cliché ridden to be that clever.

57,TheMarwood,Felt like an extended unaired pilot for a network TV series,3,17 May 2014,"Over-lit, without so much as a hint of atmosphere and cheap looking - this looks like something meant for broadcast on network TV. The story is about as deep as a Goosbumps episode and the chase/fight within the first 15 minutes is so inept and long, you have to wonder if the producers demanded the addition and shot it themselves. The CG is pretty simplistic, but Sommers wisely doesn't over reach with complex effects - except for a large scale digital explosion, which looks like the effects house had about 25 minutes to simulate and render. Anton Yelchin is fine as the lead and Defoe is wasted in a throw away role that could have been played by anyone. Addison Timlin is absolutely horrendous as Stormy - the perfect, quirky hot girlfriend. She comes across like a demented 12 year old girl infatuated with her first boy. Despite being madly in love with each other, these two generate the heat of a snowball. The financiers refused to pony up $35 million for prints and advertising and it's not difficult to see why. This is not big screen material and throwing good cash at Odd Thomas would not make any of it's problems go away.",Odd Thomas

The first part of the movie they show how Thomas is strange and how he doesn't fit in the society. That part is very awesome. Thomas sees dead people and monsters who want people dead. The cgi is not very great and it looks like the movie Frighteners. Even though Anton Yelchin plays his role very, very well. When his girlfriend comes in the movie, the movie gets cheesy. She has to show that she loves Thomas and that he is an ordinary guy. She overacts and does not do the movie any good.I have been a fan of Willem Dafoe since Platoon so I watched this movie because of him. The movie did not disappoint, even better, it exceeded my expectations. Dafoe plays the father figure of Thomas (it was a pity he wasn't his real father) and did that very well.

61,Mike-DD,Book fans can rest well,9,15 March 2014,"I am a fan of Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas series; it is in fact my favorite Koontz series of books. So I was apprehensive about the film adaptation, especially when Odd is played by someone I did not know too well - Anton Yelchin, and Hollywood does not have a history of producing good Koontz adaptations.However, I have to agree he was a good fit for the role. He carried off the look I always imagined Odd Thomas to have - good looking but not handsome, brooding smile, a face that has lost its innocence yet retains a pureness about it. Even the hair and the gait seemed to fit. He can evidently enjoy life yet half the time he has this look on his face like he is expecting trouble. Can you blame him though? His inperviousness to the other girls' charms was also so good to see on screen. The only 'fault' I can find is that he seems too serious at times.Addison Timlin as Stormy took some getting used to though. The chemistry that Odd and Stormy had in the book wasn't completely missing, but it wasn't perfect either. She was supposed to be his foil, but that subtlety was lost in the film.Willem Dafoe as Chief Porter was another that took some getting used to. He's too sexed up compared to the book version. Sex was only inferred to in the book; in the movie there is implied love-making - I didn't see the purpose of including implied love scenes except to let the audience see a bit of skin.Patton Oswalt as Ozzy was brilliant though. He's a bit smaller than I imagined but a few seconds after his entrance, it's like you've always imagined him that way.The Fungus Bob character was exaggerated though. Pity they caricatured the character, and it lost the movie a point because it distracted rather than enhanced the film.The adaptation was generally a faithful one, yet even though you already know the story, you continue to hope what happens doesn't. The scene where he realises Stormy is dead is one of the most heartbreaking I've seen on screen, Anton playing the vulnerable heartbroken trying-to-stay- strong Odd perfectly.This is one of the better adaptations of Koontz's books, and this is one that appeals to many, especially those not too fond of the horror genre.",Odd Thomas
62,plasticanimalz,Meh,6,2 April 2014,"The trailer looked much better than the delivered product. It inspired me to read the book which was a page turner and I enjoyed. The movie was sort of like the director's paint-by-numbers of the book without the emotions or much of the suspense. The film on a whole looked pretty good and flowed well...it was just sort of empty and lacking in depth. And there wasn't enough eye candy to make it just a fun, dumb movie. My girlfriend who didn't read the book was locked into her iPad for the most of the film (a bad sign), and said the same thing, which is, she didn't care about the characters or really feel anything for them, so, she lost interest, for the most part.The director was also the writer and the producer, so, not sure if he was a fan of the book, and it said he was an ""acclaimed"" director, but I've never heard of him and he seems, not bad, but pretty much a beginner who has some hurtles to conquer. Like some male directors, he understands how to make it look and flow but does not seem to understand character emotion or motivation, which, is like drinking a flat soda. If you don't understand emotion, get over your ego and hire someone to help you with where you lack. For example, the opening scene of the book where you find out the girl is dead and who her killer is is mysterious and emotional. In the movie you immediately knew there was something off about the little girl. In the book you didn't, which was part of the suspense. In the book the killer is an awkward guy who once you find out what he's done, even though it's terrible, you sort of feel for the guy, though, want him to pay. In the movie he's just some normal looking, acting guy and so it's left up to Odd to act out the scene without much to work off of. So, when he gets emotional and the audience is supposed to realize what the killer has done, you don't really care. That's when my girlfriend picked up her iPad. This goes on in this manner throughout the film.There are also some odd choices the director makes. Odd doesn't predict the future or have powers to read people's minds in the book as is conveyed in the movie. He just has strange dreams that give him information, gets feelings, sees dead people, and sees these evil spirits that follow future death (kind of like in 'Dead Like Me' but we won't get into that). He's your basic psychic kind of like Whoopie Goldberg in 'Ghost,' who is able to do detective work through his powers, and that's about it. The scene where the bowling employees who have no faces chase Odd in the beginning of the film, was sort of a bad turning point for me that the film was not going to improve much. It was weird, a bit cheesy, and it was unclear if he was seeing this in real-time or having a dream. That could have been executed much better. And why did the manicurist die? So you could see one of the director's killer's faces once? I feel like the director added something just to add something and it did not further the plot and just added up to one more dead body and one more killer, which, I did not understand the point of him. There was much more emotional impact in the book knowing the cops wanted to physically cut down people with automatic weapons in a mall. Having one of them become the bomber doesn't carry much weight or emotion.Basically, the director followed the book for the most part and when he made a limited few choices on his own they were either pointless, didn't make sense, or took away from the emotional impact of the story, or didn't really add anything to it. It's kind of like, if the book was Coke (or beverage of your choice), the director tried to recreate it exactly but decided to not add the sugar or the fizz. Basically, he recreated an identical story without the flavor.",Odd Thomas

I used to read Dean Koontz when I was younger, but got tired of all the clichés. No matter what you think about the book, the film should be judged separately! It is the only way to enjoy it! So if you are hell bent and religious about the book having to be materialized in every way into the film, you might as well not see it. One reviewer even gave the movie 1/10 because the girl dies, and the hero SHOULD ALWAYS get the girl. I see it the other way around. If he was so upset with that, I wonder how he handles real life? At the very end, when the soul of the dead girl walks away, she smiles back at him. I loved that! How she is emotional and at the same time smiling. Almost fell in love with her! :)",Odd Thomas

The only thing I really don't like about it is how much they crammed the ""love"" thing down your throat, the whole way through. To the point where, at about half way, I guessed what was going to happen at the end. They really, REALLY want you to beleive that these two people love each other more than anyone has ever loved another person, in this history of time.

The film is about a guy called Odd Thomas (yes, thats his name), and he can see dead people. But he soon notices that there is a lot of activity going on - more than usual. Even though there was a bit of CGI in this movie, I still found it to be entertaining. The story is pretty good, and the end is a bit sad, a nice plot twist. I enjoyed this movie.

The first two Harry Potter films under the direction of Chris Columbus come to mind. Sheer perfection. Odd Thomas fits very nicely in that niche. For all of us Odd Thomas fans, those of us who could hardly wait for every new Odd Thomas book to come out, this is a gratifying transformation to film The casting is excellent with Anton Yelcin as Odd, Addison Timlin as the beautiful Stormy, and Willem Defoe as the sheriff. Could not ask for better. The script stayed faithful to the book, which is exactly what we want. As in those previously mentioned Harry Potter books – we want to see our imaginations fulfilled on that big screen, no surprises, just satisfaction. The only difference here is that although the ending of the book make me sad, the ending of this picture simply made me cry.

It has the feel of a dark teen action/adventure flick (apparently it is adapted from a teen novel, after all): not very serious, always with the quirky humor that kinda appeals to the nostalgic side of mine. It helps that the characters are not the irritating teen stereotypes most modern films tend to force upon the viewer, but rather likable and just enough witty to be believable. It never tries to be more than it really is; this is a fun, unpretentious film and it plays accordingly.The movie develops its concept enough to make it work well, without glaring holes in the plot and always with a deceptively dark undertone; the CGI for the ghosts are good too. The plot moves along nicely while taking the more teen aspect of the characters in stride (ie.: the romance scenes between Odd and Stormy don't really break the flow). The twists are good: not overly predictable, but not nonsensical or asspulls either. They keep the story always interesting, and the final one in special is surprisingly emotional.The cast is good. Anton Yelchin is likable and charismatic, Addison Timlin is adorable and has great chemistry with him, Willem Dafoe is good as usual, and the others are also above average. They never go for a pretentiously philosophical approach; they know this is just a fun teen flick, and thankfully act accordingly.One surprise I had was seeing Stephen Sommers name in the director and screenplay credits. I've never once liked his popcorn flicks; maybe this could mean a turn for the better for him?",Odd Thomas

Pico Mundo was near enough exactly what I imagined whilst reading it. The movie is fast paced and choc-full of great performances. Odd and Stormy are so brilliant together, you can actually feel it. Dafoe is excellent as well. I actually remember reading the book for the first time on holiday in Ibiza and I threw the book off the wall (causing my fiancée to shout ""are you okay?""). I was completely stunned, and the movie does it as well. There's no way anyone should give any spoiler reviews on this movie. Let them see it for themselves.

Unfortunately it was all downhill from there.My first big complaint is the dialogue. It was just way too smug. Every other line was trying to be cute or clever and it was never even a little amusing. It was a grating distraction throughout the whole movie.The second complaint was the way the story unfolded. Normally in a mystery movie hints and twists are doled out at regular intervals to keep the movie interesting. In this one nothing is really revealed until the end (the main character just bumbles about for most of the movie) and when everything is brought into the open it's just not all that interesting and plays out really obviously.",Odd Thomas
81,Mccadoo,Meh adaption of Koontz's novel,4,16 April 2021,"I've read all the Odd Thomas books and the first was by far the best one in the series. They fell off steadily from there but that's another story.I'd never heard of this movie and just stumbled across it last night looking for something to watch on Netflix...or Hulu, can't remember which. Having never known that the first book had been made into a film it was a pleasant surprise and I can't say I was hugely disappointed but neither was I blown away by it.Anton Yelchin did a fairly good job as Odd, he's not what I pictured while reading the books but he's not far off and it is a difficult role to pull off. I think he was hamstrung by the writer leaving out much of the wit and humor that Odd's narration in the book had.Stormy Llewelyn was a different story all together. Her character is pivotal to the story in the book, every bit as much as Odd's is. One problem with the movie is that they never capture that and the actress never even comes close to capturing the character. Of course had they cast an actress who could actually, you know, act that would have helped immensely. I can't recall the actresses name but she was really pretty bad.Novels are always difficult to translate into films and this novel in particular is, well, odd. My biggest problem with this movie is that they failed to capture the atmosphere of the book, it's eccentricities and the depth and meaning of the relationship between Odd and Stormy. Those were the things that made the book so special, and that I think were missing in the subsequent novels. I suppose it was a good try but it just missed the mark.It's obvious that they left it open for subsequent movies that never materialized, either due to poor box office (possibly due to the lack of any kind of advertising campaign?) or because of Yelchin's untimely death.",Odd Thomas

85,jaguiar313,Fun book based supernatural thriller.,7,26 March 2014,"Even someone like me who has been watching movies for almost 5 decades and can be very cynical about them at times can be pleasantly surprised occasionally by a movie I wasn't expecting much from. Odd Thomas is one of those pleasant surprises. Based on a book of the same name and the following series of novels by Dean Koontz, Stephen Sommers' adaptation tells the story of Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin) an eccentric young fellow who lives in Pico Mundo, a small town in California, and has a very unique talent. He is a clairvoyant who not only sees dead people but, other unearthly spirits as well. Odd Thomas his real name uses his special gifts to not only bring justice to those whose deaths are caused by foul play but, to thwart evil in general whenever it rears it's ugly head. He has a beautiful, loving girlfriend Stormy (Addison Timlin) who understands his powers and is very supportive and acts as a sidekick and a good friend in the local police chief (Willem Dafoe) who is grateful to Thomas' ability to find the guilty and prevent heinous acts before they are committed. But, there is an evil brewing in Pico Mundo signaled by the appearance of a strange man (Shuler Hensley) surrounded by demons and a rash of nightmares suffered by Odd, and some close to him, that foretell of a coming doom a doom that even Odd Thomas may not be able to stop. But, Odd is going to try, even if it costs him his life. Despite being a far smaller film then Mummy and G.I. Joe director Stephen Sommers is used to, he brings his creative energy and fine-tunes his over the top style to give Odd Thomas a fast paced and eccentric tone that perfectly fits the material. He also creates some very creepy moments with his visual eye and crafts some very tense and suspenseful sequences especially in the nail-biting last act. But, what really made Odd Thomas a special treat for me was the combination of Sommers' witty script banter and the wonderful work from his cast, especially lead Anton Yelchin. Yelchin creates a very likable hero who is saddled with a great burden and yet, not only uses it to do good and defeat evil but, is actually happy to do so. The banter between he and adorable leading lady Addison Timlin really creates a delightful character dynamic between the two and totally makes the relationship between this strange yet noble young man and his spunky and fiery girlfriend work. It's very effective and makes you really care about both of them. The same goes when either character is on screen with Dafoe. The dynamic between the three characters is a delight to watch and really is what makes an already good supernatural suspense thriller even more enjoyable. Timlin and the veteran Dafoe shine in their parts and are great support for what is Yelchin's show, one he carries to perfection. Shuler Hensley is also creepy and unsettling as ""Fungus Bob"" Odd's name for the man who triggers the events of the film but, he is just the tip of the iceberg and I will say no more as the less you know going in, the better it draws you into Odd's attempt to uncover the diabolical plot in the making. Odd Thomas is an odd and off-beat but, very effective film from a writer/director usually more at home with bigger, more comic book style stories. But, here he shows he can also take things down a few notches and gives us some chills and entertainment on a smaller and more intimate scale. He can also gives us some very endearing and three dimensional characters to go with his story. And this book-based story of evil, both supernatural and human created, and the young man who stands in it's way, is very entertaining if anything. A really fun and very pleasant surprise. Shame this flick is getting dumped unceremoniously onto home media when so much junk gets a theatrical release.",Odd Thomas

When a strange man Odd eventually calls ""Fungus Bob"" comes into town, followed by Bodachs, creatures that feed on pain and fear in times of great catastrophe, Odd believes Hell-on-Earth is about to arrive in their town of Pico Mundo. So, with the help of his girlfriend Stormy (Addison Timlin) and Sheriff Wyatt Porter (Willem Dafoe), Odd does whatever he can to prevent a slaughter the world would never forget.Odd Thomas is the most surprisingly entertaining and incredible thriller i have ever seen. I did read the book before i saw the film, but that did not prepare me for how accurate the film would be. Sure, there are some truly fantastic book-to-film adaptations, and there are bad ones, but even with the changes from book to movie, Odd Thomas was everything i hoped it would be, and more. Stephen Sommers, who wrote and directed Odd, was in his A-game here, beating out his previous blockbusters The Mummy, Mummy Returns and Van Helsing, all of which were fun and enjoyable, but not as thought-provoking or emotional as Odd was. Anton Yelchin was just incredible as Odd Thomas, a guy who knows how dangerous the world is and how precious his ability is, and knows he is truly odd. Addison Timlin was actually very good as Stormy Llewellyn, Odd's girlfriend. The character really added to the character development and emotional investment the audience had towards Odd, and Stormy herself. Willem Dafoe was great as Wyatt Porter, even having a bit of witty comedy attached to his character. The visual effects were astounding, especially for a low-budget, limited theater film. The cinematography was good, the music was fitting, and the script was just fantastic; it didn't insult your intelligence, it was fresh, and it didn't feel familiar. It had its own pacing (which was odd, no pun intended, really) and the camera work was just incredible; Sommers knows how to put slow- motion to good use.Odd Thomas is a strange, dark and somewhat comical thriller that does what some big Hollywood blockbusters can't; take a story that literally reaches apocalyptic heights, with supernatural elements thrown in, and ground it in reality. I really hope Stephen Sommers and Anton Yelchin get to make the sequel because this movie was a truly spectacular thriller that everyone should at least check out.8/10 Stars",Odd Thomas

This adaptation was as good as it could get in the time frame of a movie. I went into it convinced I'd hate it--because Odd Thomas is an old friend and nobody could ever capture the story on film well enough to suit me. And I was dead-ass wrong. Given the constraints of a film vs. a novel, this was done exceptionally well. The only thing I really missed was Ozzie's role, which was summarily dismissed, but seeing as that was secondary to the story, it was okay. And I'm not sure if it was Willem Dafoe's performance or just the story itself, but the ending--with Odd realizing what was going on with Stormy--really got to me. The acting was solid, all the way around, but I was especially impressed with the kid who played Odd Thomas and the kid who played Stormy. All in all, a fantastic job translating a novel into film. I'm a very hard-sell and a very brutal critic, but for what this is, it's great.

The truth is, while King consistantly comes up with original threats, Koontz seems content to recycle plots from 70s made-for-TV thrillers. This is a perfect example of that. In this movie, a guy who can see ghosts has a vision that his town is in danger, and then goes on a dull adventure trying to stop it. This kind of plot was very common on the sorts of tv movies that I mentioned earlier, and there's a very good reason why it isn't common anymore: if you've seen one psychic powers themed thriller (because let's face it, nothing in this movie is scary, nor do I think that that's the intention of it), you've seen them all.

It has Willem Dafoe.
It has a guy who looks a little like the modern Peter Parker to me.Detective movie meets the supernatural world. Felt a bit like it was based off of a comic book in regards to its narration, comedy style, and eccentricities.Quirky. All the characters have cute weird names. A lot of the comedy didn't make me laugh, but it usually made me smile.I figured out who a bad guy was at the half way point of the movie. I do wish they had covered that up a bit better so it would've been more of a surprise. However maybe I've just watched too many movies and so can detect these things like a sixth sense at this point.The little scares, like a guy suddenly being behind a door for example, as if to give us a jump scare...well they didn't work.The ending is quite well done and enjoyable though I did indeed cry. It was rather beautiful actually. Despite my having anticipated some of the movie's main surprises; there were one or two of which I failed to see coming.Glad I watched it. Overall a pleasant odd movie that moves at a quick pace and is over before you know it even though it is the same length as most movies.

Two lovers are entwined in a fight with demons, ghosts & other paranormal situations. Odd has the ability to see & interact with the otherside using his abilities he helps the local police chief (played brilliantly by Willam Defoe) & his community against a string of murders & unsolved cold cases. Unlike most films that are based off of their novel counterpart, this one is almost 100% true to the actual book which is a breath of fresh air...my only complaint is some of the other characters (ghosts included) are used as bit supporting parts unlike in the novel which isn't rare as you all may know. Other than that, from the opening sequence, the amazing opening music track which follows throughout the film all the way to the lovable characters and the almost perfect dialogue. This movie has it all one would expect to see, their is even a nice bit of cockroaches, blood & gore as well to quench the thirst or make you cringe.I'm gonna go out on a limb & say that I predict this movie to possibly spin off another sequel, or a TV series. It has so much potential to go further than just this one film.",Odd Thomas

I have two major complaints, one is the dialogue is just plain bad, super stilted and sophomoric. Fault two is Addison Timlin is terrible. Her poor acting, coupled with the atrocious dialogue destroy any of this movies redeeming qualities, which are few enough anywaysI've never read any of the books, and this movie makes me wonder if they would be worth my time. If they're half as bad as the movie, I think I'll skip them.",Odd Thomas

104,The-Plague,"In a small California town, a clairvoyant diner cook prepares for a massive tragedy he believes will soon occur.",7,9 June 2014,"Anton Yelchin (Charlie Bartlett) is back in another thriller following the the remake of 'Fright Night' in which he starred in 2011. Yelchin dawns the role of Odd Thomas in this film adaptation of Dean Koontz's book of the same name. Odd, is for lack of a better term, an odd guy. He keeps his life as simple as possible by not owning a vehicle and taking a menial job as a short order cook at a diner, but that is only to balance out the complications that come with seeing dead people. Odd uses his abilities to serve and protect as some sort of supernatural sheriff, but when a strange man enters his diner surrounded by an unnaturally large group of bodachs (ghostly predators who feed on pain and destruction), Odd realizes that his town is in serious danger.Now I know what you are thinking, ""another movie where the main character can see dead people, really?!"" but let me assure that Anton Yelchin plays a much more badass clairvoyant than Haley Joel Osment. In the movie, Odd is a skilled fighter who walks towards danger when most people are running in the other direction. While I have not read the Dean Koontz book and cannot comment on whether this is an accurate adaptation, I can safely say it is an enjoyable movie. Yelchin's performance as Odd really shows how far he has come as an actor since 'Charlie Bartlett,' and leaves no question as to why he landed a role in the new Star Trek series.A movie is not made good by one man alone, and even Odd has his own paranormal pit crew. Yelchin is joined by Addison Timlin (Stand Up Guys) who plays Stormy Llewellyn, Odd's way too hot for him girlfriend, and Police Chief Wyatt Porter who is played by Willem Dafoe. Police chief Porter and Stormy are the only two people in the movie that know Odd's secret, and they support him in his supernatural endeavors. This movie was a redeeming performance for Willem Dafoe, renewing some of my faith in his acting abilities that I lost after seeing the Spiderman franchise. Addison Timlin, a young actress with a reasonable amount of performances under her belt, plays a convincingly genuine girlfriend who leaves guys asking, ""I don't have nearly as much baggage as Odd, where is my girl like her?!"" 'Odd Thomas' is one of those rare gems that I have discussed in earlier reviews; one of those movies I probably would have never come across without a Netflix account. From the opening scene to the ending credits I was lost in a world where a guy spends his days helping ghosts and still has time to make a hell of a pancake. This movie has two acting up and comers and one veteran, and let's be honest, a strong story line adapted from a best selling book doesn't hurt.",Odd Thomas
105,andrew_jakobs,Excellent popcorn movie,10,17 September 2013,"Yep, definitely a Stephen Sommers movie. Action, comedy, tension and especially tempo... For me it was the best popcorn movie of 2013 (still a few months to go, so who knows).. Stephen Sommers shows what he's really good at, creating excellent popcorn movies which keep you at the edge of your seat from start to finish, not a moment does it get boring...I'm not gonna tell anything about the story, you'll have to see it for yourself, but if you like Peter Jackson's ""the frighteners"" you'll also gonna love this one...And I never read the book(s), so I cannot tell if it has anything in common with the books, but I certainly don't care, because if the books are anything like the movie I might even consider reading them..Hopefully it will get enough money for a sequel (but not a crap one like the one to Stephen Sommers last movie GIJOE (part 2 really sucked in comparison to the first one IMHO))..",Odd Thomas
106,rhaynes1974,Fabulously Fresh and Funny,7,7 July 2013,"Anton Yelchin is a very likable performer and Odd Thomas cashes in on his screen personality in spades. Stephen Sommers, who's been away from the directors chair for way too long, pens a witty and fresh screenplay that zips along and keeps the audience thoroughly entertained every step of the way.The one liners are spouted fast and furiously, the dialogue sparkles and there are plot twists and turns a plenty. The film defies being classified into any one genre. It's a little horror, a little fantasy, a little science fiction and a little mystery, none of it boring or expositional.It's also great to see Dafoe doing a little mainstream fluff piece for a change. But just as you think you know exactly where this film is going, it surprises you yet again and takes a U-turn in another direction. I realise the target market here are probably teens, but I must confess that I loved it.A very solid 7 out of 10.",Odd Thomas

Apparently some characters and story lines are omitted from the movie. Parts of the movie are a bit slow. Plot is not overwhelming. Plot is just a bit odd for a movie; more suitable for a teen book (i.e. the source here). Acting is OK, and it's watchable, but just not great (unless you are already a fan of the book(s)).",Odd Thomas
109,killgamers,Great Movie,8,30 June 2013,"I have not read the book. Though I did enjoy this film a lot.Yet it was not really amazing until I got to the message during the ending. Which for me makes this film a must see before you die! The script, acting, visuals and story all fine. However I wished it had been longer, plus a little bit more realistic/darker. It just seemed a little too glossy.Basically this film could have been made into 5 movies, not a TV series for it deserved the good actors and visuals only movies can afford.Shame really for the story was better than most trilogy/box sets around.All in all a great movie one to watch with a partner, bottle of white and a nice big bowl of pop corn! :D",Odd Thomas

It did not matter. My wife and I were blown away by how fun this movie was. Very likable lead characters, no unnecessary tangents or messages besides just good versus evil, just enough humor, scares, romance, and action. The main character was sweet, sensitive, unselfish, empathetic, and tough as nails. A real hero that you care for. This movie had a feel like Romancing the Stone, Big Trouble in China Town, and the Ghost and Mr Chicken, just a charming movie.I was trying to predict the plot and did not come close. I advise you not to do the same, just sit back and enjoy the ride. Warning - be prepared for a tug of your heart.",Odd Thomas
111,SeakDub,Watch and be ODDLY Amazed!,9,30 July 2016,"Before I start on the review, I have not read the book and will now go out and pick up the book because of how spectacular the movie turned out.Somehow this movie turned out to not be what I expected, but for all the better. I pictured some zombies and bad CGI and other things. I don't think there was a single part I didn't love. The movie had a ton of elements from the creatures, powers Odd has, the story, the who did it, and my favorite the humor that fits perfectly into place with it all. If you have been skipping this movie or putting it off, just go right for it. I kept putting it off and was so glad I finally got around to watching it. I would have to call this movie a hidden gem. Never heard anyone talk about it nor saw any trailers. I only came across it due to Netflix having it. So if you are checking out the reviews because you yourself are wondering about what this movie might be. Simply put, watch it. I would have given it a perfect 10 but went with a 9 instead due to movies that are 10 I tend to re-watch and love. Now I very much liked this movie, but can't say I would watch again. It was amazing to see for the first time but some movies it isn't as intense a second time. I would still enjoy it just not love watching it again. So with a 9, I still have to say that it is a perfect movie. With Anton Yelchin who plays Odd Thomas, loved him. Absolutely adored him. Besides Star Trek(2009) I cannot say what other movie I saw him in or remember at least. Which surprised me to see what a truly talented actor he was. And with his passing, which hurts to see such a young life gone and what other movies he could have gone on to perfect. He made this movie go the extra mile.",Odd Thomas
112,madpigmadpig,"Overall, surprisingly well done",8,4 July 2018,"Overall, surprisingly well done. The characterizations are just expository enough to be good without being too upfront. The acting is mostly fairly good, especially by the Anton Yelchin (who also did well in the recent faux Star Trek films) and Willem Dafoe (who always does a good job). I would be willing to watch a sequel. That said, the movie does have some flaws. Some of its special effects are too gross for kids to watch (the faceless people, a couple of the roach stunts), which is a pity because it would otherwise make a good kids' movie. Also, I have a bone to pick with the writing of the ending *spoiler alert from here on out* Having Odd and Stormy being able to kiss/touch when she's a ghost breaks the rules the movie set up only a couple of scenes before. Also, the ending fanfare scenes of the townspeople cheering Odd and the part where Stormy dissipates into butterflies didn't fit the feel of the rest of the film and took all the wind out of the movie's flow and rhythm. That's just bad writing. Here's the fix I would have suggested: Firstly, it's illogical that Odd forced the gal with the kids to leave but made no effort to save Stormy before the bad stuff went down. He should have told her to go, and then maybe she could have been distracted a little too long by trying to make the customers leave first. Then, in the moment when Odd steps into the ice cream shop and sees Stormy stand, causing his heart to lift and him to smile, the next beat should have been him walking towards her and her trying to speak to him and but being unable to. Then, just as the blow of the realization that she's a ghost hits him, the other ghost appears to notify him it's not over yet. There would be a brief, soul-crushing moment where Stormy urges him that he needs to follow the other ghost, and after the big action sequence she could come back later to pull him from unconsciousness in the hospital and say a proper goodbye then. See? Better, right? Well, I think so anyway.",Odd Thomas
113,tomas-344-902574,"Peculiar movie, don't understand the rave reviews",5,9 July 2013,"This was a peculiar movie. Definitely did not fit the standard cliché ""supernatural thriller"" or ""superhero"" story. I really didn't know what to expect. One thing none of the other reviews mentions is that there is definitely a cheesy teen novel feel to it all. Basically, the main character is likable from the first moment, by everybody, all the action goes into his favor, he has a supernatural gift that everybody seems to be okay with, and even the police chief seems to love him. He already has the girl of his dreams (boring). It has a certain infantile ""everyday-hero"" feel that is lacking the conflict in reality of how authority (ie the police) would find him nuts and his methods of dealing with these people he catches as vigilante. It all has a strong youth-oriented fantasy/make-believe feel. It seems like something a 13 year old boy could enjoy, but didn't feel very adult oriented. I find it bothersome, though, that it's just so easy for ""Odd"" to do his thing and succeed. It gives young viewers/readers the sense that life actually goes well/easily for those who do good and/or are weird. It's misleading to teens who are looking for some direction, that life is that easy. Life is hard. Being a hero is hard. Being accepted as different or 'freakish' is hard, in reality most people will scorn you as a freak for being different. Having an unusual ability is often a curse. Basically the total opposite of hero movies like the recent Batman trilogy. Either way, the hero's journey without the tribulation/struggle is not a full journey at all. But perhaps this movie was just trying to be a hip 'thriller' than some hero movie.Everything worked out so well for ""Odd"" that it really didn't fit a typical hero story. You don't need to be an action movie to be a hero story. Any story with a 'good guy' trying to do something important (ie stop a mass slaughtering) is a hero story of some sort.There was one scene that Odd was hauling a dead body of a 225lb+ man. I don't know if it was done deliberately, but it was laughable bad. The shape of the wrapped body (typical average build) was entirely different than that of the actual person (a heavyset guy). Blatantly a generic ""dummy"" inside. Then there is Odd's ""super human strength"" being able to pull this HEAVY dead body of a fat man over a ledge and then pick up the whole body with two hands, like it was a sack of potatoes. It was a really awful joke. But whatever.Overall it was moderately enjoyable but I would not say remotely that it was something I'd see again. Not like something like Butterfly Effect or Sixth Sense. The corniness and total lack of conflict/struggle just rubs me the wrong way. After the movie I just don't feel like it's changed me in any way or that I've learned anything.The twist ending is a bit unexpected given the otherwise corniness, but a bit cliché if you've seen enough psychological thrillers. A tragic twist to it all at the last second, just to yank on the viewers emotional nerves for effect I suppose. Not really any purpose on than to frustrate you with an ending you really did not want. If there is one formula it's following it's that a largely positive movie has to have at least one part to the ending that is tragic. I just found it annoying.Whether it's true to the novel(s), I dunno. Its's definitely not what I expected, even not after reading the reviews. I thought it's worth warning other viewers, though, of it's peculiar beat. For those who don't have much tolerance for cheesy teen novels (Beautiful Creatures comes to mind), it might be worth passing on. But I'm sure there are those who love the stories and will love the movie.",Odd Thomas
114,sandiglendinning,Mysterious fun that everyone can enjoy,7,3 July 2013,"Odd Thomas is an enigma, his mum was a little bit gifted and got locked up for being a loon. He lives in a strange little town called Poca Mundo where he works as a fry cook. He has a lovely girlfriend called Stormy and lots of pals. Odd has a nice normal life for the most part, aside from the fact that he sees dead people. Accepting that he has a gift Odd has decided to embrace his special talent and try to do good things with it. This is not always straightforward though, as we come to find out!Odd Thomas is an adaptation of the Dean Koontz book of the same name, one of the strengths of this film is that it is populated by a diverse selection of quite likable and quirky characters (some alive and some dead!) Odd is an original protagonist and the story is fantastical, mysterious and well-paced. You will find a bit of everything in this film, action, suspense, romance a little bit of horror and some laughs too. Not very many films balance all of the above equally but this one seems to manage where others do not. Performances are reasonable throughout, however they are hindered occasionally by a script that may possibly be too direct an adaptation from the book and too literal for film. This aside this is a very entertaining diversion, which most people will take something positive from. The plot is a little bit tame for my personal horror-preference however, Odd Thomas would make a good TV series or franchise and I would be surprised if it didn't go that way eventually.A whimsical and fun experience, watching Odd Thomas is a good way to spend a couple of hours unwinding. It's suitable for most viewers over the age of 12 and has enough about it to keep teenagers interested as well as adults. As a film it is just scary enough to keep the kids jumpy without anybody peeing themselves or being permanently traumatised. A great alternative to the predictable blandness and CGI stupidity of Twilight, give it a go- and read the book if you feel adventurous!",Odd Thomas
115,tellstar,Nicely done genre film,8,20 October 2013,"I have never read an Odd Thomas book or story. However, this film surprised me with its combination of charm, snappy dialogue and nice performances from all concerned. If anything, this is a direct descendant of 1940s film series like I Love a Mystery in tone, pace and dialogue. It's a modern film set in a town straight out of those older movies, populated by wise-cracking characters, greasy spoon diners, ice cream parlours, and a noir-tinged underbelly. The film has its heart in the right place and avoids the harsh edge embraced by other current genre films. I believe Odd Thomas could be shown to most older kids without really worrying that they are going to see something blatantly offensive. With all of the poor and thoughtless films that are currently making it to the big screen, why did this one fail to receive wide theatrical release?",Odd Thomas
116,pietroschek,"Slightly off, but indeed a Solid movie & Good Book to Screen Adaptation",7,24 June 2015,"*** SPOILERS INCLUDED! ***First of all, I fully agree with the reviews here at IMDb saying 'Solid Movie' and 'Good Adaptation'. Actually my only problem is that we live in an age which has scientifically proved that the supposedly psychic abilities of Odd Thomas are not psychic at all.While the story remains noteworthy among all the stupid, lacking, and faked-footage dirt dished at us as an audience, it would not be fair to leave unmentioned that the protagonist is a younger man of very low education.His explanations are subjective and flawed. While this, in a way, is true for all of us humanoids on earth, it began to pester me, when in the movie he tried to explain incidents the paranormal way. Intuition plus what is known as visualization (or delusional psychosis) really can explain it all more plausible and more realistically.Now a protagonist acting heroic because his delusions drive him through a boring and underpaid routine existence must not be bad, and the story and its characters were actually pretty likable. It is simply that the story could have gone from good to great, if it hadn't reduced itself by in example the mentioned insistence of paranormal or psychic abilities. They were not needed to make this an entertaining movie, so I expect them to be part of the authors or screenplay-writers 'gusto'. Taking the good with the bad (or utterly insane) I still consider it a better and worth-watching movie. Bye.",Odd Thomas

From start to finish it is filled with cheese and cringe. It tries to be serious and/or clever and falls short constantly.

And not in a good way for a horror movie. It's just plain terrible.Right from the off, I felt uncomfortable, knowing this was shaping up to be a corn-filled turd. And that was in the first five minutes! Right from the start, we are confronted by a ridiculous chase sequence, that goes on too long and then is just brushed under the carpet like nothing happened.The actors seem to be struggling to act convincingly the entire time. I don't think this is their fault however. The script is so corny, and teen TV show orientated, even screen heavy-weights like Dafoe can't make it work. Some of the lines in this movie, wouldn't be out of place in an episode of Hannah Montana! Apparently everyone in this one horse town, speaks like ""hip"" teenagers. Even the police chief!The visual effects are solid enough (with some low budget moments), but the real problem is atmosphere. This movie has none. The scenes are all so well lit, it's almost as if there is a lighting crew following Odd and his friends around the town! Which of course there is, but we aren't supposed to KNOW it! Even at night it's like daytime! This means there is no tension or fear, which the book was full of.Long story short, this feels like a TV episode (and not a good breaking bad/game of thrones TV show, think more 90's TV). The actors tried their best, but there was no rescue from that script, and the whole affair was let down by total lack of atmosphere and pacing.I would like to thank all the positive reviewers for wasting an afternoon my life!

The story isn't something over complicated, but the mystery it creates as it tells said story, is engaging.The characters are actually well done, leading with Oddie,... who lives up to his namesake.

I liked finally getting a visual of the bodachs. Somehow, I don't see the Dafoe as the sheriff though.I would love to see a film about the adventures of Christopher Snow.

The story was really engaging, acting was great from Odd and Stormy and great chemistry between them, you felt like they really were lovers. Nice plot twists, it's not going to be a blockbuster and win academy awards, almost as many plot holes as World World Z but it was much better than I expected, very enjoyable, no dull moments and this will be joining my DVD collection when it comes out for sure. The ending was very good... It's pretty obvious there's a telly series (or string of follow-up movies) wanting to be made :-)",Odd Thomas
132,ArdourFilm,Perfect representation of the book,9,9 April 2014,"I thoroughly enjoyed Odd Thomas. Seeing the movie first inspired me to read the books. Stephen Sommers did a wonderful job depicting the book. It gave off the same vibe and emotions. Anton Yelchin and Addison Timlin were perfect for the main characters, they made a very cute couple on screen and the chemistry between them was definitely there. Odd Thomas may not be for everyone but either way I would recommend it. The overall idea of the movie was great and keeps you interested the whole way through and the twists and turns added to it nicely. The ending is definitely one of the main talking points with this movie. It definitely surprised me the first time and continues to make me cry every time. It would be great to see more of Dean Koontz books come to life on the big screen.",Odd Thomas
133,steveisfreeeva,Fantastic Adaptation!,9,6 July 2014,"Loved this movie! I work as an electronic specialist at Target, and one day this movie appeared on the shelf. I didn't even realize that a film adaptation was even made. I thought that it was a straight to DVD, so I cringed a little, thinking it would be so-so. When I saw that Stephen Sommers had directed it, I perked up. After all, this was the director of The Mummy! I did my homework and found out while the critics hated the movie, the fans loved it. So I dove in. The movie is fast paced, and the characters (Odd, Stormy, Officer Porter) were very likable. There is a cameo from Arnold Vosloo (the mummy from THE MUMMY) and a funny moment courtesy of Patton Oswald. The story is faced paced and never drags. There isn't any scary or creepy moments, but dare I say it, Odd moments. Sure the Bodachs can be viewed as 'scary', but it's more of a thrill like what you would see in THE MUMMY, or even (going old school here) THE FRIGHTNERS. A very safe, fun thrill ride with a bittersweet ending. More please!",Odd Thomas

135,thegene-2,Having a hard time getting this movie out of my head.,7,26 March 2014,"Yes, I am having a hard time getting this movie out of my head. Odd Thomas is not all that odd of a movie. What I mean is that some people make a prejudgment on a movie by its title. I am actually not sure I could come up with a better title right offhand. Probably as titles go, this is as good as any for this movie. IMDb shows the genres as COMEDY - HORROR - MYSTERY. I personally would have chosen SUPERNATURAL - MYSTERY. While there is some comedy, the few places that it was in could have been modified to the point that the comedy was either so minor that it would not distract from a serious movie or just be taken out completely. This is a somewhat serious movie for sure. This is an excellent movie in fact. I like the characters. The special effects and music are first rate, the acting is great, the scenes are set up very well and overall just a down right great movie. And as for the HORROR part of it, that just does not seem to be a word I would use to describe it. If you could call WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S a HORROR movie, then I guess any movie with a dead person in it would be called that. Of course that movie is just classified as a COMEDY.Pretty much the goal of any movie is to entertain. And the single best way to do that is have actors that can make you forget they are actors and you become a part of the movie story line. They did an excellent job. Of course when you identify with the characters strongly, it will affect you for a while about what happens to them in a movie.When I saw the Star Trek move where Spock dies, there were people leaving the theater crying. I would be there were some people in Hollywood that had a bit of a rough time until they brought his character back.I would say that Odd Thomas is one of the best movies I have seen this year. So if that be the case then why did I give it a 7.Well, there were a number of minor problems in my mind, but since that is more of a personal thing, I never count that against a movie. There were also a couple of bigger problems that I believe many will pick up on, but yet, the movie is so good, that you almost gloss over them as well. However, there was one significant problem that I believe the director/writer/whoever, tried to resolve in their own way, and it was actually done in a fairly good way, but sometimes I just don't like something and that is that.And I did not like this particular thing a lot. It is the kind of thing that almost makes me (and probably others) want to stop watching a movie. I didn't and I am sure most of those that watch the movie will understand what it is with no problem. I highly recommend this movie as it is so good that it could well appeal to various types of people that often watch only certain specific genres that they like.",Odd Thomas
136,shawn4004,Good Adaptation,8,23 June 2013,"Firstly, I am a huge Koontz fan and a huge Odd Thomas fan. I've been waiting years for this movie so my expectations were pretty high. I'm sure that figures into my analysis of the movie, as I have been largely let down by adaptations from novels in the past. That being said...Overall, good movie, good adaptation. Moving a story from a book to a movie always presents problems; always there will be portions of the story and significant nuances left out. This is no exception. The casting of Odd was very good. Yelchin did a fantastic job capturing the strong albeit naive nature of Odd. I was skeptical about Timlin as Stormy, but she not only pulled it off but, in my mind, perfectly captured Stormy. I will no longer be able to think of Stormy without seeing her face. I wish we could have seen more interaction between Odd and Ozzie; in the books this is a very important relationship for Odd. Also, in the books, Ozzie is 350 or so pounds and Oswalt is considerably smaller. That being said, I think his size in the books is more of a testament to his larger-than-life character and less about his physical size, which I believe, given the chance, Oswalt would have perfectly captured. He is a largely underrated actor.As for the story, it sticks to the book even though there are a few things left out. It would have been nice to know more of Odd's background but it would have unnecessarily stretched the movie out. Well told, with appropriate use of flashbacks, and good use (and not overuse) of narration, just as in the books. One thing I really enjoy about Odd Thomas books is the quick-paced, quick-whited dialogue. I've rarely read another author that could match Koontz in this aspect. This was transferred to the big screen very well.As I said, I've been waiting for this movie for a while and whereas I wish they'd done it as an eight hour miniseries and captured every nuance of the book, this was a superb adaptation and an excellent movie. I really hope they make more because Odd's adventures keep getting better.8 of 10",Odd Thomas
137,benson3436,Anton Yelchin did a superb job! A-,9,21 September 2017,"I am kicking myself for waiting this long to view this movie. Anton did a marvelous job and the movie as a whole is very well made, with great execution and a great cast behind it! It sucks that Anton passed away last year and again I waited long to view this movie, but NETFLIX has it on there so I decided to give it a go and I was NOT disappointed ! Willem Defoe is great as usual and then there are a few people who I did not recognize, but all parts are played very well! This is a great take on a Dean Koontz novel and it is just a shame that we will not see a 2nd one with Anton in it. Maybe a new movie as a whole, but I do not see it being better than this one! I don't know though. We could be surprised. Great movie though, if you haven't seen it, give it a go! It should not disappoint you! Peace!",Odd Thomas
138,taikung1,An outcast set on justice,8,4 July 2014,"This movie takes you on an adventure with an outcast who not only sees the dead but is willing to risk his own well being to bring about justice. This righteous integrity is fueled by Odd's strong connection to his inner circle including his girlfriend Stormy Llewellyn played by Addison Timlin. The movie mixes twists and turns well in a creatively action packed time line of events that will answer the questions that the story leaves off with from scene to scene.The connection between Stormy and Odd Thomas played by Anton Yelchin can best be described as one of pure admiration for each other. Anton Yelchin was the perfect fit for this role and his on screen chemistry with Addison Tilmin was not only sold, it came with a lifetime warranty! The story captured the essence of 2 people who found each other's muse that inspired one another to be the best at everything they are and do and what that would look like. Addison Tilmin is not only beautiful but has the substance of an elite actress right down to her subtle mannerisms which are absolutely memorizing. It is quite refreshing to see not just another pretty face and call that talent but rather someone with character and wit that knows how to entertain the viewer as Addison provides to her role.The movie does have some violence and a fight scene which must have been practiced extensively because the movements are quite legit. Other than being completely entertaining, this movie will make you laugh and may bring a tear to your eye. It was well thought out, creative, entertaining and most importantly original and also gave a witty undertone which prevented the movie from being dark.",Odd Thomas
139,thesupershadow,A memorable film with heart-breaking ending.,9,13 January 2021,"Damn, the ending to this breaks me every time...

I really wish there was a sequel or prequel too.",Odd Thomas
140,titus227,This Movie Blew it for me,1,17 January 2015,"The first 20 min of this movie really hooked me and I was hoping for that level of interesting storyline to continue, alas, it did not. Too much of this movie is wasted on buildup, which isn't that big of an issue, the thing that really hurts this film is Addison Timlin. I don't know if this is someone's daughter or girlfriend, but her overbite is enormously distracting during the film and her acting is abysmal. She delivers her lines with a strange melody, like a high school production of Shakespeare with false Shakespearian accents. If it wasn't for Stormy, I would have felt comfortable with an 5, possibly even a 6, as Willem Dafoe is one of my favorite actors. However, Addison/Stormy is in a majority of the scenes and her acting is too horrible to ignore. She will skip around Thomas gaily, chirping and buzzing, then all of a sudden say, Thomas, I'm scared, I've been scared this whole time. It's as if she started acting yesterday.***Spoiler*** The other reason I'm giving this movie a low score is because they overused the ""oh, crap, that person's already dead"" bit and they broke their own rules. I HATE it when movies break their own rules. First off, Stormy and Thomas were not together forever, they were together for about 10 more years after the gypsy mummy's fortune. Second, it was told that once a Bodach has acknowledged that you can see it, they will kill you. Odd Thomas stared directly at a Bodach, attracted it's attention and after failing to kill Thomas on the first attempt, the Bodach lets him live. F*** You. I can't stand awful movies that will allow the main character to break every law set forth. Allowing the Bodach to see you notice him is like suicide, it didn't make any sense when Thomas did it, and I was waiting the entire rest of the movie to see the Bodach kill him, and they didn't.",Odd Thomas
141,IMikeDB,Absolutely astonishing!,9,16 June 2015,"This movie was amazing. I recommend this to all my friends. There has only ever been a short list of movies that I have actually felt any emotional connection to a character in the movie. Bridge to Terebithia and Juno gave me all the feels requiring tissues which was quite the impressive feat as I almost never care about actors in movies. I can honestly say Odd Thomas was one of those movies. One of those rare occurrences and not only was it an entertaining movie, they also had me seriously caring about the actors and towards the end they had me the saddest I had ever been since The Bright To Terebithia which is no easy feat. While I am usually a fan of comedy, action and adventure (as obvious by my IMDb ratings) on rare occasion I will give a movie flying stars when they actually make me have physical emotions for a movie. 50 First Dates gave me an emotional Roller-coaster, Love Happens got me as well, however I can honestly say that Odd Thomas did an astounding job for the budget it had and the story there was to work with. Well done.",Odd Thomas
142,robin-72-718219,Solid Movie,7,22 June 2013,"Odd Thomas was a solid movie and it was indeed an enjoyable watch. I'm a pretty big fan of the Odd Thomas books. As with any novel turned into a movie there was much of the finer details left out and a few that were never there added in. I feel they did a fair job of capturing Odd's character. I do feel the chemistry between Odd and Stormy was a bit off. I'm not sure if this was due to the casting ,acting or direction. Or the fact that so much about her character was left out. But it felt more juvenile rather than deep love of your life love. I can't help but wonder if they had given it a slightly bigger budget and focused more on some of the other characters and their stories, it would have been a great movie, instead of merely a good one. In the book we get a lot more ghostly communication between Odd and a very diverse and interesting collection of ghosts, including Elvis. I would have loved to see more of this in the movie, as I feel it really helps the viewer/reader understand the world of the dead and how it impacts the living world and Odd himself. One of the most interesting characters in the books is his strange friend Little Ozzie and his cat, Ozzie has 6 fingers on his left hand, writes detective novels and knows about Odds unusual powers as does the Sheriff. Of course Stormy is the only one who knows everything about Odd. I gave Odd Thomas a 7 out 10 - It's a good solid movie and a fun watch. I'd love to see it made into a T.V. series. I think that way you could get the in-depth character development and plot lines you have in the books.",Odd Thomas
143,walter2-407-597390,Excellent translation from book to movie,10,23 June 2013,"I have liked the Odd Thomas books since I first opened the initial book, and I often wondered what a movie of any of the stories would look like. While this film seems trapped in a legal quagmire that will probably prevent release any time soon, watching it was a total delight.I really wondered how they would cast this, and while I never thought of the people they did pick, they worked perfectly, and having seen them in it, I can't imagine any other cast. Fans of the book will probably pipe up with ""hey, where's Elvis""? and the answer is he's a cardboard cut-out in Odd's bedroom, and I didn't miss him at all in the film. The story is complex and vivid enough as told, and Odd's abilities get explained perfectly without Elvis. That's the beauty of books and films, both have their tales to tell, and they don't have to be identical to be well-told and the same story.Anyway, I loved it, and can only hope it makes its way to screens all over. Why? Because, we all need to be looped in, Odd One.",Odd Thomas
144,TheNineOrders,Odd surprised me!,7,19 May 2014,"I have to say that Odd Thomas caught me by surprise. I have not read the books and never heard of him until now, which I'm not sure how it affects my judgment of the film. I have to admit I enjoyed it greatly. Full of character and, as the title implies, oddness. Plot: This is a simple plot which I, for some reason, am grateful for. The movie did not try to be more than what it is. Odd sees dead people and learns through time to understand why and how to use his ability in a positive way. Demons show up one day and scare Odd into thinking something really bad is about to happen in town and he is determined to stop it. Again, the movie is simple with story and character repertoire. Stormy the girlfriend destined to be together forever, the sheriff that knows of Odds' abilities and uses it to aid in solving crimes in town and the necessary bad guys to give the movie some motion. Nothing complicated or hard to follow here, maybe you will see the entire plot twist coming a mile away like me, but it won't take away the enjoyment of the film. Yelchin was really good as Odd.Verdict: a good popcorn crunching movie that will only take an hour and a half of your time. If you are looking for something light and fun, this is the movie for that Sunday night before going to bed.",Odd Thomas

146,Quiestar,A movie well worth watching.,8,30 April 2019,"""'Odd' Thomas,"" is the antithesis of the modern male hero. He doesn't live in the Dark Ages; doesn't havre rugged good looks and Hollywood white teeth.Odd is an average, seemingly aloof fellow who has an ability best suited for a comic book superhero, something that he's definitely not! You see, ""Odd,"" his given name (it's suggested that his intended name had been,""Todd."") has the ability to see the dead and predict calamities. It seems he's grown used to his predicament; much as those born in the Dark Ages became used to the ravage of being host to multiple parasites and the pervasive smell of body odor, raw sewage, death and decay,Odd, a mild-mannered present day guy copes with his abilities by keeping a matter-of-fact attitude and a subtle but refreshing tongue-in-cheek sense of humor.""Odd"" Thomas, spends his life living in the thin line between accepted reality and the hauntingly supernatural. He tries, as anyone would, to appear, well: normal. When the harbingers of death start appearing to Odd Thomas at an alarming rate; he recognizes that he's the only one who can prevent a catastrophic outcome - something he'd rather not deal with. It's not as simple as it seems for Odd to be the hero.A well-crafted film I highly recommend. If your expecting a pure horror film devoid of human sensibilities, you may find the film lacking. The money normally spent on copious amounts of blood gushing forth from severed limbs and heads was spent instead on developing characters you'll grow to know and care for (mind you, it does have its fair share of death and the macabre). Odd Thomas is definitely worth watching, I find myself watching it again, something I typically reserve for only the most celebrated films and classics, the strength of Odd Thomas is simply its fresh and fun (if not relatable) take on good versus evil; subtle humor and a rousing final challenge.",Odd Thomas
147,johnbthomasiii80,Terribly under appreciated film that is delightfully weird,9,21 May 2020,"Anton Yelchin and Willem Defoe have so much fun on this fil that it's impossible to not have fun yourself.Yelchin was destined to be one of this generations best character/leading actors. Cast in the lead in this film he proves he has the chops to carry the film. Sadly we lost Yelchin I'm a single car accident that angers and pains me to this day.Yelchin plays Odd Thomas, a wacky/weird but lovable young man who can see dead people and avenge their deaths.The dialogue is quick and witty and the actors are all fine to great. It moves at a breezy pace yet doesn't lack for creepiness, nor for sweetness.There are enough characters that when the plots cranks up, it can be tough to keep up with them all. That said, it all comes together quite cleverly in the end.The end. Odd Thomas has one of the most heartbreaking endings for a thriller/horror film.This is the first film Stephen Sommers has directed that I have enjoyed. Too often his films are filled with bad cgi and crappy storylines. Not so here. Dean Koontz must have had a strong grip on this.Most sadly is that this film has not received the credit it is due.

Not that I'm against with it, it's just that I was used to him being in that-guy roles.The brief description written here in IMDb does not justify the contents. I mean, it's more than that. The genre says Comedy/Horror/Mystery/Thriller but they forgot one more important thing, Romance. Yes, there is also a love story involved and that's what made this movie more pleasantly interesting. The action and nonstop twists also got me hooked. Sure there were a few questionable aspects which I won't mention here. I'd just ignore them for the sake of entertainment.How odd is this movie?

153,robert-broerse,Seer With a Mission To Save Lives and Pscyhes,4,19 July 2013,"As this film's climax winded down, I couldn't help but compare the film to Rambo II. Some might say this is a strange comparison. But consider when Rambo II was released in the early 1980s. This was a time when America was still tender a decade on about the Vietnam War. Nixon was long gone; Reagan was President. The war had ended in 1975 but here was Rambo, the orphan of that war. Though the first film was excellent and showed the plight of veterans, the second film mocked general intelligence and in the minds of many, Rambo's machine gun and endless body count helped American audiences believe they won the war. It was cathartic entertainment at best and perhaps done for a reason.This film is only faintly 'cathartic' but like Rambo provides that uneasy balm; and yet I couldn't help feel the film seemed to take such a timely subject as psychopaths and their need to hurt crowds of people and make it popcorn fare.(Before I go any further, I should mention I am in no way familiar with the novels so I cannot comment on the adaptation - that is best left to fans of Dean Koontz.) Yes, this is an 'entertaining' film and was made for Friday night purposes. Odd Thomas is a quirky character and Anton Yelchin is a great actor, the young everyman and is perfectly suited for the role. We follow him nearly 100% of the time. He narrates portions of the story but for the most part, this film is fairly easy to follow. Odd introduces us to his world, tells us of his special gifts and within the first five minutes we are shown in a cartoon-like, Hardy Boys manner how he chases down and nabs a killer. Nothing too esoteric here. The supernatural fused with a bit of action.We are then introduced to his detective buddy (Defoe) and of course, we learn Odd isn't a cop, more or less a superhero who solves crimes when he's not working as a short order cook. His girlfriend Stormy (Timlin) is equally adorable and well-suited girlfriend though most of the film she straddles the world between eye-candy for male audiences and sounding boards for plot developments. (And I have to mention this... Mr. Stephen Sommer, you have directed this movie and been sadly consistent in your ability to diminish your leading actress by making her wear the skimpiest of outfits. I am a heterosexual male but I found your wardrobe choices far too distracting and moreover, demeaning. Sincerely... me).To get to the nitty gritty, Odd knows something is big because he's sees the presence of these other worldly creatures, bodachs forming around a low-life patron in the diner. He follows this man and begins to unravel clues that something wicked is coming to town. He's also had dreams and so have others.What we eventually discover (ahem...SPOILER) is that a group of devil worshippers is going to attack the local mall with machine guns and blow it up with some nefarious explosives.Again, this is popcorn fare but getting back to Rambo II and the comparison. When we think about American society, every since Columbine, there have been several deadly attacks on public property, whether schools, malls or campuses. Here we have Odd Thomas, just like Rambo, on a mission but unlike Rambo, Odd isn't here to kill (though he does take out a few baddies along the way but not with an excessive stream of bullets, a glittering puddle of shells on the ground beside him) but he does save the day. And the psyche of his country.There are two levels of fantasy in this movie. The first being fantasy of the story, a man being able to see the dead and then pick up clues concerning the evil aggressors. He is the everyman but gifted, a Clark Kent meeting Cole Sear of The Sixth Sense (the ending to 'Odd Thomas' was notably (un)inspired by the superior, latter film). It is an adventure, a hero's tale. The second fantasy is his intention for the fictional world and ours, namely to stop the devastation from even happening.We cannot watch this film now without the context of the last fifteen years. For me, this film is insulting. And the more I think of it, the less likely I will be able to recommend it. Year after year many people south of the border endure trauma at the hands of a madman or madmen and instead of coming to an intelligent solution on how to stem violence, films like this are made for the interim, that is until the next tragedy. Movies try to make us believe it will all go away. This film is just a terrible band-aid. We want so badly for a Odd Thomas to exist, to put our faith in him and who can blame us. How can you put your trust in governments that raise money for war? Anton to the rescue and in the unlikely world where he exists, endings are wrapped up with new set-ups in the wings.Perhaps I am reading too deeply into this movie but I think it is dangerous to enjoy a film with such a devious intention: i.e. to make us feel we haven't already been wounded by the world outside. When audiences stepped out of theatres with memories of Rambo killing 'Charlie',they experienced a thrill of victory. Odd Thomas, I'm certain was made with the same intention.",Odd Thomas

It really rocked me to the point of me screaming NOOOOOO. I really enjoyed the chemistry between Stormy and Odd. The movie had a great heart to it. One thing I appreciated was the fact that they made Odd a part of the community, liked and respected. It would have been so cliché to make him an outsider that no one listens to even though he is proved right again and again. Odd and Stormy do a great job of selling their relationship and the cynic in me was reluctantly moved by their love. Willem Dafoe does his usual great job as a supporting character. The movie had a good story, with lots of good action and moved quickly. In fact, I felt like the movie could have delved into Odd's powers in more depth. The movie seemed too short.

It was quirky in its style and I understand how some might not like that. I liked the fact that this movie was different - even if it would be better as a TV series. Either way, the ending did catch me off guard. While hindsight is 20/20, I found it strange I didn't pick up on it; I assume it's because of the good-natured theme and quirkiness, putting me off guard.

The monster elements looked better than I expected? Based on the first book in one of my favorite book series? And it stayed more faithful to the source material than a lot of book-to-movie adaptations?Great job.The only problem I had was that it ran the indie film circuit before getting a limited theatrical release, and I was unable to see it until the DVD release.",Odd Thomas

162,wc_ling,very entertaining,9,25 June 2013,"I would have given it a ten and you'll know why I didn't when you see the end. This movie will thoroughly entertain several age groups! Excellent story, I haven't read Koontz's books as I only read non-fiction. I thought of the movie ""GHOST"" while watching, see if you don't do the same. Just the right amount of intrigue, action, and intensity. Anton Yelchin is an excellent actor... as well as most the cast, a couple actors performances were a smidgen less than perfect, blame that on the Director, he is the one telling the story but I found that it didn't detract from the over all movie. Special effects were fine and I found no reason to criticize the computer graphics work. I don't recall seeing the young lady before and found her a delightful addition to the cast. Enjoy.",Odd Thomas

I got the impression this Thomas is psychotic, he is seeing strange and evil creatures all the time. So I watched all these scenes he is hallucinating while this has no meaning in the story, of whatever, I just had to wait and watch until things become clear? sorry, but I got so bored and turned it off. However, I did like the acting but thats not enough for me. I like a movie that's gripping from the beginning and I hate it when my patience is tested for a reason I can't figure out. Horror and comedy doesn't go very well usually, and definitely not in this movie.",Odd Thomas
166,ws_mcewan,Cool concept but meh,4,13 October 2021,When a movie uses models to cast all the extras it makes it look unbelievable. Yes I know I'm talking about a paranormal film. When the population of the entire film is beautiful people it's hard to relate. It feels like you're watching WB or some teen melodrama. Must have been cast by high school girls.,Odd Thomas
167,svederen,"A little Odd, but quite good.",7,16 July 2013,"This film is quite a little gem. Solid acting, decent special effects and an interesting plot. I read the book a few years ago, and while I enjoyed it, it was one of those read and throw away titles, so I didn't expect much from the movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well it turned out.I liked some of the references to the book as well, such as the cardboard cut-out of Elvis that Odd keeps in his bedroom.If / when you go see Odd Thomas, don't expect fantastic drama or mind- blowing effects, as this is a relatively small movie on those fronts, but if you can enjoy a suspenseful and quirky film that doesn't look like every run-of-the-mill Hollywood production out there, then I heartily recommend it.",Odd Thomas
168,cherstarkey,Loved This Movie!!!,9,18 June 2015,"I'm a Dean Koontz fan from the start, and most times the Hollywood people don't do his books justice. However, they did a wonderful job with this one. No big names or big budgets here, but a great story line. The chemistry between Odd and Stormy was spot on, and there was a great portrayal of a beautiful love between a guy and a girl without being weird or trashy. Like one of those movies from the good old days that let you use your imagination without being too revealing. Just a small amount of cussing, and the scary/gross stuff was enough to get the point across but not make you want to throw up too much. I was able to watch the movie with my boys, ages 9-13, and they liked the movie too. The romantic/kissing scenes only made them mildly squeamish and they blood and gore wasn't enough to make them hide their faces in a pillow. It had a little bit of ""jump and scare"", but it startled me more than it did my boys. :)I like movies with at least some kind of resolution, and there is that element (to a degree, since it is based off a book series) with this one. It's also good for those of you who like defined good guy and bad guy roles (which Koontz usually does) and not this back and forth with which side the characters stand regarding morality issues and then a butt load of introspection followed by switch footing again that has become so popular in shows nowadays. I mean, you do have to figure out who the bad guys are, but after you do, there's none of that whole trying to water down the bad guys' awfulness with stories of a tortured childhood (the kind of stuff Nicholas Sparks likes to do).Overall, I give it nine stars and I will buy this DVD for my own collection. Give it a spin. You'll like this movie too. :)",Odd Thomas
169,thebarebear,"Terrible, terrible FIlm, despite the acting talent",4,3 July 2013,"Corny awful dialogue, especially the 'romance' scenes. Hilariously bad.Despite a stellar cast including Willem Dafoe this is a terrible, terrible film. For some reason every time Odd calls Willem Dafoe's character, he ends up interrupting coitus. (Why?) It makes no sense.I'm not a fanboy of this series or a teenager, but this movie was awfully sh*te.The special effects aren't bad, photography and cinematography are average. THe dialogue and script are just crappier than crap. Do you know That scene in SLumdog Millionaire where the kid gets drenched in faeces? That is what comes to my mind as an appropriate simile or metaphor for the writing in this film.",Odd Thomas
170,hoohaa79,"I was looped in, characters brilliantly portrayed",8,26 October 2013,"Finally, I plucked up the courage to watch this movie, a movie based on one of my favourite books by DK. First of all the casting; Anton as Odd was spot on, Stormy, the same. The rest were good, William Dafoe played his part well.It was a bit of shame however, that Ozzie Boon didn't have so much to say, nor did he have any influence on the story. I was also a little gutted that 'The King' was only represented by a cardboard cut-out, he was fun in the book, and as you readers know, 'The King' and other backseat passengers continue through the Odd series.The Bodachs, in my humble opinion were not what I imagined when I read the book, I pictured them more as hooded black shadows, but that being said, the Bodachs here, served their purpose.As you may of noticed, part of my review seems to show a certain disappointment, far from it. Considering the budget, and the niche market, the film for me was a HIT. I will also say it's the most enjoyable book-to-film adaptation I have ever seen. The characters, the story, the feeling....oh and the ending....I cried at the end just like I did all them years ago when I turned those last few pages.If you're a DK fan, you should like it, if you're an Odd fan, you should LOVE it. I only hope, that Odd's future endeavours are brought to the big screen, OK the sequel to Odd wasn't brilliant, but Brother Odd was a book I couldn't put down, I even listened to the audio version 5 or 6 times. Please, please make more :)",Odd Thomas

Really loved the clever dialogue and the love story - thought the special effects were very effective. And now have the hots for Anton cute guy.(sp?) Maybe a little predictable although I jumped big time at the appropriate moments so maybe not so predictable. Would have paid money to see it, don't even remember when it originally came out. I would have like to have seen more character development of the Willem Dafoe character. Such a strong actor for such a relatively small part. And I kept thinking that there would be more back story on Odd and his mother, which never came. (I guess that counts as my spoiler)",Odd Thomas
173,JohnnyD,Surprisingly good,8,19 September 2014,"Watched this on Netflix last week. Am a bit of a fan of Anton Yelchin (Fright Night, Like Crazy, Middle of Nowhere, Taken) so this caught my eye. Also Willem Dafoe was a draw. Bottom line is that I got caught up watching it one late night. Has a bit of ""Repo Man"" absurdity but the suspense builds nicely towards the end. After watching this movie, and reading the credits, I realized this was a Dean Koontz book. Of course! I'd read several of this author's books, but this particular series seemed, er, ""odd"" to me, so I haven't ready any selections. This will change. It's a shame to see movies like this not get wide release, but I'm grateful for Netflix for making this movie available. My only hope is that the talent gets a decent share of the proceeds, since I gladly would have paid admission to a cinema to see this.",Odd Thomas

There's action, romance, supernatural events and plot twists that will really tug on your heart strings.However, I suggest you read the book first, right the way up to Odd finishing his business at the mall. Then stop reading go get the film and watch it.For some reason the film makers decided to cut about 30% of the book out of the film, so reading what I suggested above will fill you in on all the details. You can then watch the film, make more sense of things and still get the big plot twist at the end.",Odd Thomas
176,anthonyg2003,perfect movie,10,11 May 2014,"I am a big fan of Dean Koontz, and acknowledge some of his work is a bit outlandish. The first Odd Thomas book did capture my attention, but subsequent books in the series got a bit trite. Thus, I was hopeful, but skeptical about this movie adaptation. I didn't know how they could tell such a weird story in a movie. I was worried it would turn out like so many horrible low budget Stephen King movies.Wow, what a pleasant surprise. The movie told the story very truthfully, including the majestic relationship between Odd and Stormy, which was unquestionably the magic that made the book's storyline compelling. (Her death is what made me lose interest in subsequent books in series). In addition to keeping the Odd/Stormy relationship front and center, the movie masterfully presented the supernatural parts of the story without making it seem absurd. I've read reviews complaining about the ""low budget"", but I can't see how that affected the movie. Its special affects were just right, the casting was absolutely perfect, and the screenplay was perfect.",Odd Thomas

This is not a unique idea of predicting or the premonition of crime, The Minority report comes to mind, however this version is quite refreshing and is slick in it's execution. Although the leading character becomes a type of Sherlock Holmes in his investigative work as he battles against evil he is also the type of hero in the making we would all like to be.

I am surprised this movie wasn't better advertised. Great find! Watch it, even if you have not read the books, it may inspire you to read the others. I really hope they make more movies. The movie does seem a bit lower budget. Like a made for TV movie, but it has a great cast, and as I said it follows the books. They picked the perfect actor to play Odd. They also did a great job of bringing Pico Mundo to life. It all feels so much like the places described in the books.

I'm regretting that I didn't look any deeper than the name and the rating. This is not a nearly 7 star movie. It's a B movie with a couple of good actors in it.I'll start with the good. Anton Yelchin. Without him this movie would be utterly useless. He plays Odd with the perfect mix of humor, strength and self deprecation. Willem Dafoe brings some credibility to his role so we at least have 2 actors who can act, but doesn't do much more than that. The special effects are cool in some places.The bad: everything else. From poor acting performances to showing skin for no reason (do we really need a slow motion running scene?) to unconvincing dialog. Maybe if I was a teenager or liked B movies. But no, neither of those is the case. Skip this one.",Odd Thomas
182,quej,Excellent Movie version of the novel.,10,12 February 2014,"When i saw they had made this movie, I had contrasting feelings. I really wanted to see it but was worried about whether or not they may have ruined what is an excellent top notch series of Novels by Dean Koontz....Being a Koontz collector, I love everything he does and the Odd Thomas Franchise is possibly his best work IMO. Movie adaptations of books tend to fall flat on their face. The 1998 release of Phantoms being the only notable exception to this.Turns out I was worried over nothing... The Odd Thomas Movie is nothing short of Excellent. They have stayed true to the book in every way and couldn't have chosen a better cast.Anton Yelchin is the perfect Odd.... He plays the character and gets the behaviours of Odd Thomas totally spot on. As for Timlin as Stormy ??? I'll never be able to read Odd Thomas again without picturing her sexy curves all way through the book.The whole movie feels like Dean Koontz had directed, edited and cast it himself. He really couldn't have made it anymore his own work if he had.The only negative I can think of is that there will be a gap between this movie finishing and the next one being made...I am salivating at the prospect",Odd Thomas
183,farkas419,Pleasing Adaptation,9,18 July 2013,"I usually dread watching movies based on books that I love, because I already know that they are never as good as the books upon which they're based. This film adaptation of ""Odd Thomas"", based on the book of the same name by Dean Koontz, is no different. It's not as good as the book... but then, the book was phenomenal.That said, however, I thought it was excellent. The special effects seemed rather low-budget, but they did the trick. The bodachs were even scarier than the way they were described in the book. Anton Yelchin did a fantastic job playing the enigmatic and charismatic Odd Thomas, while Addison Timlin as Odd's soul-mate Stormy Llewellyn was adorable and very lovable. The dialogue was superb for the most part, particularly between Anton and Addison, though it did seem a little stilted in some places.The pacing in the film was fantastic and relentless. I can recall only one instance where it could have been considered ""dragging"", and the moment was fleeting.There were a few characters in the book that weren't even mentioned in the movie, which was disappointing but understandable. Books are generally much more involved and intricate than movies are allowed to be, particularly if the director wants to keep the movie at an acceptable length.One of the things I really loved about ""Odd Thomas"" as a book was the light-hearted tone in spite of the lurking sense of danger, and the movie stayed true to this. I smiled listening to the dialogue between both Odd and Stormy, and Odd and Chief Wyatt Porter (played by Willem Dafoe), and Odd and pretty much everyone. I also really appreciated the depth that Anton Yelchin brought to the character of Odd Thomas; he was absolutely excellent.All in all, I would highly recommend this movie to absolutely anyone, whether they read the books or not. It's a story about love, loyalty, trust... and of course ghosts and the evil of which mankind is capable. The only thing that stops me from giving this movie a 10/10 is the fact that so many characters were left out, but altogether, it was a solid effort, and I sincerely hope that the troubles preventing its release in the US at this time are resolved, and the rest of the series is also adapted.",Odd Thomas

A few are as good, some others fair enough.Tonight I think I may have watched the absolute pinnacle of poorness. Odd Thomas, although surely entertaining at parts, is such a horrid movie from a book that I can't even put words to it. Had I never read the books it would have been passable, but because I've read them... oh crikey!That being said, I will attempt to review it as if I hadn't read the books:The movie is entertaining, which is the main focus of all movies, but it just fails in such weird places.For instance, what's with the incredibly poor CGI scenes in the diner? Why are the cucumbers flying? And the milk? Why?!? The CGI in the movie is generally well done, but the whole cooking scene was just... dreadful.Sadly, the biggest flaw in the movie is the acting. It's just not well done at all. At times it was so bad in fact that it made me cringe.It could have been so much better. As it is, it's only a 6.",Odd Thomas

Yes, but it is also an extremely dense book, so that makes sense. I was not at all disappointed - on the contrary, I found all main characters to be spot on. In the beginning, I thought Odd was a bit too handsome and heroic - I always saw him as more quirky - but he quickly grew on me and now, I honestly can't imagine him Ny different. And Willem Dafoe was great! Exciting, interesting, moving - PLEASE make another one! There are so many great stories to tell from the Odd Thomas series, and it would be a shame to stop now!",Odd Thomas

This is one of those simple films that catches you quickly and you are glued to every second of it from that point on. The lead who plays Thomas and the young lady who plays his girl friend do a fabulous job. Very good story and wonderful acting. Lately I am being more selective about the movies I watch as I am growing tired of gratuitous violence/sex etc. This is not a children's story, as many would find this too scary (in my opinion). Don't read to much about the story for this movie, just watch it. I knew nothing about this story and really enjoyed the character development and plot. I don't want to say too much at all, because I want others to be pleasantly surprised as I was with such a rare find. Just a good movie.

Anyway, with great anticipation I ordered it and paid my $10 to see the film.Dean Koontz! Where were you when this film was cast and written? I had no idea who the actor playing Odd Thomas was, had never heard of him. He was definitely NOT the right actor for the role. I felt the same about the actress playing Stormy. I've never liked Wilem Defoe and he was wrongly cast also in my opinion.To say I ""hated"" the movie might be a little much, but I didn't ""like"" it at all.

193,cristalcutler,I really wanted to love this,6,13 March 2021,"Guys sees dead people and uses his skill to help people. Nice. I enjoy a little ghostly crime-solving. I didn't realize that this movie was based on a book when I started watching it, but it soon became pretty obvious. It held all the tell-tale signs: Narration. Weird dialogue. The feeling like you're walking into a bigger story than what's being shown in the movie. And that's fine. It was all just... fine.On the subject of dialogue... it tried. So hard. It was almost a mix between those old black and white crime movies and that one Quirky Show where all the characters have clever mouths. But not in a good way. The actors did their best, but most of it still came across as forced and distracting.Another way I judge movies is based on the romantic interest. Is the romantic interest a three-dimensional character, or can he or she be replaced with a cardboard cut-out with a voice recorder that repeats the same, basic, supportive phrases over and over again? This one leaned toward the latter. Stormy's most interesting trait was the fact that she was in love with Odd. She was almost completely defined by their relationship. Other traits include: works at an ice cream shop... has supermodel level good looks... and likes The Wizard of Oz?Someone else's review said that it felt like the pilot of a TV show, and I completely agree. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I kept thinking, ""It's okay--the show will get better a few episodes in, once the actors get a feel for their characters."" But I guess we didn't get that. It's a shame. Probably would have been a great TV show.On the other hand, I was very interested in the story itself. Solid plot twists. Unique enough to keep my attention. I'm going to go find the book now. So thanks for that, I guess. Here's hoping it did better in its original packaging.",Odd Thomas

That's the positive.The negative is that the acting and script were annoyingly weak. For example, the male lead will say something terrifying and the female lead will reply with a humorous quip. It doesn't flow.There are other moments that are clearly unbelievable and ruin the flow of the movie, the immersion experience.Without those issues, it could be rater higher than 7/10...but the issues pull a good story down. 7/10 is still worth watching though, unlike Transcendence that let a good story be brought down to a 5/10 by bad production.",Odd Thomas
196,hikeeba2006,Anton Yelchin And A Strong Cast Make This Movie,8,3 July 2016,"Since Anton Yelchin died everyone has talked about his role in the Star Trek movies, but I'll remember him as Odd Thomas, short-order cook with a power to see dead people and sinister Bodachs who feed on pain, omens of disaster. He, his father (Willem Dafoe), and his girlfriend (Addison Timlin), must fight off a very odd stranger and swarm of Bodachs before a massacre wipes out his town.Sound silly? Sound familiar? Not with Yelchin in it. He took what could have been a goofy, sappy, straight-to-disc and made it a funny, creepy, scary, romantic, compelling, and heartbreaking story. He made Odd Thomas someone you would want on your side -- loyal, fearless, honourable, loving and lovable, and a hopeless romantic -- a better human than most of us, but a fully fleshed-out human.That's what Anton Yelchin could do. From what I've heard, that's the kind of person he was in the real world. And like so many young people who leave us every day, we'll never get to see what more he could have become.",Odd Thomas

My God, what a beautiful young woman. I don't watch much television but I'm going to start following her on the shows listed above. Its not just her killer body on that petite frame, its her eyes that I find to be mesmerizing. The rest of the film sort of went by in a blur between the times she was on-screen. I'm a fan of young Mr. Yelchin. I'm impressed with his famous intellect, and his self-possession at such a young age. I understand there was quite a bit of in-fighting over advertising and marketing of this film. A shame, really. Though I think it deserved a wider audience, it was far from perfect, as its low budget showed. For me, it was all about Addison Timlin, who has a natural quality about her.

Firstly I am a fan of the way Dean Koontz writes but much prefer his earlier books as they don't feel rushed as if he's writing to a deadline, although this was his best book since STRANGERS. Secondly, I am not a big fan of Stephen Sommers.This movie is a good movie. It is not a blockbuster, taught psychological thriller, fantastic comedy, spine-chilling horror or romantic epic. BUT it contains elements of all of these. It stays faithful to the book in most respects but the nature of Odd is different enough to make him interesting for film. BUT he is still good to watch. The movie doesn't flow perfectly but it doesn't drag either and 90 minutes went by very quickly. My biggest flaw with the movie is that it felt like a pilot for a TV show. It would make a very good TV show because it is funny, dramatic and deals with death very well. It fails in a couple of relationships that only worked for me because I had read the book.In summary, this is a good movie with some nice twists and turns, some excellent scenes but lacking something to make it fantastic. Like the novels of Dean Koontz, it doesn't sit into any one classification so in that respect it is true to the original.",Odd Thomas
200,merxii,You Have To Watch This. Seriously.,9,6 July 2013,"First of all, I'd like to say that I am more than just a ""frequent"" user of IMDb. In fact, I'm online here probably more than I am on Facebook. And yet, I rarely write reviews.I just had to make one for this and tell you guys to watch it.I love Anton Yelchin and the rest of the cast. I have watched a number of his films and have enjoyed pretty much all of them. His chemistry with his love interests are always incredible.The movie was told in a rather unique way. It wasn't predictable, at all. It was really quite different. At first, though, my reaction was ""Oh, it's a cool movie, I'm totally gonna tell my friends to see it""... until the end.After that absolutely unexpected ending where you thought you were just going to see the credits next, I was like ""Oh, no, I'm not going to tell them to see it... I'm going to MAKE them see it.""The length of the movie (which is shorter than usual films today), the way it was told and narrated, the editing and cinematography.. everything... I loved.",Odd Thomas
201,rynoz,Simply Amazing,10,25 June 2013,"So this guy's review, Nyall St. John Smythe, is terrible. The movie Odd Thomas, was absolutely amazing. It followed the book nearly every step of the way with very few small changes. Just like the book did, this movie made me laugh, scared me enough to give me the chills a couple times, and made me cry. If you read the book you will love it and you most likely will cry. If you haven't read the books, check the movie out anyways.The selection of cast was pretty good. Yelchin as Odd was perfect from the moment I read he was cast. Addison Timlin as Stormy fit the bill. Willem Dafoe as Chief Wyatt Porter was a head scratcher, mainly because the books give the impression that the chief is a bigger man. At least in my imagination it did. But within minutes I think you will , as I did, fall in love with Dafoe as Chief Porter. This movie was an easy 10/10.",Odd Thomas
202,jpbenedict-593-793672,The Saddest Ending of Any Movie....ever.,8,17 August 2014,"I am a huge movie watcher. I can figure a plot out usually within the first 10 to 15 minutes of the movie...any movie. That said, I was not ready for the ending of this one. First of all, great movie. I love Anton as an actor/entertainer. Loved him in Star Trek (probably his huge break and will definitely not stop there as he is very talented). The ending of this movie is among the most heart wrenching I have ever experienced. Tears were inevitable... (and when I say ""tears"", what I mean is heartache and despair; the world around you grows dark and all at once you experience an empathy to such a degree you may never feel it like this again)...and I am fairly hardcore when it comes to movie moments. This twist was brilliantly hidden and even I didn't see this one coming. This movie is definitely worth seeing if only to see the end scene. Not to mention the fresh plot elements we don't get to see in the stuff folks call ""Blockbusters"" nowadays. Let's not forget Willem Dafoe, he is a legend in my opinion and performs as expected in this film. This is a must see movie. Thanks for reading.",Odd Thomas
203,jeffkroeger,This movie is very bad,1,28 October 2014,"This movie is an absolute trainwreck. First of all, the movie can't even decide what it wants to be and awkwardly juggles being a quirky, sugary teen comedy and a gritty supernatural thriller. The basic story is actually decent, but everything that fills it in is utter garbage. The dialogue is bland, awkward, and permeated with clunky exposition. The characters are completely one- dimensional and the two leads are very poor actors. The movie makes no attempt to develop characters or create an interesting world or tell a story in any way and instead just rushes between plot points, pausing only to have characters deliver clunky exposition, often in the form of ""witty""""quips"". For instance, instead of developing the completely extraneous yet stubbornly present character of Viola, they simply have Stormy announce something to the effect of ""WE SHOULD PROTECT HER BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT"". OH OKAY, I GUESS I CARE ABOUT HER NOW.The writing is incredibly lazy. The movie literally opens with an entire first-act-worth of dry exposition. A thousand things are introduced that never amount to anything. Odd's clinically insane mother is introduced during the opening exposition but is never even mentioned again. The only reason she's mentioned in the first place is so Odd can say ""She had crazy psychic powers and so I have them too"" as if that is a suitable explanation of the origin of his powers. Odd's position as a short-order cook serves literally no purpose other than giving an excuse for four of the main characters to be in a restaurant together. It doesn't come into play later in the movie at all. They literally could have told this story in 15 minutes and not sacrificed anything of value.The protagonist is an absolute Mary Sue and is completely unrelatable and unlikeable. Not only does he have psychic powers, he also is a super-humanly dexterous, flashy, and charming short-order cook (even though he is none of those things throughout the rest of the movie.), drives a motorcycle, has an impossibly beautiful girlfriend, and is a skilled street fighter (their only justification for his fighting skill is ""I like my face the way it is so I learned how to protect it"". OH, OKAY).The movie thinks so little of its audience that it has its characters announce EVERYTHING that's going on. After a gas line gets broken during a fight, Odd announces ""Gas!"" even though they JUST SHOWED a close-up of the broken gas line. As Stormy is driving away on a motorcycle after a ""tearful goodbye"" in one scene, she announces ""DON'T LOOK BACK. DON'T LOOK BACK. HELP HIM BE STRONG"", you know, like NO ONE HAS EVER DONE EVER. They could have just showed her looking troubled as she drove away and let the audience read into it and figure out what was going on, but that would require the film-makers to have even a modicum of respect for the audience.... and of course would require even a modicum of acting ability from Addison Timlin.This movie honestly makes me angry. It's so bad it's offensive, both to me personally and to the art of film-making. I really cannot fathom why Willem Dafoe signed on to this crap. The director must have kidnapped his kids or something. Honestly, I don't think it was worth it; You can always make more kids.",Odd Thomas
204,Emosjrny,Hidden gem...,9,29 March 2014,"On basically a whim not to mention that I quite like much of director's Sommers previous works, I picked up the BluRay on it's release (plus it was marked down to 12 bucks) and what an amazing film. Easilly one of the best movie I've seen all year (granted it's only late March 2014), it's astounding and really unjust that being a movie buff, I never heard of the movie and knew nothing about it at all. It was a fantastically entertaining film and had an especially moving ending. The talent on hand are all fantastic: Yelchin proving to be a likable hero, Defoe playing against type and doing a fine job and Timlin very much charismatic, lovable and sexy. Now that I know it's based on a Koontz novel, I'll definitely need to pick up the book.",Odd Thomas

207,artistmoon,Very Well Done and true to the book!,8,28 June 2015,I love the Odd Thomas books by Dean Koontz so I was really looking forward to this film. I wasn't disappointed. I think the casting was brilliant. Anton Yelchin is a great choice for Odd. He plays the part with the perfect amount of humility and charm. I wasn't sure about Willem Dafoe as Wyatt Porter but he pulls it off. They minimized some of the big characters like Ozzie and I can only assume that is because of a lack of budget or need to trim the plot to fit the film.They also shrank Ozzie to a normal sized person and dropped him in for a cameo. Having said that they stick pretty much to the plot and the quality of the acting is very good so I say if you are a fan of the book you will enjoy the film too.I just hope they continue the series and are able to keep Anton as Odd.,Odd Thomas
208,johnelfrik,Great Film adapted from the Book,10,12 October 2016,"Warning Spoilers are in this Review if you have not seen it don't read on.I found this Film while searching Amazon for the Third Book and thought it was going to be a total failure like 99,99% of all the Film adapted Books. I was surprised i have watched almost all Films that where made from Books i liked and this was by far the best both in staying with the the Story of the Book and in the Acting.The Story is just as in the Book brilliantly written and the People here who have written negative reviews are either people who have never Read the Books or people who want pure Blood Splatter Horror and i say to them go watch a different Film this is typical Koontz well written and well placed that's what sets him aside from the others not that they are not as good it's just different Stephen King for example is a great Horror both in Film and Book.Okay now to the Film itself it starts off slow just like the Book building the Character and getting the interest of the viewer. Then it goes along the lines of a typical Koontz project Horror/Thriller at the end even having read the Books and knowing what was going to happen i was still in Tears when Stormy Died and he spent a while with her Ghost living a normal Life at least as far as he could. The Acting was not brilliant in all but Odd could not have had a better person Playing him he was sad and interesting at the same time and everybody can relate to him.",Odd Thomas
209,kalaab,Almost Decent,5,11 November 2013,"Having read the novels by Dean Koontz, this film piqued my interest when I first heard of it. Unfortunately, I found that the film lacked interest and depth, despite following the story of the novel nearly perfectly. I believe this film fails to achieve a truly cinematic story because of the lack of depth in its production as compared to the novel. The novel, though not what I would consider Pulitzer material, was quirky and full of character (literally and figuratively). Each person who makes an appearance in the novel is nuanced, developed, and integral to the story. The movie, on the other hand, seems to push the plot forward too fast. While the novel shows that Odd makes a lot of his own luck by reputation and relationships, the movie only shows these occurrences as events that just happen without revealing any of the depth or reason behind them.From a technical standpoint, the use of anamorphic zoom and creative cinematography were effective, but the special effects were underwhelming. It looked a lot like something one could accomplish in a home studio with a good computer. I wanted this movie to be good - I was hopeful because of the depth of character I saw in the novel, but the movie ultimately fails to create that sense of intimacy with the characters in the story. If they could have tacked an extra 45-60 minutes onto the movie, I think they could have pulled it off, but its short runtime and the resulting lack of depth in the characters made it seem like a vapid date-night movie.",Odd Thomas
210,BESommer,"Adorable, Action-Packed and Afflictive! A Wonderful Movie!",10,26 June 2013,"I've read a few of the ""Odd Thomas"" novels by Dean Koontz, but regrettably I have not kept myself up to date with this series. So, while I have the advantage of knowing the story behind the movie, as compared to those who haven't read the ""Odd Thomas"" novels, it has been some time since I've read them. With that in mind, I'm not about to go into any detail about whether the movie was faithful to the novel or not.As far as the movie by itself, I really enjoyed Anton Yelchin's portrayal of Odd Thomas. Having enjoyed his performances in ""Charlie Bartlett"" and the remake of ""Fright Night"", I'm glad they chose him for this role.The relationship between Odd Thomas and Stormy Llewellyn was ... ADORABLE! Seeing Odd in action at the Pico Mundo grill was as entertaining as any circus act. His naiveté around other women was cute.The action of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat.The parts of the movie that were meant to bring tears to your eyes, brought tears to mine. That is how involved with the characters I became.I'm disappointed that the DVD has yet to see an American release. If and/or when it does get released, I encourage all those who are fans of Dean Koontz to purchase it -- vote with your wallet -- as this will put money in Dean's pocket and give you an opportunity to visualize what he has written in his novels on the big screen (your large screen television) as well as increase the probability of ""Odd Thomas"" sequels being produced in the future.For me, this movie was well worth the time and I would gladly see it again.",Odd Thomas

The major point from the book that I remember most is the ending...and it was so perfectly captured in this film. I was so affected by it. It is always nice to see a good interpretation of a book you have enjoyed and this one (unlike some of Dean Koontz's film adaptations) hit the nail on the head. I'm so glad I took the time to see it.

216,valkyrieicestorm,The worst adaptation of a book I've ever seen.,2,21 August 2021,"Let me be clear; the actors are fine. The failure of this film is wholly down to the writer/director. He rewrote scenes and lost everything that was important in them. He added new, completely unnecessary scenes that did not drive the story forward in any way. At the same time, he completely failed to capture the mystique, the wonder, or any of the increasing dread or horror. The dialogue was horrible. The characters paper thin.I'm normally very understanding about the changes that need to be made to bring a written story to the screen, but this was a hatchet job for zero visual gain. Dean Koontz writes great dialogue, writes fantastic characters, and ratchets up tension like nobody's business. To ruin this story to this degree can only be chalked up to ego and hubris. Or incompetence. I'm still not sure which is the case here. If I sound personally aggrieved, it is because I resent the hour and a half I wasted on this. What a great movie this could have been.

I get it, but truly the book is amazing and I highly recommend it! This movie is on the other hand, done much better than I expected. They left out large parts of the book which is understandable but still sad for a long time reader of the odd Thomas novels.Actually the only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 was because it felt like I was watching it at 2x speed. Even though I already knew what was going to happen, it was so hard for me to follow lots of the scenes because each character talks so fast. Everything happens so fast. The movie doesn't give you anytime to breathe it's just one big revel to the next. So then when the ""BIG REVEALS"" happen there is NO payoff to the audience because you couldn't even remember or follow what was happening. Still I'll give this movie a 7/10 I expected it to be much worse and was pleasantly surprised.",Odd Thomas

So, if other do the same, maybe I can help.Rather small budget movie, but the attention to details is exemplary, as most of the money went to the VFX teams - which nailed almost everything.Very entertaining and heart warming - I am also a fan of Anton Yelchin now - go see him in the two new Star Trek movies as well, where he provides a lot of comic relief.Odd's girlfriend is great too - very good choice for the actress, she is bitter sweet and in almost perfect harmony with Odd.

I could see the love in Stormy's eyes every time she looked at Odd. It reminded me of ""The Girl Next Door"" the way Danielle looked at Matthew with that look of pure love and sweetness. I definitely felt like Stormy balanced Odd out and hated the ending. It took away his Yin in my opinion. Not to mention it was really sad. I mean really sad.

Hoping that they make some sequels too it. As for the ending, I sobbed and sobbed, exactly the same as when I read the book.

The comedic parts are well played and managed to get a chuckle out of me for most of them. The serious parts, likewise, got me involved in the plot and helped me suspend disbelief for a good part of it.Would I recommend this movie?

I was excited to see this movie because I loved the book, but the actors in this movie are not very good, they seem like drama class students in college. Plus, there is way too much ""skin"" in this movie, and I would not recommend allowing a teen or pre-teen boy to watch this one, especially with his parents. The movie is filled with unnecessary female sexual exploitation in regards to Vy and her breasts always hanging out and Stormy and her tiny shorts and short tops,and several butt views,and the very ""hiney"" revealing panties in her and Odd's bedroom scene. Stuff like this just isn't necessary to make for a good scary movie. Ruins a great scary movie family night. Is this really what Dean Koontz wanted his movie to turn out like?

Casting, sets, dialogue, tone, were all captured very well and I did not even miss ""Elvis"" (after all, even True Blood chickened out on the Elvis vamp, and he's a major player in those books as well).I look forward to seeing more films in this franchise, and hope they will stick to the Koontz story lines instead of trying to reinvent the wheel like ""True Blood"" ( not that I dislike the series, but other than the names of characters, it bears very little resemblance to Charlaine Harris' books).Kudos for an outstanding adaptation.",Odd Thomas

Forget that, I've seen TV shows that air on regular TV that are worse (worse language, not even an f-bomb in here, worse gorge, worse nudity, worse everything). I hope the financial problems with OMG gets taken care of so the rest of America can see how brilliantly Stephen Sommers, Anton Yelchin, Ashley Sommers and the rest of the cast and crew finally do justice to a film adaptation of a Dean Koontz book that's true to the book and worth seeing. Quite honestly, my imagination about the ""gory"" scenes in the book are much more vivid and disgusting than this film.

227,flapshot,Enjoyable but so far removed from the book,6,1 July 2013,"My partner and I hold the Odd Thomas series of books very dear to our hearts. The character of Odd Thomas and his ""one true love"" Stormy Llewelyn really speak to us both. So it was with trepidation we decided to watch the film.Firstly, the film does stick largely to the plot of the book. There are scenes missing, but that is expected when you condense a novel into a 90 minute film. That for us, was not the real issue.The real issue is that the essence of the book, the character of Odd and Stormy, and to a large extent Chief Porter, was lost. Odd Thomas is a very simple, unassuming man. He is in no way 'cool', he doesn't flip pancakes like he is auditioning for 'Cocktail' and nor does he entertain children and adults alike with his culinary mixology. Likewise, Stormy is a polite, quiet, deep but troubled girl with a past that only the readers of the book will understand. She is not a sassy little bombshell, although she IS beautiful. The film got this all wrong. Odd was too 'cool', he was too show off and his dialogue is delivered with humour and a confidence that is far removed from the real Odd Thomas. The real Oddy, is dead pan, he is very simple in his ways, he speaks with little intention of humour and often with a charmful simplicity that endears you to him. I'm afraid the film got this so wrong it was upsetting to watch. The casting of Ozzie Boon, 'Little Ozzie' to us aficionados was dreadful. Fungas Man was all wrong, and there were glaring omissions from the plot. Chief Porter was wrong too, William Dafoe is of course brilliant, but Chief Porter he is not, and where was 'Terrible Chester'?The end scenes were touching, and my partner and I both cried, but afterwards agreed that we cried because we knew the book, and the ending in the book is so much more poignant.I'm not sorry I watched this, but 'the essence of Odd' was missing completely. In Odd we trust x",Odd Thomas
228,mjpreston-212-522237,Odd Falls Short,4,7 July 2013,"I watched the Odd Thomas film with optimistic enthusiasm, especially when I heard that Anton Yelchin would be portraying the clairvoyant fry cook from Peco Mundo.Odd Thomas, as presented to us by Dean Koontz is an optimist living in the shadow of a cynical world. Throughout his narrative, Odd makes you laugh with one liners and his endless use of light sarcasm. While I did find positives with the Odd Thomas adaption, I also found it very milk toast and lacking the dread that Koontz presents in the first book. I also found the omission of certain characters took away from the stories strengths including his Mentor Ozzie Boone who merely a cameo and hardly the fore-mentioned. Instead of the influence, of being the 300 lb Mystery writer who urges Odd to keep the tone of his story light, he is an inconsequential character who appears and disappears.The adaption of this book fell horrible short. Perhaps the answer would have been to make an HBO miniseries and it would have resulted in near the hatchet job that did adapting this to film.Positives are Anton Yelchin who plays a very capable Odd, but that is where it ends. Even Willem Dafoe seems wooden and out of place.",Odd Thomas
229,tawnataylor,SO very well done,10,21 September 2013,"I can't recommend this movie enough. While I knew the premise, I have to admit I watched the movie before I started reading the books. I fell in love with it immediately and went on to start the books. They did such a good job of translating the feeling in the book to film, in my opinion. The actors were perfect, the mood was right... It's very quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time. It broke my heart and I cried for days but it was the most beautiful heartbreak ever. I would recommend this to people who don't even know what it's about. Just go into it and enjoy it.

I know what some might say, ""that storyline has been done before"" true. Although this one is different than the other movies you have watched. Odd Thomas actually has people in his life whom understand his ability. Therefore he does not spend 75% of the movie trying to prove his abilities to skeptics in order to get them to help him. He is sort of like a hero/crime fighter if that makes any sense.

Story is very interesting and feels like you are not just watching a movie but you are into real world where things around you are bit creepy and you always tend to divert or forget. Coming to lead actor, he is just awesome, his expressions of anger, love , suspense and investigation nature made me for sure he is gone go long way in his career.

232,mattybris,Well worth the wait.,8,26 June 2013,Absolute brilliant film. Hope they do more. Read all the books and was so excited when this came out. Only one thing let it down in my opinion and that was the lack of the ghost Elvis. His interaction with Odd made me laugh out loud when reading the book. I understand that casting an Elvis would have been quite hard. It is also possible that the copyright on his image may have prevented it. But maybe changing it yo another character may have brought that humour back in. It by no means detracts from the film. It would recommend this to any one who likes the Odd Thomas books.

Followed the book pretty well all down the storyline.Bodachs were different than I imagined, but, were still good.Yes, Odd has all of his powers.I would have liked to see this in the theaters, but, I am not sure if it is ever coming out in the US, so I rented it on Amazon.I really hope they do more of these, especially ""In Odd We Trust!"" But, we'll see.I was especially surprised and pleased by Willem Dafoe's role in this movie -- I was initially skeptical about him playing the chief, but, he did a great job and did not bring his darkness. He played a really great character.It took me a bit to get over Chekov as Odd Thomas, but I sank into the story and just went with the ride.I do recommend this movie and hope for others.",Odd Thomas
234,groo-461-874328,Just Vanilla,4,21 February 2014,"I'm a fan of the books and was hoping for a better adaption. The movie adaption was not Moose track or Cherry Garcia ice cream, it was plain vanilla. The acting was nearly an atrocity, especially with whomever played Stormy. The movie seemed thrown together on a whim. Anton Yelchin is an excellent actor, but the movie was just to mundane. It wasn't a terrible movie, it was just blah. I would have preferred to wait till Netflix gets it. They also changed a few things that shouldn't have been messed with. All in all, if you're laid up in bed and have nothing better to do, watch it on video. I wouldn't have wanted to pay full price at a theater.",Odd Thomas
235,mikecaryus,Well Done,10,4 November 2014,Missed this because of traveling...got to catch up with Netflix...is a great Koontz series...am happy to see it finally brought to life...just fun reading and even more fun watching...that's what movies are for. Good Flic...ready for the next one...hope they made more than 30 Mil on this or they won't do it again. The Character of Odd is real and understandable because he's with you in your head as he brings you along by hearing what your seeing and not being left behind. His love and relationship with Stormy is simple and your apart of their happiness with one another...cheering on but apprehensive at the same time. The interplay between the Chief and Odd is understood from the beginning and that's what you want for Odd...to have the right people understand and believe in his gift... The weave by Mr.Koontz is always magical and cinematic folks did him proud.,Odd Thomas
236,laurabevan,TRAGEDY!!! It's ripped on YouTube ALL over the place!!!,7,11 September 2013,"I am a HUGE advocate and fan of the Odd Thomas chronicles. I've been creeping IMDb since the movie's inception and I am SO very disappointed I didn't get a chance to see it in the theaters. Even MORE upsetting is that Anton Yelchin had more inner-dialogue than actual interaction with other characters. I think Anton is an extremely charismatic and amazing actor, and I would enjoy watching footage of him just sit in a cardboard box. The kid has amazing acting chops.At this point, I would totally pay $50 just to see this on the big screen. I found it on YouTube in low-res and watched it with a friend that is completely unfamiliar with dear Odd. At the last scene, I was crying my eyes out. NO, not because the movie was that moving, but because I was remembering how moved I was by the end of the first book.It was a slightly-better-than-mediocre movie but I would still really like the chance to see it on the big screen. You know - with popcorn and stuff.",Odd Thomas
237,liviumpopescu,disappointing,5,7 August 2016,"Big disappointment watching this movie comparing to the solid novel of Dean Koontz! Poor acting of all actors... Unappropriate music... A lot of scene from the novel are missing: Elvis's ghost, Terri Stambaugh, Rosalia Sanchez etc. And it is too short, to be much closer to the book it had should been minimum 2 hours... It's more a teenage game than a dramatic movie! Dialog was choppy and uneven. I did think the special effects and cinematography in general were good. But the rest just wasn't great. I prefer reading the novels of Dean Koontz, the ""Odd Thomas"" series. Also expecting a much better movie after the second part,""Forever Odd"". My rating: 5 out of 10.",Odd Thomas
238,tbuff-563-117992,Way off the mark,2,30 March 2014,"Apparently, Dean Koontz books just cannot be made into movies.All of the reviews from ""Huge Dean Koontz"" and ""Odd Thomas"" fans that I read which gave this movie more than 2 stars, I have to say- you are way off the mark. The Odd character didn't suck me into his world like I wanted/hoped would happen. Stormy was not nearly as strong a character as she should have been. Plus, their relationship didn't even come close to the power in this screen adaptation as it should have. And really, that is the crux of the first Odd Thomas book.Other pivotal characters that should have been included were not, and those that were, well... William Dafoe as Chief Wyatt Porter? Patton Oswalt as Little Ozzie? and with only a cameo appearance? Come. On.This movie comes off as more of an action film, when really it's a story of how Odd deals with his abilities and the relationship between Odd and Stormy, with action a necessary part of the story. Bad Direction? -- Check. Poor Casting? -- Check.Hollywood takes too many liberties in this adaptation and this movies fails as a result. I wish Mr. Koontz would just start his own studio so that his books could be made into proper movies that his fans would love to see.",Odd Thomas
239,crystal_gordon11,I recommend this one.,10,25 June 2013,"So, much to my surprise, I enjoyed this one. I was skeptical before viewing because of the log line but it really took me on a ride. It was funny, sweet, sad, a bit scary, and had action. The mystery kept me engaged and the love story was so sweet but not sappy at the same time. The dialogue was great. I think Stephen Sommers did an outstanding job on the screenplay. Not to mention, he also directed and produced it. Kudos to him. I was shocked and impressed. I actually wasn't expecting the last plot twist. I didn't think so many elements could come together in one film and create harmony but it did. The genre says mystery/thriller but I think mystery/romance/comedy/thriller/action would be better suited. Go watch it.",Odd Thomas
240,trevornumber17,A much better movie than you'd expect.,8,25 June 2013,"This is my first review i've done of a movie on IMDb, so maybe that alone shows how much I enjoyed this movie.It was filled with action, adventure, romance, heart, even mild comedy when the character of Oz (Patton Oswalt) was introduced. This movie like most new movies is very fast paced, and witty with the word play and sarcastic tones that some characters had. The lead roles were chosen wonderfully. Anton Yelchin (Odd) in one of his maybe breakout rolls. I'd hope to see him play more lead roles very soon as he is a great actor, you can even tell by his large amount of upcoming movies in 2013 and 14. DaFoe was outstanding as he much always is, his character had bits and pieces it would seem from his role as the main Detective of The Boondock Saints. The supporting roles were great, and there's a twist at the end that caught me off guard.Great movie!",Odd Thomas
241,scox-samcox,Complete garbage,1,25 June 2013,"I used to be a big fan of the Odd Thomas books and am currently working my way through Koontz's latest instalment, this film however is a disgrace. Yes the books and characters therein were humorous, but also subtle. The film however doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a full on comedy or a B-movie thriller that gets its laughs from poor acting and cheap effects. Yelchin does suit the part quite well, but the laid back enthusiasm and cheery de-meaner he portrays is ridiculous considering the impending mass-genocide. The bodacks looked pretty cool, but frankly I was more scared by Piranha 3D; the acting was better in that film too, now that's saying something. SPOILER: I would have been willing to overlook the gimmicky infantile style used if it wasn't for the fact the ending of the book was completely destroyed. Stormy's death was an excellent and heart wrenching piece of literature, and its exclusion from this film made the whole story pointless. Foe the love of god don't make a sequel, you've done enough damage already.",Odd Thomas
242,mcgillconstruction1,Can't wait for the next one!!!,10,28 June 2013,"I really enjoyed this flick. I read most of the Odd Thomas books and felt the story kinda went off track except the end, it was spot on to me. the feeling I had was so emotional I remember crying as I read the book towards the end as well as the movie. If the producer keeps on making the movies I will watch them just out of respect for the book which in my opinion were some of the most entertaining and attention grabbing books I have ever read. the best part was the diner seen its shot in Santa Fe as well as a few other scenes I can tell my own city when I see it. hopefully I cant be an extra next time they shoot here but it seems as if Las Vegas is where they will be shooting next. all in all I'm still in awe that they turned this book into a movie which is awesome to me so thanks again cant wait to see what they do in the next one because that will be amazing to see all the books shot as a movie!",Odd Thomas
243,ramanama16,"Immersive, funny, dynamic. Recommended without any reservation!",9,29 June 2013,"Easyly one of the films that focus on what matters. Acting , screenplay, good pace and dosage of action, mystery, drama, comedy and all under the light of the paranormal with no logic leaps like most films of the kind present. Not having read the book, it is understandable that the story is the main reason for the enjoyable mix this film is. No mater how good a book is though it needs a good director and script writer to produce something that fun to watch. Acting wise, being no expert, the film was really well communicated, not boring, and well chosen actors from the lead to the smallest role. The compelling point for me was that this film made effortless succession from being funny to dramatic to dynamic, mysterious and metaphysical. This film delivered the goods for me. Kudos",Odd Thomas
244,lezboss83,Great book to film adaptation,10,29 June 2013,"Now i have been waiting a long time for this adaptation and to personally hear nothing about it previous to watching the film and the fact that its such a popular book series and didn't make it to the BIG screen i have to say i was blown away by how much i loved it.Now i know there was a lot of the finer points of the book missing but that's what usually happens when transferring book to film due to one reason or another and taking this into account for me i though it had everything it needed and more it was so great to finally see the images in your head from the book finally put to the screen and done well for example the bodachs.Odd and Stormy were portrayed really well although maybe Odd could have come across a little more odd at times but over all i thought he did an amazing job capturing the essence of the character especially with the inner monologues which i though was fantastic, they really help to understand whats going on inside the head of odd.Actually i thought everyone was pretty spot on with there portrayals although we didn't get to see much of Ozzie, and yes there was know Elvis but i am personally glad as this potentially could have ruined the movie if they didn't get it just right.So over all i loved it and thought it was a Great book to film adaptation and if you haven't read the book still a highly entertaining movie with something for everyone, but definitely do yourself a favor and read the series as well.",Odd Thomas

247,olas_world,Great adaptation,9,7 August 2013,"I know I won't be alone in my opinion. And I also know there will be countless others that will disagree with me. But I have to say that I loved this movie.Was it all that it could have been? Perhaps not. But as others have stated, this wasn't a 100 million dollar production. But then again, I don't think it needed to be. There are plenty of lower budget ""indie"" films that have gone on to be huge. Or, they never do well financially, but produce Oscar winning performances. And then there are just the ones that I call the ""Donnie Darko"" films. The great movies that will just have their following, and be happy knowing that at least somebody out there recognizes how good it really is. Or as most call it, a cult film. I think Odd Thomas will fall into that category. I have read all the books, and I have loved the characters. And this is one of the very few times that I have said that a movie has truly captured everything that was good about a book, on film. Sure some things have to get left out, but that's natural. But the two main leads..Anton Yelchin, and Addison Timlin, made me believe that they really were, Odd and Stormy. If you enjoyed the books, then in my opinion, you will love this movie. And for all the haters out there. You are definitely entitled to your opinion, but mine is that this was a very fine adaptation.",Odd Thomas
248,tanjawest,Much better than I had expected,9,5 October 2013,"I watched this with my Husband recently and was blown away, the character Odd played by Anton Yelchin, played his role in my view, Brilliantly and his girl friend Stormy played by Ashley Sommers fit the role really well I thoroughly enjoyed this story, I new the story line already from the books, and the only real fault I can find in the film is that the story line was a little rushed as I didn't have time to bond with the characters properly.I'm also glad they dropped Elvis, and just left the paper cut out for all those who read the book, which was my main worry when the film started as I always found it a little too much weirdness in one story.I really hope they follow up with the forever Odd sequel.fingers crossed.",Odd Thomas

250,lilblackbackpack80,Terribly disappointing.,1,4 May 2014,"I've recently read all the books and just finished the movie. I couldn't stand it. Not one bit. I understand editing a story to convert it to film but so much was changed, and not in particularly helpful ways, either. My sister, never having read the books, enjoyed it well enough but right from the start I was put off by every piece of it. The feel and filming style were so distracting. So much depth and beauty, just gone. I can't help but wonder what Dean Koontz thinks of his 'Odd' world. But perhaps it's not meant for the fans of the original story but for those who never experienced said world.I do believe that throughout life it really IS the little things that count, equally so in movies(or so it should be). In this adaptation so many of these little things were just discarded without a thought as to what they added to the story. So many little things that, together, brought beauty and the depth to the story, characters, and plot. Alas, to each their own, I suppose...I do believe, though, that it was a terrible waste.",Odd Thomas

I think he's very talented and I'm glad he's been getting more work lately. He didn't disappoint, as usual. However, Stormy was stiff and 'too cool for school', unlike the book character. I would have liked to see more development for other characters, like Chief. It didn't follow the books very closely, but that's to be expected. I think they did pretty well with the material, though. The jokes and twists were predictable, but I still enjoyed watching it. My girls really liked it too, and that was what mattered most. I believe that a sequel would get more attention, now that the teenage crowd can swoon over Anton and create a base audience.",Odd Thomas
252,celestialdoble30,"Read the books, it makes the movie better!",7,20 June 2021,"A lot of people are asking why such good reviews on this movie. It's sort of like that inside joke. The ""you had to be there"" concept. If you notice most of the good reviews are from those that love Koontz and read the Odd series. I'm on book 4. The books are amazing. And this movie follows closely with the first book, minus a few details omitted or added. I understand it can't be exact. It would take a TV series to include all the details of the books. Which really would be AWESOME! I hope they create a series.I gave this movie 7 stars because of the following: I wish they had included the ghost of Elvis. Elvis was such a big part of the books and Odd's sanity in some moments. Ozzie's character was hugely minimized (no pun intended). Which was a bummer. Also they didn't include a lot of the conflict Odd ran into during his pursuits. Like the coyotes after dumping fungus mans body. He was more clumsy and awkward in the book. He wasn't strong or fast and had no physical special abilities. This makes the story in the books more interesting. The struggle is important. It gives the story depth.Otherwise we loved the movie. I loved how they kept the sarcastic humor dialogue.",Odd Thomas
253,gilchrist89,A Surprising and Awesome Adaptation,10,6 February 2014,"I've seen a lot of varying reviews on this, people seem to love it or hate it. I thought it was an incredible adaptation. The movie was almost word for word from the book, except in areas where things had to be changed in order for it to work on screen. Anton Yelchin was the perfect Odd. He captured Odd's innocent optimism, cheesy humor and adoration of Stormy. Addison Timlin was a fabulous Stormy,their chemistry really worked and their quirkiness was beautifully captured. They were adorable.I'm a huge fan of the Odd Thomas books and I seriously doubted their ability to capture the material, largely due to the cheesy/silly nature of Odd's outlook and humor and the way that blends with his optimism and hopefulness about life/the afterlife, even when constantly faced with horror and trauma. The books are a fairly unique blend and I was very impressed by Stephens Sommers ability to bring it all together without it becoming over-the-top.I'd say this was the closest thing I've seen to a perfect book adaptation, I thought the film was full of whimsical charm, very well acted and very entertaining. The CGI is not the best you'll ever see, but don't expect it to be -- it's a low budget film. If you don't like a side of silliness with your humor, you may not enjoy a movie about the world's best short-order cook who can see dead people. You don't need to have read the books to enjoy the movie, I'd been trying to talk my sister into reading the books for years but she never got around to it. She loved the movie, though, and immediately downloaded the book (Audible version) after we watched it. Not everyone's taste is the same, but I think you should give this movie a shot. There's a better than average chance you'll really enjoy yourself and it's nice to watch a movie that is a little different from everything else now and again.After all the struggles and the delays with this I can't imagine they'll make the rest of the books, but I will still hold out hope. This was so well handled, I would LOVE to see them take on the rest of the series.",Odd Thomas
254,james-926-486400,Very cool adaptation.,9,16 February 2014,"I missed The King and there was not much Oz but it was so true to the heart and soul of the original book I still loved it. The quirky outlook on life, the style and cadence of the books, are truly represented here. Odd lives an unusual life, but it is the only one he knows. He does not consider it anything other than just the way things are. No whining, just dealing with it the best he can. The ending is so well done that those who know the story will be as entranced as those who don't, and that is saying something! I hope the sequels are on the way as well. I NEVER thought those words would ever come from me, but there hey are!!!",Odd Thomas
255,merritt-langley,For the fans of the book:,7,26 February 2014,"I showed this movie to my mother, and then to a younger sibling, both of which had never read or heard of the novels. They both didn't quite get the movie. They followed the plot and had lots of questions by the end. However, giving me their honest opinions of how much they enjoyed it (at least they said it was honest), still gave the movie a 7 and 8 out of 10 respectively. But still, I believe this movie will be more enjoyed by fans of the books than those who'd never heard of it.I'd read that author Dean Koontz had quit adapting his books to movies after a few failed ventures, but I was so excited when I'd first heard he changed his mind for this particular book. I am personally a very visual guy. I read many books, but I always prefer movies. It's a curse because there's a war between 'the book is always better than the movie' and always wanting the movie to be so much better.Like most reviews here note, the movie captures the surface of the characters of the book and left a lot out, even changing story features to condense the tale (I guess) so that the plot could stay central to the film. To capture all the content of the book, the movie would have to be really long, or barely brush on each aspect and do them no justice. So you can't really blame the film makers, and what they ended up working with made the movie as enjoyable as possible. The core concept of the story is present and not mangled, and I gotta lend it to them for not butchering a story I am very fond of.I personally was most disappointed at Odd's and Stormy's chemistry in the movie. The film keeps most of (all?) the expected plot points and twists, and to fans of the book, their detailed chemistry and deep love for each other is what helps those very specific powerful parts in the story actually be powerful (fans of the book know what I'm talking about). In the movie, those parts aren't stale, but definitely didn't spark the same intensity of emotions the book was capable of doing. And remember, I'm a visual guy, a movie is always far more likely to stir up emotions.The second (and last) thing I was personally disappointed in, was the four second conversation between Odd and Ozzie. And again, they can't add every aspect of the book into the movie.. this is an example of brushing on an aspect and doing it no justice.. When I heard Patton Oswalt was going to play the character, I was really excited. Oswalt is someone I believed could perfectly define the personality of Ozzie and I built that hype up for myself for nothing because he just comes off as another stranger Odd happens to know.The movie is very fun to watch! It's highly enjoyable! But if you enjoyed the movie and like to read, the book will take you on a bigger adventure.",Odd Thomas

You had a good guy with the beautiful girl; our hero is a little 'odd' pun intended, and he has these abilities which he uses to help people. He has learned to defend himself an is not just a weak character using luck to get by, but learned to handle himself as he states in the film, and the local police chief is behind him.So what's not to love about this film? We have the cute girl, beautiful, stunning, obviously loves our main hero, then what might you ask could go wrong with this film? In a nut shell, ""Stormy"" the destined love of our hero Odd Thomas is killed at the end of the film.How many times must fans explain to writers, producers, and film companies that if you want your movie to be a success, then you must follow this simply diagram; the good guy wins in the end and gets the girl. It is that simple folks! The bad guys may win a few battles here and there and our hero and the girl he loves might get injured, but what you do NOT do—Seriously, what you do NOT, NOT, do is kill our either the main character of the film or the girl he loves.

It deserves at least a 7 point something.When i decided to watch this movie i didn't even think it will be this good. The main character's got a nice sense of humor especially when in dangerous situations. I haven't seen any movie that falls into so many genres and still makes it work.

I really liked this movie and thought they did a good job getting the main feelings, characters and story across. Is it a little different from the book? Yes, but movies have to be, a book is hours of reading and a movie is 2 hours. And in the book a lot of what takes place is in Odd's thoughts and the movie did an excellent job with that which is not an easy thing to do. My only complaint is that I really missed Elvis and Oz, which besides Thomas were two of my favorite characters but neither were necessary for the story line.

If he's a Koontz fan, shame on him. This film moves just like his awful ""The Mummy."" What is supposed to be nail-biting is merely one dopey, light-hearted scene after another. Two of the most harrowing parts of the book: Fungus Man's ""portal to Hell."" In the film, it's nothing but cheap FX. And hiding Fungus' body? OMG, the book made me CRINGE in suspense! In the movie? Wrap him, move him and drop him. The end. No tarantula. No coyotes. (The film is only 96 minutes.) Frankly, there's a complete lack of suspense and fright. The ONE light moment he could have written was Ghost Elvis, but he's not part of the film. Plus, Odd is, well, strange. In the book, he plays much more like Crispin Glover. Anton Yechhh was too cutesy (and Charlie Bartlett). And why bother to have Ozzie in the film? He's there in one mall scene (wtf was that?) about 150 lbs too small and no Terrible Chester. I wasted $8 on PPV, because I couldn't wait for Redbox. Boo, Sommers. You have no concept of mood, tone or casting. I hope you read this.",Odd Thomas

The books where so enjoyable and I was hoping for a true to the feel of the book adaptation. Flipping pancakes into a stack with CGI, cutting cucumbers with CGI? Really??.. Too much CGI in my opinion, Bodachs CGI was OK, but other than that why was it needed?I connected with the character from the books, as I know everyone else who I spoke to did. I could not connect with the film character of ODD THOMAS or any other main characters either.The way I remember the books was ODD being someone who tried to lay low, soft spoken and a NON SuperHero, HERO.. Yes he was compelled to help the dead who sought him out, but the way he was written in the film made him appear a bit too tough and cool, which he was not. I see that the director only writes and directs action films which explains a lot.Overall it felt more like a made for SYFY TV movie that did not lend itself to the true feel of the books.

261,dhare-959-841603,Favorite book adaptation so far.,10,27 March 2014,"My mantra has always, always been that a movie cannot come close to the scope and emotion of a book. This was the first time I've been so happily wrong. The Odd Thomas books are close to my favorite Koontz characters, perhaps only edged out by Christopher Snow's menagerie or Twilight Eyes.The actors, writers, and director of this movie captured everything I love about the story; it is simultaneously creepy, optimistic, loving, hopeful and suspenseful. Knowing the plot did not affect my emotions or the impact of the finale.I don't know if this movie got short shrift because of the controversy, the lack of theater release, or the critics were unfamiliar with the source material - I would think that the latter should be no excuse for a work as the medium should stand alone and all that, but I think the low reviews are inexplicable and they baffle me.I truly wish this had been a hit for all the right reasons, primarily so I could see Anton Yelchin and Stephen Sommers bring the rest of the story to the screen.

I would recommended this movie to every one! The more people the watch it the more of a chance for a sequel. Odd Thomas is funny, smart, suspenseful, and romantic all wrapped up into one. The special effects were great, the way the monsters move is exactly how I pictured it. The acting was great, the choices for Odd Thomas and Stormy were spot on. It's been a while since I read the books and there seemed like there were a few parts that were. Little off, but all together it was a great movie, for people that read the book and people that didn't.",Odd Thomas
264,oxdoc,Excellent adaptation of Dean Koontz' book,10,6 April 2014,"I was leery as to how this film would come across compared to the novel. the movie was rated 2 stars on our Shaw TV programing guide. ....but it was excellent. The casting was perfect and the characters were just as I had imagined when I read the novel. The directing was smooth throughout the film. The whole production couldn't have been done better ~ the music score usually tells me if I will like the filmand it was very well done........This film did a favorable job of following Dean Koontz's novel, bringing the characters to life ~ the special effects portrayed just what Odd Thomas was seeing and in turn, felt. This was a very exciting film from beginning to end and we are all looking forward to the next Odd Thomas movie ~ Hopefully very soon",Odd Thomas
265,larry-phenneger,One of the best,10,28 April 2014,"This movie was a surprise! Just happened upon it and loved it! One of those movies you can watch again and again. A fresh retake of a theme done to death, but this one works! If your looking for a great movie. One that it is not a waster of time. Watch this one. The acting was great! The directing, perfect! Everything about this one worked! IF your tired of the old, ""I see dead people"" theme, you will still love this. The actor who played the lead did a great job in making the part believable, as did all the supporting cast. You have to see this one!In this instance the gift is actually used. I just wanted to say watch this, but IMDb has a minimum number of lines! I don't want to spoil the movie, just watch it!",Odd Thomas
266,Spencer_Has,Absolutely loved it!,10,30 April 2014,"When i see a movie that originates from a book, the first thing i think is the absolute worst. But as far as book to movies go. This one does the opposite for most. It had everything from the book and no fillers that i was aware of. If you've read this book then watch it! It did 10 out of 10 in my book and i've only watched very few movies that astound me like this one did. The roles were perfect with the actors. And the personality with the main actor was spot on with the character in the book. They got everything down from the book in the scenes and with the right pacing as well. It never seemed rushed with anything nor slow. I really hope with the amazing work they did here. It will allow the process to get the rest of the series out on the big screen. Great work! Keep this up!!",Odd Thomas
267,ghodge2009,Poor Adaptation,3,5 May 2014,"Love the books, disappointed in the movie. In general I view this as a poor adaptation by the director. Did he read the book? Or if he did, did he like the book? This came off more as a cartoon and probably should have been animated to protect the actors images. I won't even place blame on performances, although some were very bland. I thought Anton Yelchin was a fine choice and as much grief as Addison Timlin gets from some reviewers, to me the blame has to go to Stephen Sommers. Other actor choices were head scratchers. The choice of Patton Oswalt for Ozzy Boone was without inspiration, but I guess it didn't matter since there was no plan to use this important character from the book except in a silly cameo.As a fan of the series, Mr Koontz please try again (Can you come up with another $27M)! Great choice of a book to adapt for a movie. Extremely poor execution.",Odd Thomas
268,phantomdc4,Unexpectedly Excellent,10,19 June 2014,"This movie is a sleeper hit. You may not expect it, but this is one of the best movies ever made. The plot is strong. The characters are solid. The action is intense. The love story will rip at your heart-strings! Anton Yelchin is one of the best actors of our generation. Most movies like this are quite predictable, but this one will send you for a few loops. You think you know what is going on, but the whole time - you have no idea! HAHA.It is very creative and very imaginative. If this review didn't have to be ten lines long, I probably would've convinced you already! If you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh and cry within the same 30 mins, then this will satisfy you completely.",Odd Thomas
269,bokonon9,I was not disappointed,10,26 August 2014,"I was a little worried that Hollywood would butcher this book that I love so much. But I needn't have worried; they did a great job bringing Odd Thomas to the screen.They stick pretty much to the book. Of course in a less-than-2-hour movie you have leave out or consolidate some things, but they did it without doing violence to the storyline or the main characters.The chemistry between Odd and Stormy is steamy and, ultimately, heartbreaking - even better than the book (maybe this is just because Addison Timlin is just soooooo hot). The ending was done perfectly. And Anton Yelchin was the perfect choice to play Odd Thomas.I wondered if they would do a good job explaining Odd's well, odd, abilities. I thought they pulled it off splendidly, but maybe that's because I had read all the books and already understood how it all worked. I would be interested to hear an opinion on this from someone for whom the movie was a first introduction to the story and the characters.I really loved this film and have watched it several times.",Odd Thomas
270,adaptordiebaby,"Loop in to this one, Odd Thomas fans!",9,25 September 2014,"Anton Yelchin truly captured the character of Odd--sweet, winsome, emotional and yes, odd. Of course, Willem Dafoe ROCKED as the Chief-- can't recall him being anything but stellar no matter the role. The relationship between Odd and Stormy was a little stiff but Addison Timlin was sweet and sassy and smartass enough to pull it together. Great SFX-the bodachs were as creepy and scary as the book portrayed them! Followed the story line of the book faithfully with few anomalies and kept the overall spirit. Would've liked to have some of the other characters fleshed out--especially Ozzie who was such a friend and influence to Odd. But hey, movies have their limitations and within them, I really enjoyed it!",Odd Thomas
271,bcherry-124-707978,Good flick and very decent adaptation of a great book.,8,4 October 2014,"Loved this book. I almost loved the movie just as much. A few character flaws that didn't fit my taste, but I suppose that happens in a book/movie transfer. Don't let that stop you though. Koontz is hard to transfer to movie form but I feel this is about as close as you can come. I loved the choice of actor for Odd and then throw in Willem Dafoe, how can you go wrong? Some elements are missing of course but you might not even notice. I have only seen 2 or 3 Koontz books gone movie that I actually liked. This was the best of them all I think. I don't want to say much more and try to be a spoiler, but I watched this with my 14 year old daughter. She broke down a cried like a 2 year old at the end.",Odd Thomas
272,Mzlica,I really liked it,8,19 July 2018,"This movie does justice to Dean Koontz's book.
Anton Yelchin's acting was great, really spot on.",Odd Thomas
273,gabesreview,An enjoyable waste of time,5,9 December 2014,"In idly cruising through the itunes movie section, I happened upon ODD THOMAS. This film was written, produced, and directed, by Stephen Sommers. Stephen, you may remember, is the acclaimed director of THE MUMMY (good) and GI JOE: RISE OF COBRA (seven kinds of bad). ODD THOMAS is adapted from a Dean Koontz novel which I have never heard of. Being bored and having nothing else to do, I decided to watch it. I will have to say, it turned out to be exactly what I thought it would be. That is, it is a horrible film, however, in the right mood very enjoyable. Since I felt like I knew what I was getting into, I appreciated the fact that the movie got right to the point. It didn't spend a lot of time introducing characters, developing story lines, etc. It just hit the ground running. The protagonist is a young man named Odd Thomas. Odd has the unique ability to see dead people. He uses this gift to fight crime on a freelance basis for his small town of Pico Mundo. This much is learned within the first few minutes of the film. It opens with a frenetically cut chase/fight scene and rarely slows down from there. As much as I tried to tell myself to just go with it, I couldn't help but notice a few glaring abominations that greatly detracted from my enjoyment of the film. The major culprits were the editing and the dialogue. The editing was done with that crazy fast paced jump cut hyper stylized nonsense that all the kids are using these days. I have found the films in which this style is most prevalent are often attempting to compensate for their complete lack of substance. So now, even when I am trying to enjoy an insipid action thriller, I am constantly assaulted with vertigo inducing reminders that this film has nothing going for it and I am wasting my time. And the dialogue! The cute silly overly clever dialogue that is far to self aware! Okay, to be fair, about half way through the film I started enjoying the overly indulgent catchy phrases. Actually, I found myself cheering every time a particularly juicy one came up, for which I never had long to wait. There were many enjoyable aspect of this film as well. For one, it certainly did not take itself to seriously. It struck a tone which can be very refreshing in American Cinema, namely ""Hey guys, lighten up! You are watching a movie! Lets have some fun!"" For this I thank the director Mr. Sommers, for in this way, ODD THOMAS, was very similar to his previous film, THE MUMMY. Further, it had Willem Defoe in a supporting role. For the most part I find it very difficult to judge a Defoe performance objectively, since I basically enjoy anything I have ever seen him do. I certainly would not say he was snubbed by the academy for this role, but I did appreciate his presence. Oh and there was a Patton Oswalt cameo, which for me scientifically increases my enjoyment of said film by an indeterminate yet significant margin. I liked the ending of the film and appreciated the message. Over all, however, it was a bad film and a waste of time. That being said, if you don't have anything better to do it is an enjoyable waste of time and a fun movie.",Odd Thomas
274,zkubin,Fantastic movie,9,26 December 2014,"I really don't get the hate for this movie, it was a very refreshing dark comedy. Two thumbs way up. From the very beginning this movie sets itself out to be different from other horror movies. The main Character narrates and he does a fine job. The main girl is smoking hot. This had as much or more of a surprise ending than the ""Sixth Sense"", Only problem might have been with the gross out factor. It is fairly graphic in the same way that Shawn of the Dead is. Apparently I am required to write ten lines of text even if I've given my two cents. Arghh professional blogging is not my thing. Anyways， apparently IMDb does no have Chinese script enabled so I can't leave a review in a different language.",Odd Thomas
275,sumanthsf,A Great Sci-Fi tied into the most beautiful love story Movie,9,19 May 2020,"I cant recommend this movie enough, this story is about a odd young man who doesn't have many friends but a great understanding girl friend with a super power which he uses to save people with help of a local authority.",Odd Thomas
276,smcornett-54670,What did I just watch?,2,9 November 2015,"Seriously. I am writing this review to save some of you some time. Ignore all other reviews. First off, I had high hopes because of all the positive reviews on here. I really was looking forward to watching this. I set aside a couple of hours, popped some popcorn and sat down to enjoy Odd Thomas, a film almost everyone on here recommended. Here is the honest truth. While the story itself is pretty good (kinda like Shaun of the Dead meets The Sixth Sense), everything else was pretty horrible. The acting was bad. Even Willem Defoe couldn't save it. I tried. I really tried to look over the acting but their was absolutely no chemistry. The script was even worse. The lines seemed like someone was trying to be cool or hip or whatever. Like a bunch of catchphrases thrown together as dialogue. The special effects looked very bad. There are scenes where the green screen is so evident it looks like a parody of a movie. And the pacing was off. Everything seemed forced and rushed. And worst of all you never really connect with the female lead character or any character for that matter. This movie has the feel of a low budget television show you catch in mid season and are suppose to already know the characters and don't. I would not recommend this movie.Now that being said, I will be fair. I have never read the novel or novels this was based on. Maybe that would make me like it. Maybe the one's giving this movie positive reviews are Dean Koontz fans. All I know is I wish I would have seen a review like this BEFORE I wasted my time. Maybe I would have read the book first.I give it a 2 out of 10 only because the idea was good.",Odd Thomas

278,gerelyviktor,Worth once,7,11 January 2017,"NO SPOILER PART! I have never even heard about the books. This movie just jumped in front of me in the TV, so I said, why not, let's watch it. I thought I get some bad, stereotypical movie, but I was positively disappointed. The plot is good, the acting is too (but I didn't watch it in original language, so I can only talk about the visual acting), the CGI wasn't bad either.About the characters, Odd is well built, Stormy is decent, the others are good, but could have been better.It does worth a watch, and I will read the books.What made the movie a bit worse, was that I couldn't get the ""I'm watching The Sixth Sense with extras"" feeling out of me.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON! For me, the two cops (as characters) were not good. They weren't introduced well enough, and it was quite predictable, that one of them will contribute, and it wasn't that big of a surprise, that both of them were in it. But what was, is that there were four of them. It was a good twist.And of course, the ending. It pulled the rating up to 7 from 6. I didn't expect that, I thought either Odd dies, or no one else, so it's a big plus.",Odd Thomas

280,jasoncollier-72109,A pleasant surprise...,9,14 November 2016,"I noticed this came up on Netflix and was in the mood to go ahead and try it. I was very pleasantly surprised by it. First, the characters were interesting and engaging. Second, the movie had an entertaining plot that twisted and turned. Third, the movie was the right balance of humor and seriousness that gave it great charm.In addition, I didn't realize it was a book first. After listening to the audiobook recently I have to say the movie did a great job of capturing the book as a movie can. I think I even preferred the movie over the book.If you are in the mood to watch something, but don't know what, I would recommend Odd Thomas whole heartedly.",Odd Thomas

284,gingersteve-94176,Shockingly bad,2,23 March 2019,"I really can't give this movie much credit at all. Some decent special effects, but apart from that it's cardboard all the way. Appalling script that no acting talent can save, and an awful hash made of what could have been an OK storyline.The main Romance is utterly devoid of any soul or passion and there is not a single believable relationship in the whole film. The scene transitions are overly energetic and out of kilter with the pace of the movie, which is also out of pace with itself.Honestly, save yourself an hour and a half and steer clear of this absolute turkey of a film. I honestly don't know what kept me going to the end but I wish I hadn't bothered. Crazily bad film.",Odd Thomas
