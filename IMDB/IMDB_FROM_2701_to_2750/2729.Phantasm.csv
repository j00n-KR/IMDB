0,MartinHafer,"A startling exposé on the dark, seedy side of the funeral business!",8,1 February 2017,"It's important, first off, that you understand that horror films (with the exception of horror from the 30s and 40s) is about my least favorite genre. It's mostly because too many newer films rely on too many gory special effects and not enough on a real plot. They're often just one senseless murder after another. While many love the Halloween and Friday the 13th franchises, they just don't appeal to me. I'm saying all that because this certainly has to effect my impressions of ""Phantasm""....especially since I actually LIKED the movie! It sure ain't sophisticated...but it is incredibly frightening and cool.The biggest reason I liked this film is that unlike so many other slasher films, there is a backstory...an actual REASON for the killings. It's not some indestructible guy in a hockey mask or Leatherface doing all the killing but a weird group of aliens who run a mortuary and do so in order that they can reanimate the dead and send them back to their home planet to become slaves! And, when Mike discovers this, the movie jumps into warp speed--with one crazy, terrifying scene after another....and it NEVER lets up!What I also appreciate about the movie is that although it's incredibly violent, the deaths all are done with low-tech 1979 special effects so it doesn't look the least bit realistic (though I liked the fake urine used in one scene...a nice little touch). If seeing folks REALISTICALLY slaughtered happened in the film, it would have turned me off...and I would have turned off the movie! Overall, weird, very inventive and strangely fun. By the way, although the lead was only 16 and the film was CLEARLY marketed to teens, it is NOT a teen film. There's too much in the gore and boobie departments to make this a film for teens...unless, of course, you're trying to raise a young psychopath.",Phantasm
1,Leofwine_draca,A cult favourite,6,8 October 2016,"This eerie supernatural horror has lots of weird moments which help to make it a cult classic film. Numerous sequels have followed, each composed of the key cast in this, the original. This film is very strange and surreal. Some parts of it are frightening too, such as the dwarf attacks. It blends a lot of different aspects of different genres - horror, thriller, mystery, action, comedy - and it works, although the film just may be too confusing for some. It's a very low budget type of film with cult written all over it.This is my main complaint with the film. With all the plot twists and strange dream-like scenes, it's difficult to keep track of just what is going on exactly. In fact it gave me a headache, and the loud noise didn't help much in that respect. The acting in the film is all excellent; even the young boy isn't too annoying. Angus Scrimm gives a tour-de-force performance as the Tall Man, totally creepy and mysterious. The special effects, although somewhat dated, are still entertaining and the dwarfs look strangely like the Jawas from STAR WARS. PHANTASM is a good film but not one to watch with your brain switched off, you've got to be on the ball in this case. It's just so odd and out there that it's pretty unique too (well, at least it was until the sequels followed).",Phantasm
2,SnoopyStyle,great ideas with indie execution,6,10 April 2015,"Jody Pearson is burying his friend Tommy in Morningside Cementary but refuses to allow his little brother Mike to attend since the trauma of their parents' funeral. Mike sneaks in and sees the mortician The Tall Man use his superhuman strength. Mike witnesses small reanimated creatures attacking people. He is eventually able to convince Jody and their ice cream man friend Reggie. The Tall Man, his deadly flying spheres and his dwarfs are just the beginning. There is also a white room with a gateway to another world.It's a messy disjointed story. The acting is amateurish. The directions are low grade. The production is weak. It's not scary but it has a lot of great ideas. Angus Scrimm looks creepy as The Tall Man. The flying spheres are beautiful instruments of death. These are great concepts that are executed amateurishly.",Phantasm
3,Prismark10,Phantasm,6,10 February 2020,I saw the trailers of this movie as a kid and I can still remember Mike waking up in his bed in a cemetery and the flying spheres.Teenager Mike (Michael Baldwin) cannot get over the death of his parents and is afraid that his older brother Jody (Bill Thornbury) will leave him as well. Mike keeps following his brother around.Jody and Reggie (Reggie Bannister) attend a funeral of a friend who was stabbed by a woman in the cemetery. Mike sees the creepy Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) acting strangely. Mike has weird dreams and he persuades Jody to investigate the funeral home. They find strange happenings and a portal to another world.Phantasm is a disjointed film. The story lacks coherence. It does contain some weird imagery which takes precedence over the story.Director Don Coscarelli has done wonders with a small budget when it comes to the visuals. The flying spheres look really good even now. There is plenty of blood both red and yellow. There is a bare breasted blond. Although why do men in this town decide to have sex in a cemetery for some unfathomable reason?,Phantasm
4,mark.waltz,Phantasamally funny!,7,15 October 2021,"You know the names. Jason, Freddy, Michael. Add the tall man into that list, the type of creepy man that you might see either as a mortician or dentist or minister or just a creepy old guy who lives in the neighborhood that people cross the road to avoid. Angus Scrimm with his long receding hairline is creepy looking just beyond his looks. He's lanky and stoic and barely says a word. Lascivious pervert could be used to describe the image he projects on screen, yet so much more. Hardly human, yellow ooze shoots out of his stump when young Michael Baldwin chops off his fingers while being chased in a mortuary that looks like a cross between ""Suspiria"" and ""The Cabinet of Caligari"".Long aware of the franchise of ""Phantasm"" movies, I wasn't prepared to enjoy this as much as I did. It has to be one of the best horror movies of the 1970's, chilling and funny and weird. As Baldwin's older brother, Bill Thornbury is the first to encounter the tall man who bark at him that the funeral is about to start. It is for one of his best friends, who died under mysterious circumstances, and it is Baldwin who first sees the tall man picking up the coffin by itself and putting it into the hearse. From there, things just get more bizarre with Baldwin stalking the tall man and breaking into the very art decco styled mortuary and encountering a series of bizarre incidents that are funny and scary at the same time.There were tons of horror movies in the 1970s that have become forgotten that deserve more recognition, and the first Phantasm, with its cult following, remains even better than the first Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween combined. The horror comes from what you do not see coming and how it all of a sudden jumps out of you, and that creates frights and laughs you won't soon forget. This is a must for every horror movie fan regardless of what era they were born in because there are so many elements of it that were later utilized in more modern horror films, yet none as unpredictable as this. Perhaps we don't scare as easy as we did when I first came out, but for me, it's a great start to a franchise of films where I don't expect them to match what is delightfully present here.",Phantasm
5,claudio_carvalho,A Weird and Original Cult Movie,7,23 December 2012,"After the death of Tommy (Bill Cone), who was stabbed by a woman at the cemetery, Jody (Bill Thornbury) and his friend Reggie (Reggie Bannister) attend the funeral at the Morningside funeral home. Jody is followed by his teenage brother Mike (Michael Baldwin), who has just lost his parents and is afraid of losing his big brother that intends to travel.Mike snoops around the cemetery and sees the mortician known as The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) carrying Tommy's coffin alone without any help. Mike breaks in the mortuary to investigate the mystery and discovers weird dwarf creatures with yellow blood and dangerous flying spheres that protect the location. When he is chased by The Tall Man, he cuts his finger and brings it home to show Jody to convince his big brother that there is a dark secret in the mortuary. Jody, Reggie and Mike discover that The Tall Man is from outer space and is transforming dead bodies in dwarfs to work as slave in his world. Now they decide that The Tall Man must be destroyed. Will they succeed in their intent?""Phantasm"" is one of the most weird and original cult movies that I have ever seen. The surrealistic and dreamlike story entwines horror with sci-fi with many twists and bizarre characters and situations. I saw ""Phantasm"" for the first time on VHS in the early 80's and I have just seen it again on DVD and surprisingly the film has not aged, only the clothing, the hair style and the special effects. But for fans like me, it is still attractive and entertaining. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Fantasma"" (""Phantasm"")",Phantasm
6,gavin6942,"Another Horror Classic, And With Good Reason",8,5 March 2007,"A teenage boy (Michael Baldwin) stumbles upon a plot by a very tall mortuary worker (Angus Scrimm) to steal dead bodies and turn them into midget slaves for an alien world. With the help of his older brother (Bill Thornberry), the boy hopes to cut the tall man down to size.Many years later, Don Coscarelli is now seen as a master of horror and Angus Scrimm somewhat of a horror icon (though to a lesser degree than, say, Robert Englund). While the plot I have outlined above may sound silly, the actual execution of this idea makes it clear why this film has really lodged itself in horror history and spawned numerous sequels (all starring Scrimm).This film captures the feeling of the late 1970s and early 1980s horror with the young boy stumbling upon a plot of large, sinister proportions. Horror geared towards the youth of a generation who have parents who may not believe them (or in this case, an older brother). I really like this theme, much like ""The Goonies"", ""The Monster Squad"" and ""Lost Boys"" -- a kid's film without being childish.""Phantasm"" has become known for the silver balls, and believe me -- when Angus Scrimm puts one of his balls in your face, you won't be happy about it. A bloody mess is all you will get! I really enjoyed the effect of this (remember, this is 1979 when effects still took some creativity). Some of the tricks they pull off are impressive considering computer technology of the day, and also considering Coscarelli himself was writing and directing at the unthinkably young age of 23.Now, some things I did not understand. For example, why are the midgets bleeding macaroni and cheese instead of blood? And more importantly, why does the tall man have to transform into a woman to stab people in the cemetery? If he is super strong and has those silver balls, he really does not have to be very sneaky about the whole ordeal, does he? But these are issues that can always be addressed in sequels.Some of the acting is cheesy -- people deliver their lines in a way that sounds forced, and Jody (the older brother) looks like he belongs behind the wheel of the General Lee. And Michael spends half the film looking like a girl. (I have met the entire cast, and I can assure you that Baldwin grew out of this phase.)But, seriously, check this film out. Created roughly in the same time period as ""Halloween"", you are left with a similar feeling. Only this one is more light-hearted and ""feel good"" and less ""the embodiment of evil"". I suppose it depends on your personal taste or your mood for the day. Myself, I like a little bit of the unusual thrown in to a movie just to keep me guessing. And, edging out ""Halloween"", this may be the longest-running horror franchise, running from 1979 through 2016 (37 years!). Over the years, ""Phantasm"" has been released in a variety of ways, but I think the definitive release finally exists thanks to Well Go USA. I asked Coscarelli why he went with Well Go (known for their martial arts movies) rather than Arrow Video or Scream Factory, and his answer was quite simple -- they had the most enthusiasm. And they have put together a nice package, too. The remastered Blu-ray looks sharp. WGN host and super-phan Nick Digilio screened it in Chicago in August 2016 and audiences were shocked to see individual raindrops. The new scan is better than the original print. The disc also contains a vintage interview with Coscarelli and Scrimm circa 1979, and an episode of ""Graveyard Carz"" where Coscarelli and Baldwin drive around in a Barracuda tribute car.",Phantasm
7,jboothmillard,Phantasm,4,5 October 2017,"I found out about this film from horror compilation Ultimate Boogeymen: The Killer Compilation, which consisted of notable scary movie villains, killers and monsters, I was hoping it might be something worthwhile. Basically following the deaths of his parents, 24-year-old musician Jody Pearson (Bill Thornbury) raises his 13-year- old brother Mike (A. Michael Baldwin) in a small Oregon town disturbed by the mysterious deaths of its citizens. Family man and ice cream vendor Reggie (Reggie Bannister) joins the brothers in their suspicions of the local mortician, dubbed the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), they believe he is responsible for the deaths. Mike relays his fears to a Fortuneteller (Mary Ellen Shaw) and her Granddaughter (Terrie Kalbus) about the possibility of Jody departing and leaving him in the care of his aunt, and his suspicions about the Tall Man. Mike is shown a small black box and told to put his hand inside, something grips his hand, he panics, before being told to calm down, and the grip of the box relaxes, he is taught that there should be nothing to fear but fear itself. Mike decides to enter the mausoleum, and finds the lair of the Tall Man, a series of corridors with wall burials, he is pursued by flying silver spheres, capable of drilling into the head of a victim, and a number of minions, that are in fact deceased townspeople, their corpses have been shrunk down. Jody and Reggie are sceptical about Mike's stories of what he has found, but they are eventually convinced, they all enter the mausoleum, and find white room filled with containers, as well as two beams. Mike unintentionally finds that the beams are a gateway, leading to another planet, he enters this briefly, and sees the dwarfs working as slaves, Reggie tries to escape from the Tall Man, but appears to be stabbed and killed. Mike and Jody barely escape, and devise a plan to lure the Tall Man into a local deserted mine shaft and trap him inside, they are successful, then Mike suddenly wakes up, lying next to the fire. Reggie is there and tells him he was having a nightmare, in fact Jody was killed in a car accident, this has been a common occurrence for Mike. In the end, Mike enters his bedroom, he is shocked to find the Tall Man there waiting behind the door, and he is dragged through the bedroom mirror by one of the dwarf minions. Also starring Kathy Lester as Lady in Lavender, Kenneth V. Jones as Caretaker, Susan Harper as Girlfriend and Lynn Eastman-Rossi as Sally. Scrimm does make a menacing villain, but it sits right between imaginative and illogical, a macabre fun-house mortuary is fine, and the shiny flying balls drilling and spilling blood are nasty, but the science-fiction stuff and slave dwarfs take it to a ridiculous level, a weird but sort of alright cult horror. Okay!",Phantasm
8,Woodyanders,Beware of the Tall Man and stay out of the cemetery,9,29 January 2020,"Teenage boy Mike (a credible and likeable performance by Michael Baldwin) suspects that the weird tall man mortician (a splendidly sinister turn by Angus Scrimm) at a mysterious funeral home is up to no good, but can't convince his older brother Jody (an engaging portrayal by Bill Thornbury) that something is amiss.Writer/director Don Coscarelli not only does a masterful job of creating and sustaining a supremely surreal'n'spooky gloom-doom atmosphere, but also cleverly blends elements of horror (the infamous silver sphere in particular is a startling sight to behold in action!), humor, and science fiction into an extremely unique, surprising, and hugely enjoyable whole. Moreover, Coscarelli also offers a rich exploration of basic adolescent fears and hang-ups pertaining to death, loss, sex, and fear of abandonment that gives this film a substantial amount of additional depth and resonance.Most importantly, the protagonists register well as sympathetic everyday folks who find themselves caught up in an otherworldly situation that's way beyond their ability to initially understand or effectively cope with. Reggie Banister lends sturdy support as easygoing ice cream man Reggie while Kathy Lester makes a favorable impression as the lovely (and lethal) Lady in Lavender. The spot-on creepy score by Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave further enhances the overall eerie mood. Totally deserving of its stellar cult classic status.",Phantasm
9,BA_Harrison,"Bizarre, but entertaining.",7,16 June 2011,"Don't go looking for a coherent narrative in Don Coscarelli's Phantasm, 'cos there isn't one: the film develops in a seemingly random and totally illogical manner. Although some will regard this erratic, disjointed style as shoddiness on the director's part, I found that it makes for a uniquely enjoyable viewing experience, lending the whole affair a decidedly unsettling, otherworldly quality—quite literally, the stuff of dreams and nightmares.It is this air of eerie unpredictability that has earned Phantasm a loyal following with the cult movie crowd, who are able to look past the film's obvious technical shortcomings and simply enjoy its surreal majesty. Amongst the stranger sights on offer: a severed finger oozing yellow goop that transforms into an over-sized bug; an old woman and her grand-daughter, both bearing star-shaped marks on their face, perform supernatural trickery in front of an unfazed Mike; two women are attacked and abducted by dwarfs in Jawa outfits; an inter-dimensional gate to a world where shrunken reanimated corpses are used as slaves; a flying silver sphere latches onto a man's head, drills through his cranium, and pumps the blood out of his body (Jeez, what was Coscarelli smoking when he wrote this and where can I get some?).NB.—Perhaps one of the most interesting things about Phantasm is that it undoubtedly influenced Wes Craven when making A Nightmare On Elm Street, several moments in Craven's film bearing more than a passing similarity to certain scenes in Coscarelli's film: Nancy becoming mired in goo whilst fleeing from Freddy mimics Mike's sprint through a muddy bog whilst pursued by The Tall Man; Marge Thompson being pulled through the door at the end of Elm Street mirrors (pun intended) Mike's fate in Phantasm; and, rather strangely, Mr. Krueger's transformation into a hot nurse in Dream Warriors is very similar to The Tall Man's habit of turning into a big breasted blonde babe to seduce unsuspecting male victims (I'm not sure what to make of that!!!).",Phantasm
10,moonspinner55,"Threadbare horror opus, with a flimsy-cheap look that has been taken for a new-fangled style...",3,16 December 2015,"20-year-old Don Coscarelli wrote and directed this low-budget, school kid's idea of a scary story: young boy must convince his older brother that the neighborhood funeral parlor is actually a house of horrors, presided over by the Tall Man and guarded by a flying silver sphere. At one point, the sphere boars its way into a man's skull, and the audience gets a dirty laugh as blood shoots out the other end and the victim urinates on the floor. There's no other relief in ""Phantasm"", as much of the acting is amateurish and the rest of the special effects are variable. Coscarelli is actually given more credit from horror fans than he deserves; nine years later he was still doing the same thing, albeit with a bigger budget. *1/2 from ****",Phantasm
11,Quinoa1984,"clever, out-of-the-box horror filmmaking with some quixotic, bloody, harrowing elements",8,15 April 2016,"Phantasm has a plot, and you can actually follow what the characters Mike and Jody, the brothers who go up against the ""Tall Man"" and his Jawa-esque minions, and their ice-cream buddy Reggie are going through. At the same time it's also an incredibly strange and surreal experience just due to what is not necessarily explained, objects like the metallic ball that flies through the air and can basically gush out blood from a man's head once attached between the eyes, or just what those little dwarfs are (we soon find out, but it's not made totally clear how the original versions of the dwarfs are made except... horror movie magic it would seem). And there's other elements involving how the Tall Man does things and finds his way to confront characters and so on. And lest not forget the revelations in the final act.But the joy of this movie is that this is made by someone who is just a real fan of horror: Don Coscarelli, who was quite young when he made this movie (not unlike Sam Raimi with Evil Dead, which this feels like a spiritual cousin with in its ultra low-budget, gotta-be-creative-and-go-for-f***ing-broke cinematic grammar). I don't know what all of his influences are exactly (from IMDb trivia the title comes from Poe), and it feels drenched in the flavor of someone who isn't out to do something sleazy and only for the bucks, which was easy to do in the immediate post-Halloween time, but from Gothic horror literature and the more surreal visions of experimental filmmakers.Some of this may not make sense, and some of it may be rough around the edges (any woman here is basically not a good actor, and I'm not sure if it's due to the ultra-low-budget or that Coscarelli was better with Baldwin who plays the determined younger brother Mike), and yet psychologically, in the way it feels, it flows and is always cohesive. And some of it is pretty violent (I didn't know that it got rated X multiple times due to the aforementioned metal-ball-head scene), but it's all in the dark-morbid fun of a horror movie that's out to scare you and at the same time make this world of this Funeral Home-Cum-Temple that is drenched in inter-dimensional possibilities. Also like Raimi's early films, Coscarelli gets a buzz from showing things like severed fingers that turn into other objects and bleed colors that aren't blood.So not only is it terrifying (in certain spots, where certain effects haven't quite dated, which are only a few), it's an extremely funny movie - both extreme and funny in equal measure. You don't expect the laughs to come like they do, and it's not always from laughing at the excessive gore but genuinely creative dialog - it's also just downright amusing to see Jody and Reggie on the front porch playing guitar together, seemingly random but makes these guys immediately much tighter and recognizable as friends who've done this for years - and there's some honest to goodness stakes set up due to... well, what the hell this Tall Man can do to any people in the immediate vicinity!Featuring a star-making turn by Scrimm, music theme that gets repetitive but isn't too tiring, action that has some real spark and verve (I loved the chase scene at night, it's not complex but you feel the danger with all of the shotgun play), and when the filmmaker gets into hinting at the whole other world behind a particular door, all of the possibilities make it a much richer experience. This isn't the cynical sequel baiting we get today, as it works on its own as its own movie (even with a little of the 'huh' bit near the end with Mike), this is more like 'Wow, that was a lot of fun... is there another one going to be made?'",Phantasm
12,BandSAboutMovies,Bonkers and amazing and perfect,10,23 December 2018,"Directed, written, photographed, and edited by auteur Don Coscarelli, the original Phantasm makes much more sense if viewed less as a linear film and more as a collection of imagery, a ""complete movie"" to use the words of Fulci.However, if we were to look at the basics of the story, they'd concern the evil Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), an undertaker who comes from a red dimension where he transforms dead people into dwarf zombies and commands an army of flying metal spheres. He's obsessed with a young boy named Mike (Michael Baldwin), who is trying to convince his brother Jody (Bill Thornbury) and friend Reggie (Reggie Bannister) that their town is being taken over.Sure. It's kind of about that. It's also a surrealistic rumination on how teenagers see death and the worry that they won't be there for those they love. Or worse, that those they love won't be there for them.This is the kind of movie that has a villain who can also become a woman, the Lady in Lavender, who transforms back into the Tall Man at the moment the men orgasm. There's some strange commentary at play here, right? It also has fortune tellers who tell you that fear is the killer, characters dying and coming back and characters that lived actually dying and chopped off fingers filled with yellow blood being transformed into winged monsters that can only be stopped by garbage disposals. And it's also the kind of film that can completely stop the narrative for everyone to play ""Sitting Here at Midnight.""For all the narrative and psychological questions that Phantasm raises, I often wonder: exactly what kind of ice cream man wears a leather vest over his uniform?This initial offering also introduces a trope that will endure for the rest of the series: at the end, when it seems like everything is making sense,nothing does and the villains end up exploding out of a mirror or from hiding, dragging our heroes back into the void.I've watched Phantasm at least once a year since my first viewing and each time I watch it, I am struck by its strange power. Unlike so many of today's independent movies, it looks and feels like a big budget film, except it's been beamed to Earth from another dimension.",Phantasm
13,Coventry,Bizarre horror highlight,7,14 June 2004,"Phantasm and its sequels is a popular horror-series, but not as big as the obvious franchises such as Nightmare on Elm street, Halloween or Friday the 13th. And that's a good thing because you can't really compare this ingenious muddle with mainstream slashers. Phantasm is a complete one-man Don Coscarelli project with a good share of morbidity, humor and extravaganceall brought together in one major cool looking packing. The plot simply has to be to be believed. The Tall Man (terrific charismatic performance by Agnus Schrimm) is some sort of nightmarish grave robber. Immensely strong and ghoulish as he turns corpses into ugly little dwarfs, before shipping them out as intergalactic slaves! How does this rate on your originality scale?!? Phantasm contains other (already legendary) elements such as the deadly flying spheres that plant themselves into the victim's forehead and then perpetrates the brain. A pretty violent thing to see, but even more appealing when you're a horror fan. Regretfully, Phantasm also suffers from a few overwhelming negative aspects. Like the uninteresting main characters of the boy and his older brother. The stress isn't laid on The Tall Man in this first episode yet, and the ultra-cool Reggie (an ice-cream vending guitar player with a ponytail) hasn't got that much screen time, neither. The finale is a big letdown and a bit too confusing for a late 70's horror film. So far, 4 sequels have been produced. The first one (released in 1988) is a highly recommended film with an overload of macabre splattering and black humor. At times, this first sequel was even funnier to look at than the original. All the other sequels can easily be skipped.",Phantasm

16,Hey_Sweden,You play a good game. But now you die!,7,26 December 2016,"Mike (A. Michael Baldwin) and his older brother Jody (Bill Thornbury) are mourning the death of their parents in a small Oregon town. Together with their friend Reggie (Reggie Bannister), an ice cream man, they must do battle with a nefarious undertaker known only as The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) and his various minions...not to mention a neat flying sphere that can puncture skulls.Writer / director / cinematographer / editor Don Coscarelli truly hit paydirt with this enduring fan favorite, a horror / fantasy classic that spawned a franchise spanning over three and a half decades. A great film it is not, but it sure is a fun and entertaining one. Admittedly, the acting is mostly amateurish and our heroes less interesting than our villain. But Coscarelli clearly enjoys himself playing with as much ""it's all supposed to take on the tones of a nightmare"" shtick as he can. He never does worry about any of this making sense.Baldwin, Thornbury, and Bannister are at least likable as our heroes, especially Bannister, whose character turned into more of a badass as the series went on. Kathy Lester is alluring as a mysterious ""lady in lavender"". But ""Phantasm"" ultimately belongs to the imposing Scrimm, whose appearance is very memorable. ""BOOOYYY!!!""The film also benefits from a music score by Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave that is pretty catchy, in particular its haunting, somewhat ""Halloween""-esque main theme.The main set piece involves the sphere mutilating a caretakers' face; Coscarelli fought the MPAA to keep this sequence in the film and actually succeeded.Worth watching, at least once, by devotees of the horror genre.Seven out of 10.",Phantasm

Bodies are disappearing from coffins; a lady in lavender has sex with men in the graveyard and then stabs them to death; little midgets in brown cloaks (making sounds like lions) are roaming about and there's a flying silver orb with spikes that embeds itself in people's heads! And then there's the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) overseeing it all...Soon Mike, Jody and their friend Reggie (Reggie Bannister) are fighting for their lives...The story is pretty thin (and REALLY out of whack at the end), the acting dismal, there's no characterizations or depth and some of the special effects are horrible but...this is STILL a classic horror film. It takes a while to get going (nothing much happens in the first half hour), but when it does there's scarcely a letup. Action leaps into high gear, there's some fairly graphic gore (including the now infamous flying sphere killing), there are plenty of scenes guaranteed to make you jump and the music score is very spooky...right up there with ""Halloween"". Also some of the special effects are impressive (considering there was no budget). Also Bill Thornbury is a VERY attractive man and there's gratuitous male and female nudity. What's even more surprising is Don Coscarelli wrote, produced, directed AND edited this at the age of 24! He's never matched it since and all the sequels really suck...but this stands alone as a classic. A must-see for all horror fans. Also Scrimm is EXCELLENT (and damn scary) as the Tall Man.Trivia: This was awarded an X rating FOUR TIMES because of the sphere killing...Coscarelli went all the way to the head of the ratings board who overturned it and gave it an R--a rare occurrence that the ratings board kept in a gore scene!",Phantasm
18,Boba_Fett1138,Such a mess to watch.,5,5 April 2011,"Can't really understand why this movie is being such a popular and much appreciated one. I couldn't even understand what was all going on in this movie or what the point of it all was.This movie really comes across as a random one. Things happen in this movie but I had difficulties understanding why and what the purpose of it all was. Still really don't know what the 'villain's' motivation was and the movie really should had put some more effort into its story. The movie just explains far too little, which does not add up to the movie its mystery but to its messy and annoying aspects instead. The story just comes across as so very messy, in which random stuff happens and also characters seem to pop up randomly. The movie reaches a point pretty early on, to which I simply stopped caring about anything that was happening in this movie.It was a really cheaply made movie, so that might explain for some part as to why the movie feels incoherent. But I can't really say that I think this movie would had been a better one with a multi-million dollar budget. The entire idea behind the movie its concept is just far too weak for that.I really love the horror genre and can often appreciate a good cheap and old looking movie but I just couldn't really find any enjoyable or redeeming aspects about this movie.

An illusory mental image(American Heritage Dictionary)My copy is quite old but I figured I'd use this post as an educational opportunity. It may give some insight to the meaning of the movie. Then again, it may not.The movie takes place In this sparsely populated town where it seems only this boy, his brother, and his brother's friend exist. The young boy Mike (A. Michael Baldwin) saw something strange at the cemetery and the cemetery becomes a rendezvous point from then on. It's used for sex and sleuthing mostly and yes that's weird.This clearly low-budget movie failed to move the meter for me. Somehow, they took a very nebulous and obscure premise and made it into a movie with sequels. Besides the movie seeming rushed there were no explanations for anything. Maybe the entire movie was a phantasm?",Phantasm

How's that for a plot summary? And watching the film is about as weird as reading what it's about. It's a shame the movie isn't more competent in the directing and acting departments, because the raw material of a really good dark comedy is there. But the movie feels shoddy and slap dash, and it's never really scary, though it's occasionally a little creepy.A twist ending does manage to leave an impression even if it's a little cliché (though maybe back in 1979 it hadn't yet been used to death), while a twist to the twist ending leaves the audience with a final shock but doesn't make a whole lot of sense in the context of the movie.Grade: C+",Phantasm

Because of this traumatic event he is terribly afraid to lose his other brother named ""Jody"" (Bill Thornbury). As a result he begins to follow his older brother wherever he goes and that includes the funeral home where a friend of theirs was recently buried. In the process of spying on Jody he sees a strange looking man picking up the extremely heavy coffin and putting it inside a hearse all by himself. Following up on this he then discovers all kinds of weird things and eventually relates these events to his brother and a close friend named ""Reggie"" (Reggie Bannister). Without realizing the implications these three people decide to find out what is going on once and for all. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this picture has a reputation for being a great horror film. However, after just watching it for the very first time I must say that I was more than a bit disappointed. For starters, I didn't think the horror was nearly as dramatic as I had hoped. Along with that I thought several of the scenes lacked the necessary development required for the overall plot. Some scenes just didn't make sense. In any case, having now watched this movie I must say that I was not at all impressed and have rated it accordingly. Below average.",Phantasm

Most of this is due to the film's singular best decisions of centering on one of the most original, engaging and thrilling villains ever. The Tall Man here is a creepy, unique and wholly intimidating figure with a fascinating mythology about his true origins while is the build-up about the otherworldly beings under his instructions being a pretty good addition to the mystery utterly interesting and fascinating as well. Coupled together with his behavior that makes some of the most banal scenes somewhat chilling and creepy, like the casket-removal after the funeral or the manner in which he appears around town being quite shadowy which is really well-explored here and it all manages to make for some rather interesting and enjoyable scenes. As well, this one has some truly enjoyable action scenes that are quite unexpected here as it manages to mix together horror and action in a nice manner as the minions try to overcome the group in several extended scenes. Most of the chasing scenes in the second-half come from this tactic, including everything from car chases filled with gun-battles and high-speed crashes to several assaults on their secret hideout in the mausoleum and encountering the creatures. Of course, the most famous aspect of this one is the fatal Flying Silver Spheres, as nasty a weapon ever devised for cinema and providing enough awe and terror, as well as bloodshed, to make this a winning entry just by themselves. Aside from the action, the dream-like nature of it all when it plays out is just captivating and really makes these scenes all the more thrilling, as it seems to play like the events are in a dream-reality due to the freaky occurrences of what's going on, yet the fact that they're not by being rooted in reality is just really fun and enjoyable which tends to make them all the better by forcing along plenty of stellar jump- scenes. Alongside one of the finest endings to a film and some solid gore, there's a ton of elements to really like here as this one has only a few minor, barely noticeable flaws. The biggest problem with the film is that most of the scenes are at night, resulting in very dark images that ruin key parts of the film where the print was so bad that several scenes were never visible. Making it dark for suspense is one thing, but to do it in scenes that should be lit is a big gripe. While some will find this one a little tedious because of the low body-count, overall this is an unquestionable classic that deserves to viewed by every horror fan around.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, Nudity, and a sex scene.",Phantasm

It doesn't make sense much of the time, but the atmosphere and music and actors are actually making the film delightfully creepy. Also the creative freedom of the time was awesome: kids driving, shooting guns and drinking (without them being socially uncouth), gratuitous boob scenes, psychic old women that make things appear and disappear and that have no connection whatsoever with the plot but rip off from Dune, yellow blood, parallel dimensions... They knew how to mix it up back then.Bottom line: not much of a horror based on the scariness factor, but a fun film with low production values. It is the first of four films which I intend to see.

32,thesar-2,For Phans Only,2,17 February 2011,"Granted, I was only phive when Phantasm was releasedbut it equally took me phive times to finally see this mess of a movie.I've heard so much about this, and even saw Phantasm II first, when it was released 9 years later. (They like to say 10, but who's counting.) But every time I tried to watch the original, the opening not only failed to grab me, it literally bored me. Weirded me out. And it was probably only partially due to it being sooo dated.So, quite frankly, I'm not joking when I say it did take me phive, er, five times to finally force myself through this. I'm not happy I did.Some might consider this a ""classic"" or ""true horror"" and I say phooey! Wow. That one actually worked.Despite the few advantages the film had, such as creating a menacing funeral director and his stress ball or the fairly effective score, the low-budget movie was just all over the place. It was as if they invented it as they filmed it. I could hear them say: ""Let's throw in goblins!"" and ""Oh, that's coolbutwhat about a killer flying-sphere?"" (Though you'll have to wait for part III to learn more about the ball, their initial explanation, at least to themselves, probably went: ""Oh, if we haven't lost the audience by now, they'll simply be amazed at the FX! Look, it's killing, drilling, draining and no strings! Awesome, dude!"")After a funeral of a family member, the younger brother, Mike (Baldwin) observes a tall man, named appropriately, The Tall Man (Scrimm) lift a casket he couldn't possibly. Oh, and then there's some little (Star Wars) Jawas scrambling about.Naturally – and that's where the realism ends – this disturbs Mike. Nevertheless, he still follows around big brother, Jody (Thornbury) in fear he'll leave him much like his parents, who died previously.I'm just gonna fast-forward here, because the movie really is a trip, as in drug-induced experience. Mike has to convince brother and Ice Cream Man Reggie (Bannister) – yeah, an ice cream man who's more interested in saving a young boy thannever mind – that something's up at the mortuary and he does. After a little investigating, the evil thugs, that comes in all shapes and spheres, attack at will, whenever, wherever.This should be labeled as the first live-action Mike in Wonderland movie because whoever made this was seriously tripping. And if one were to follow it coherently and agree it's a well made film, is equally using. Eh, to each his or his own, and I have no problem with horror flicks that make up their own sense of reality and rules, but when you consistently break them, make new ones, and fade in/out of the real worldI just find it uneven and sloppy writing.And don't get me started on the unanswered, incoherent and literal out-of-this-world revolution in the finale.

34,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Must've been a gopher in heat or something.,4,8 October 2021,"Ostensibly, its loose plotting and narrative inconsistencies are key contributors to its dreamlike feel. In reality, they're by-products of the fact that the flick was initially three hours in length before its director decided to ruthlessly excise about half of its scenes in order to get its runtime down to something reasonable. Therefore, the fact that it feels like a dream - which, essentially, is here used as a synonym for 'doesn't make sense' - is almost entirely accidental, even though it is arguable that its intention is to feel like a living nightmare. The only thing nightmarish about it, though, is how utterly boring it is. 'Phantasm (1979)' is a messy slog that doesn't really do anything with its premise, ultimately wasting most of its promisingly weird plot elements. There are a few good scenes, don't get me wrong. The one that stands out the most is a sequence in which a baddie is dispatched by a flying chrome ball. The piece is at its best when it gets straight-up wacky; it's sometimes funny just because of how strange it is. The thing is, though, this is often unintentional, causing you to laugh at the picture rather than with it. Even with its occasional comedic value, it's still difficult to get through. It's genuinely just rather dull, despite its outlandish elements (which really ought to be more engaging than they are). Some people consider this a classic; I'm definitely not one of them. 4/10.",Phantasm
35,bowmanblue,"Weird, twisted and very watchable",7,19 December 2014,"I do like films that are 'so bad they're good.' And recently I watched The House By the Cemetery (by the same writer/director Don Coscarelli) and I hated it. So perhaps I lowered my expectations with this one. Either way, I was pleasantly surprised.It started with a young boy. Now, this can be a problem, as kids in horror movies (especially ones from the seventies and eighties) are notoriously annoying. However, despite his old fashioned haircut, he was actually pretty watchable. The same could be said for his older brother, who he goes to for help when he starts watching a suspicious undertaker in a local funeral home.What transpires is the brothers and their friends investigating some pretty dark and nasty goings on. Yes, it's a bit dated, but fun nonetheless. Could you really pass up the opportunity to watch cloaked dwarfs, angry mutant flies with super-strength and, of course, that scene with the miniature Death Star (watch it, you'll know what I'm referring to).Rather than just being a straight slasher film, Phantasm actually tries to be a little different, not just with the plot, but also with the way it's put together. Some people have described it has having a similar feel to David Lynch's films. In some ways they're not wrong.All in all, if you're a horror buff, then you really should watch this. It may look a little dated, but it's different enough to be regarded as an important part of the horror genre.",Phantasm
36,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Very odd, but very cool.",8,19 June 2001,"As a successful director of kid's films, Don Coscarelli felt like moving into horror. But he was out of ideas so he shut himself in a mountain cabin for a few weeks and dreamt up Phantasm. God only knows what he was smoking or drinking in order to conjure up a story like this. I've been watching it for over six years, trying to get my head around it. But like the most complex of David Lynch films, there are still some parts of the puzzle that are too warped to fit.Mike and Jody Pearson are two brothers living in small town California. Their parents have recently died, leaving twenty-something Jody in charge of 13-year-old Mike. But Jody is restless and cannot stay cooped up in such a small town for long. Mike dreads that Jody will dump him with an aunt or uncle and disappear beyond the horizon.But that's the least of his worries for the moment. Jody's friend has mysteriously committed suicide and after his funeral Mike, hiding in the bushes, sees the undertaker, a sinister Tall Man, heave the coffin out of the ground all by himself and dump it back in the Hearse.Knowing something ain't quite right about all this, Mike investigates the funeral home and is attacked by hooded dwarfs, flying killer chrome spheres (inspired by one of Coscarelli's nightmares) and is chased by the Tall Man. He gets away but loses a shoe and hacks off some of the Tall Man's fingers for proof.It's not an ordinary finger, it oozes some kind of yellow puss (embalming fluid perhaps) and still pokes around on it's own. Convinced of supernatural interference, the brothers team up with their Ice Cream vendor pal Reggie to kick the Tall Man's head in. It ain't that easy I'm afraid and the film turns from weirdo horror into positively strange sci-fi as the trio discover more and more inexplicable activity going on at Morningside Cemetery.The film doesn't have many faults. But it is quite frustrating seeing the characters do no more than go to the cemetery and go home, then go to the cemetery and go home for, more or less, the entire running time. Don Coscarelli shot about 3 hours worth of footage and only ended up using half that. There are loads of fun scenes left out that, while not essential to the film's plot, could have kept things more balanced.The total 70s feel is a major plus though. Man, I wish I were a kid back then. The big hair, the flares, the cool cars, the loose women and the funky music are all part of this film. The hip 70s score is also incredibly funky and spooky at the same time. Once you start humming it there's no stop.It's also very different from the typical 70s horror formula. There are no masked killers, no women being chased through the woods and no slasher fodder characters. Mike, Jody and Reggie are bold and decisive and choose to fight instead of running and hiding. The setting of rural California is also a refreshing change from medieval castles, hick villages or haunted houses.Angus Scrimm, who plays the Tall Man, is no doubt the film's best asset. He hardly says a word but he OWNS every scene he's in. His physical presence and menace makes him a damn cool horror villain and he ought to be as iconic as Freddy or Jason.No matter what way you look at it, Phantasm never makes complete sense. You can turn it upside down, inside out and back-to-front and you might be able to work most of it out, but there will always be one thing that sticks out. Don Coscarelli claimed he wanted it to be open-ended and ambiguous as a way of not having to make any sequels. That tactic didn't work.",Phantasm

The film knows it's limits more or less,it also knows it's limited budget as well. The Tall Man himself is one of the more underrated Horror Villains of our time. He walks creepily,he's dressed in a creepy black tuxedo,along with a creepy menacing stare to boot. Despite the film's amateurish type acting,it succeeded in giving us some likable characters,there enthusiasm managed to overcome all of the weak acting,in my opinion. The film felt like more of a fantasy type dream,then a Horror film at times,I mean the ending itself,every time I watch it,manages to confuse me,was Jody really dead or not? was it all just a hallucinatory type dream?. For it's budget,it manages to have quite the impact on the viewer,especially some of the creepy cemetery scenes,they put in the film. I also love the flying little sphere they used. It's so odd,yet so very effective at the same time. Phantasm is a classic of the Horror Genre for sure. While I didn't find it to be as revolutionary as some have claimed,I still find it to be a very enjoyable film.Performances. A. Michael Baldwin is a geeky,yet likable kid. His acting could use some work,but I dug his enthusiasm and likability for the most part. Bill Thornbury is charismatic,that I can definitely say. His chemistry with Baldwin,was also on the money. Reggie Bannister is a bad actor,no doubt about that. His charisma is completely undeniable though,he's a Horror genre Icon. Angus Scrimm is just plain creepy. The way he walks,the way he talks,it's all so unique and terrifying. The Tall Man is one of the creepiest Horror Villains,that have ever walked.Bottom Line. Phantasm is all about creativity and surrealistic imagery. It works though for the most part,I suppose it's somewhat revolutionary for the Horror Genre. I don't consider it a classic,but I do enjoy it every time I watch it,and that's all that counts for me. Recommended in general,and a must for Horror fanatics.7/10",Phantasm

Well, suffice it to say that it was a great decade. Toward the end of the '70s, we saw some truly outstanding low budget masterpieces hit the big screen: there was HALLOWEEN (which had me checking behind doors when I got home, the night I saw it), DAWN OF THE DEAD (which I saw while suffering from pneumonia, and which literally made me hallucinate)... and PHANTASM. If there was one thing that made PHANTASM such a standout, it was the sheer imagination of the filmmaker. Like EQUINOX back in 1971, PHANTASM dealt (albeit much differently) with another dimension and the horrors therefrom. Despite its obvious low budget, PHANTASM was endlessly inventive- and no one who saw the ominous flying spheres would soon forget them. Along with HALLOWEEN and DAWN OF THE DEAD, PHANTASM helped make the late '70s a great time to be a fright film fan. There are movies that endure simply because they're great fun.

He discovers that an evil mortician (Scrimm) is a grave robber who enslaves dead people turning them into evil dwarfs and transports them to a mysterious netherworld. He also has deadly flying spheres to attack. Mike warns his other brother, Jody (Thornbury) and ice cream man pal, Reggie (Bannister) about what's going on and convinces them to help him stop him.

Before Jason Voorhes, before Freddy Kreuger, or even the Candyman, there's The Tall Man(Angus Scrimm), a hauntingly tower of terror who uses a the deadliest arsenals of all: The Flying Silver Spheres! The fun fact is the Plymouth HemiCuda is a rad car back then, and still is now. A young man meets this sinister man and sees how he handled the coffins. His older brother one time makes out with this mysterious blonde and he freak when he sees one of the Tall Man's minions running around the graveyard. Then there's the scene where he was is the coffin and he blows out the left rear tire from inside. If he shot the middle he would have been blown sky high. Fighting the Tall Man is challenging, knowing his weakness is even more challenging. Reggie(Reggie Banister) remembered that the Tall Man can't stand cold. He worked as a Ice Cream salesman, and he's also a warrior at heart. Great horror movie, I like it! 4 out of 5 stars!",Phantasm
45,hellraiser7,Resident Evil,10,12 October 2021,"This is another of my favorite movies of all time as well as one of my favorite horror movies of all time. This film really has a special place in my heart as it was another of the very first horror movies I've ever seen when I was an adolescent 12 or 13 to be exact.I remember seeing this film on the ""Sci-Fi"" channel when they had another weakly movie marathon in which its theme was called Phantoms or something and this film was playing on that week. I'll admit seeing the film the first time really scared the hell out of me but also at the same time amazed me as it's a film I've never seen before; and this film is another one of the films that not just helped me get my foot into the horror genre but inspired me in my writing.I really love the story it's very strange but interesting at the same time, it sort of Lovecraftian as like Lovecraft's stories deals with strange otherworldly creatures and elements. The film is a bit like an Italian horror film but made in America which is cool, just like those films they really on a steady build up to the discovery so it all comes together as a cohesive story but also to keep itself an enigmatic experience and this film is one heck of an enigma.The characters are solid, from the protagonists who are a trio and are actually slightly interesting and well-rounded characters. They all have sort of an almost wishfulment lifestyle as two of the brothers Jody and Michael are living by themselves with no parents around. They both get to own and drive a cool car which is a muscle car called ""The Barracuda"" which is awesome as that's one of my favorite cars. Drink beer, shoot guns, have the house to themselves just about anything you can think off.And of course, you have Reggie Banister whom to me is another of my favorite horror protagonists up their with Ash Williams, John Constantine, etc. He's just cool and funny in a down to earth sort of way. He is sort of like the older brother of the trio as he has certain responsibilities from his summer job in running an ice cream truck, looking in on both Jody and Mike every once in a while.But I like that he never lets things like that bog him down as he still does some cool things like the fact he played in a band and there is a slice of life moment which at same time gives us a hint on something latter in the film, but in this moment both Jody and Reggie are playing a song together. Of course he has a favorite line of mine, ""What the HELL is going on.?!"" Yeah good question Reg.I also love that the protagonists are ones that are capable of kicking ass. Most of the time most main protagonists in horror films they are at times untrained people that do put up a fight but mainly near the climax of the film when the opportunity presents itself.But these protagonists are different because they get to have that option of fighting back all the way from beginning to end which I like and makes the conflict between both the monsters and them a fair fight, and even helps in making the stakes all the more higher where it feels things can easily go either way depending on the outcome of the battles.I wouldn't say the action is the wall to wall kind, their more like action and reaction to sticky situations that are thrown at all of them. From a decent car chase and shootout against a hurse, I just really love that music in the chase which just sings fast intensity and immediate action; I remember being on the edge of my seat wondering how the hell Mike and Jody were going to get away let alone if they can blow the hurse away.Let alone the fact that all three are smart guys and not the stereotypical horror protagonists that make one stupid mistake after another that even a third grader couldn't make.One favorite scene that demonstrates this intelligence is this entrapment situation where Mike is locked in his room for his own good (sort of) and he's trying to find a way out. It's basically a ""Macgyver"" like moment as we see him take certain items and is just putting it all together; I know like in that show this probably wouldn't work in real life or not the way we think it would, but still fun to think it could.But of course, there is The Tall Man himself played well by the late great Angus Scrimm. He's one of my favorite horror icons but also fictional villains of all time. This guy is just really intimidating not just from his height but the fact he has super strength and possibly not all that easy to kill; he's a guy you really don't want to be in a fight with.That dry raspy voice that just gives me chills; man, it's really too bad Angus didn't get to voice Mum Ra in the 2011 ""Thundercats"" revival, that would have been so awesome. Anyway, despite not talking very much he has some of the most memorable lines, of course my favorite quote and no surprise ""BOY!"" it may 'be one word but I always get an icy chill when he says that because despite that line to the protagonist, it almost feels like he's saying to me. But from that one word you know he's gunning straight for you.He's got two tools in his arsenal for his evil campaign from those icky creepy mustard blooded zombie dwarves. But the most fearsome of all those flying silver spheres, those are another of my favorite fictional weapons. Those things are interesting as their robotic drones (at least I think they are I'm still not entirely sure) as those things constantly fly around for any victims that come within its sight. This of course leads to a scene that is one of my favorite kills ever, I won't say anything about it you just have to see it for yourself.However, what makes him scary is that he is one big walking enigma. We never know what his true motivation for what he's doing really is, let alone what he even is as he's obviously not human, all I can about that is that it's obviously not good.The music is awesome, this film has one of the best and most memorable horror movie tracks ever, most notably the theme song which is one of my favorite theme songs of all time. The music sort of reminds me of the kind you hear from the Italian horror films where it just creates this really ominous, mysterious, strange, atmosphere from beginning to end. You can never be sure of anything, and danger is always close behind and can hit anytime.It's one of those film can be to any one's interpretation and one that will leave you with more questions than answers because despite how much we discover there is so much more we wonder about. In a way the film is a bit of a coming-of-age tale and one of the things about it are dealing with loss, loss of your childhood, to loss of people in your lives.Mike and Jody are living alone because their both are dealing with the loss of their mom and dad. This in turn makes them have the coming-of-age blues with Jody on the verge of adulthood going his own way, while Michael is at that age of transcending from an adolescent to a teen, just one more step to adulthood.We do see with Mike has some abandonment issues as he is you can say Stalking his brother, yeah, I know an ugly word and overused term but that's sort of what he's doing. But not because he's a creep but simply the thought that his brother will leave at any time. I think this makes Mike sympathetic and slightly relatable as we've all had that fear sometimes in our subconscious on our friends and family going their separate ways away from us; it's not the happiest thought but it's a fact of life despite their ties their individuals with wants and desires of their own that don't include the other.In a strange way the whole film could be a dream as most of what is going on doesn't feel totally real. The whole scary adventure could just be an imaginative device by Mike to keep his brother Jody from leaving and for both to continue being a family together. But like I said this film is up to your own interpretation, so I'll leave it all up to you.Beware for evil can sometimes live in the most unlikely places and is never far away from reality or your dreams.Rating: 4 stars.",Phantasm
46,Captain_Couth,Classic Horror: Phantasm!,9,23 October 2004,"Phantasm (1979) was one of the classic horror films that came out during the genre's rebirth during the late 80's. Fueled by the success of Halloween, Don Coscerelli created his own low budget horror with similar results. A nearby cemetery has some strange happenings going on. A young kid (A. Michael Baldwin) witnesses some creepy stuff and a mysterious figure he dubs ""The Tall Man"" walking around the yards. After a few scares and having to convince thoses around him about what he's just witnesses, his brother and an ice cream man buddy Reggie (Reggie Bannister) finally become aware of the new evil that has entered their neighborhood. Future trips to the cemetery brings them closer to horror that none of them could have ever realize.Produced on a shoe string budget, Don Coscerelli made one of the most frightening and influential horror films ever made. Nobody knew how successful this movie would have been. It was such a hit that they made three more films. but the movie was plagued by problems with the M.P.A.A. and many of the gory scenes had to be toned down and re-shot. Still, this movie is very effective and one of my favorites. If you love smart and intelligent horror films, look no further.A",Phantasm

Just expect loads of questions and not many answers. Michael and Jody have recently lost their parents. Jody is thinking of heading out of town for good, but Michael's been a bit clingy to say the least. After their friend Tommy commits suicide (that's what they think, as we see Tommy being murdered at the start of the film), things start to turn weird. Michael sees the undertaker lift a coffin all by himself, there seems to be cloaked midgets running around everywhere, and Jody has a narrow escape from the mysterious woman who killed Tommy. Michael sets out for the funeral home to get to the bottom of what's happening, and that's when things truly get strange. He gets attacked by a flying sphere that sprouts blades and drills its way into the brain of one of the bad guys, but can he convince Jody of what's happening? Perhaps that still moving finger he chopped off the undertaker might do the trick Phantasm is an extremely atmospheric film that doesn't skimp on the gore, and has an amped up weirdness factor that'll have you scratching your head by the end. What really helps the film is the main characters. The bond between Michael, Jody, and friend Reggie really stands out and makes you care for them as they are driven into an increasingly strange world (literally, at one point) in a film that's part horror and part sci-fi. Folks that like everything to be wrapped up nicely at the end are going to be let down, but for people looking for stand out horror from the seventies, this is quite a unique and inspired film.",Phantasm

When I recently re-watched it, I was somewhat surprised (and disappointed) by how brief these scenes actually are. I'd also forgotten how generally silly (the finger-fly-thing being a good example) and incoherent (try to explain the plot to the uninitiated) the film was. That said, it's still a classic (cult?, camp?) horror film from the golden-age of dead fornicating-teenagers.

49,jadavix,"Too confusing, dull first act, cool effects",5,14 October 2018,"I suppose when you take the budget into consideration you can't help but be impressed by ""Phantasm"". It manages some impressive effects and shots. The problem is, unfortunately, not really related to budget: the screenplay doesn't work. The movie makes you wait over half an hour to get to the cool stuff. That first act is unnecessarily confusing garbage. When we get to the cool effects, the movie still doesn't really make sense, but at least it's a little more interesting.The plot is something to do with a kid who witnesses an undertaker steal a body from a graveyard. He follows the man home to a spooky mansion where he gets attacked by little hooded figures. Back at the graveyard's mausoleum, the undertaker, Angus Scrimm, attacks people with what is basically the movie's main claim to fame, a flying metal ball that drills into a person's head.Some other stuff happens, like car chases, and a long awaited entry into another world that is only glimpsed in one impressive shot.This movie just doesn't make sense. I wonder if that came as a result of working around the budgetary constraints, but I find that hard to imagine, especially since none of the other movies in the series make much sense either. I think they were just carried away by enthusiasm for the cool effects they were going to pull off that they decided they didn't really need a plot to hold it all together.Considering the movie went on to cult classic status, I guess they were right about that.",Phantasm

55,kirbylee70-599-526179,Revitalized for a New Generation,9,14 December 2016,"""This review is of the newly released remastered version on DVD/blu-ray"" Horror fans are the most dedicated fans you will find. The only group that comes close are those who love the tear jerking romantic films like THE NOTEBOOK, movies that will be watched again and again. But horror fans will not only watch a movie multiple times, they will buy every edition that comes out, will watch every extra in detail and will watch the film with every commentary track included. That's how dedicated they are.So when it was announced that the 1979 horror classic PHANTASM was being restored this year in a 4k version supervised by J.J. Abrams, the director of the first two movies in the new STAR TREK movies, SUPER 8 and the recent STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS, fans were thrilled to know the movie was in good hands. It turns out that Abrams was a fan of the film as well and contacted director Don Coscarelli to help with the restoration. Not only have they cleaned up the look they've polished up the soundtrack as well.If you're not aware of the film it's an interesting tale. Mike (A. Michael Baldwin) is a pre-teen troubled after the death by accident of his parents. When his older brother Jody (Bill Thornbury) helps with the funeral of his friend Tommy, Mike sneaks about the cemetery watching the funeral. Rather than the normal situation he watches as the funeral director known only as the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) returns to the gravesite after everyone has gone and single handedly lifts the coffin into his hearse to take back to the funeral home.This is just the first encounter Mike has while dealing with the deaths around him, Jody possibly leaving town and leaving Mike with his aunt. With each encounter with the Tall Man Mike finds himself drawn into something bigger than a few deaths or the mysterious behavior of the man. In the funeral home he wanders the halls of the mausoleum and is nearly caught by a groundskeeper. But as he is grabbed a flying silver sphere suddenly comes down the hall with three protruding blades in it, sticking into the groundskeeper's forehead and draining him of blood.Mike tries to tell his brother about what is happening and eventually convinces him he's not seeing things. With the aid of Jody's best friend Reggie (Reggie Bannister), the three determine to enter the mausoleum and discover just what the Tall Man is up to. Shrunken humans, odd shaped people, a portal to places unknown and more flying spheres help to make this film a combination of science fiction and horror with a little heavier lean on horror. The story might sound simple but the visual storytelling of Coscarelli makes it all work and holds your interest from start to finish.The movie did decent at the box office but nothing spectacular. Even though it was considered a low budget film the look, style and feel of the film make it seem all the more impressive. While it does have that low budget drive-in atmosphere about it the movie offers more than most films made for those locations ever offered. This could be the reason that the film has drawn such a dedicated fan base.It had enough fans that the film spawned 3 other sequels over the years. Oddly enough most were never completed under the same studio banner making their release in a box set nearly impossible (and yet it happened). Each sequel left an open ending with more story to tell. That has resulted in what has been called the final installment, PHANTASM: RAVAGER, which also comes out this week.Fans of the film will be ecstatic over the look of this restoration. I've never seen the film look better than this and I've seen it a number of times, from my first viewing at the local drive-in to VHS to DVD. The images here are sharper than ever before, the darks are actually dark rather than the milky look they've had in some incarnation and the clean up on some of the effects make them better than they've ever appeared. Abrams and his crew deserve recognition for the wonderful job they've done here.If you love the film you'll want this edition in your collection. It also includes some notable extras including an episode of GRAVEYARD CARS where they recreate the classic car from the film, interviews from 1979 with Coscarelli and Scrimm, deleted scenes and a commentary track with Coscarelli, Baldwin, Scrimm and Thornbury. And if you've never seen the film before now is your chance to do so with the best edition you will more than likely ever find. With Christmas around the corner this is the perfect gift for any horror fan. Just look for PHANTASM: REMASTERED.Speaking of horror fans those who can't get enough of trailer compilations, those previews shown before movies, will want to get their orders in for TRAILER TRAUMA 3: '80s HORROR-THON from Garagehouse Pictures. With over 250 trailers and running over 7.5 hours, this trailer compilation will most likely be one of the best ever offered.

56,drownnnsoda,"Imaginative, Bizarre, And Thoroughly Entertaining.",10,15 July 2006,"""Phantasm"" is about a young teenager, Mike, who just recently lost his parents. He is worried about losing his older brother, so he follows him everywhere, including a funeral. While hiding in the bushes during the funeral, Mike sees ""The Tall Man"" (played by the creepy Angus Scrimm), the man who runs the funeral home, pick up a casket by himself. Mike begins spying on the man afterwards, fascinated with uncovering the strange events surrounding the funeral home. While investigating, Mike discovers a strange world within the walls of the mortuary, including flying metal spheres with sharp arrows that drain the blood from your head, and many other horrors. Turns out, the Tall Man is from another dimension, and is taking the bodies of the dead and reincarnating them in his world for slaves. Mike teams up with his older brother and the local ice cream man, Reggie, to stop the Tall Man's gruesome work.I remember my mother telling me about how much ""Phantasm"" scared her when she was a teenager, and she rented it one day and I watched it along with her (I was about nine or ten at the time), and it was genuinely one of the most bizarre movies I've ever viewed. Written (as well as directed) by Don Coscarelli, ""Phantasm"" has become something of a horror classic over the years, and deservedly so. Coscarelli's writing here is so unique that it hurts. Everything in this film is surreal and dreamlike, and the entire plot line is so out there that I can't think of another film that can quite compete in terms of strangeness. But, despite it's strangeness, this movie works, in it's own, weird little way. The script is solid and the characters are believable (there are some real-life situations thrown in as well, so there is some sort of viewer-character connections that can be made), even though about ninety-nine percent of this film is something of pure fantasy. But it's quite a scary fantasy, and that's for sure.There are many elements in this film that have become somewhat legendary, among them being the murderous silver spheres and The Tall Man's ""Boyyyyy!"" line. The thing is, among all of the randomness that is ""Phantasm"", this is quite a terrifying movie. A dense feeling of helplessness and foreboding is hiding in every scene, and the cinematography and locations add to this quite a bit. The imagery is bizarre and often very spooky, and the settings are perfect (especially that creepy old funeral home). The viewers themselves are easily caught up in the engrossing story, and the atmosphere is very scary. Michael Baldwin plays our lead hero well, with Reggie Bannister as the ice cream man, and Bill Thornbury as Mike's older brother, Jody. And Angus Scrimm plays his signature role as The Tall Man, and his presence alone makes this film scarier than most of it's genre. And then there's the score to the film, which is equally as effective and just as chilling. The film concludes leaving many questions open-ended and unanswered, but honestly - can you really expect genuine, fulfilling answers when the movie itself is so strange? I think it's good that this film does leave some loose ends, because it goes along with the movie's overall feel.Bottom line - I don't think this movie is for everyone, and it might be just a little bit too weird for some. Honestly, one of the strangest, most out-there films I have ever seen, but in my opinion, that's a good thing. The story is strange but well crafted, and the bizarre imagery and atmosphere make this a painfully unique, scary experience. I can see why ""Phantasm"" has become such a classic of the genre. For me, this film remains a nice little piece of spooky and original nostalgia, and I'm glad my mom decided to scare the daylights out of me with it at such a young age, because I grew to love this movie later on. 10/10.",Phantasm
57,kluseba,A creepy trip down memory lane,9,11 October 2018,"Phantasm is a cult horror movie every genre fan should be familiar with. Despite its excellent reputation, this movie and franchise are still somewhat underestimated if compared to the Halloween franchise for example. If compared to other horror movies of yore, Phantasm has aged surprisingly well and still sends shivers down your spine nearly four decades after its initial release.One key element for the film's success is its twisted, mysterious and creative story that isn't always easy to follow because it isn't obvious what's dream, imagination and reality. The movie revolves around mysterious events happening around Morningside Cemetery in an American small town. After the mysterious death of a young man and the awkward behaviour of the grim undertaker known as the Tall Man, curious teenager Mike and his older brother Jody who have recently lost their parents in a tragic accident start investigating the strange morgue. They soon realize that they are opposed to villains with malevolent intentions and supernatural abilities and must risk their lives in order to save their town.Another element that makes Phantasm stand out is that the low budget production relies on amateur actors and actresses who really behave like boys and girls next door without any pretense. Some of the dialogues might lack wit but one can easily identify with the grounded characters and root for them. It's obvious that everyone involved in this project poured their hearts and souls into this film.The movie comes along with a creepy, ominous and psychedelic atmosphere that goes beyond some efficient jump scares. The mysterious antagonist is particularly memorable and quite scary because his true intentions remain mysterious. Angus Scrimm's acting performance is intense and inspired by iconic early American horror actors such as Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Vincent Price. The creepy settings including the dark cemetery and the mysterious morgue look very intriguing. The otherworldly sequence in the final third drifts into the realm of science-fiction and adds yet another twist to the tale. The few special effects might look slightly dated today but look surprisingly well for such a low budget production. The scenes with the mysterious finger are still very efficient by today's standards. These effects aren't overused but rather employed with care in small but efficient doses. The ominous soundtrack blends in perfectly and is one of the best horror movie scores ever written.With a length of one and a half hours, Phantasm doesn't overstay its welcome and is entertaining from start to finish. If you care for horror cinema with a mysterious touch, Phantasm is a must-see as it represents one of the very best examples of this genre. The remastered edition looks sharp but hasn't lost the amateurish charm of the original film. Enjoy this creepy trip down memory lane and give this movie the credit it deserves. I prefer this movie over the popular Friday the 13th, Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street franchises anytime.",Phantasm

Micheal Baldwin,, Angus Scrimm, and a host of others, that really make this movie great,, but i guess what really sells this movie is the premise,, pretty much unique to itself, that the guy in charge of the mortuary is stealing bodies,, souls,, and shrinking them,, into dwarfs,, and using them as slaves for the netherworld,,The tall man only has 5 lines in the movie,, 28 words all together,, but he is definitely a man to be reckoned with,, this man will scare the heck out of you time and time again,, this is really just a great horror movie,, with a lot of twists and turns,, and great camera work two i might add, steady cam was just starting out ,, specially on this flick, so yeah it's a little on the raw side,, buy hey it's new for the time period... this movie is a classic ,, and should not be missed.",Phantasm
60,fertilecelluloid,"Dreamy, surreal horror gem",7,15 February 2006,"""Phantasm"", known as ""The Never Dead"" in some markets (to avoid association with Richard Franklin's softcore ""Fantasm"" and ""Fantasm Comes Again"") is a creepy, dreamy, surreal horror gem. A young boy (Michael Baldwin) experiences nightmares after his parents are killed in an auto crash. He turns to his brother Jody (Bill Thornbury) for comfort, but no man can halt the visions Michael has of being stalked by The Tall Man, an evil, intimidating undertaker (Angus Scrimm). The vague plot involves Michael's investigation into the theft of corpses from a mausoleum, but it is really an excuse to show scary, erotic and bloody set pieces. The score by Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave is one of the best horror scores ever and the sound design is mighty impressive. Director Coscarelli demonstrates a flair for surreal imagery, but his dramatic, non-horror scenes are flat. Awful sequels followed.",Phantasm
61,dworldeater,"Great horror classic, one of the best!",10,23 January 2018,"Phantasm is one of my favorite horror movies that holds up really well as the years pass by. Don Coscarelli 's masterpiece of horror is very original and a nightmare vision of existential weirdness. Angus Scrimm gives an intense and brooding performance as menacing horror icon The Tall Man. The Tall Man is mortician at the Morningside Funeral Home which our kid Michael as well as his brother Jody and pal Reggie discover some nefarious activities of The Tall Man where he reanimates the dead for his own evil purposes which do not always take place on our plane of existence. Phantasm is a very cerebral horror film, but also delivers on gore, atmosphere and cool characters. The series of films is essential viewing for horror fans and the films get weirder and more sci fi as they go. In my opinion, the first and second film are remarkable and by in large the best. The score is incredible and iconic and in my view Phantasm is untouchable as well as one of the finest horror movies of all time.",Phantasm
62,Witchfinder-General-666,Creepy And Bizarre Cult Horror,8,20 December 2007,"Don Coscarelli's ""Phantasm"" of 1979 is a creepy, bizarre and very original cult flick, that no lover of the Horror genre can afford to miss. Then only 25-year-old writer/director Coscarelli created a very imaginative film that delivers genuine creepiness and suspense, morbid humor, a very cool score and many new ideas. ""Phantasm"" has so far been followed by 3 sequels, a fourth sequel is announced for 2008. The sequels differ in quality (""Phantasm II"" is immensely entertaining while the others are quite poor) but none of them comes near the original in atmosphere, suspense and greatness.I don't want to give too much of the plot away, but I assure that those who haven't seen ""Phantasm"" yet can prepare for one of the creepiest villains ever, the 'Tall Man', brilliantly played by Angus Scrimm. This extremely scary Tall Man, a mysterious supernatural corpse snatcher, alone would be reason enough to see this movie, but ""Phantasm"" has so much more to offer. The film is full of highly bizarre creatures, constantly suspenseful and often delivers a downright nightmarish atmosphere. Apart from Angus Scrimm, who, as I mentioned above, delivers a brilliant performance in the role of the Tall Man, Reggie Bannister is also great as the pony-tailed Reggie. A. Michael Baldwin is also good in the lead, the other performances aren't bad, but not particularly worth mentioning either. The film is also quite violent and gory, the main theme is a highly memorable and great piece of Horror movie score and the suspense is constant. The film also has a few minor flaws, but these are by far overwhelmed by the film's qualities. All said, ""Phantasm"" is a creepy and bizarre film that deserves its cult-status, and a must-see for any lover of Horror. 8/10",Phantasm
63,ferbs54,Fun But Ultimately Disappointing,6,11 October 2007,"Don Coscarelli's third film, ""Phantasm"" (1979), is a fairly freaky, often startling but ultimately disappointing horror outing that has managed to accrue quite a cult following over the years. It tells the story of the Pearson brothers, Jody and Michael, and the very strange goings-on at their local Victorian-style mausoleum, presided over by a character only referred to as The Tall Man. As personified by Angus Scrimm (great name, that!), The Tall Man makes for one memorable character indeed, despite his speaking (as Scrimm reveals in one of this DVD's many extras) only five lines of dialogue, totalling 28 words. Coscarelli throws a lot into his film to keep the viewer surprised and unsettled. Thus, the mysterious cowled dwarfs, a dismembered finger turning into a monstrous flying insect, the homicidal Lady in Lavender, a gateway to another dimension (?), and, of course, the flying metal orbs that suck the blood out of their victims' skulls. The movie is a nonstop roller coaster of sorts, with likable characters, an effectively creepy score and adequate FX. It could have been a minor masterpiece of the horror genre. Sadly, however, not a single one of the bizarre happenings is ever solidly explained, and by the film's head scratcher of a finale, I was left thinking, ""What the hell was THAT about?"" Is The Tall Man an alien or an immortal or a dead person? Is that Red Land another planet or another dimension or what? Was the entire movie a dream? Either Coscarelli couldn't be bothered to supply us with answers or he decided to leave those answers for this film's three belated sequels. But after this letdown of a movie, I'm not overly motivated to check out ""Phantasm II"" to find out....",Phantasm
64,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Great Cult Film,9,20 April 2019,"This was a film that it actually took me awhile to finally see. I remember when the third film in the series came out and I watched it, not having any idea about the previous two. While in college I finally got the chance to see this original film and then again when it came to my local theater on 4K. The official synopsis is a teenage boy and his friends face off against a mysterious grave robber known only as the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), who keeps a lethal arsenal of terrible weapons with him.We kick off with a man and a woman having sex in a graveyard. He is Tommy (Bill Cone) and the woman is Kathy Lester. There's something not quite right about her and she kills him.At the funeral, a couple of guys meet up. One of them is Jody (Bill Thornbury) and the other is Reggie (Reggie Bannister). We learn that Jody's parents had passed away a couple of years ago and funerals creep him out. He goes inside to pay his respects to his parents before the funeral actually begins. His younger brother, Mike (A. Michael Baldwin) was not brought along because the funeral for his parents really tore him up and gave him nightmares. Mike does show up and spies from the bushes.Mike sees the Tall Man lift the heavy casket and body out of the grave by himself. He also hears and sees something small scurrying around him. He does what he can to convince his brother of what he is seeing, but he doesn't believe. Jody is worrying that Mike is going to revert back to how he was right after their parents passed away. That is until Mike goes up to the funeral parlor and brings back real evidence to prove there is something not quite right going on.This film is actually quite intriguing. I tried to go as vague as I could, because I don't really want to spoil anything for it. I do feel that this is a film that you really need to experience regardless though. As I said earlier, I had seen the third film before ever seeing this one and it still doesn't ruin the film. Something though about this one is that it really was made as a stand alone film. It did leave itself open for a sequel, which at this time we know it is now a series that it could be.I will admit that this is a film that deserved sequels. An issue I have with this film is that writer/director Don Coscarelli never really explains what is going on. I can usually be a fan of that in some cases. This one though I do think that a little bit more is needed and a lot of that comes from the fact that he sucked me into the story. The Tall Man and his small minions are so creepy and interesting that I really want to know more about them. We get a glimpse of what could be going on in this film and that just makes me want to know more.Going from here, I do have to say that the feel of this film is amazing. It has such a nightmare quality to it. What makes this interesting is that this film was done on a microbudget. Coscarelli had to ask a lot of people to help fund this and it took quite awhile to complete. I think some things were probably too difficult to film so it helps enhance that nightmare feel and I dug it. It also does create some convenience issues as well for the film. I do think a reveal near the end does hurt the film a bit as well.The feel is also helped by the editing. It has a tight running time of just less than 90 minutes and I think that is fitting. This is one that I would have liked maybe a little bit more as there are so many things that are left unexplored. I would say that the budget issues might have been why, but this series never really fully explains anything and a lot are left open for theories. It really isn't fair to hold what later films don't do, but since it isn't explained here it is relevant evidence. Something else is this film does well at showing us something early on and then harkening back to it as well. It gets a little bit too in the face, which I thought could be toned down, but I still like doing that.As for the acting, it is quite surprising that it is people that Coscarelli knew, but I think it actually works out fine. Baldwin is interesting that he never listens and he is quite inquisitive. He really drives the story and I thought his portrayal was fine. Thornbury I also thought was perfectly fine as well. The only issue I have with his character is he doesn't believe his brother, but then all of a sudden sees one thing and is onboard completely. The evidence doesn't necessarily prove anything, but it doesn't ruin the film. He is also telling his brother to stay home when he investigates, but I do think this gets a bit repetitive, especially when bad things happen when they split up. Bannister in this film is fine. He doesn't get much screen time, but I thought he was fun. Scrimm was great as the villain. He just has an angry, menacing look and the size to go along with it. The thought the rest of the cast did just fine as well.The effects for the film were also good. Things were done practically, which I really love to see. There's not much in the way of human blood. They did make the Tall Man have this bright yellowish color, which makes sense and I liked it. There's an evil fly that doesn't look great. That did make me laugh though. I will say that the silver spheres are introduced in this film and they are a staple of this franchise. I thought how they moved was quite impressive. The film was also shot very well and I had no issues there.Some thing I had to touch on during this review would the score. I would have to say that would be the strongest part of the film. It gives the film such a creepy feel and I love it. It builds tension and it actually helped to get my anxiety going. This would be a score I would come back to for sure when writing. The main theme is used a lot and its one of my favorites.Now with that said, this film is quite impressive for what Coscarelli had to work with. I thought the story was interesting and it had me wanting more. I do think that it does stay a little bit too vague for my liking. It does have a nightmarish feel to it, which is aided by the score of the film. That is my favorite aspect. The acting isn't great, but it definitely fits the film. It is edited pretty well and does move at a good pace. The effects for what they had to work with were also good. It is does have its flaws, but I still find this to be a good movie and worth a viewing for sure.",Phantasm
65,robertemerald,Effective and original horror,7,27 November 2019,"The soundtrack for Phantasm was progressive for its day, a sort of conservative Tubular Bells. It worked really well. And the effects for its day were brilliant too, though there wasn't many of them. It is a nail-biter, powered as much by two brothers and their individual bravery as by any outside evil trying to get in. As a story of two brothers it's sweet, and such a relief from movies where juvenile teenage humour is often the go. The cast of characters was really well chosen and I doubt the movie would have had much renown if that hadn't been the case. Yes, the Director needed to review several scenes for acting faults. Luckily that well-chosen cast had enough credibility for it not to be a problem. Phantasm is a truly original horror tale, with a sci-fi premise, and well worth a look.",Phantasm
66,Backlash007,"""Boy!!!!!!!!!!!!!""",10,11 October 2001,"This is one of the best films of the genre, but what genre do you put it in? Don Coscarelli has created a science-fiction, horror, and fantasy epic all wrapped up in a bizarre package. Phantasm is a surreal tale of a young boy who discovers a nightmare landscape of a cemetery after dark (and all the creatures who inhabit it). The entire cast have become major horror icons, and for the most part haven't left the boundaries of the series. I can't say enough about Reggie Bannister and Angus Scrimm in particular. Reggie's character (aptly named Reggie) ends up becoming Bruce Campbellesque as the series goes on. The musical score is one of the most haunting aspects of the movie. Along with the score, the Tall Man (with his dialogue consisting of only five lines) is one of the most awesome villains in cinematic history. The flying sentinels are also quite amazing; they make the film unforgettable. This movie has a creep factor of ten and I recommend seeing the sequels as well. Phantasm has become a great saga and I can't wait to witness the next installment.",Phantasm
67,Samiam3,almost phantastic,7,1 February 2009,"Don Coscarelli's Phantasm is a unique and original horror film that would have been great were it not for two problems; bad acting and a rather lousy ending. Everything else here is exceptional; the music, the story, the scares, and best of all, the villain. Angus Scrimm plays the 'Tallman', a human from a world in another dimension who has come to Earth, and works in a cemetery where he steals bodies to take back to his home planet for reasons that the protagonists have to figure out and fast. Scrimm plays the character perfectly, he manages to be frightening without over doing it. The protagonist is an adolescent named Michael who lives under the care of his older brother, the two of them are orphans. One day, Mike sees the Tallman stealing a coffin in the cemetery where his parents were buried and from there, his journey to find and stop this alien man becomes intense. He is a cute face, but not necessarily a protagonist that the audience will fall in love with.Phantasm as a whole, works pretty well for a horror film, it falls apart at the very end but not completely, it leaves the story open for a great horror franchise.",Phantasm

69,lemon_magic,"Nightmarish dream logic and some powerful, gruesome images make it better than it should be",6,26 June 2005,"This seems to be a case in which the relative paucity of the budget worked for the film instead of against it. The director was forced to keep things pretty lean and focused instead of indulging in a lot of fancy flourishes and details, so he didn't waste any screen time or film with stuff that wouldn't help tell his story. Admittedly, the plot is so thin, and the room the budget leaves the director to work is so spare, that often the movie drags, or simply wastes air time. The body count and SFX occurrences are spread quite thin, as horror movies go, in fact...I remember maybe five deaths and a maximum of three-to-four minutes of actual special effects. But what the movie DOES have going for it is: atmosphere. Almost from the beginning, ""Phantasm"" does a great job of instilling dread and anxiety into the viewer. The setting of the plot, a small, isolated town, with weird goings on at the local mortuary, is guaranteed to unsettle even the most matter-of-fact, unimaginative viewer after a while. And because the plot and crisis events are so thin, when something awful DOES happen on screen, there is very little to muffle or diminish the impact of what you just saw as the movie goes on. Years after I first saw ""Phantasm"" as a young man, four major images still stuck with me: the ""Tall Man"" leering at the camera, oozing menace from every pore; the Sphere burrowing into the henchman's forehead and spewing his brains out the back; the dismembered finger leaking yellow fluid all over and turning into an insect; and the hellish vision of the alternate dimension beyond the twin pillars which the hero sees before his friend manages to yank him back. That's pretty good shooting for a low budget film from the 70s. If I were the director, I would be proud to be known for this movie. Not for the faint of heart or the squeamish, and not for the SFX junkies who cut their teeth and had their expectations molded by multi-million dollar extravaganzas like the Dark Castle remakes (""13 Ghosts"", ""Ghost Ship"" ""THe House On Haunted Hill"". etc). If you have some patience, and can accept the movie on its own terms, ""Phantasm"" will make you squirm.",Phantasm
70,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"This gives new meaning to the word ""BOOOYYY!""",10,21 March 2003,"In 1980, Magnetic Video released the full length 90-minutes long version on video, with a difused glow throughout the entire film. In the latter part of the 1980s, the film was issued again on video, but one sequence (which takes place in near complete darkness in The Tall Man's glowing white room) was accidentally edited out by the people supervising the film to video transfer. This version of the film ran 87/ 88 minutes in length. When Phantasm was issued on DVD in the late 1990s the scene was restored, but the colour balance and the soft diffusion was corrected, which I think robbed the film of some of its atmospheric effect. My review is based on Magnetic Video's 1980 release. This haunting, dreamlike hallucination of a movie was written, directed, photographed, produced and edited by Don Coscarelli, it doesn't make much sense but it's still a great bit of fun to watch with the lights turned out. This kid named Mike convinces his older brother Jody that there is something weird going on at the local cemetery. So he and Jody break into the old mausoleum and find out that it's actually some kind of factory where people are killed by a flying metal ball, crushed down to a height of about 3'2"", dressed up like little monks and packaged up into round metal garbage cans and shipped off for use as slave labour in some other dimension. A dimension ruled and resided over by the six and a half foot tall mortician (known throughout the entire ordeal as just simply ""The Tall Man"") working at this cemetery. When The Tall Man kills another friend of theirs, they decide to put and end to him, or at least try to.This movie has many different layered meanings, over the years some people have said that it's a reference to corporate America coming in (in the form of The Tall Man) and killing off everyone (by turning everything into a 'business') and some have said that this movie is also about a kid's loss of innocence and fears about everyone around him leaving (or in this case dying) Whatever the hell this movie is about, it's still great fun, followed by a couple of really disappointing (and belated) sequels.",Phantasm
71,Gislef,Dream like movie,8,30 April 1999,"Basically, Phantasm isn't dissimilar from the later ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" stuff.  Much of the movie has the same dreamlike quality.  One suspects that Wes Craven ""borrowed"" a lot from here.  The main bad guy oozes some weird not-blood substance (yellow instead of Freddy's green), characters tend to get killed that you don't suspect, and there are a lot of ""Am I awake"" stuff.  It's a creepy little low-budget flick that you really have to watch a couple of times to understand.  And look for the deliberate Dune references scattered throughout the flick.",Phantasm
72,Maciste_Brother,Excellent Horror,8,30 August 2000,"When I first saw Phantasm, I hated it. Was annoyed by it all. Now today, I really love this film. It's one of the many great horror films of the 1970s. The DVD is amazing and made me appreciate this underrated flick more than ever. Sure, the acting is stilted and the set-up are sometimes obvious but the whole nightmarish quality is near perfect. It's obvious Wes Craven was ""inspired"" by Phantasm when he came up with A Nightmare on Elm Street (which is a crude combination of Halloween and Phantasm). But Phantasm is so much better than NOES because it remains scary and edgy up to the very end. A Nightmare started with a bang but ended on a flat note.What I find really funny about Phantasm is that it follows the strange trend of the 1970s, where a lot young filmmakers who really didn't know that much about horror, created one classic scare flick, and then were unable to come up with a better film with their unveven career. For example, Tobe Hooper and Texas Chainsaw Massacre; Carpenter and Halloween; Romero and Dawn of the dead; Friedkin and Exorcist, etc. And like these directors and their great horror movies, Don Coscarelli has been unable to repeat or top the coolness and greatness of Phantasm with his terrible film career (avoid the Phantasm sequels). Very odd.The story is good and the relationship between the brothers is original and all too rare in movies, and makes a lot of sense, in a Jungian way. The cinematography is excellent, the music is as memorable as Halloween's score. The effects are actually good and the film is creepy, even when it's silly (that bug scene). Everything about Phantasm works, including the truly frightening, fatalistic ending, which was ripped-off unsuccessfully in A Nightmare's ending. Phantasm is a surreal, nightmarish odyssey. I highly recommend it. And the DVD is A+.",Phantasm

Average at best.",Phantasm
74,baumer,One of the most bizarre films out there,9,7 March 2002,"Like everyone that has reviewed this film before me, I am going to sing it's praises, however, unlike those before me, I'm not quite sure why.  This film did everything it was supposed to do as a horror film.  It scared me in a few areas, it was quite gory in others and it was easily one of the ten most quirky and bizarre films I have ever seen.  I can't tell you why anything transpires the way it does in here, I can't even tell you why people do the things they do, but I don't really think that is the point of the film. Like David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, this is more of mind altering experience or a dream that just doesn't make any sense.  Perhaps this is a film that is esoteric by design and if that is the case then perhaps I should just watch it over and over again until I do have some sort of puerile grasp of it. Dictionary.com's definition of a phantasm is ""in Platonic philosophy, objective reality as observed by the five senses.""  Another definiton it gives is simply, ""a notion"".  And if you watch this film from beginning to end you will see why this makes all the sense in the world, yet it is still an abstruse concept that is meant to be exactly what it is.The film begins with a funeral of one of Jody (Bill Thornbury) and Reggie's (Reggie Bannister) best friends.  Jody's little brother, Mikey ( A Michael Baldwin) is a precocious kid who can't seem to stay in one place and follows his big brother everywhere he goes.  Hence he is at the funeral but is surreptitiously hiding out in the bushes.  As the funeral ends, he sees the caretaker lift a casket all by himself and put it into his truck.  This is the nascency of the bizaare rituals that encompass the film. 
Michael decides to investigate the strange looking mansion where the cemetery rests.  Once he breaks into the house, he is chased by some strange Jawa looking creatures and by a sphere that seems to come out of nowhere and drains your head of blood.  He does escape and finally gets his big brother to believe him when he says that things aren't quite right up at the Morningside Cemetery.  Now, up until this point, the film is quite linear. You have your classic set-up, a spooky looking mansion where the dead are taken and your typical stupid characters that do the traditional scary movie things, like going to investigate a haunted house all by yourself, gratuitous breast shots, some eerie music and dark nights.  But that is where the title ""typical horror film"" ends and it crosses over into Rod Serling territory.  From here on out, it just goes weird, but in a goosebump inducing way that keeps you frozen in your seat.Don Coscarelli can take all of the praise and/or blame for this eccentric film.  He wrote, produced, directed, was the DP, the editor and as another reviewer so aptly pointed out, he probably swept the floors at night and fetched coffee for those on the set.  This is his incarnation.  I also happen to agree with other viewers that say that this film has one of the most haunting yet mellifluous scores which is on par with Carpenter's Halloween theme.  Both are intricate pieces to the presence of the film. Words like haunting, eerie, creepy and forbidding all come to mind when you hear the score.  It is also uncanny to see some of the similarities to A Nightmare On Elm Street and Phantasm.  Nightmare was a little more clear with what it was trying to say but both films have an overtly murky and dream like exploration into realms that many of us have yet to understand.The underlying theme in this film is the unsolved questions that plague many of us when we wonder what happens when you die.  Most of us believe that you go to Heaven or Hell.  But those are just theories.  And if theories are unproven then what is stop you from believing that this movie could really be the answer to those questions?  As the tag line for the film so poignantly points out, ""If this one doesn't scare you, you're already dead."" What if all of this was true?  What if you could be stolen and made into something that you did not ask to become?  Who is the Tall Man and what is he doing here in our world?  One of the most harrowing yet well done plot pieces is when Mikey goes to the girl's house and finds an old picture of the Tall Man sitting on a horse carriage, looking like it is circa 1776. This leaves the viewer ripe with questions.Phantasm will leave you with more questions than answers but I will say this about the film.  In a day and age where you get prosaic, banal and myopic efforts like ( take your pick of most of the horror that has ""graced"" our screens since the Scream and Blair Witch craze) and you compare them to films like Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Phantasm, you quickly realize that the 70's and early 80's was the genesis of the horror film.  I realize horror probably dates back to Nosferatu and it became respected with Psycho, but to look at the films that were born in the 70's and 80's, it's a veritable, indefeasible list of some of the most revered and imitated horror films of all time.  Now that I have seen Phantasm I can easily see the mark it has left on other films.9 out of 10----As I said, I still can't tell you what this film is all about nor can I tell you what it all means or how it all ends, all I can say is that it made me feel something strange with it's disingenuous stroke of the brush.  This is a film that absolutely demands a second and third viewing....which is what I am about to do right now.  BOY!!!!!!!",Phantasm

This is the type of film that took pride of place alongside the likes of The evil dead, Hellraiser, and A nightmare on Elm street in the horror section in almost every video shop in the land; with almost everyone who rented it getting their money's worth from this fun, quite well made, and more than a little odd film. This truth be told isn't all that gory, there's the scene with the metal ball of death doing what it does, but overall this is more of an interestingly creepy and slightly funny film than violent or disturbing. Anyone who likes this era of horror should without doubt give this a look.",Phantasm
79,stamper,This one is banned in Germany and I know for what: STUPIDITY!!!,4,18 February 2001,"This is really not a good film. B minus maximum, but I think its more of a C film. The story and the actors are no good. Although the director seems to have seen Star Wars numerous times (or why the hell are the dwarves running around like monks for). Also this is banned in Germany (what for?) there is just a bit of blood and no gore. This really is an enormous piece of crap. One or two laughs though.To people interested in the story: (SPOILERS AHEAD) This film is about a graveyard dude who crunches dead people to a height of 3 feet, revives them and then uses them as slaves in some sort of 'other galaxy'. Think that is a great story? Then rent this. (SPOILERS END)4 out of 10(Oh yes did I mention that the effects totally suck (from a 2001 point of view.

80,eminkl,If only he had a film to cogently back his demonic presence,4,13 December 2019,"In which the bogeyman is turned into a murderball slinging monkey-suited alien with an arm swing to rival Tyra's. If 1979's ""Phantasm"" is soundly scary then ""Friday the 13th"" must be original, but at least the former tries to make something of its low-budget self, which is worth something even if the value at hand is little. Famously, ""Phantasm"" was made on a wing and a prayer by young Hollywood wunderkind Don Coscarelli, who was twenty-two during production and was only a teenager when he made his first film, 1975 drama ""Jim the World's Greatest."" Written, directed, edited, produced, and photographed by Coscarelli, ""Phantasm"" wears the stamp of economic less-is-more filmmaking proudly on its chest - but in effect do we additionally blame its relative inability to tie up loose ends and its inability to find any sort of conversational believability on the inexperience of the film's otherwise inventive maker. Using surrealism and unmistakable disjointedness as attributes to further enhance its night terror reflecting patina, the film is a hotbed of disconcerting imagery that never proves to be much more than its haunting array of images. Coscarelli has a way with the camera and a way with the art of the concept, but his fundamentally materialistic screenplay never allows for his abstractions to bury their claws into our vulnerable flesh. One can only wonder what David Cronenberg or Clive Barker could have done with material as brimming with potential as ""Phantasm's."" Its storyline sounds sturdy enough, but interest is lost in execution. The film circles around Mike (A. Michael Baldwin), a thirteen-year-old grappling with the recent death of his parents. Being raised by his twenty-something brother, Jody (Bill Thornbury), the grieving period has been slow and painful - it's been two years since the demise of their loved ones and simple everyday existence is still gloomy. But suspicions that the local mortician, whom Mike dubs ""The Tall Man"" (Angus Scrimm), was the person responsible for their ends suddenly are propelled to new levels when Mike witnesses the man stealing a coffin from its resting place shortly after a memorial service, remarkably throwing the casket into his car without a hint of assistance. A short time later and the goon is chasing Mike around with killer silver ski balls that hook onto their victims and funnel out all their blood in a steady stream. So sure, The Tall Man, an obvious dweller of the underworld or some other hellacious netherworld, probably did kill Mike's parents. And yet the fiend's very existence strikes a universal chord of fear within its audience - while The Tall Man's motivations are individualistic, he's holistically a representation of a child's fear of dominating authority and other figures of intimidating power. Because Coscarelli's script is much too underdeveloped to bring us to any real conclusions, though, we only reach that epiphany out of an elongated search for something to grab onto. Coscarelli succeeds in sketching out a memorable villain, but fails in his determination to build a posse of protagonists worth noting. When The Tall Man's not stalking the shadows and those amazingly murderous Christmas ornament imitating balls of fury aren't flying about looking for a piece of human to snack on, ""Phantasm"" is decidedly derisory, a smorgasbord of horror tropes that never prosper because they're so malnourished. But it flourishes in its introduction to one of horror's more idiosyncratically frightening villains, and there's no ignoring The Tall Man's cryptic capacity. If only he had a film to cogently back his demonic presence.",Phantasm
81,cchase,"""Booooooyyyyyy!""",8,5 December 2008,"If the sound of that sonorous, ball-rattling growl wasn't enough to make you wet yourself, you needed to check your pulse to see if it was still there. Or as the poster and the previews so aptly put it: ""If THIS doesn't scare you, YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD!!!""At the time that movies like THE EXORCIST, HALLOWEEN and THE FURY had already bolted from the gate in the Kentucky Derby of scaring up ""boo"" and ""bling"" at the Box Office, there were some nifty little gems that wormed their way between the cracks to scoop up some crumbs and some die-hard fans who became fiercely loyal to them and the franchises they eventually spawned. Of those films that surfaced at the time, the most imaginative and out- and-out frightening of them all was PHANTASM.Mike (A. Michael Baldwin), the youngest brother of Jody (Bill Thornbury) is always underfoot, always shadowing his big brother. Younger bros have a way of doing that to begin with, but Mike has some ""abandonment issues"" and it's not a surprise: their parents were both killed in a car accident, and Jody is not only Mike's legal guardian, but he's all the family the kid has. Well, not counting Jody's best bud Reggie (Reggie Bannister), a ponytailed, laid-back Sixties holdover who drives an ice-cream truck for a living.PHANTASM begins with the mysterious death of a mutual friend of Jody and Reggie's. Forbidden to attend the funeral, Mike sneaks off to Morningside Cemetery anyway to watch the service through binoculars. But the event that kicks this scarefest into high gear is not the funeral, but what happens AFTERWARDS.The moment the mourners are gone, a hearse arrives and a seven-foot tall, gaunt vision of terror dressed in the usual funeral director's outfit, picks up the casket WITH HIS BARE HANDS and dumps it into the back of the hearse like a grocery sack. Mike has just had his first encounter with the ghoul known only as The Tall Man, but it definitely won't be the last. He manages to get brother Jody and their friend Reggie roped into believing what he's seen, and trying to find out what The Tall Man is up to, and then how to stop him. The rest of the movie is catapulted into a world where dream states and reality exist almost as one, and you have no idea from moment to terrifying moment what the hell is going to happen next. Using every trick in the book that could be created before the benefits of CGI, director Don Coscarelli blends horror, sci-fi, comedy, fantasy and everything in between to keep the audience laughing and screaming, sometimes all at once. Referencing Mike Oldfield's haunting theme to THE EXORCIST, composers Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave came up with a superb score that's just as haunting and memorable in its own right, underscoring the visuals perfectly. And if the acting is not top drawer from a then no-name cast, at least the performances are somewhat natural and not over-acted. The key scene-stealer is Bannister, a great instinctive Cheech-and-Chong-type comic, whose priceless expressions and timing would be enlisted for a whole slew of PHANTASM sequels.But the acting awards overall have to go to Angus Scrimm as The Tall Man. A former schoolteacher, Scrimm, with very little help from the makeup department, cut such a formidable figure of fright, that it would be impossible to imagine any sequels without him. (Indeed; he's in all of them.) And the spare special effects budget is used wisely on briefly glimpsed but highly effective set-pieces based on gore and intense action, especially the mainstay of the PHANTASM series: the ominous and terrifying Silver Spheres. If (Gawd forbid!) any talk of a remake actually leads to an upcoming movie, (and there HAS been talk), I would only hope that Don Coscarelli is hired to do it justice. No other director could bring to it the sparks of originality that spawned the series in the first place.A little on the dated side, but for anyone who considers themselves a true fan of the genre, this is REQUIRED viewing!",Phantasm

I've read reviews comparing this film to David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" and I suppose to a degree that comparison is feasible. Directed (as well as written and produced) by Don Coscarelli, the film is a triumph on many levels, one of them being its originality. Secondly, it's a superbly written story. It starts off as a seemingly by-the-book horror film, and then it begins to take on a mystery tone right before delving into something much odder and more esoteric than you expected you were in for. There are many chilling yet awesome visuals thru out, adding to the eeriness of it all.Another big plus is a very well acted cast. Michael Baldwin is just plain awesome and Bill Thornburg is great as well. Reggie Banister is also damn good, everyone creating very human characters and making the story that much more potent. Angus Scrimm is priceless as the Tall Man most definitely. One of its greatest aspects is its score by Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave. It really adds to the dream-like aura of the film.

Angus Scrimm became a horror icon with his Tallman character and the film has an interesting concept about evil dreams long before Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" came to the screen, the film is quite bloody but not merely gory as the film relies on storyline and atmosphere unlike most slasher movies of the time.",Phantasm
88,PeterMitchell-506-564364,A 80's horror that won't die for a long time yet,8,2 April 2013,"One of the better eighties movies, it's story original as hell, if intriguing, as is it's slogan, on it's cover which had me as a teenager, pondering what it meant exactly. The Never Dead is one of those better 80's horrors, one of those well put together flicks, despite some cheesy moments, slipping in, hey that made the eighties what they were. The setting takes place around a mortuary, where at the start, a beloved young friend is taken by a demon force, the wrong girl, he happened to have sex with. At least he died doing something he loved, having intercourse and groping titties. Two things. As being part of a rock trio, one of his friends does his own investigating, while baby brother, who likes to ride his bike anywhere-including funeral grounds, follows him in the shadows. The usual stereotypical brotherly love angle: Big brother doesn't want little brother to get hurt. Afterall, parentless, all they have is each other. What has got the boy spooked is this tall man (caretaker of the cemetery) where the kid is witness to him partaking in some strange happenings. When he sneaks into the mausoleum, he's confronted by this killer brass ball, he has some close calls with, another guy not so lucky, in a small nifty horror treat of some blood gushing violence, which doesn't run excessive in this well put together film, of more story. Another interesting story touch I liked was the boy confiding in an old woman fortune teller and her daughter who he knows well, worried big brother's gonna leave him. This added more spook to the horror. As for the acting, it's passable, most of them around the 53 percent mark, though none of them should hold out for an Oscar nomination, although Angus Scrimm as the caretaker, rocked, who will forever haunt me. Known also as Phantasm (The Never Dead sounds better) if trawling through a lot of unseen horrors of (here we again the ""eighties""-they were just great times for me, okay) include this in his gathering.

89,Java_Joe,And essential movie of the horror genre. It's just not a great one .,5,20 November 2018,"Let me get this out of the way first, I get it why people like this movie. It's very dreamlike, there's some really good cinematography and a genuinely creepy antagonist in the Tall Man. And that silver ball thing is notable for being incredibly iconic. But I can't rate this any higher.The FX are decent for the time and I really have no real problem with them. This movie was made on a shoestring budget by a bunch of Hollywood outsiders. It's everything an indie movie really needs to be. It's memorable, it made a lot of money and it spawned several sequels. All in all it's been very successful.Except when it comes to the main failings of the movie namely the plot and the acting. They're just abysmal. It started off well. With the creepy mausoleum, the creepy Tall Man, the creepy silver ball that drills into your brain and all those weird Jawa things. Something was going on and it kept you guessing. That is until they find that secret room in the mausoleum that leads to another world. Suddenly it loses any and all power if might have had. The Jawas turn out to be the reanimated bodies of people, but compressed to withstand the pressure of this alien world. No seriously. They've been turned into zombie midget slaves. It's like when in ""Insidious"" we finally see the demon and he looks like Darth Maul. He loses any terror we might have for him. It's a staple of the horror genre that the monster is scariest when we're never able to get a good look at them. Our minds fill in the blanks. But you show them, and their power is lost.And then there's the acting which is wooden at best. People just accept stuff when somebody says it, there's no real realism in how the characters act and it just feels flat. And again I get it, these were amateurs. But even amateurs can act well when they have a good director or a good script.It's not a bad movie but it's not a good movie either.

90,harryplinkett14,It's fun,5,15 March 2015,"The plot is wafer thin and repetitive, not to mention amateurish. But there are original elements in the film and the film radiates genuine joy of filmmaking. It reminds me of a time when filmmaking was fun and original, not a cynical business of remaking and rebooting that Hollywood has become.So, what is this film about? It's about a weird kid that is being chased by a tall, creepy guy and a bunch of horror-style Jawas. That's about it. Scene after scene he runs into these guys and somehow gets away. Then a couple of other guys join in and now they too keep running into the creeps and somehow managing to get away.Of course, the tall man cannot be killed, and he has an endless supply of evil Jawas, so there is room for endless encounters with them. In fact, the director thought one film was not nearly enough, so he made three sequels, all of which have virtually no plot and consist of little more than creepy encounters with the tall man and his minions.There is, however, one cool thing: a floating silver ball that buries itself into a guy's head and drills into it.

95,blackmamba99971,A rare film,10,18 January 2010,"Phantasm, quite possibly the most original horror flicks known to man or at least The Tall Man. Don Coscarelli who wrote, directed, over saw editing, and also produced these films is one of the most influential directors to others mainly because of his surreal quality that binds these films together in a continuing series. Each one different from one another yet somehow works in a cohesion that causes the characters to wander town to town to find the Tall Man. And upon finding him they realize that their efforts are completely useless, because of the fact the Tall Man knows how it is going to end. Only he has seen every outcome that the Dimensional Forks can provide, which is why Mike, Jody, Even Reggie has absolutely no stake in. To be pawns in a game that Only the Tall Man initiated, and to be the only one left standing so to speak. Yet every character has a part to play, trying to fight or stop the Tall Man from accomplishing his goal of dominating the known Dimensions. Still to see the fight was wonderful, especially seeing those incredible flying Spheres that can slice, dice and julienne at the same time. The creator of this Sphere is also the Tall Man using brain tissue from dwarfed human beings after they are dead, only to become slaves for off world colonization. The effects in these films were quite staggering, and in 1979 those Spheres were the eye candy of audiences all over the world making these films the most original ever created. No other film has come close albeit one other called Hell raiser. But that film used puzzle cubes to bring the user to another dimension for final judgement. Those films are in a class all by themselves, but well worth the watch. Yet for Phantasm, the films will remain as the most mysterious because of how dreams and reality can collide in such a way, that the characters don't know if they are asleep or awake. Possibly a side effect from the Dimensional Forks the Tall Man created himself. Excellent genre, I recommend anyone to see these films, I hope more are in the works, because no one can replace the Tall Man,... BOYYYYYYY!",Phantasm
96,Gafke,I LOVE this movie!,10,28 October 2003,"I remember staying up late to watch this movie on TV when I was a kid.  It scared the hell out of me.  Then, for 15 years, I forgot all about it. Recently, I found a $5 VHS copy in the discount bin of my local drugstore and thought: ""What the hell?""  That was the best $5 I ever spent.Phantasm may not make a lot of sense, the story is confusing and seems to have been made up as it went along, but that's kind of the point.  It's like watching someone else's fever dream...and that's exactly what it's supposed to be like, because it IS someone else's fever dream.  Phantasm is a classic nightmare; totally unpredictable, claustrophobic, paranoid and frightening.13 year old Michael Baldwin was perfect as the young protagonist, an amazingly refreshing, un-annoying child actor.  I was totally convinced by his performance as the lonely teen, desperately chasing after his older brother and displaying just the right amounts of anger, confusion and frustration, yet never giving in to panic even as his world spins out of control.  Bill Thornbury as older brother Jody seemed mysteriously detached, yet after repeated viewings, I realized how correct this was in light of the twist ending.  He is, indeed, a ghost that Michael simply refuses to give up.  Reggie Bannister was completely irresistible as the sweet and gentlemanly Reggie the Ice Cream Man, who manages to remain innocent and lovable even as he suggests ramming a stake through the Tall Mans heart. And the Tall Man, Mr. Angus Scrimm himself...BRRRRR!!!  He doesn't have many lines (other than the now-infamous ""BOYYYYYYY!"") but he doesn't need any. His very presence is chilling, and the scene where he stops dead in the middle of a suburban sidewalk in the middle of the day and turns, ever so slowly, to face Michael through a mist of frost emanating from Reggie's ice cream truck, is more frightening than any murder scene set in the dead of night.  And need I mention the flying balls?  What an original, ingenious invention!  This is such an amazing blend of sci-fi, horror and fantasy that I really did not care if it didn't make a whole lot of sense.  The flying balls, the dwarves, the yellow blood, and THAT FLY IN THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL!!! Wow.  If nothing else, you simply have to give this film and its makers credit for originality.

It's an offbeat and unusual movie that has a kind of dream logic all of its own (Coscarelli based it on a nightmare he had as a kid in which he was chased down a corridor by a flying silver ball equipped with a long needle), but owes just as much a debt of gratitude to Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes and the 1953 Invaders From Mars. A cult classic thanks to a great cast (Michael Baldwin, Bill Thornbury, and Reggie Bannister were all aspiring professionals, the latter was Coscarelli's friend and his part was especially written for him,) who show great enthusiasm to bring the directors vision to life including performing most of their own stunts, and a killer soundtrack composed by Fred Myrow that is greatly influenced by Goblin and Mike Oldfield, Phantasm spawned four sequels as well as appearing in numerous lists of all time great horror movies.",Phantasm
99,ericrnolan,"A review of ""Phantasm"" (1979)",3,18 May 2019,"I don't enjoy panning films that others revere. There's no percentage in it. I'm not the guy who tries to be edgy or cool by telling you he dislikes something that everyone else loves.But I do need to tell you that I think that ""Phantasm"" (1979) is a bad movie. I'd rate it a 3 out of 10, based on some interesting ingredients, but I suspect that even that is a bit generous. I finally managed to make it through its entire running time tonight, and it feels amateurish on every level.It's poorly scripted, directed and edited, with performances that are nearly all quite bad. The first exception here is A. Michael Baldwin, who was a decent child actor when this movie was made, and who was quite likable as the story's adolescent protagonist. The second exception, I suppose, is ""The Tall Man"" himself, Angus Scrimm, the deep-voiced and admittedly unsettling big-bad.There's really only one other positive thing I can say about the movie - it has a damned good set design for its mausoleum. (Somewhat confusingly, the film suggests this is located ... inside the funeral home itself? Is that a thing in some places? I honestly don't know.) The set is simultaneously beautiful and frightening, with symmetrical hallways of contrasting white and red - the kind of thing you'd expect to see in a Stanley Kubrick film. I can't escape the suspicion that it was somehow pilfered from a far better film.And I do understand the unconscious appeal of ""Phantasm's"" story. We see an adolescent boy who has lost his parents team up with his likable older brother to fight mysterious monsters at their local funeral home. They enlist the aid of the brother's guitar-playing, everyman best friend, they use everyday weapons like guns and knives, and they bond over the shared experience. It's a tailor-made, understandable power fantasy for any adolescent boy first grasping adult concepts of death and mortality.But ... those things aren't enough to redeem the film. In my opinion, it's bad enough to be a candidate for the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" treatment.Hey - what do I know? Your mileage may vary.

100,jonathan-577,what the hell is going on?,7,8 December 2007,"Now here's the RIGHT way to be juvenile and incoherent. I got fairly obsessive about this movie in high school, and while it's doesn't transport me the way it once did, it still looks and sounds just great, and keeps knocking you off your stride with unexpected bizarre flourishes. The gape-mouthed fascination with naked girls is hilariously pubescent, the tacky musical interlude is actually kind of cute, and what's up with Mabel? But its dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream hallucinatory quality is best captured by the sequence where the kid slams a door on the legendary Tall Man's hand, cuts off his fingers so that they ooze yellow blood, puts one in a box and takes it home, watches it turn into a giant fanged insect, helps his brother wrap it in a shirt and jam it into the garburetor, and then welcomes their friend the ice cream salesman who speaks for all of us when he sticks his tongue out and inquires, ""What the hell is going on?""",Phantasm
101,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Didn't really do it for me... A very overrated film,4,30 June 2020,"""Phantasm"" is one unique and bizarre horror film. Made on a low-budget by a very young director, the film boasts some fine horror imagery, atmosphere and a very creepy score that rivals the likes of ""Halloween"", but unfortunately it is just too incoherent to maintain interest and focus on its story, and it is severely inhibited by many factors. Quite a few people have pointed out that the film's incoherence just adds to the nightmare quality of the film. I agree, to a certain extent, but overall ""Phantasm"" just did not do it for me. But I have not ruled out a further viewing. Basically, the film sees two brothers, one is only a teenager, the other is a grown man and looks after the former now that their parents are both dead. They live together in the family home, and the younger brother has recently become fascinated by the graveyard and the caretaker and his activities, prompting him to snoop further until he uncovers something he will wish he hadn't, and drags the older brother into it as well. It turns out that the caretaker - the Tall Man - has been messing around with the dead bodies of the towns denizens, and turning them into dwarf monsters to carry out his bidding. The bothers, aided by an ice-cream truck driver, set out to stop this mysterious Tall Man and fight his minions. Overall, I do not rate ""Phantasm"". The nightmarish qualities that it has are shunted by some poor special effects and mediocrity; the infamous sphere-ball looks embarrassing and took away from the horror for me, and scenes such as the one with the fortune-teller just inhibit the atmosphere of the film in how ludicrous and poorly made they are. Very overrated, and becomes dull to watch by the end.",Phantasm
102,michaelradny,A Classic Among Horrors,9,29 July 2015,"This has to be one of the greatest cult classic horror films around. It's weird, bizarre, surreal, chilling and ultimately scary. It has one of the most original and most iconic murder weapons on it and whilst talking about original, this story is as different to anything you would have seen before. It never deals B-Grade in terms of quality. Everything is high octane and well revised for a delivery of great suspense and thrills. A great if not fantastic horror film. It's second only to that of the Evil Dead trilogy. Cult classics are great and this one is one of those greats.

103,Jacques98,The only thing more unintentionally hilarious than this movie is the positive reviews.,2,22 February 2009,"I realize the idea of taking Star Wars, interbreeding it with one of Dario Argento's cheese-films, and putting an intoxicated spin on the whole thing may sound like a pretty cool idea. In 2009, the weirder the idea, the greater the appeal to the ""open-minded"" emo kids. In 1979, I'm the idea also appealed to the acid-induced ""free-spirited"" 10-year-old hippie boys. My point is, no matter what generation you grew up in, there has always been and always will be those who think that they can be nonconformists by throwing out every rule and making their own rules . . . thus, paradoxically, conforming. I can't help but relate this attitude to Phantasm. It tries so hard to be different from the rest, but in the end, it's just another bucket of horror clichés. Maybe the bucket is painted a different coloryellow blood, perhapsbut the contents are exactly the same as all the other generic horror films from the 70s.A concept that few people really understand: When weird is the norm, it isn't weird anymore.That concept is the problem that I always have with movies like Phantasm. The fans and the modern critics always site them as coming up with original ideas, when in reality, they're just cliché ideas presented in a weird light. Every single ""weird"" occurrence in Phantasm was unabashedly copy/pasted from Star Wars, Argento movies, 40s horror movies, and classic sci-fi novels. There wasn't a single ""weird"" scene in this movie that I haven't seen in entertainment before '79. For example, the silver sphere IS unarguably the lightsaber training bot in the original Star Wars. The hooded midgets in the end are also unarguably the Jawas from the original Star Wars. The fly was used before in various Stephen King short stories and various 40s movies. Etc., Etc. It would take me pages to list every single instance Phantasm ripped-off other movies/books, but it pretty much amounts to the entire movie. Anyone who tries to argue otherwise is a fanboy, blinded by his nostalgic first viewing of this film as an adolescent, then growing up thinking ""Those were the good old' days , when horror . . ."" for no other reason than it was his first exposure to horror. Anyone who enjoys horror films that are actually scary, aren't overflowing with cheese, and actually have some sort intelligence, this is the last place to look.Despite what the old men who grew up with this film will tell you, it is not scary, gory, or weird. It's just another generic paint-by-the-numbers horror film. The acting is pathetic. The special effects are pure cheesefugitively and literally (referencing the yellow blood). The story is done with go-anywhere-do-anything surrealismwhich has recently been popularized by the author Neil Gaimanwhich works in children's movies, but here is just unintentionally ludicrous. People have complained Phantasm makes no sense, but they fail to realize that's the immature point behind the movie. It's meant to be nothing more than a bunch of pseudo -weird scenes that it ripped-off from other (superior) movies. It's ironic, maybe even hypocritical, that older horror fans claim Phantasm as part of ""the good days of horror"", when ""there was a story, not just gore and nudity."" Phantasm has no story. In its time, it was just an acid trip, and a vehicle to display what was considered over-the-top gore/nudity in the '70s. In its generation, it was far more mindless than what is claimed as mindless today.Some cite the music as great: it's really just okay. It is atmospheric like the music in Suspiria and Halloween, but it can't stand up to either, really. Also, the acting, like everything else, is laughable. Another problem is the lack of entertainment value. I fell asleep four times.I'm not sure what my overall thoughts on Phantasm were, because as soon as I write the last sentence of this review I'll forgot entirely about it. It's just a generic horror film with ""weird"" aspects copy/pasted from other films. And it cannot be defended by saying that it's intended to be cheesy, because that is not the intention of the film. If that's what we classify as original, intelligent horror that is deserving of a fond place in our hearts . . . there's no hope for us as horror fans. And even less hope of the genre progressing any further in the future.(1) Cheese oozing out of severed fingers, and fugitively out of the plot line. Or, (2) A genuinely scary, original horror movie that you can talk to the outside world about without feeling immature and stupid.It's your choice.2/10",Phantasm

105,geminiredblue,A Creepy Little Dream... Or Is It?,9,19 April 2011,"Every decade or so, the horror genre gets re-defined by an iconic movie. In the 30s, it was Universal with their classics. In the 50s, it was giant animals and atomic-age monsters. In 1960, it was PSYCHO. In 1968, it was NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. in the 70s, audiences witnessed the rise of wild and unhinged directors with equally unhinged movies: ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", HALLOWEEN, DAWN OF THE DEAD, SUSPIRIA and ZOMBIE all terrorized audiences in their own ways. Near the end of the 70s, along came this little movie made on a shoestring budget about two brothers dealing with a mysterious mortuary. At the very beginning of the movie, we're given what appears to be a gratuitous sex scene. But at the end of it, we realize something more sinister is going on. From that point on, anything could happen, and a lot does. The plot makes virtually no sense (as other critics have noted) and that's kind of the point. Just look at the title: PHANTASM means ""dream"" or ""nightmare."" And the best way to view this movie is through the logic of a nightmare. Sure it makes sense while you're asleep. But upon waking up, it seems absurd. The appearance of the Tall Man is a truly unsettling moment, as are numerous others. The most famous of which involves a flying silver ball. Imagination brims all over the place, which is one of the benefits of a small independent production: It dares to risk trying new things. Watch this movie and be prepared for a thrill ride through a nightmare world!",Phantasm
106,TheRedDeath30,Bizarre and Dreamlike Classic,9,25 September 2016,"I am fairly well immersed in the horror community. I go to a dozen conventions a year. I talk about horror on social media frequently. I buy things from horror vendors (toys, t-shirts, etc). What I am trying to convey is that I think I am fairly in tune with the trends of the horror culture. This is one of those ""forgotten out of mind"" classics. What I mean by that is that I don't see the stars of this movie invited to conventions all that often. I don't see people talking about it all the time on social media. I don't see Phantasm toys, posters, t- shirts flooding the vendor stalls and websites. It's by no means a HALLOWEEN or Friday THE 13th. However, ask any horror fan if they like this movie and you will get a resounding yes. This fact was backed up last night (as I type this) as they re-released a remastered version to select theaters, most of which sold out, attesting to the love of this movie.As loved as it is, clearly what keeps it from being a certified classic is that it does have weaknesses, as well. It is certainly not a perfect film, but it is memorable and frightening. The movie occupies a strange place in its' classification. It's an American independent horror film, but feels far more in place with what European horror was doing at the time. This is no slasher, or mean- spirited grindhouse horror that was so popular with American horror audiences at the time. It is a surreal film, with a storyline that is all over the place, and a dreamlike tone that reminds me much more of the influence of the Italians. It is, also, not quite horror. There are clear sci-fi tones and influences here, which only begin to reveal towards the end of the film, but the big ""reveal"" of who the Tall Man is and why they are gathering bodies is certainly not your typical horror story. It has much more in common with sci-fi.The movie has several things in its' favor that have made it so loved by horror audiences, not the least of which is Angus Scrimm as The Tall Man, the movie's iconic villain. He has that old guy creepiness that works so well in a horror role, mixed with physical attributes that made him imposing. Let's not forget that voice, too, as he utters those classic lines....""Booooyyyy"". He has an arsenal of weapons at his disposal, as well. We have the human familiar with almost traps our young hero in the crypt, another creepy old guy. There is the slut with the stiletto, who may or may not also be The Tall Man. A well-endowed young woman who lures men, siren-like, to their deaths in the graveyard. There are the evil Jawas, dwarf minions who always seem right around the corner. Then, of course, there is the ball of death, the orb that is so familiar as a part of this movie. It was originally given an X-rating because the orb scene was considered to be so gory and violent that they couldn't pass it with an R. Of course, now it look a little silly, but if you can let your imagination do a little work, it is still a frightening scene.The biggest thing going for this movie is that it has creativity in spades. I can't imagine sitting down to write this story. There are so many ideas here and plot strands going all over the place that someone's creativity was clearly running wild. That is, also, one of the weaknesses of the movie, though. The plot is all over the place. There is, at times, just far too much going on and some of it makes little to no sense. It feels like this could have been tightened into a masterpiece by eliminating one or two elements to bring more detail to the best ones, but part of its' charm is that ""all over the place"" feel.Know that this is low budget before you go in. The acting is very limited. The effects look like a high school AV club did them. One of our main heroes is a middle aged guy with a ""skullet"" who drives a 50s looking ice cream truck and wears silly bowties, all while playing a mean acoustic guitar. I don't, personally, hold any of that against this movie, but I know that there are plenty of millennials out there who will look at this and scoff, robbing themselves of the experience of seeing the type of movie that formulated your modern horror scene.The movie has spawned four sequels, to date, and the orb and Tall Man have become iconic. It may not be on anyone's Top Ten list of horror, but I think you would find that it's on a lot of Top 100 lists and that's nothing to scoff at, either.",Phantasm

But this is no arthouse affair, as the plot follows a more typical b-movie structure, making for an easy to follow smooth ride.

109,happyendingrocks,Like taking an acid trip at a graveyard,8,7 October 2009,"Don Coscarelli's defining film-making statement is unquestionably one of the trippiest, most inventive and startlingly original horror films of all time. While the plot is often incomprehensible, and the happenings are rarely clearly defined as true events or the product of a nightmare, the sum total of Phantasm is an unforgettable experience that very few films in the genre come close to rivaling.Angus Scrimm's unnamed Tall Man is one of the most iconic figures in horror history, and his imposing presence is enough to generate most of the film's scares on its own. Of course, he gets plenty of help from a horde of hooded dwarfs and a mysterious flying sphere that burrows into the forehead of its unsuspecting victims and spews out their blood and brains like a guignol geyser. If that's not enough, the fact that the bulk of the film is set in a sprawling mausoleum with seemingly endless marble corridors, which houses a gateway to another world no less, should be sufficient for Coscarelli to tap into some source of dread within you.Fans of Dario Argento should notice some obvious admiration on the part of Coscarelli, particularly in some of the camera-work and neo-psychedelic imagery. However, while Coscarelli takes obvious cues from the godfather of giallo, Phantasm's auteur uses these tools for devices entirely his own. Indeed, this film's highly-stylized approach and disorienting cuts seem to invite the viewer to be confused. But this confusion is an unsettling one, and it's more likely that Coscarelli was aiming to make this dark head-trip as jarring and incoherent as it often is. While you may not understand exactly what's going on at any given moment, the film sustains its morbid atmosphere so effectively that you won't be able to take your eyes off of the train wreck.The understated score is one of the best of all time, channeling the minimalism of John Carpenter's superlative music in Halloween through a filter of the avant-garde progressive rock favored by Goblin, Dario Argento's go-to music source. Musical score is a sometimes-overlooked component in many films, but in the horror genre especially, the sounds that frame the images are often as important to the foreboding tone as the visceral horror that accompanies them. You won't find better examples than in this film, where a seemingly benign shot like The Tall Man walking down the street becomes a vortex of grim foreshadowing, indelibly augmented by the music that follows him.The film utilizes very little splatter to serve the horror, but the few bits here are truly memorable and unsettling, such as the afore-mentioned gore-geyser. However, somehow the sight of Scrimm's egg-yolk-yellow blood is far more effective than gallons of the red sauce, so the film manages its fair share of wet-work despite the obvious emphasis on mood and suspense over slice and dice.In keeping with its experimental leanings, it's fitting that Phantasm doesn't come to a logical conclusion, and in many ways, the appearance of the Tall Man at the film's denouement with his infamous bellowed ""Boy!"" leads us to believe that this movie ends somewhere in the middle of the story rather than the finale. With so many intriguing ideas here ripe for exploration, it's actually rather strange that Phantasm only spawned three sequels. I must admit, I only saw two of those, and I barely remember them at this point, but I'm fairly certain I don't have answers to all the questions that arose while I revisited this classic original.Perhaps that's the key to Phantasm's chilling aftermath: it introduces us to a series of unexplained supernatural occurrences and forces us to accept them without the levity of understanding. The film itself is only a snapshot of the greater horror, so when we invest our imaginations in the happenings at Morningside Cemetery, we have to conclude that there are more malevolent evils at play there than what we have been privy to through the eyes of our characters.Whether or not you will be satisfied by the tantalizing glimpse the film provides, there is no denying the pure power of the film's unique and obtuse approach to horror. There has never been another film like Phantasm, before or since, and for that reason alone it is mandatory viewing for anyone who considers themselves even a casual connoisseur of horror cinema.If you need a reason other than that, I'll offer you a simple one: this movie is freaking awesome.",Phantasm
110,meathookcinema,An underrated 70's horror masterpiece,10,1 November 2017,"I first heard of Phantasm when its sequel came out. Barry Norman reviewed it and admitted that he hadn't even heard of the first film. Neither had I.Fortunately my sister in law had a friend who had closed down their video business and so gave her a lot of the videos he used to rent out. She lent me two films that could be classed as life- changing. One was The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The other was Phantasm.The film starts off like standard horror fare- sinister goings on at a small town American mortuary. But then the film starts to get more and more surreal. Its like a lot of the film inhabits a dark dream-like world.Check out the scene where the lead character goes to see a local seer. Add to that the chase scene in which Michael chops off The Tall Man's fingers and takes one home. This film is most famous for the flying silver spheres within the funeral home. These spheres certainly don't disappoint.And then there's the soundtrack which fluctuates between gritty analogue synths of doom and funereal organs. I found the soundtrack on CD and within the sale section of a local and long gone record store. One of the best purchases I've ever parted money for.Angus Scrimm as The Tall Man deserves recognition as one of the scariest and most sinister baddies of all time. Hes unrelenting, otherworldly and the inhabitant of many viewers nightmares.This film was remastered and released at cinemas across America last year.

The effects are good (for a low budget production), the sets are nice, the music is decent and the cinematography is often really good.Its not your typical horror movie and part of that has to be with the fact that its a really personal movie for the director who made it with care and love under many limitations, I can certainly respect that.A bit dull at times but I will recommend it, it has enough positive elements to say that its worth watching even if its really cheesy at times and a bit slow.

You are chased by killer metal spheres, what appear to be Jawas and have a fabulous score by Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrove. Now I say what appear to be Jawas, but if I am not mistaken this film was not inspired by STAR WARS as I believe it was written before George Lucas' sci-fi epic was released. In turn though Captain Phasma from later STAR WARS entries was influenced by the silver spheres from this film. The big references though were Ray Bradbury's 'Something Wicked Comes This Way' and Frank Herbert's 'Dune'. The Tall Man to me really is one of the best bad ass villains in horror history. As well A. Michael Baldwin who plays Michael really does a great job in the role. For it is he and Angus Scrimm who carry this film from beginning to end.

Presumably, the same criteria that a film in any other genre must meet to be considered a classic are applicable to horror movies, too: things like plot, characterization and atmosphere. ""Phantasm"" has none of these. It's just a patchwork quilt of visuals, a ninety-minute-long exercise in throwing nutty, surreal images at the wall to see what sticks. This gimmicky onslaught is accompanied by poor acting, crummy dialogue and lots of screaming (because, you know, it's a horror movie). But why are all these strange things happening to the characters? Why have Angus Scrimm and his army of dwarf slaves singled out these young men? Why is a shiny metallic ball equipped with multi-pronged blades hurtling through the corridors of the mortuary? Well, just because. It's like a story that one twelve-year-old kid might tell another, making it up as he goes along: ""So there were these guys, and one day some really scary stuff went down.""

115,RockPortReview,The Tall Man Cometh!,8,3 January 2010,"Phantasm 12/26/2009Two classic icons of horror came out of this movie made by Don Coscarelli in 1979, The Tall Man and the Silver Sphere. These two elements helped spawn three sequels, all of which were directed by Coscarelli. This is a fun scary ride of a movie that can be extremely weird at times. This first installment was filmed on a shoestring budget but all of the effects, story, and acting don't seem to suffer much from it.Like ""Carriers"" the last movie I reviewed, the story follows the relationship of two brothers. Jody is the older of the two and is now stuck raising his 13 year old brother Mike after their parents' death. I've got to say that Mike is quite possibly the coolest bad ass kid ever. If I was a little older in the early 80's he would be the kid you would dream of imitating. He owns a dirt bike; has a big knife strapped to his ankle, wears a jean jacket and has quite the dirty mouth. Not to mention the chrome .45 he wields towards the end. Mike is tough kid but also fears of being abandon by his brother. The one thing that keeps them together is their love for Jody's muscle car.At the funeral of one of Jody's friends we are introduced to the mortician simply known as the Tall Man played brilliantly by Angus Scrim (who also appears in the sequels). He is the creepy embodiment of death and as Mike finds out there is something not right with him. We then meet Jody's other friend Reggie, an ice cream truck drive and aspiring musician. I know it's quite the combo. Reggie always to just be along for the ride, but is a very necessary character. Mike is always following his brother to make sure he doesn't leave him. Jody then hooks up with this bar skank and they go into the cemetery to make out. While Mike is looking on in the woods he is attacked by a dwarf in a brown robe. Rumor has it that George Lucas stole this idea for his design of the Jawa's. Mike runs away screaming and Jody follows him. Mike tells him what he saw in the woods and about the Tall Man, but Jody doesn't believe him.Mike wanders off to the mortuary and breaks in through a basement window. After he is found out, he is pursued by a flying metal sphere. It ejects blades that hooks on to your face and drills through your skull. The sphere and the dwarfs make this movie so WTF it makes it really fun to watch. There are a bunch of cheesy scenes with a lot of bad dialogue but the creative story line makes up for it. Jody finally comes around to believing Mike and they go together to the mortuary too face the Tall Man and his minions of evil. There is a big twist ending that I won't give away, that really makes the story make sense in a crazy sort of way. A new DVD edition of the movie was released in 2007 and includes a bunch of special features that are all quite good. This movie is quite an accomplishment in the fact that you would never believe its was made on such a small budget, all of the money is definitely up on the screen and not the actors pockets.",Phantasm

Utilizing much the same story, budget and Z-movie trimmings as Ed Wood's best-known film, PHANTASM is eminently watchable trash.

Plus Angus Scrimm as Tor Johnson.It says something about the acid generation that while PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE was a dismal box office failure in 1959, twenty years later PHANTASM was popular enough to achieve international release, spawn at least four sequels, and launch the career of questionable auteur Don Coscarelli.

117,freaky_dave,A very imaginative movie with some disturbing images and characters,7,27 February 2006,"Phantasm was a very effective horror movie that was made on a shoestring budget. Don Cascarelli, who wrote, directed, and produced the movie used a lot of camera angles, eerie scenes, and moody atmosphere to make even the worst special effects seem scary. The movie also contains one of the best musical scores for a horror movie, and this makes the movie even more disturbing than what it already was.Young Mike Pearson (Michael Baldwin) watches a funeral from a distance involving his brother's friend. His brother Jody (Bill Thornberry) had decided that it probably was best for Mike to stay home since he thinks it would be too much for his young brother to witness. After all, their parents had died recently, and Jody just thought that seeing another funeral so soon after their parents deaths might just put his brother over the edge.Long after the funeral is over, little Mike stays to witness something unnatural involving the caretaker (Angus Scrimm) who is soon dubbed only the Tall Man. He decides that something just isn't right about the caretaker or the cemetery, so he decides to investigate, and becomes involved in something completely sinister and out of the ordinary. He soon find himself haunted by little trolls in robes as well as the spooky Tall Man who soon becomes a part of his life.Not long after he manages to get his brother involved as well as their other friend Reggie (Reggie Bannister). Together they make a startling discovery about the Tall Man and what he is doing with the recently deceased that proves to be horrifying and surreal at the same time.Cleverly made and filled with disturbing images which include flying silver spheres that do very nasty things to the human skull, Phantasm proved to be imaginative and spooky on many levels. It is known as a classic by many, but I can't quite put it there. The movie, as good as it is, still includes some very bad dialogue. It doesn't help that its two leads aren't very good actors either. Still Phantasm is a clever film and definitely a labor of love for its director. It may not be quite up there with horror movie classics like Halloween, Alien, Jaws and Psycho, but it is definitely worth your while if you enjoy horror movies.I almost forgot to mention that the Phantasm story is no ordinary horror movie cliché. It has a moral which involves losing loved ones and not being able to let go. It also involves fighting your fears and never giving in.",Phantasm

It's supernatural, it's edgy and it's also very dark and grainy, both in picture quality and mood! What they don't tell you is how this movie basically comes off as a long, elaborate crack fantasy, filled with bright lights, magic and...well, yellow mustard blood. But it is pretty creepy at times, with decent performances from all the actors for their respective genre and some very good atmospheric moments, like pretty much every time you see the Tall Man.And speaking of Angus Scrimm, he is damned creepy here. Seriously, you would be running and screaming too if you saw this guy running after you. That's right, running. He puts the typical laughable horror stereotype of walking serial killers catching their sprinting victims down with ease. Great performance.Phantasm doesn't make much sense, and it is pretty thin at times in terms of plot, but it is a fun watch, and essential if you're a B-horror fan.

125,macabro357,The Chrome Sphere is 70s classic,7,7 November 2003,"There are two things that stand out in this film. The Tall Man (played by Angus Scrimm) and the chrome sphere with hook-like blades that stick out of it. Those are the two main elements when it comes to this horror series directed by Don Coscarelli. The Tall Man comes from another dimension where he takes some of the earth's dead back to his home planet, reincarnates them and turns them into slaves for his world. He even occasionally murders some earth people in order to speed things up. Why wait for them to get old and die natural deaths. That would take too much time, right? And what better earth profession he can hide his identity behind than that of a funeral parlor director. Everything goes smoothly for the Tall Man until Mike Pearson (Michael Baldwin) witnesses him carting a body away that's supposed to be buried in the ground. At first his brother Jody (Bill Thornbury) doesn't believe him, but when Mike shows him a cut-off finger surrounded by 'yellow blood' in a little wooden box he had saved as proof, Jody starts to believe him. Excellent scene of the chrome sphere zooming down the funeral parlor hallway and 'accidentally' digging into the skull one of the Tall Man's henchmen. A little screw appears out of it and starts to bore a hole through his skull, ejecting the excess blood out a hole in the back of the sphere. I wish there was more of the sphere although we'll get to see a lot more of it again in PHANTASM II (1988). I also like the portal gateway scene where if you go through the two chrome poles, you'll get to see the Tall Man's alternative universe where the slaves are busy carrying caskets down a stone pathway. We even get to see Ice Cream Man, Reggie Bannister almost get sucked through it as well. I won't give away the ending but let's just say the Tall Man is temporarily disposed of until the next sequel comes out, although the dream element that's supposed to encompass the whole sequence of events in the film, is a big negative against it. In fact, it brings it down a notch, unfortunately. Even so, I consider PHANTASM to be one of the best horror films of the 1970s. It managed to keep Avco/Embassy in business so they could bring us later horror stuff like ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (1980); THE FOG (1980) and DEAD AND BURIED (1981) The MGM DVD also has a lot more extras on it than you would expect from other DVDs released by the same company, including 8mm behind-the-scenes footage of the making of PHANTASM; a 1979 interview down in Miami with director Coscarelli and Angus Scrimm; an appearance at a 1989 Fangoria convention by Scrimm, and movie & TV trailers for the film.

127,Chromium_5,It grows on you...,7,21 June 2003,"Very rarely do I completely change my mind on a movie, but that is the case with ""Phantasm."" I wrote my very first IMDb review on this movie, and at the time, I hated it. I had never seen anything quite like it before, and I was put off the weirdness. But the thing is, it's inspired weirdness, and now that I think about it, a movie where the ending twist involves people being sucked into another dimension through a giant guitar tuner deserves some kind of AFI award just for being so damn creative. I think the movie's genius is that it plays on a somewhat childish fear that many people have, but hate to admit: funeral homes. This movie is intended for everyone who feels an uncomfortable, ominous atmosphere in funeral homes and cemeteries, and serves as a terrifying (and hopefully fictional) expose of just what goes on back there after dark. Yes, the movie is full of incoherent nonsense involving flying metal spheres and little demonic creatures, and some of it is unintentionally hilarious (I still think the scene with the giant fly is one of the funniest things I've ever seen), but it is a Phantasm, after all: it's not supposed to make sense. It's supposed to confuse you, shock you, and unnerve you, and it sure delivers. The fact that I just can't forget this movie, even after hating it the first time I saw it, is proof of how unique it is. Out of all the hundreds of horror movies out there, this one is more memorable--and downright cool--than most.7/10 stars, highly recommended.",Phantasm
128,MooCowMo,Ummm...heh?? :=8/,6,1 March 2000,"Um, ok. Well.

Oh, and also, there's this shiny metal sphere that flies around and drills into people's heads & shoots out all their blood. And, then tall guy(Angus Scrimm)dies, but he comes back all the time, but sometimes he's a blonde woman in lavender with too much blue eye shadow, and if his fingers get chopped off they spurt yellow goo and turn into large, plastic flies that have to get chummed in the garbage disposal(I do hope yer taking all this down...). Rytalin-deprived Mikey, who can never just stay in his room, follows his brother Jody everywhere, even though he already died but can still sing cheesy 70's am-style guitar rock, and Mikey drives and works on a car and shoots guns, even though he's only 13, and he's just like the hero in ""Dune"" because he has to conquer his fear, according to the mute, all-powerful gypsy who makes black boxes appear and disappear at will. Mikey is upset because his father is dead, even though is casket is empty, and later it turns out that his father is really an ice cream man, who kind of dies, but then really doesn't, and he can sing cheesy 70's am guitar rock just like Jody, who really died in a car wreck & didn't really make the tall guy fall in a square hole & fill it up with styrofoam boulders.

129,Minus_The_Beer,"""BOYYYYY!"" This Movie is Great.",9,23 April 2012,"When writer/director/producer/editor Don Coscarelli made a little film by the name of ""Phantasm"" in the late '70s, little did he realize that he was creating a cult-classic, let alone one that would spawn a series which would endure for multiple decades. Somehow, with a minimal budget of $300,000, Coscarelli managed to make the wildly imaginative film stand out from other films at the time while at the same time holding up over the years. The film is a true testament to the power of independent horror films and what happens when a creative mind is allowed to run free. Studio executives who don't know how to bank on anything other than remakes and sequels should really watch the film and take notes.Mike and his older brother Jody are left to fend for themselves in the wake of their parents' passing, which puts a particular strain on Mike who has a nagging fear of separation. His instincts are correct, as Jody plans on sending him away to live with his aunt so he can perhaps have more time to play guitar on his porch with the local ice cream man, Reggie. Such fears are cast aside quickly, however, when it is discovered that the mysterious Tall Man at the local cemetery is repurposing dead bodies as dwarf slaves in an effort to take over the world. ""Huh?"" You may say. ""Huh?"" is right.While it certainly isn't a film for everyone, ""Phantasm"" gets by with enough bizarre visuals, jarring violence and broad concepts to reel in even the most cynical of horror fans. It also helps that the film is packed with lovable characters brought to life by charming actors. Michael Baldwin (of no relation to 30 Rock's Alec Baldwin) plays the young Mike Pearson, while Reggie Bannister (who could pass as a doppelganger for 30 Rock's Scott Adsit) plays Reggie the ice cream man. Likewise, Bill Thornbury (Sorry, 30 Rock reference not found, please try again later) brings big brother Jody to life with a likable quality that almost makes you forget you're watching characters in a movie. Then of course there's the great Angus Scrimm as the Tall Man. This single bit of casting almost serves as the linchpin of the whole film. Scrimm's stage presence combined with his uber-creepy vibe is a big part of what makes ""Phantasm"" work.Like something straight out of a dream journal, ""Phantasm"" is completely out of this world and off-the-wall. Despite its lofty ambitions, the film works. Not only is it as creepy as anything you'll see, it's also gruesome and genuinely tense. This is of course balanced well with its characters who you will certainly want to follow in the adventures of the next three films (here's hoping for a ""Phantasm V"" while everyone's still young). It's a film that works on multiple levels and as time goes on, it seems to be holding up even better than before. ""Phantasm"" isn't a nightmare so much as it is a dream come true.",Phantasm
130,DanLives1980,A young boy is plagued by the nightmarish presence of the mysterious Tall Man after the death of one of his brothers,8,6 April 2012,"When you want to name the most memorable classic 70's horror films your first mentions are most likely Halloween, The Exorcist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Dawn of the Dead; so notorious have these films become since their release.What isn't so often named are the intended classics that weren't as gruesome or shocking but are classed as B-Movies nonetheless. Phantasm is one such classic that was neither recognised by the mainstream nor accepted as a B-Movie because it was simply too well made to really be loved as a cheap and tacky horror.Young director Don Coscarelli directed this family affair of a small but well made and enjoyable horror aimed at the ghosts and ghouls genre made so memorable by the Hammer House Of Horror label in the 60's, this time based in leafy green small town America.Mikey is just a lonely kid with no other boys to play with. Saddened by the loss of his parents, he lives with his older brother Jody, who is conflicted by his need to leave town and find his own peace. So Mikey spends his time drifting around town, following his young curiosity wherever it leads him.When one of his older brothers is found dead, he comes across the ancient and undead looking mortician after the funeral and witnesses something he shouldn't. As Jody and his friend Reggie go about their lives, Mikey finds his curiosity getting the better of him again and finds himself not only pursued by ""The Tall Man"", but by the creatures of the night under his very command. It isn't long before Jody and Reggie are drawn into the strange goings on and discover that the whole town is in danger of becoming premature residents of the local mausoleum.What works so well in this film is what I call the ""Goonies Factor!"" The typical childhood adventure in quiet and what most city dwellers would call idyllic small town America, fraught with danger and all the inventive ways kids will create to get out of trouble. It's all here. Mikey's got his own motorbike already, his brother's a loner musician who drives a black Plymouth Hemi-Cuda. Then Reggie's a guitarist/ice cream man whose reaction to everything is either absurdly dim or just comical. You can't not like or even love the characters.The Tall Man, played by Angus Scrimm who became a legend for this role although he's a well respected classical actor, is one of the freakiest horror film villains to never need a mask of any sort. Referring to Hammer Horror again, he has that unique charm and gift for character acting the same Christopher Lee has. It's refreshing even now to see an American film pull off an English formula successfully and few horrors have followed in Phantasm's success as a perfect all round horror. hell, not even the sequels until number four pulled that off.Fred Myrow created an amazing theme tune for Phantasm that resonated chimes of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells and gave the film more of an anthem than just a theme. The music's success alone went on to influence others such as John Carpenter and even death metal outfit Entombed recreated it as a song of their own titled The Left Hand Path.Other than the typical achievements of the film's production such as first time actors being able to act, the film counted on good old fashioned special effects tricks you can laugh at and then some that seemed revolutionary such as the flying silver spheres that drill holes in your skull and blend your brains and squirt them out all over the floor.If you want a classic horror film night for Halloween or just a regular Saturday night at home, get this and settle down for one of the more enjoyable rather than disturbing horrors!",Phantasm
131,HaddonfieldJason,"A very creepy,and imaginative horror film",8,20 February 2005,"Phantasm is one of the most creative horror films from the late 70's/80's.From the imagination of Don Coscarelli,it doesn't play like a slasher film,it's a lot more clever.The setting of the horror is a Funeral home/Cemetery.A smart move,people fear funeral homes/graveyards because they associate them with death.I'd say it a cemetery is a smart place to set a horror film,because we fear it to begin with.The plot is about a boy named Mike,who lives with his brother Jody,they have a friend named Reggie who is an ice cream driver.Mike/Jody/Reggie are the main characters of the film.Their friend is killed in the cemetery.They bury him in the cemetery.Mike hides in the bushes,and sees the funeral home director known as The Tall Man,take the casket.He suspects something is wrong.Mike doesn't hesitate to investigate the cemetery.He sneaks into the mausoleum,where a flying sphere nearly kills him.The Tall Man attacks him,and he cuts off The Tall Man's fingers.Yet the finger still moves,he locks it in a box,and shows it to Jody.Jody decides that they have to investigate.They encounter dwarf slaves,they look like Jawas on film,but I'll forgive Don,because of the low budget.These Dwarf slaves are actually the corpses of the dead of the town.They bring Reggie in on it,and decide they have to find and kill The Tall Man.Phantasm is a great horror movie.It is fun,and a lot more clever than others.Don Coscarelli is a gifted film maker,he makes great horror films on low budgets.I checked Phantasm out because of his recent Bubba Ho-Tep which was great,and because a teacher at school who I talk to about horror films loved it.I'm glad I did see Phantasm,it was a great horror movie.",Phantasm

It is hilarious to me to see how self-important some guys become after cranking out two or three movies that are total wastes of time.This movie is vastly overrated.After you see it you'll wonder just how much validity you can give some of the reviewers at this website who all seem to praise this mess.At the time of this review this movie was rated a 6.6 in here.Unbelievable!Certainly you can find a lot worse horror movies to watch but you probably won't find one in which so much praise has been heaped on so much of nothing.",Phantasm

Then shortly after that we have the Tommys funeral and the Tall man single handed picks up his coffin and puts it into the back of the hearse !. Now Tommy has a younger brother (Mike) who visits and old woman who one could guess is a fortune teller and her granddaughter for some bizarre short sequence which to me seems totally irrelevant to the plot of the movie. This movie was obviously shot on a very low budget as the film seems to only revolve around a couple of locations and I guess most of this was wasted on the sphere that takes out the caretaker who is another character shoed in for no rhyme or reason. The upshot is this, humans are murdered for their bodies and converted into dwarfs so they can be used as slaves in another dimension and the mauseoleum is the gateway to this other dimension.

135,thelastblogontheleft,Low Budget Classic,8,28 December 2016,"I knew from the very first scene that I would love this movie, and I was totally right. Mike (played by A. Michael Baldwin) is still processing through the grief of losing his parents. He lives alone with his older brother, Jody (played by Bill Thornbury), who is growing a bit weary at his clinging and neediness. When Mike goes against Jody's request and spies on the funeral of a friend of theirs, he becomes suspicious of the undertaker — only known as the Tall Man (played by Angus Scrimm) — and what his motives really are. The rest of the movie unravels into delightful chaos — a bit disjointed at times, totally, but with some absolute gems, too.It's worth noting that the director, Don Coscarelli, not only wrote, directed, photographed, co-produced, AND edited this film, but he did so on a budget of around $300,000 (all privately funded). He was literally renting equipment just for the weekends, which dragged the filming process out to a full year. His father helped fund the movie, his mother designed some of the special effects and costumes, and the cast — unsurprisingly — was comprised of friends and aspiring professionals. They worked scene by scene and much of the script was improvised. But oh man, for what it lacks in cohesion and solid acting it makes up for in charm, creepiness, and some really awesome gore.It's an endearing story to begin with — two brothers just trying to make it through life alone after a tragic loss. Mike justifiably worried that Jody will leave him to retain some independence and freedom. And the naturally undeniable curiosity that comes from being a young teen — the only explanation for him busting a basement window at the funeral home to investigate further when most of us would have run for the hills after seeing the Tall Man.The scene where Mike slams the hand of his pursuer in the heavy metal door and yellow blood comes spurting out awesome. The fact that he makes sure to take that finger home to convince his skeptical brother that he is, in fact, seeing some crazy things even more awesome. And then you see the first glimpse of the Sentinels — the metallic orbs that latch onto your head and pump your blood out — and you're a fan for life (if you're anything like me, that is).Ultimately, the Tall Man is one of the creepiest goddamn villains I've seen in anything. He's just got this air about him that makes your blood run cold. I could relate deeply to the scene where Mike sees him out on the street and presses himself hard against the wall behind him in a vain effort to escape the mere sight of him from a distance. The fact that he is meant to represent death — and the morbid but honest idea that we can only escape it in our dreams — just makes him even more awesome.",Phantasm

It feels as if we are sliding down a water slide of unreality's. This film has atmospheric score of the unimaginable. Phantasm delivers us an onslaught of a very lonely world where we see a family that has been dealing with their parents death.Then we set our sights upon the ""TALL MAN"" we know nothing of this character except for the fact that he is very strong and conniving, he seems to be a reflection of the so called Grimm Reaper, but not from this planet, he uses the dead for his own purposes, and to this day we don't know why, he seems to have super powers that are to the most extreme.Phantasm gives us a glimpse of a reality we are unsure of, even when we have it all figured out, the ending still leaves us questioning our logic. This film is a cult classic for a reason. My point being is the fact that it makes us feel alone, the characters are believable, and the score is haunting. This film makes me feel unsure of my surroundings every time I watch it, of what is real and what is not real.I enjoy this film every time I put it in my DVD player and never get tired of it. Phantasm seems to be timeless, even though some of the effects look cheap in certain points of the film, but overall I highly recommend this film to any fan of sci-fi or of the horror genre.PHANTASM is a masterpiece of scifi-horror, and deserves every star that I gave it, 9/10 for me.",Phantasm
138,MovieLuvaMatt,Way overrated,3,8 January 2004,"Why this so-called horror flick was such a big hit--I don't have a clue!!  I only got a few thrills and definitely didn't get any scares.  Not to mention the acting is atrocious!  I didn't care for these bland characters at all! Angus Scrimm, who plays the Tall Man, is the only actor of any merit despite the fact that his part is small and he has few lines of dialogue.  I found it hilarious that the director kept on raving about the actors' performances throughout the DVD commentary.  Scrimm obviously had theater training, while the rest are obviously non-actors.  It's no wonder that I checked the actors' filmographies and their only credits were in direct-to-video schlock flicks and the ""Phantasm"" sequels--some of which probably fall into that category.  The film looks highly dated, from the bellbottom jeans to the nauseatingly bad hairstyles.  I enjoy the theme song, which actually does sound creepy, but the rest of the score is pretty awful.  The plot didn't hold my interest for one second, and ends with a huge cop-out.  ""Phantasm"" is definitely not a horror classic!My score:  3 (out of 10)",Phantasm
139,Phantasm01,My favorite horror film of all time!,10,9 May 2006,"Sure, ""Phantasm"" is about as low budget as you can get, even for a horror film, but the amazing thing about this movie is that a lack of funds did not hurt it at all. In fact, some of the plot holes that a bigger budget would have filled in actually work in the movie's favor. By not really understanding who the Tall Man is or why he does what he does, ""Phantasm"" assumes enigmatic dimensions that practically beg for explanation through further sequels. Coscarelli, who I think is planning yet another sequel in this franchise, has also made a few other films over the years: the recent ""Bubba Ho-tep"" and the ubiquitous cable favorite ""The Beastmaster"" are the most memorable.Reggie, Jody, and Jody's younger brother Mike soon learn strange things are afoot at the Morningside Funeral Home. After a funeral service for a friend of Reggie and Jody, Mike sees the eerie undertaker at the funeral home heave a three hundred pound casket in the back of a hearse all by himself. Intrigued, Mike begins to investigate the funeral home and this puzzling figure, fondly known to fans of the series as the Tall Man, and unearths a whole heap of weirdness. Before long Jody and Reggie get caught up in the madness of the Tall Man's world. What they discover behind the walls of the funeral home is a nightmare of endless dangers: twisted, angry little creatures clad in robes, a portal to another dimension, and small flying spheres that seek out human flesh with disastrous and bloody results. As the three attempt to put together the odd pieces of this puzzle, the Tall Man and his minions always lurk in the background ready to do serious bodily injury to the interlopers. What Reggie, Mike, and Jody discover is hardly reassuring: the Tall Man is some sort of other dimensional being roaming our world in search of corpses. He then reanimates the bodies and transforms them into stunted little creatures so he can transport them into his dimension. Why does he do this? Who knows, but it is fun watching our three heroes battle the Tall Man in this film and the subsequent sequels.One of the best elements of ""Phantasm"" is the characters. You have the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), a lumbering giant of a man dressed all in black and sporting a perpetual scowl. He delivers his lines, of which there are few in this movie but more in subsequent films, in a growling tone full of dark menace. Scrimm is creepy as the Tall Man, and I think this character may well be one of my favorite horror film bad guys. The actors who play Reggie, Jody, and Mike appear in all of the sequels (with a minor switch in two), an important continuity because it gives the ""Phantasm"" franchise a real ""contained universe"" feel lacking in most horror series. It was fun for me to watch the original film after seeing the later sequels because the guys are so much younger here. Jody sports a '70's coif that would do Starsky and Hutch proud, and Reggie looks so young that it is almost frightening.""Phantasm"" films always contain elements that make for a great, downbeat atmosphere. The music is absolutely fantastic, and if I had to compare the background beats of ""Phantasm"" with the sound of another horror film it would have to be something along the lines of Kubrick's ""The Shining."" The movie sounds creepy, and when matched with the mostly shot at night scenes and the wickedly gory rampages of those metallic spheres, the whole film takes on a most memorable feel. Coscarelli does not rely solely on gripping horror, however, as there are many humorous scenes throughout the film. The scene where Mike and Jody do battle with the severed finger is one of the funniest I have seen in a horror movie. Even the fake looking bug and the gruesome little minions of the Tall Man are amusing in their own right.If you want to buy just one DVD because of the extras, you should get Phantasm if you can track down a copy(it's gone OOP now). I couldn't believe how much stuff they packed on one disc! You get lengthy deleted scenes, a commentary with Coscarelli and the film's actors, a long interview with Coscarelli and Angus Scrimm made years ago with some film professor, a short film of an appearance Angus Scrimm made at a horror convention, trailers, a disco version of the theme song (!), poster and lobby card pictures, a kooky promotional ad made by Angus Scrimm for the Australian market, and a widescreen picture transfer. I especially enjoyed the footage of Scrimm speaking at a horror film convention. Even though it was a bit corny, he quickly ran through all of the lines the Tall Man said in the ""Phantasm"" films, and since most of his dialogue in these movies is so memorable it was great to hear him say them in character. Overall, it felt like it took longer to view all of the extras on this disc than it did to watch the film! If you haven't delved into the dark world of ""Phantasm,"" start here and rapidly move on to the excellent sequels.",Phantasm
140,Tender-Flesh,"Silver bells, silver bells",6,8 February 2009,"I mean, silver balls.... Yes, the ball is back. This film is so unusual that it could have only come from a dream, which is exactly where the director got the idea. Sometimes that's where the best ideas come from. This film has a few things going for it, which I'll mention before I harp on it.Angus Scrimm created a horror icon in the Tall Man. I prefer his character in Phantasm II to this film, but he still does a creepy fine job. Reggie Bannister as, well, Reggie, was lame in this movie, but he seemed much improved for the sequel. Still, I liked the character of Reggie in the movie, even if most of his lines were bad and weren't delivered well at all. The sweeping runs through the mortuary corridors were great, reminding me of One Dark Night(though Phantasm makes that film look like a school film class project). The silver ball had limited screen time, and one wishes the red POV would have gotten a little more presence in the film. I think the best thing about the movie is the plot. It's so different from anything else up to that point, you can't help but have some admiration for it and also wonder how the director sold the idea of this picture to get the funds. A possibly indestructible alien(?) and a league of undead dwarfs run a funeral home with a secret gateway inside that leads to another planet and possibly another dimension. The music was great. I think it owed a lot to some Italian horror soundtracks of the time, and is just as creepy as any tracks John Carpenter ever wrote. A very memorable theme.The ending of the film is the worst. It is slipshod and feels like it was tacked on. I know the original idea for the film had a runtime of close to 3 hours, but certainly more could have been done with the ending. Jody's fate seemed like an afterthought, and how much of the film was supposed to be real up until the ending? And, ewww, did both Tommy and Jody make out with the Tall Man and did Tommy have sex with him in the guise of that nasty beast of a girl with the horrid robin's-egg-blue eye shadow? Now, that is scary. Also, I hated the repeated shots of the funeral home exterior from the exact same angle in several shots. I'm not sure if they just kept recycling the footage of that shot or what, but it was annoying.The DVD includes a few deleted scenes, the best of which should have been left in the film. Within the mortuary, Mike and Jody encountered the Tall Man, with Jody unloading his pump shotgun into the weirdo, but having no effect, Jody and Mike get slapped around a bit. Mike remembered the Tall Man's aversion to cold and sprays him with the fire extinguisher with gooey results. That could have been left in the movie and still used the same ending to maintain the Tall Man's indestructible nature.I'm not a huge fan of the Phantasm series as a whole, I think III and IV are not that great. I love part II, which was actually the first of the series I ever saw(I can still remember seeing the great trailers on TV). The original is still pretty good, if you can overlook the bad editing, the often rancid acting and dialogue, and the insipid finale. You'll be hard-pressed to find much more original fare in terms of old horror. Maybe a remake would be better than a part V.",Phantasm
141,ropelawshiel,What is with the high ratings?,2,21 June 2020,"The actors appear to be the worst, it would be hard to try and act this badly. It makes Plan 9 From Outer Space seem an Oscar classic. The effects, well I have seen better at a primary school production, and the plot, just pointless. I remember seeing this when it came out 78/79 I think I had some memories of the film so thought I would give it another try. Even in 78/79 it must have seemed dated.This is so amaturish it beggers belief.Maybe I am missing something as so many reviwers have said it is great, I think rose tinted glasses are wrapped around there memories.

142,fairlesssam,Certainly a cult classic,4,3 June 2017,"A small town sees the arrival of the Tall Man, a mortician, who carries with him an air of mysterious evil. There are an increase of deaths in the town and it seems the Tall Man has something to do with it. Mike, a 13 year old boy follows his older brother Jody and his girlfriend into the cemetery at night and is frightened out of his wits by some kind of robed monster. This sparks off a journey into terror of which Mike could never have imagined.Phantasm is undeniably a cult classic. It is a strange film in the way that it has some fantastic, iconic moments yet is very shallow in script and direction/development of the story line. This is somehow echoed in the visuals when showing us the stark wasteland that is the alternate universe where the Tall Man is from. Dwarfs are enslaved, snaking across a desolate wasteland, which mirrors the emptiness of the script. This somehow feels fitting.For me I enjoyed the visuals of the Tall Man striding through the town, knowing he was being watched and stopping to stare back. As kids we all had a creepy person we were scared of but liked to watch from a distance and then run away if the person got wind of you. The Tall Man is the epitome of this. The silver orbs are fantastic, absolute class, I love everything about them. Got to be my favorite weapon of all time.This movie has an air of Stephen King about it which I say as a compliment. It's one of those films you watch and are not particularly impressed with at the time but it stays with you and plays out in your mind.Every horror freak must watch this franchise, be part of it and enjoy the honor of knowing the Tall Man.",Phantasm

The movie takes sooooo long to get going, and is dreadfully hard to follow.  Some of the scenes in this make no sense at all, like the brother and the ice-cream man playing guitar????????  And the cut off finger turning into a rabid over sized fly with gigantic teeth????  I mean, come on.  And, who in the hell would take a woman into a graveyard and have sex with her on top of a tombstone?  I have to admit, this movie is sh*t!!!  I love old horror movies, and have sit through some really weak ones, but this is one I had to fast forward to get through.  The acting, by the way, was dreadful also.  The only creepy thing in this movie was ""The Tall Man"", who morphs back and forth between a blonde woman who loves to have sex in a graveyard.  Silly!!

144,Blackace,A scary adventure into a world of horror make-believe.,7,2 October 1999,"Ok, so it's not The Exocist, but what movie is? Phantasm is a cult classic that was a lot scarier when it was first released back in 1979. By today standards, it wouldn't scare little Johnny Jeckle down the street. I liked it back in 1979 when I first saw it and had nightmares of someone pulling me through the closest door mirror. Phantasm II was actually better and it seems each movie ended with a chance for there to be a sequel. Even the incredibly lame and awful Phantasm IV: Oblivion left it open for a Phantasm V. Yes, the movie is cheesy and the special effects aren't anything great, but the whole story is so unique and creepy, that you have to love it. The acting is terrible of course, but that's what your going to get with a B style horror flick with unknown actors. The movie is still worth seeing at least once. Definitely watch with all the lights off and a girlfriend.

145,MWNiese,Premier 70's Horror,10,27 January 2008,"The premise of this movie surrounds the strange occurrences that Mike, a young man, starts to witness at a local mortuary. As Mike comes closer to discovering the truth about the goings-on at the Morningside Mortuary, his life is suddenly thrust into a nightmarish sequences of horrific events.This film is full of genuine scares, because the special effects are amazing considering the budget and year of release.The editing is intentionally fast paced and choppy, which almost makes this movie hard to keep up with at times. The musical score as amazingly haunting; it is a major component to this movie's success.I WOULD NOT recommend that people other than horror fans view this movie. The extreme violence and plot holes will turn off people that aren't true horror aficionados. · Editing is an integral component for Phantasm, as Coscarelli has flashbacks, flashes forwards, and dream/ nightmare sequences interwoven throughout the entire film. In fact many critics of the Phantasm film series argue that Coscarelli's screenplay causes confusion at times due to his editing techniques (Coscarelli is listed as the Editor for this film)· Indeed there is a purpose to the dream sequences and the flashes to and fro. The dream sequences show us the impending danger Mike is in and contain some of the major scares in the film. The flashes, to and fro, may cause confusion for the viewer not entirely tuned into the picture. But the flashes provide us with a sense of uncomfortably, fear, and a type of dreamy drug-like trance that transcends the picture effectively· The flashes and dreams provide critical plot details that help us piece together the Tall Man's intentions· Coscarelli also moves from one scene to the next with fast paced cuts. The fast cuts are also used in scenes to promote terror and provide excitement· The Tall Man, played by Scrimm, is filmed from lower angles. In reality Scrimm is 6 feet five inches tall, but we are given the feeling that he is about 7 feet tall· This film was a fairly low budget production that used nightmares, flashbacks, flash forwards, fast paced cuts and emotionally charged camera angles to provide fear and horror, without CGI.",Phantasm

The plot is simple, the tall man is robbing graves, and making dwarf slaves out of the bodies, and it's up to Mike, Jody, and Reggie to stop him! This is the best installment of the series, and there isn't too much gore in this one. The possible exception is when the ball kills the care taker, but that is pretty mild by today's standards, so I wouldn't recommend it to little kids, or the faint of heart. The tall man ranks as a true classic horror character, along with Dracula, and Freddie Kruger. Angus Scrimm is the modern day Bela Lugosi in the respect we will remember him for scaring the pants off of us by playing a true horror villain!!",Phantasm

It's creative and unique and I really enjoyed it because of that. You just feel like there's an entire world waiting to be discovered while watching this movie, and you can't wait to explore it.There are a lot of things that were really great in this movie like our main villain, the mysterious ""Tall Man"". The way he walks, talks, chases his victims, it's all really effective. I also really like the floating spheres as a weapon, because it's truly an original weapon. There's also some good comedy in this movie that I didn't expect, and it's not like it changes the tone of the film, it just adds to the entertainment factor. And finally the music used for this film (by Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave) is just fantastic and instantaneously iconic.Now there are a couple of things here that I didn't really like, so I'll just say them pretty quick:Some of the acting isn't great, some editing feels odd and doesn't make a lot of sense and finally some of the camerawork isn't fantastic.

Monstrous hooded dwarfs that attack in darkness. A beautiful lady in a lavender dress equipped with a knife. A scowling, menacing middle-aged man that towers over you. These are all classic elements of Don Coscarelli's highly bizarre but wildly creepy 1979 horror film ""Phantasm"". I just recently revisited the movie after a long time, and was easily reminded of how undeniably scary it is.13-year-old Michael Pearson spies on his brother Jody and his best friend Reggie, an ice cream vendor, as they lay their friend Tommy to rest in Morningside Cemetery after he supposedly committed suicide. But Mike sees too much when he catches a glimpse of a tall man in a black suit picking up Tommy's coffin with intimidating super-strength, throwing it in his hearse, and driving away. When things take a turn for the worse, Jody unfortunately doesn't believe his brother. Until he and Reggie become involved in this puzzling and dangerous game of where reality is broken and the dream becomes real. And The Tall Man has insidious plans for our three protagonists.""Phantasm"" is truly a product of its time, a horror flick that was released in the wake of ""Halloween,"" ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and others. Director Coscarelli found the inspiration to scare the audience in his dreams and his previous drama ""Kenny and Company"". And he manages to scare us immensely by employing a strange and dread-filled atmosphere with surreal and dream-like imagery. Right from the opening sequence, Coscarelli establishes a bleak environment.The film has some goofy effects by today's standards and some bad acting, but deep within its cheesy but inventive execution lies a fear that hits home for all of us: fear of dying. Most of us believe in Heaven or Hell. Others believe that when we die, we are nothing. ""Phantasm"" comes up with something different, a fate far worse than death. Not much of the movie makes sense, but is it supposed to? Perhaps not. And once the film ends, we are left with food for thought. Is there really a Heaven or Hell? Does The Tall Man represent the Grim Reaper or the Devil? Those who haven't seen ""Phantasm"" would laugh at such remarks, but once you watch it, you realize that Coscarelli, who not only directed the movie but also wrote and edited it, focuses on something we can be genuinely afraid of.The Tall Man is easily one of the scariest bogeymen in horror cinema. With only five lines, he is able to effortlessly freak us out through his body language and facial expressions. He almost doesn't have to say anything to scare you.Although the three main characters are mostly well-developed, they are all hammed up by C-grade actors. Sometimes, their delivery of the dialog can even be a little funny. But the performances are forgiven thanks to likable, nicely structured people. Kathy Lester's Lady in Lavender is seductive and creepy enough (even though we all know by now that those are not her real boobs). But the best acting job here goes to Angus Scrimm as The Tall Man. A man Coscarelli had previously worked with, Scrimm fits the role like a glove and does most of his own stunt work. His appearance is unforgettable, and he has made The Tall Man what he is today: one scary-as-hell villain.Music is always a trait that could make or break any horror movie, and Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave's combination of cymbals, guitars, and simplistic tunes holds up as one of the best horror movie orchestrations to date. It serves the movie well and adds a whole new layer to the already existent horror.""Phantasm"" may not be perfectly made, but a flawlessly characterized antagonist, eerie camera-work, surrealism, a bang-up finale and its ability to stand on its own cause it to remain a cult classic. It cannot be classified into a certain subgenre of horror, which may be the main reason why it works so damn well. And who could miss out on a movie with such a knockout tagline on its poster?

Then in the mid 80s I saw it for sale for ten bucks, I bought it, what the hell. Now while it still didn't scare me as much as the first time I saw it, I was still impressed with the style of it all. Sure the dialouge is laughable sometimes. Is it incoherent: Yes. But for a film that had almost no budget, it carries alot of weight, and is better than most horror flix that come out today.

By the end of the film both of us were quite confused by the movie.  Due to our experience with the first movie we didn't bother renting any of the sequels.  Now, years later, I rented Phantasm II and really enjoyed it, and having viewed that film I had a better understanding of the original.  I decided to view Phantasm again so I bought it on DVD and I'm glad that I did.  This is a very good independent horror movie.  At times the acting is a bit thin (but not terrible) and the story still has some holes in it (ie questions that could use answering) but what it does have going for it is a creepy atmosphere and a director that knows how to use suspense.Too many horror movies today, especially low budget ones, rely heavily on gore.  Gore is good for shock value but it is rarely scary, just gross.  Don Coscarelli provides one of the few times that gore is also scary with his flying silver orbs.  But most of the time he relies on suspense to create his scares.  This fact has quickly placed Phantasm I and II near the top on my favourite horror movies list.If you have seen Phantasm and didn't like it I recommend watching Phantasm II then giving the original another try (mind you if you didn't like the first one you probably aren't reading this review).

What was a little annoying is the scene when Jody returns to the bar in the cuda, to find out about the lady in lavender, young Mike enters the scene virtually at the same time on foot.

Like many 70s horror flicks-- The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane, Last House on the Left-- it looks and feels like some creepy, half-finished documentary. It feels real in a way that few horror films do. I especially appreciate the desolation of this film's setting. It's as if the town's population has been decimated, and the brothers, whose parents have recently died, are just now noticing. Except for the incredible Angus Scrimm, the actors here do not ""perform"" the way A-list actors usually do. Their actions and dialogue often seem awkward. Still, this very awkwardness serves the documentary feel of the film. A. Michael Baldwin and Bill Thornbury seem like real brothers in this movie, brothers who sometimes bond and sometimes grate on each other's nerves. Their relationship is the heart of the movie and it is threatened with death and loss in almost every scene. I just can't rave enough about this movie: it is full of powerful scares, creepy images, believable characters, a strong sense of melancholy, and probably the most compelling group of faces ever assembled for a horror film.

159,stmichaeldet,Six-Plus Feet Under,8,4 February 2006,"There may be stranger films, and there are definitely many better films, but Phantasm has got to be one of the best strange films of all time. Adhering only to nightmare logic, the plot careens about the screen like a drunken celebrity chased by a pack of paparazzi.The story revolves around two brothers' attempts to discover the sinister secrets lurking in the town's cemetery, Morningside, after the deaths of their parents and a friend of the older brother, Jody. Opposing their efforts are the amazingly menacing Tall Man, a small horde of robed dwarfs, and a lethal, flying silver ball. Michael, the younger brother, is the more motivated of the two, stumbling upon signs that something evil is afoot while hanging around the cemetery in the wake of the friend's funeral (which Jody forbids him to attend because he's afraid that, after having just dealt with his folks' deaths, attending another funeral might just send Mikey over the edge). They gradually uncover a plot to turn the recently-deceased into a renewable resource for the Tall Man's home planet/dimension/whatever, and with the help of their scene-stealing ice cream vendor friend, Reggie, manage to foil the Tall Man's cheap labor scheme. Or do they? By the end of the film, we discover that nothing is as it seems, and the threat more subtle and pervasive than we have been led to believe.Alas, the film is not without its flaws; most notably, there are two gaping holes in the final confrontation at Morningside, where money apparently ran out for filming. Trick editing and exposition attempt to fill the gaps, but really only serve to draw attention to them. And our lead actors are fairly stiff and lifeless, but fortunately, in this case, the supporting cast, especially Reggie Bannister as Reggie and Angus Scrimm as the Tall Man, more than make up for it.The main strength of Phantasm, however, is in the atmosphere it creates. Menace lurks around every corner, and the imagery of death is everywhere. All in all, Phantasm is a film that will haunt you long after the final credits roll.",Phantasm
160,S_dot_M_dot,True Indie Classic,8,31 October 2021,"While sneaking around a funeral, trying to spy on his older brother Jody (Bill Thornbury), Mike (A. Michael Baldwin) sees a mysterious Tall Man (Agnus Scrimm) picking up caskets alone. When trying to convince his brother of his findings, they team up with their friend Reggie (Reggie Bannister) to investigate the funeral home. Once inside, they find weapons from another world, as the Tall Man steals the dead bodies.Director Don Coscarelli crafts a beautiful, low-budget horror film. He makes the production feel big by making creative decisions to trick the viewer into believing things are larger than they appear. The production design inside the mausoleum is spectacular and the added sound design has a big budget feel. The creativity behind the entire process is what makes this film work.Another way to sell this film is by having a fabulous cast to go along with it. Agnus Scrimm plays the brooding Tall Man with intensity and makes you feel his presence even when he's not on screen. The image of him walking down the smoke-filled street has been burned into the minds of many over the years. You can see how the actors bought into Coscarelli's vision and trusted in his direction. Going throughout a house holding a blanket to your head and thrashing everywhere, only to have sound effects make it work, is massive trust in your director.As big a plus as short run time is, in this case, it could have been extended. Some areas of the film are a little incoherent and you feel lost for a few frames. Some extra screen time would have helped the plot and painted a clearer picture. One downfall of the low budget was lighting. Outdoor scenes at night are difficult to make out what is going on. Thankfully, some well-timed edits broke this up and didn't leave the viewer in the literal dark for too long.This film stands the test of time all because of the direction. Add in an iconic villain and you get a horror classic. Despite its minimal downfalls, Phantasm is a testament to creativity and believing in yourself. Anyone who aspires to be a filmmaker has to watch this film and take detailed notes on the craft.",Phantasm
161,Aphex97,A strange trip indeed!,6,17 May 2001,"Phantasm is definitely a strange trip. I remember watching it when I was a child and thinking, ""This is cool as hell!"" Now after a second viewing of the special feature loaded DVD at the age of 21, I sat thinking the whole time, ""What the hell is this?!?"" 
WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE: Some redeeming factors for the movie are the Tall Man, who does manage to be pretty scary throughout. Also the Tall Man's evil motivations (which I won't divulge for those who haven't seen the movie) are pretty interesting and refreshingly original. When Mike goes through the dimensional portal, I was very impressed with the visual of the alien surface and slaves. And of course the Orb killing scene takes the cake as by far and away the coolest scene in the movie and well worth watching at least once! The film also creates a nice horror ambience when inside the very scary mortuary halls.
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THIS MOVIE: Amazingly horrendous acting...I'm usually pretty forgiving of actors but these actors were just plain bad. Poorly scripted (not to mention unbelievable) build-up to main action; I didn't understand why/what was going on half the time. The decisions the actors made were senseless (e.g. why did Jody keep leaving Mike alone when every time he was left alone Jody either needed Mike's help or had to go save him). 
FINAL RATING: 6/10 - The very original, novel, and promising plot idea is nearly destroyed by a poor script, poor presentation, and poor acting. However, it is still a somewhat classic horror film worth watching at least once. Hardcore fans of the horror genre should enjoy. The overall strangeness of the movie also makes it interesting.",Phantasm
162,VCRanger,What's so great about this?,4,18 June 1999,"Phantasm is a weak excuse for a horror film.  Bad acting, choppy editing, a not so scary meanie and low-grade F/X make this movie a tooth-grinding experience.  I just could not wait for the movie to finish.  I have not seen the sequels, so I am interested in seeing if they are of higher grade that this piece of manure.  Too bad the lead girl (or was that a boy) did not end up on the other side of that weird sphere.  A rating of 4 out of 10 was given.",Phantasm
163,Don_Falone1985,Cult classic boyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!,9,7 July 2020,"Just recently got a gift for the Blu Ray boxset of all the Phantasm films and thoroughly enjoying these cult classics on high def and on the big screen at home. 1st one I will initially review, as this was what started the craze. An absolute stone cold classic with a fantastic villain ""The Tall man "" played excellently by Angus Scrimm. I won't go into detail in regards to the story, but the main story is of a young boy named Mike, who tries to dig deep into this mysterious Tall man character who is seen at the grave of a funeral. It follows the story and introduces excellent characters like Reggie, Jody etc who also feature in the sequels to, so you really connect and interact with these characters. One thing I love about the Phantasm series is how well developed the characters are. The original is probably the best, purely as it's the scariest and has the dreaded atmosphere throughout the movie. Everyone who knows Phantasm will know of the excellent arsenal of weapons and henchmen they Tall man has, from his dreaded spheres, the dwarfs and The Lavender women, who the tall man appears as in certain segments of the movie. Super cult classic horror.",Phantasm
164,Pozdnyshev,Truly Inspired Strangeness,10,19 June 2014,"When I was a teenager, I watched this movie a few times; I'd liked weird/cult/horror movies like The Toxic Avenger and the Evil Dead, and Phantasm was advertised in Fangoria as a cult horror classic (I was also around when Phantasm II came out, and believe me it was a BIG DEAL -- they all but plastered San Francisco with ads for it). I rented Phantasm and while it was interesting with its nostalgic 70's feel and iconic Tall Man, it was also boring. It didn't have a lot of special effects (cheap or otherwise), and with all the emphasis on the relationship between the two brothers, it almost seemed like a dark soap opera. Now, watching this movie again for the first time in years, there's a LOT going on here that I never noticed before. It's a sincere, weird, and effective film that gets its power from the poignant story of a boy who needs someone to raise him, emotional trauma and sleep-deprivation-induced hallucinations, vaguely occult initiation rituals, and clever scriptwriting that never makes it fully clear whether the weird stuff going on is real or not. I think this movie, at its core, is about a teenage boy unable to come to terms with the trauma of losing both his parents and his big brother. He can't get his head around it -- it's just too horrible. So he distances himself from it with imaginative delusions about some awful Death Figure (the Tall Man), and an exciting fantasy where his older brother and him Fight The Bizarre and Terrifying Forces of Death, all of which is just a projection of the real-life deaths which Mike cannot accept.And the movie ends with the Tall Man STILL after the boy, which just shows that Mike is going to be dealing with the terrible trauma of losing his immediate family for a long time; the Tall Man is just the reality of those deaths asserting itself to him. It's very sad, but in a good way because that's just how things work out sometimes, without sugarcoating. I had some friends who lost close family members and there's no happy ending for them either, they've felt the pain ever since. In the words of Mikey, there's somethin' else. At the risk of sounding like a nut, the movie strongly hints that the Tall Man also represents some parasitic, discarnate entity that was drawn to Mike because of his vulnerable state. Say what you want about ghosts and whatever, but I do think that there are ""harmful sentient impulses"" out there that look to feed off and exploit the weak, the wounded, and drug addicts/alcoholics.So that's why I think this movie is a classic. It's an unfiltered nightmare inspired by a great loss. This bottom layer was ripped away from all the sequels in favor of the imaginative mythology that grows out of it (the Tall Man, the killer spheres, living-dead slaves, etc.), and that works too, but that's why they also don't have much of the eerie power of the first.Also, the music is PERFECT. Right at the beginning there's that long, alien wail, wavering in and out of pitch, like the cry of a madman deep inside an asylum.",Phantasm
165,dracforever,It's a love/hate relationship,6,16 August 2019,"I saw this in the theatre when it first came out; I was about 13. Even now it's kind of a creepy flick thanks to Angus Scrimm and the flying spheres. Now, even as then, it has its flaws, but what B-independent-movie doesn't. I remember leaving the theatre thinking ""what the hell did I just watch""! Still does that to me today. Initially, I even laughed at the first sighting of the flying sphere because the blood just kept on coming long after there should have been that much to support such a forceful stream! So, why do I seem to be drawn to this movie? As much as this movie answers it's own questions, is how well I can answer that question to myself. It was a bit controversial when released, tackled some odd topics, and brought us the Tall Man (which in my opinion is the only redeemable thing about this flick as his character is iconic), and was made by a young, unheard-of guy in the movie industry (you got give credit where due). For some reason I am drawn to this one repeatedly, but I truly feel it's because it had the balls (Freudian slip?) to try, because it's become a cult classic & well, I'm not sure why. If you like B-movies, maybe give it a try and see for yourself, you'll understand why it's hard to explain.",Phantasm
166,Johnny B,What has been going on in the last 90 minutes????,1,6 June 1999,"Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Please someone try to explain to me what sort of crap this is.  Everything in this flick shows its ridiculously low budget and its scarce use of art.  Here are some of my comments on the so-called ""classic tale of terror"":the story is impossible to follow: you get people getting killed and reappearing again later, unhurt, while others remain alive throughout and then, toward the end, you get a glimpse of their grave.  Apart from that you get people being here and there, not understanding how they got there, how they got in etc.the main character, Mike, seems to be in a desperate need of a speech therapist;no one can really act (except Reggie Bannister)nothing really makes sense, except those spicy brain-chewing flying ballsthe Tall Man with his continuous, ever-monotonous ""Boy!"" is more pathetic than scaryOne last note, I did not realise when it was time to start getting frightened - it is all so awfully junky.

Over the decades, this film has somehow become a cult classic and I honestly have no idea why.As others have pointed out, the story is non-existent, the ""villain"" is more comical than scary and the ""acting"" (such as it is) is the stuff of MST3K dreams. In fact, had it not been for the boobs, this surely would have made the cut for the fine folks at Gizmonics Institute.The sorry excuse for a plot has been covered many times by other reviewers, so I won't rehash. I couldn't help being reminded of Troll 2 whenever the laughable, non-scary dwarves showed up. I would not be surprised at all to learn that the writer and director of Troll 2 were highly influenced by this mess.Regarding the ending, how did ice cream boy come back to life? I can only assume that they resurrected his character in order to ensure that one protagonist would remain for the sequel(s). Who knows?Don't waste your time with this.

Like the best horror films fo the black and white era, half the jumps that come from Phantasm are from shadows and inventive camera work; did you _really_ see those little brown-robed guys out of the corner of your eye? Phantasm holds a very high place on my hundred-best-of-the-century list, and deservedly so.",Phantasm
170,MovieManiacX,A Horror Classic,10,28 April 2005,"Phantasm is a horror classic. Don Coscarelli crafted an atmospheric, creepy, and very entertaining movie dealing with all kinds of unexplained terrors of the unknown. Made on a shoestring budget, the film has a few flaws, but is definitely worth watching at least once.The musical score, which many horror movie lovers know very well, fits the film perfectly. You'll probably find yourself whistling or humming it long after you've seen the movie. This single theme creates a creepy sense of dread that stays with you the entire movie.The cast is excellent. Michael Baldwin plays Mike to a tee. He can be a bit annoying at times, but he delivers a genuinely great performance. Bill Thornbury as Jody is good as well, playing his part with skepticism at first, and then once he believes Mike, he goes through the rest of the movie with caution and a shotgun. Reggie Bannister as Reggie the ice cream man supplies a bit of comic relief, which some people find unneeded, but I enjoyed it. The best performance is by Angus Scrimm, who plays the extremely creepy Tall Man. Due to this fantastic performance, The Tall Man has become a horror movie icon, just like Jason, Freddy, and Michael.The special effects are top-notch for 1979, especially on such a small budget of $300,000. A few of the props look fake, like The Tall Man's severed finger and the giant mutated fly that it becomes. But these are only minor annoyances, with everything else looking great, most notably the flying metal spheres. These things fly around, impale the victim in the forehead, then drill a hole right between their eyes. Ouch! The actual setting for the film is also very ominous. Inside the marble halls of Morningside, there is no movement, no noise, nothing. It produces a particularly unsettling result.The ending of the film is very interesting. Most people shrug it off because they don't understand it, but I found it to be a very unique way to end it. It not only made way for a sequel (three, to be exact), it stuck to the horror movie rule that not all endings should end happily.The Bottom Line: Phantasm had stood the test of time and is still to this day a shocking, creepy, and extremely entertaining horror classic.",Phantasm
171,BuddyBoy1961,"You know, Don, ""PLOT"" is a noun AND a verb!",3,31 October 2021,"This movie is the poster child of movies that shouldn't be edited by a director/writer! It is shockingly disjointed and frustrating to watch; the narrative is simply all over the place. Scenes exist that have nothing to do with...anything else. People say things they would never say...and do things people would never do. Characters just show up late in the plot that have never been seen or referred to previously. Jump scares do not a movie make! And please don't give me the standard, ""It's all happening in his head"" rot. If there truly were a 3-hour rough cut, the director should have handed over the footage to a set of fresh eyes who would have been able to craft something that at least made a modicum of developmental sense. How has this film not been skewered by MST3K?! There are perhaps a couple of moments here or there that are modestly interesting, but it's all really just a matter of too little-too late. The cinematography is not bad, and the score is sometimes effective, but I simply could not wait for these 90 minutes to elapse. Don't say I didn't warn you.",Phantasm

Scary and funny.,10,9 June 2007,"The new 2007 DVD of this film features a 30-minute documentary that is excellent and covers all the major interesting points. It's nicely packaged too, the DVD case inside a color cardboard sleeve with foil accents--classy!Don Coscarelli's ""Phantasm"" is a very original and startling horror film from the late 70's. A lot of horror classics were produced in the 70's, but this one in particular stands out because it is the only one that does not hearken back in some way to earlier established archetypes. All the details are more or less original, so you are not looking at a retread of the conventional Frankenstein/Dracula/Zombie stories. The main baddie is an exceptionally tall undertaker from another planet, for starters. His dwarf slaves are essentially zombies (reanimated dead people he has crushed ""down to half size"") but in their behavior and appearance do not really resemble zombies from other myths. This is a movie trying to be as different as possible.Large amounts of surrealism and humor are mixed in, and the film displays a willingness to throw in very off-the-wall ideas and quirky moments. In the opening scenes, we see that spooky shenanigans are going on over at that Morningside Mortuary, including murder, appearances of strange hooded dwarf creatures, and kid-hero Mike (Michael Baldwin) riding his motorcycle around in the cemetery, apparently for kicks. After just a few minutes have elapsed, ""Phantasm"" is already a tapestry of weirdness, and it generally gets stranger, scarier and funnier as it goes along. The youthful hero Mike was also a big hit with youngsters when the film came out. He is an unusually energetic character who, to save his older brother and their friend Reggie from the eerie monsters, is ready to jump into the action and fight.Not surprising that it was a big theatrical hit when it came out originally. It was totally unlike any other movie, and audiences could see clearly that this low-budget oddity was bending over backwards to deliver its roller-coaster-style entertainment.This has been available for some years now in stereo/surround format, which sounds great and allows the viewer to better appreciate the very atmospheric musical score by Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave. In addition to stereo manipulation of the sound effects, director Coscarelli also beefed up the sound effects for the famous ""flying silver sphere"" scene, adding stereo ""whoosh"" effects. I think the new additional sound effects are layered on fairly tastefully and you still get to hear the sphere's signature humming whine. The MGM release also features an ""original mono soundtrack"" option for purists.",Phantasm

The Spheres of ""Phantasm"" are one of the most memorable icons of the genre, and the ""Tall Man"" one of its most intriguing characters.  The underappreciated sequel, ""Phantasm II"", as well as numbers III and IV serve to flesh out this masterpiece of horror.

177,As_Cold_As_Ice,À fine example of classical horror,7,30 January 2007,"This was a very enjoyable, more classical-style horror movie. The acting was of high caliber, with all of the main characters ably acted. However, more praise should go out to Angus Scrimm, who played the Tall Man. With barely saying 10 words, he projected terror and a presence throughout the entire movie. And when he did speak, it was scary, especially his first words.I mentioned that Phantasm was a classical horror movie. I say this because it is very reminiscent of the older horror movies, with it's lack of blood, Goblin-esquire music, and slower storyline. This was great, after watching so much gory stuff, sometimes you can forget about movies that don't rely on crutches like gore and shockjump horror.The lighting and sets were very intriguing. The whole movie starts off looking normal enough, although as Mike goes deeper into the enigma of the Tall Man's plans, the colours and lighting become more stark, because the lighting and sets are either extremely bright, or extremely dark. This added to the surrealness towards the end.One niggle however, was with the ending, because it was:1. Clichéd 2. Lacking in senseThe ending wasn't bad, just the two above points sort of lessened it's impact.Nevertheless, Phantasm is still a good movie, bordering on great, if it weren't for the ending.",Phantasm

You see, there's something strange about this funeral home and a young kid named Mike wants to get to the bottom of it. After a family friend dies, he begins hanging around the funeral home, hoping to get a glimpse of something sinister. Eventually, he gets his wish and he starts running for his life.For such a surreal film, the character relationships are incredibly well drawn, which is the only thing that keeps the film grounded and relatable.

The atmosphere is excellent, the around-the-way, average joe characters make the film very believable. I've always thought this was a great film, but I recently found new respect for it after seeing the director's commentary on DVD, where I see how seriously the filmmakers took this project when they made it, and that is wasn't no joke to them. This was not a great film made by default, they meant to make it great.

181,shuklavinash,The Personification of Fear.,10,9 February 2012,"'Phantasm' has always been close to me, and I don't remember a single week, I lived without it. What make 'Phantasm' different are slow off-the-tone and sometimes absolutely fast nightmarish sequences, that kill the crap out of you. The film is remembered as a cult-classic now, and there is a fairly good reason behind it. After watching this film, you'd feel like you'd just lived a nightmare to the fullest. The 'Tall Man' is one of the most haunting villains one would ever wish to see for real. Don Coscarelli is a great craftsman, who has the ability to get down to the sub-conscious levels and explore the underlying fears of the human mind. It's been more than 30 years now since its release, but it holds a charisma that wouldn't fade with time. This truly is non-degradable.The film begins with Morningside cemetery, where Tommy is busy making love with a vampiric blonde. Moments later, the scantily clad blonde transforms to a vicious looking old man, The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm). The Tall Man kills Tommy and we soon land at his funeral. Jody (Bill Thornbury) and Reggie (Reggie Bannister) are friends, and members of a band. They are here because Tommy was their friend and a band member. Jody's brother Mike (Michael Baldwin) is prejudiced with a thought that Jody would abandon him in near future. Long back, after the demise of their parents, Mike was looked after by Jody. Mike doesn't want to lose Jody but his fears torment him. He sneakingly follows Jody and Reggie at the funeral and notices something strange at the Morningside. He also gets a glimpse of the unholy undertaker of the cemetery. The Tall Man, takes Tommy's dead body back to his hearse after the attendees leave. Mike wants to find cure for his trauma, and seeks help of a local fortune teller, who asks him to give up his fears regarding Jody. Mike is followed by ghoulish dwarfs, who are after him for no apparent reason, or this is what Mike thinks. Jody disregards Mike's strange story about the Tall Man. Agitated by the belief that his fears are not baseless, Mike heads to the cemetery. There he is chased by the Tall Man and his henchmen, satanic spheres and ugly dwarfs. During the fracas, the Tall Man happens to cut his finger that squirts yellow goo instead of blood. Mike takes the finger along and shows it to Jody as evidence. Jody, Reggie and Mike join hands to finish the Tall Man and his minions. They eventually discover that the Tall Man is an inter-dimensional being, who has a portal to his own scorching and hellish world at the Morningside cemetery. The Tall Man harvests townspeople and enslaves them by transforming them into dwarfs. Everything goes on surreptitiously until our men decide to have their final showdown with the Tall Man.'Phantasm' is more like a dream than a movie. You must have dreamed something bizarre at least once in your life, and 'Phantasm' is the same eccentric trip to the unknown depths of metaphysics. Don Coscarelli has made use of heavy symbolism to show the nihilistic worth of a matter or incident. The disappearance of money and magic box, gloomy mortuary set-up, silence prevailing inside the mausoleum, the dwarfs and their journey to other dimension and finally the angel of death in disguise, 'The Tall Man' are all symbolic. Mike is a victim of his own fear, the death itself. He believes Jody would leave him someday, but Jody, as Reggie tells Mike, had already died in a car crash. Was Mike unable to accept Jody's death due to inherent attachment with his brother? Did Jody already die before these bizarre incidents? We can't really know and neither could anyone. This freaky ride is enough to create a long lasting terror as 'Phantasm' is more like a doorway between the two worlds. The first world is our own mundane world, which we can see and perceive, while the other world is located in a different dimension, which has its own laws and regulations, but certainly all the otherworldly incidents and beings can neither be understood nor analyzed with rational eyes. 'Phantasm' has been crafted with a non-noetic expertise and we should remember that it all started in our own world. 'Phantasm' qualifies itself to be a perfect cult flick, with one of the greatest atmospheres and vivid representations of death. The 'Phantasm' sequels were loosely aligned with the main story, where the Tall Man has been depicted as an evil force that misuses the powers solely for diabolic purposes. This film offers a great combination of 'Body (Jody, Reggie, and Mike), Mind (The Tall Man is actually the personification of fear and death), and Soul (the dwarfs, who are condemned to the hell forever). Don't even think about missing this film, because this would sure have a great impact on you and would give you a deeper insight about the real horror that always stalks and ambushes life.......The Death! So.....Your Funeral May Begin Anytime Sir!",Phantasm
182,ashspicefilms,You think you go to heaven- YOU GO TO US!!,10,9 August 2000,"The first time I saw this film (just in 1999) I was really freaked out and astonished, but I felt it would have been much more enjoyable if I'd seen it before I knew the secret of the dwarves. I read about it at www.houseofhorrors.com and it gave away the horrifying secret to what they are. I watched it again with a friend who didn't know the secret and when the secret of the dwarves was revealed he was so shocked it was amazing. Nobody was expecting the dwarves to be what they are. I kknow consider it the most horrifying movie experience of my life (and I've seen about 1000 horror films). The haunting music definitely sets the perfect mood for the film.  Seeing the dwarve chase after Mike in the bushes, the sphere scene, the shocking revelation, and the ending will scare you. If they don't scare you, you are already dead. The Tall Man is death. An omnipresence. You cannot escape him. The best way to see this film is knowing very little of the plot. None of the sequels are as scary, but all have better effects and action. I think the original's darkness of the dwarves makes them much scarier. They show them more in part 2 and that makes them less scary. And part 4's attempt at explanations really ruins the story (so avoid part 4) . See phantasm, BOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Phantasm
183,FJWWindsor,"A Near Masterpiece That Somehow, Someway, Works",8,8 July 2017,"Sometimes, a film or song wedges itself in our minds because of a certain point in time or occurrence in our lives. That's what happened for me with Phantasm.It was October 1981, close to or on Halloween. My girlfriend and I were in college, both with full course loads and both working near full time. I ended up at her studio apartment late one night, and she was too tired to do anything, so she crashed early. The wind was slightly chill and rustled through the dying leaves on the trees, sounds which came through the open windows. She had a comfy Lazyboy, I had a cold beer, and the room was very, very dimly lit. With nothing else to do, I settled in for a little boob tube action.Near the beginning of the movie, there's a scene where one of the lead characters, Michael, catches fleeting glimpses of dwarf figures scurrying between tombstones. That scene FREAKED ME OUT that night, and I was hooked for the rest of the film. Hooked on the film for the rest of my life, as it seems.I recently revisited Phantasm for something like the twentieth time and started thinking about what makes this movie a critically acclaimed horror fan's favorite. Here's some observations:The basic story line is fairly solid and easy to follow, though the script is nothing to write home about. The acting is average to mediocre but, yet, we actually care what happens to these characters. Kudos to writer/director Don Coscarelli for creating some backstory to the two main characters, brothers who lost both of their parents and are now all the family they have left. Michael, the younger, exhibits the insecurities and awkwardness of adolescence, while his older brother shows the confidence and fearlessness of the man he has become. Their best friend, Reggie, adds a feel good camaraderie indicative of many 1970s films.There are certain visuals in the film that stand out, though the cinematography is an exercise in contrasts. For me, the stark, pure white Morningside mortuary building lit by full force sunshine is emblazoned in my mind. Also, the black and white faux marble interior scenes are harshly lit, while the rest of the film's exterior shots are dark and murky. The silver sphere rounding corners is a hallmark of the special effects, as are the scenes of the other world.The soundtrack is subtle, eclectic, but superb. Although not as recognizable as John Carpenter's Halloween or Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells from The Exorcist, Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave use synthesizers, electric guitars and bass to compliment scenes and heighten tension, without being overbearing or obvious. And then there's, of course, The Tall Man - Angus Scrimm, who's presented as the malevolent evil foil to the love of the brothers and their friends. Though he's in the film a limited amount of time, each appearance is larger than life. For example, his relishing the coldness of Reggie's open ice cream truck is absolutely eerie. And the way he pops up when you least expect him. You cringe when he growls, ""BOY!""I also remember a few ""firsts"". Phantasm was the first film that I can recall that successfully married the horror and sci-fi genres. Also, the scene where Michael is looking at an old photograph and The Tall Man begins to move is the first such device I can recall in modern horror, a full 23 years before the Harry Potter movies did the same thing.All in all, Phantasm scores while many contemporary films fall off. Maybe they're trying too hard.",Phantasm
184,jacobconnelly-47681,Unusual and Haunting,8,14 November 2021,"Although it possesses little realism or logic, Phantasm does what few films can. It casts a spell on its audience, takes them to a whole new world, and doesn't let them doubt what they're seeing for even a moment. It's all the more impressive when you discover how inexpensive this film was to make. It's not your usual monster movie or slasher and takes its audience to a whole new world.Don Coscarelli milks the inherent creepiness of mortuaries and graveyards and gives Christopher Lee-esque actor, Angus Scrimm, a role that commands immediate authority. You don't want to mess with The Tall Man.There's also a very relatable relationship between brothers Jody and Mike and their friend, Reggie, that anchors the film when some of the stranger aspects begin to overwhelm it. Because of how well this part of the film is executed, it allows the audience to suspend disbelief and give into the film's more surreal moments.",Phantasm
185,EllisDee,One of the most original horror films ever!,9,15 January 1999,"""Phantasm"" is a bizarre, charming film that I watch frequently.  It has a campy quality where virtually anything is allowed to happen.  Among my favorite weird occurrences in this movie are the giant fly (the fly rules, too bad it doesn't appear again in any of the sequels!), Mike's bike accident and the Tall Man growling ""BOY!"".  The soundtrack complements the visuals very nicely, though they should have varied the music more as one composition in particular gets overused.  The plot may or may not be just a bad dream from one of the characters, and it is not particularly coherent. However, the lack of coherence may actually be appropriate as dream sequences often just skip abruptly instead of flowing logically from one to the next.  This quirk of incoherence may generate confusion and require having to watch the movie twice to fully appreciate it.  Nevertheless, ""Phantasm"" has a wonderful chemistry mixing humor with horror, and despite its late '70's look, the movie transcends time!",Phantasm
186,buddypatrick,"""Hey, you had a dream. Just a nightmare""",10,22 June 2009,"""Phantasm: an apparition of a ghostly appearing figure"" Simply put Phantasm is a visual nightmare transformed into a person's sketchy reality. The emphasis on sleeping and dreams is exactly the message it is getting at. With a perfect score and a quintessentially frighteningly written Horror villain 'The Tall Man' the only downfalls of Phantasm are its lack of quality acting, script, pacing and cheap 1970's horror clichés. In fact the acting and characters become so irritating it is the only element of Phantasm that takes it away from being considered a true Horror classic by most Horror buffs (or maybe it's George Lucas' unauthorized use of Jawa's?).When one scans the Horror elite those films have pretty atrocious acting problems too, so why should Phantasm fail so much? It shouldn't really because Phantasm is just as good as the classics. One of the reason why Phantasm is such a unique film is the well established characters unlike most Horror films; whilst the acting is somewhat absent from the strongly written character it's still enough to redeem the awkwardly delivered lines, odd facial expressions and comical snappy reactions. The films score is also perfect and mesmerizing that fits well by Fred Myrow, it was in fact one of the most powerful elements of the movie that really had me engaged. The stunning visuals and the concept and imagery of The Tall Man (wonderfully portrayed by Angus Scrimm) are authentically creepy, like something one would encounter in a nightmare. (in fact, I had a dream where I was in Hell and I encountered a priest that had been shrunk and dissected by a demon and this was before I saw Phantasm) I know I would be pretty hysterical if The Tall Man was stalking me.It's these points of the film that for me makes Phantasm an atmospheric and creepy horror gem, in fact it brings me back to when I was a five year old child in a video store in the 90's, traumatized by the VHS covers for Hellraiser and The Blob only to eagerly await the day I was old enough to view them. Another reason why Phantasm's atmosphere works so well is the use of white and brightness instead darkness Phantasm's surreal mortuary is a nightmarish treat of white marble walls lined with drawers of the dead, gaping large hallways and The Tall Man's shoes trudging along the tiles that make you feel he's going to jump out of the television screen. From the flying silver balls to the void to another dimension, Phantasm's concept of a ghoulishly eerie tale about a soul keeper is wonderfully mastered and pulled off.No matter how jammed with 1970's horror clichés the use of the shoestring budget and surrealism incorporated into Phantasm makes it a pure Horror gem. It seems all the love goes to over rated films only because they're so talked about and not actually analysed. This movie has creeped me out more than any other Horror classic ever could now and I'm far from the age I was when I used to be scared those films. Phantasm is highly recommended to surrealist, horror and cult fanatics.",Phantasm
187,mailljs,"you've heard of a B movie, this one is a D.",2,3 October 2006,"I have just finished watching this movie on DVD. I bought it because it was rated highly on IMDb and it has spawned a number of sequels, (although when you think of Jason and Freddy that's not such a recommendation) and it seems to be regarded as a cult classic. I thought the one line concept was good - alien takes reanimated shrunken corpses to another planet to work as slaves - but the movie was a shocker without a single redeeming feature. The acting was bad, bad, bad. The script was nonsensical and the continuity, editing and special effects truly awful. The DVD says the runtime is 88 mins, seemed more like 120+ as it goes on and on and virtually nothing happens. I wasted my time so you don't have to waste yours.",Phantasm
188,pmoney13,Just doesn't make any sense,3,23 October 2001,"Phantasm had a lot of potential. The premise is scary: two kids fighting a wicked mortician and his evil drones. Unfortunately this low-budget horror outing (that spawned, incredibly, two more sequels) is way too confusing to be frightening. I watched as characters disappeared for long stretches before reappearing for no good reason. People die then are miraculously alive again in the next scene. Some characters are evil, then good, then evil again. Not to mention it's all directed so that the action zooms along at a brisk pace, not bothering to explain anything. All in all the movie inspires more headaches than fear. The film focuses on two (uninteresting) kids who investigate weird goings on at the local mortuary, where their deceased friend was just buried. They come upon the Tall Man, an evil fellow who kills people with flying silver spheres and turns corpses into his zombie minions. Most of the film has the Tall Man chasing the younger boy around after the kid learns of his secrets.As low-budget horror movies go, I've seen far worse. Phantasm is imaginative, if nothing else, and has some memorable scenes (the first appearance of the flying orb is great), but in order to scare people you must have coherency. Phantasm plays like the filmmakers know everything that's going on, but they feel like keeping the viewer in the dark.",Phantasm

Poorly conceived, pointless scenes, bad acting and VERY amateurish. It's muddled, to say the least. I get the feeling that it was hastily put together to showcase only 2 scenes: gratuitous nudity and the sphere.How this movie has a fan base is beyond me. A total waste of time.",Phantasm

I really enjoyed the shots of this film mostly the shots inside the funeral but all were great. The actors were fantastic and it was a emotional roller coaster.

I really enjoyed this film and would recommend this mesmerizing experience to anyone getting into the horror genre!",Phantasm
191,midnightrane,Be the ball...,9,20 November 2001,"Ahhhhh, ""Phantasm""! Quite a scary flick...I was first exposed to this little horror about 15 years ago by my Pop. I doubt that I will ever give a ""horror"" movie a 10, but this is as close as I have ever gotten. Tall Man is absolutely frightening and the ""ball"" is as fearsome an accessory as ever has appeared on screen. 10 times the fear factor of any hockey mask, hatchet or claw!You could argue for days about why this film is scary; the acting is mediocre at best, the scenes can be confusing and the resolution isn't exactly spectacular--however, this movie gets under your skin! Although never heavy-handed, it forces your head back and twists it's way deep into your psyche, sure to rear it's ugly mug after the lights go out. The inexplicable appeal is probably somewhere to be found within the setting (funeral home), spooky music (gruesome sound-effects) and style. It's subtle eerie-ness is totally unnerving and the fact that your imagination is given just enough information to be dangerous doesn't help.I spent weeks of my childhood, alone in bed, writhing beneath the blade of it's cold imagery. This is one that stays with you...whether you want it to or not. It's actually better on a second or third viewing, but I wouldn't recommend watching it very often. 9/10 for provoking my imagination in a way no other ""horror"" film ever has...",Phantasm
192,etzool,"Overrated, unfortunately.",3,10 December 2006,"The story itself is interesting -- the characters are pretty likable, and there are enough fantastic elements that it's a pretty surreal experience.However, the execution left me wondering who decided to take what would have been the most interesting parts of the film and either leave them out of the script or drop them on the cutting room floor.This movie could have been excellent -- however, major plot points are explained very poorly (when they're explained at all), apparently in favor of a few more scenes of ""ahhh, midgets, get my shotgun!"" Everything that DID make the movie could certainly have stayed, but two more hours of actual character development would have clinched this as one of my favorite movies.I wanted to enjoy this movie; unfortunately, I can't find enough redeeming value here to watch it again, let alone recommend it to others.",Phantasm

Even the effects make you feel like it's the 70s.The movie itself is pretty average in my opinion. Maybe I'm spoiled from minders movies but I had a hard time staying interested. Story was a little slow, and I kinda wish there was more spheres in the movie.One thing I didn't like is after the plot is wrapped up, one of the characters just straight up dies off screen. One scene he is a hero, then next he is dead. I had to rewind the movie because I thought I missed something.Over all it's a cheesy 70s horror movie.

197,jameslipski,A Low Budget Winner,9,11 March 2012,I first saw this movie on HBO back in 1980 and was taken in by its imaginative story line. I saw that it was going to be on TV again on Holloween in 1984 and rediscovered it. Watched in awe at the creepiness of the Tall Man.Michael is your typical teenager who wants to explore the strange going ons at the towns mortuary after he witnesses a 600 pound casket being lifted up by one man. His older brother does not believe him at first but eventually comes around. Along with a good friend who drives an ice cream truck they discover the mortuary has a more sinister purpose. It is taking the dead and reanimating them. Then using a portal to another dimension making them slaves.There are many scenes that gave me the chills and that is what a horror film is suppose to do. It is low budget but the film team does a lot with a little.I must admit seeing and hearing the Barricuda made me want to own one.The film moves along at a good pace and never bogs down. It has been said the music will make a scene even more intense and the music in this film has that effect. The ending caught me totally off guard and I loved it.There is a few missteps in editing but that can be forgiven as the movie has become one of my must see films every Holloween.,Phantasm

199,kirbyskay2012,surprising for a no-budget horror genre effort,6,19 September 2013,"I saw this curious gem on late night TV back in the early 1980s one night when there was nothing else interesting on the other channels. Note that this was before cable TV reached our area, so there were only the three major networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) from which to choose. It was uneven in pace, very low budget, absolutely no movie stars to draw interest or even justify watching it. The production values were mediocre, the acting pretty corny, the story very thin. But, still, it had almost a hypnotic effect which locked us in place, just watching and watching without really thinking about it, and generally pretty bored, but not sufficiently motivated to change the channel. My son and I, who are avid movie buffs, normally would make comments throughout a movie, and normally have the ending plotted out well ahead of time. I remember us remarking that this was really an unbelievably lousy movie, all told. Still, we kept watching under its hypnosis and the lack of competing programs of interest on other channels.Then came the shockeroo, which woke us both up with a jolt. It occurs in Mike's outer space bedroom; however, this review will mention no further details, so as not to spoil the surprise for those who have yet to view this curious venture. It was one of those rare events in cinema that makes enduring a really lousy film totally worthwhile in contrast!Angus Scrimm, the actor who portrayed the pivotal character is this story, was strange looking and appropriately unearthly, which added to the story line. I liked the musical jam between Bill Thornberry and Reggie Bannister, which provided a bit of normalcy for a break from this otherwise weird, weird production. Reggie's ice cream truck was also a link to normalcy and brought a bit of lightness to the otherwise fairly heavy atmosphere of the plot. For the most part, the special effects are pretty corny, but they seem to fit right in somehow with the rest of the strangeness which is about all that this movie can offer. Although there were a few sequels to this original story, they were surely produced to milk easy profits from the cult which formed around this movie. But, only this first effort is worth your time or money. Watch it with the lights off and a house full of friends, to get the most enjoyment out of the experience. Don't expect very much, but follow the storyline as best you can. Like I said earlier, the event near but not exactly at the end of the movie justifies the nearly two hours of viewing to arrive at that point, but is well worth the wait!",Phantasm
200,joyomi,Great atmosphere,7,8 July 2019,"Phantasm has a great atmosphere and feels very dream like. The plot doesn't make to much sense, but the effects and the Tall Man make up for it. The movie has a foreboding feeling throughout. I would definitely recommend Phantasm.",Phantasm

I finally rented it. Thank god I didn't buy it, although I wouldn't mind having it for my collection even though I would probably never watch it again. I know I'm a huge minority here when I say that not only did I not like this film, but I really kind of hated it and felt p*ssed off after I had watched it. I can't for the life of me understand the appeal this has to people, other than sentimental reasons maybe. I thought it was boring, very slow, the story was just... I don't even have words.

202,kovandac,Cool but a little bit cheesy.,7,8 September 2010,"This movie deserves its 7 rating that its averaging at. Its a cool concept. The tall man is a great villain. The characters are cool. The plot is very cool. Some of the concepts ( gates to the other world, shrinking of human corpses for slaves, the killing sphere) are other worldy and surreal.This movie succeeded in satisfying my hunger for a cool and entertaining science fiction film. With that said, I have to warn you that there are some cheesy parts to this movie. One scene was laughable because of the over-the-top outlandish ""special effect"" and the over the top acting required to attempt to pull it off. There were also one or two scenes that will require you to suspend your capacity to reason in order to further the plot. These few things kind of cheapened the movie. But still a good movie. Better than a lot of the cheese-ball stuff thats out there. I think this movie respectably should linger from a 6-7 in the review ratings. I give it a seven.",Phantasm
203,MrGrundle,"""I must not fear, fear is the mind killer...""",8,16 June 2006,"The above lines are not (only) uttered by young Michael at the beginning of Don Coscarelli's masterpiece PHANTASM, but by young Paul Atriedes at the onset of Frank Herbert's epic and much-emulated sci-fi novel DUNE. The protagonist of each story puts his hand inside a mysterious box (in Dune, the Gom Jabaar) containing excruciating pain. The purpose of such a test is to train the mind to overcome pain, refusal to succumb to the concomitant fear. Coscarelli must have been a fan of the book, for there are numerous references throughout---the local bar is called the Dunes and it's swinging wooden sign features the same type print as the front of the novel Dune. Phantasm doesn't have quite the scope of Dune, but it is the quaint charm of certain 'small' genre productions from the late 70's that endear them so greatly to our hearts (think HALOWEEN- the title songs of these two features are very similar as well).I was not yet alive in 1977 when AvcoEmbassies saturated the country with advertisements promoting a quirky horror film essential to their own survival. By account of the special features on my DVD copy, midnight sneak previews were hosted by Angus Scrimm- appearing by surprise and in character! I speculate that much of the cult adoration surrounding this title is owed to the successful marketing of the studio. Hell, it certainly would have worked on me!Acquantances at video stores and film festivals had spoken extremely highly of PHANTASM and it took me a while to secure a copy of the DVD (why is it out of print!?) so when I finally sat down to enjoy it, it faced very high expectations. I was instantly taken by the careful lighting and camera-work, not to mention the terrific score. The acting is spotty---some of the players here probably aren't professionals---but after second and third watches this type of honesty becomes a virtue. That is, if you like the film, of course.Which I do, immensely. The plot here is ridiculous, and there are numerous flaws throughout, but as far as pure storytelling is concerned, PHANTASM is immaculate. The last half hour of the film goes way over the top, and Michael drinks and drives and carries a gun even though he is 13, but it evinces a place and a time. Ah, the late 70's, when it was OK for kids to drink beer before puberty (BAD NEWS BEARS, anyone?) and every cool teenager had a motorcycle! A time when movies didn't need a believable, or compelling, or 'good' plot to excel.I think I'll swagger down to the 'Dunes' bar for a few beers. I'll bet I'll get change back from a five....9/10* There are many reasons to take stars away from this movie, but who's counting?",Phantasm

The acting and directing style are unique yet different. With various flashbacks and flashes of scenes that you don't whether they're real or not.

208,nealnels,"My favorite movie of all time, and that's saying something!",10,5 July 2013,"The reader of this review may just want to hop on down to the third paragraph. This second one is pretty much just about me and will tell you nothing about the film. And... I'm just curious. How does One write a decent review WITHOUT revealing spoilers? Hmmm...I've been putting this off for a long time. I'm not sure I will enlighten anyone on this film more that the 244 reviews before me; so, I'm pretty sure I'm doing this for ME. Let me just preface this (for those of you who haven't visited my profile) by telling you I have a DVD problem (much like women and shoes. Take it sexist if you will but we all have one buying problem or another.) I own over 4,000 DVD's. Not as large as some (just search movie collections on tube sites) but much more than your average collection. So when I choose ""Phantasm"" as my favorite movie it's got some weight behind it. And I say MY favorite film because it's completely my opinion. I'm not here to make it yours. I used to manage a video store in Las Vegas. The last two questions I wanted to hear from a customer were, ""Is this SUPPOSED to be good?"" and, ""What do you recommend?"" To the first I would usually reply, ""I guess; the reviews are good."" To the second I would always reply, ""Nothing."" I tend to like B(ad)-Movies. Who wants to recommend a movie where the customer will come back angry? Hopefully no one. I would tell people that my opinion is most probably not theirs'. This said...The first time I saw ""Phantasm"" was in the summer of '79 at an outdoor theater in Oshkosh, Wisconsin when I was 13 1/2 years old. (Ewww, it's a math problem...) I'm just saying I was very impressionable. I'd have to say it was my first horror movie. I could not have been introduced better. ""Friday The 13th"" was still a summer away. I may have also seen ""Tourist Trap"" in '79. Good times. I thought ""Phantasm"" was a foreign film. In my mind this movie could not have come out of the U.S. And time did nothing but confirm this belief. In the following years I was to see many, many Italian horror movies. For me ""Phantasm"" fit perfectly into that way of film making. Its richly colorful palate and its barely understandable storyline, not to mention the score, placed it squarely, for me, into foreign-film brackets. And just look at the last name of the director. How Italian can you get? I used to watch their lips very closely to see if there was an English overdub. None of this is true, of course. Although Don Coscarelli was born in Libya with obviously Italian heritage. Who would guess he grew up in Long Beach, California?So what do we have here? A (foreign-looking) horror-science-fiction-mystery. One of very few, I'm sure. I dislike not understanding a storyline in a film. In fact, I'm usually the guy that figures out, very early on, how the movie is going to end. A lot of the time the way I see an ending is better than the way it usually does. So I watched ""Phantasm"" over and over and over... Until I was fairly sure I got it. I also watched the sequels many times in hopes that this would help me further understand. Keep in mind Don C. just wanted the movie to be fun. Stanley Kubrick once said, ""A film can be real or entertaining, it's very difficult to be both."" And entertaining it is! It's one of those movies you just let flow over you the first couple of times before you start picking at it. It's glossy, fast paced, and ever-so 70's. It, like many things to come in the 80's, didn't have to make sense. It just had to be cotton candy for the senses. Now I know there are a lot of you reading this and saying (probably out-loud) ""How did he not get this?"" I was 13 people! I'd (probably) seen my first R-rated film (let alone a horror movie.) My parents didn't own a VCR until 1981. And... I didn't own a copy of it until 1987. So all I had to go on was an outdoor theater experience... twice maybe. Eight years after that I was playing catch-up.My interpretation? You don't want or need that from me. Read the other 244 reviews. I'm sure they're full of interpretations and opinions. Besides, you know how I feel about recommendations. Just know that I watch ""Phantasm"" and its three sequels at least once a year. They are precious pieces of time for me. They certainly started a rather large ball rolling where my film collecting is concerned. I will give you one opinion on my way out. 75% of my favorite HORROR movies came out between '77 and '80.

Those others were amusing, but the one that frighten me the most is Phantasm, and I mean FRIGHTEN.  I discovered this little gem late one night while up cramming for a test, on my little college B&W TV.  For the next week I was afraid to open closet doors, or look in mirrors after midnight (spooky).  I definitely rank this #1 on my top ten horror films.On a side note, I never expected a video game to give me the creeps, but if you are into survival horror, and you need a chill, Silent Hill (1999) (VG), for the playstation is quite insane.

That's not to say though that its not entertaining because it most certainly is. The story does gets a little incoherent at times, probably due to how much it was cut down in the editing from nearly 3 hours to 88 mins!. The ending left me totally confused when I first watched this on on VHS as a teen in the late 80's and it was only because a more observant friend was present that I got what had gone down! It also relies a little too much on the hoary old horror trope of characters stupidly splitting up when they should stay together to drive the narrative along in places.

It is amazingly original and therefore has a number of unique aspects!Unfortunately Phantasm was done as a low budget movie, it could have been probably more, because the sphere scene in the graveyard seems very dumb to me.Although it has what a horror movie needs: an incredibly frightening and unique bad guy the tall man (Angus Scrimm) and friendly heroes who fight him!The movie is about a boy named Mike who discovers on the cemetery - he is there because a friend of his brother died (killed by the tall man) - that the undertaker takes the buried coffins out of the earth after the burring! He investigates and finds out that the tall man shrinks the bodies to create dwarfs which are his servants.Later he also finds out that the dwarfs are some kind of army that the tall man passes into another dimension - a gloomy red kind of planet in the movie, unfortunately just a few seconds to watch - and later use them to rule the earth.Mike manages to get into the graveyard but gets spotted and hunted by the tall man. He also manages to convince his brother - another amazingly original part of the movie - and their friend Reggie to help him finish up with the tall man.They get into the graveyard and open the doors to the dimension and get to know the horrendous plan of the tall man. They manage to defeat him but wasn't it all a dream? No it was not! Strange ending though!As Phantasm is only the first part of this series covering 5 parts, I would say that it is by far the best part of the series! Part 2 is only about hunting the tall man and contains really silly pseudo-erotic scenes. Part 3 is absolutely unnecessary! Whereas Part 4 becomes interesting because it tells us more about the tall man and his origins. My opinion is that part 4 should have been part 2. Let's hope that part 5 (Phantasm's End) will be a perfect ending!Phantasm gets 8.7 from 10 Points!",Phantasm

The movie really does feel like some kid's extended nightmare where nothing makes sense and just about anything can happen. That's really the only way the movie makes any sense, but it's all so cool that it doesn't matter.The music score really got under my skin and it's just as effective as John Carpenter's work for Halloween. It's simple, melodic, and terrifying. Angus Scrimm cuts a mean figure as the Tall Man and I'm pretty sure he's going to give me nightmares for years to come.",Phantasm

I remember as I was leaving the theater, good story, not enough gore. Now in my late fifties it is one of the classics from my days of youth, I can still watch. The movie somehow pulls you into this nightmare before you are even aware it. There are two scenes that seem so out of touch with the rest of the movie that makes you realize you are part of the dreamscape the director intended. One was when Reggie went home, and his maid came out of his bedroom scaring him. How a man that delivers ice cream out of a truck can afford a maid is a question never answered. The second one was when Jody had a conversation with the bartender about the pretty blonde he left with from the bar the previous night. For some reason, these two scenes, for me, seem to be a break from the nightmare with a dose of reality. The movie at the end is so convoluted it makes little sense but it doesn't matter because at this point you are ""all in"".",Phantasm

Perhaps viewing it for the first time in the 21st century just doesn't provide the necessary atmosphere to appreciate what this film is about. But for whatever reason, this movie didn't grab my attention at all. It was full of long, and as far as I can tell, pointless shots of people walking, riding bikes, driving cars, or just plain standing around. They were accompanied by spooky noises or music, but they still dragged on for way too long. Maybe that was the late 70's way of building tension, but by the time 20 minutes had gone by, I was so disenfranchised that there was no way I could be apprehensive. And this while watching it in the dead of night alone with the lights off.I love horror movies, and especially hokey ones like Evil Dead. My wife and friends start groaning whenever I go off on some movie that everyone else thinks is stupid. But this one...it just didn't work for me.",Phantasm
216,simest,Short on sense.........long on style - as close as you get to a dream on film.,8,9 August 2016,"PHANTASM is an uneven work, too fantastic to be genuinely scary but ferociously unique and fascinating on numerous levels.At the films heart, there seems a desire to create a warped and entirely original Universe where nothing is as it seems and anything can and probably will happen. Logic is quickly cast aside and indeed has no place in the crooked landscape that PHANTASM paints. Into this bizarre, Dali-like twisted and surreal cosmos, are thrust a group of characters who - perhaps even by virtue of their performers' acting inadequacies - seem somehow as much a part of the fabric of that Universe - even in their struggles to survive and make sense of it.For me, PHANTASM has a distinctly hypnotic effect for all those reasons among others. Flying sphere drills, a gender bending alien cemetery keeper, hooded shrunken corpses refined for slave labour in some parallel Universe, a severed finger that morphs into a grotesque (if admittedly comical) fly and countless other wild fantasies are all episodic nightmares that work their way into the subconscious and stay there - however well or not they may be executed. They are indeed, the essence of those darkest, unfathomable episodes that randomly invade our sleep. Raw, random and without any measure of reason. It is this very trait upon which the movie thrives.Also, the film's tendency to bounce us in and out of reality - if indeed there was ever a reality there - without warning, keeps us permanently on unstable ground. Dreams are very prominent and indeed prevalent in PHANTASM. So much so, that by the end there seems no dividing line between that which was real and which was not. In this sense, the film explored the territory that NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET would later make it's own but somehow achieves a dream-like quality that even Craven's classic would not surpass. Only Dario Argento's similarly bizarre INFERNO might challenge PHANTASM for the closest we may ever get to a dream realised on film.PHANTASM is a unique, mind bending vision of quaint, small town America, infused with hellish fantasies of death, loss and isolation, unleashed from the subconscious mind - perhaps even in the end, from that of it's young, insecure and lonely adolescent protagonist.Poe said ""Is all that we see or seem, but a dream within a dream?""PHANTASM presents a case.I urge those who are not impressed, to watch it again with these notions in mind.",Phantasm

The plot is probably one of the most original i've seen and heard of(I mean who's gonna think up this?). The one flaw is in the start of the film I found Mike to be a little ""annoying"" the way he practically stalked his brother, but in the end I ended up liking Mike and had no problems with the character development. Now if you want a creepy boogeyman you've found one with the Tall Man he has no dought changed the meaning of he word ""BOOOOYYYYY"" in my mind!

He wasn't dead, and he didn't wear a mask he was a simple character. I also found the special affects really good for this movie since it was made so long ago. If you like the horror movies of the 70's and 80's you have to check this flick out.

Usually, they are just a bunch of stupid teens doing stupid things. But here, it's not the case! They have a story, some depth to them, likable personalities, and most importantly; a motive!The spheres are a really cool concept for an outer worldly weapon. Who would of thought that a simple orb could be so deadly? It's simple, but it works!The story is a little typical, but all of the elements mentioned above really make it work greatly!Overall, i highly recommend it to every horror fan out there who hasn't seen it.Remember, if this one doesn't scare you; you're already dead!",Phantasm

Secondly, the haunting synthesiser score adds a good deal to the tension in much the same way that John Carpenters excellent scores did to his works. On top of all this, Reggie Bannister (as himself) is one of the great 'anti-heros' in modern horror - up there with Bruce Campbell in the 'Evil Dead' films. As for 'The Tall man', the eponymous villain of the film well, what can be said that hasn't been said before? A classic horror film villain with many a trick up his sleeve.When I first watched this film I did not pick up on the subtle (and downright confusing) ending and therefore came away with the strong feeling that I had missed something, a feeling which somewhat spoiled the enjoyment of the film. Thanks to a repeat viewing and a bit of scrutiny of the message boards on this site I feel that I now understand the 'dream' part of the ending and must conclude that this really is a rare gem of a film, entertaining enough for cheap scare fans, gory enough for gore hounds and intriguing enough for those who like deeper meanings in their films.

From the opening graveyard scene to middle to end this movie will not only spook you out, but also creep you out. (The flying silver ball?)

It really keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end and there are some laughs along the way as well! If you get a chance to see this on a large movie screen, I strongly recommend it. I do not believe they play it in too many places any more except at horror film festivals. My rating for this movie at the theater improves to ""9"" because the larger screen is better for the many suspense scenes and especially the silver sphere scenes. You also get the reactions of the other viewers and that made it special the first time I viewed it. It was shown as a double feature with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. Those were the days! Thankfully with the large flat screen TV's, it makes for better home viewing on DVD than back in the 80's and 90's.Director Don Coscarelli has a great knack for timing throughout this movie. He throws a lot at you, too. Some of it seems to make sense and some does not. That is what makes it so special. Angus Scrimm as a tall sinister funeral director is fantastic. Reggie Bannister adds great comic relief as an ice cream truck salesman. He has some of the funniest dialog in the movie. If you are the type that think there should be zero humor in a suspense movie, downgrade this to a ""7"", but I disagree.The main protagonist is a thirteen year old child named Jody played by Michael Baldwin and he does a great job. His older brother is always trying to keep him out of mischief and the scenes between them are great.Finally, there are supernatural and special effects features that are fascinating and well done considering it was 1979.

1. Fond memories of the film being VERY scary when I saw it originally in the theater (1979).
2. Nearly 25 years later, a re-watch on VHS with a friend left a muddy image of the film (original review unedited below).
Bad quality, dark, mumbled dialog, bad sound; just this side of awful.
3. Now, with the re-re-re-release onto Blu-Ray my opinion has changed once again.
The magic has returned! The film is amazing with the image/sound quality restored!
A CLASSIC once again!(My original IMDb review)
Although, I do think the film to be a classic, I first saw this film in 1979 and it scared the bejesus out of me. It was one of my favorite horror films due to its originality and Sci-Fi twists.However, nearly 25 years later, the film is often crude and, after viewing it with a friend, I found it to be quite tedious. Many films, including Night of the Living Dead, The Omen, The Exorcist, Halloween and even Friday the 13th, hold onto their ""oomph"" factor. Sadly to say, while Phantasm still holds a fond memory for me, this recent viewing left the film a bit weak in my opinion.Also, as I remember ... PT 2 kinda bit; the only greatly remembered aspect was 'ball's-eye-view.' And I do remember the series got better with PT III and IV. All the Phantasm features played lightly on current film trends and I sorta recommend the original if you want to follow the story as a PT V may be on the horizon.",Phantasm

The pace of the movie would generously be described as languid... many scenes linger on even when there's nothing left to see.What was with the girl and her grandmother?

I understand that the budget was low and it was not yet the prime of modern horror, but Phantasm offers little to nothing as a so called ""classic film"".Aside from the darkly lit nights and the 70's hairstyles, the movie offers minimum 1970s nostalgia. As for the movie itself, the story just seems undecided and filled with gaps. How a group of filmmakers got together and decided to make a movie based on this script is very surprising.In the end, nothing really happens in this movie. There's a few cool scenes with a Tall Man, one gory scene with a flying orb, and little dwarfs running amok from another dimension. All these elements could make for one hell of a gory/cheesy/nostalgic midnight movie, but they just don't. The most offensive part is the confusing and nonlinear ending.

The acting is terrible. And the script is filled with major flaws, which is accompanied by slow paced action. I think the film could have concentrated more on what the tall man was actually trying to accomplish and what his world really was. Instead, the film takes us back and forth the mortuary and the brother's house. I think Reggie is abducted from his house on three different occasions. I realize this was all a dream, but it has so many inconsistencies. The only thing I liked about the movie was the extremely cool weapon that glides through the morgue, trying to kill anything in its path. The scene portraying the accidental death of one of the inn keepers is well executed.

241,warbuch,"Great imagery and atmosphere, lame story and characters",6,25 October 2021,"The atmosphere and tone of this film is unsettling and strange; it's easy to see how it was influenced by surrealism and arthouse cinema, as well as how it helped shape cosmic horror films for years to come. There's some wonderful set design, primarily in the mausoleum, and the darkness of certain shots and the way people/objects/lights seem to appear and disappear out of thin air is really great. The weird cosmic horror angle also works well, keeping you guessing as to what the rules of this world are, if there are any.Only problem is, there's really a lot of junk that could be cut. For all of the creepy, cosmic imagery, there's also children wearing robes chasing people, weird gnashing sounds that aren't very creepy but are rather just silly, and the main villain in The Tall Man is almost criminally not as scary as he should be, nor as tall! Most of the ""scares"" in the film are wasted little jump scares and chase sequences, or off-screen noises that aren't that inspired. The woman in velvet is less of a menacing killer and more of a silly death trap (the way she stabs people looks so gentle and cautious that there's very little violence to it). The strange bug creature is weird, the yellow blood is more silly than alarming, and the flying sphere is effectively neutered the moment it actually starts to drill into a dude's head and a fount of blood shoots out. In today's film era, the flying sphere would just be that, yet would probably have enough ""oomph"" to wreak havoc without needing silly spears on the end of it. Also, The Tall Man would actually be tall (see ""The Haunting of Hill House"" on Netflix for a good, creepy tall guy).The characters are thin, and kind of off-putting. Like the main guy and his younger brother kinda work, but what's up with the balding ice cream man Reggie? He's such an unintended unsettling presence that detracts from the whole thing every time he's around. It's also strange how little people there are in this film (I know it was low budget, but still) and yet when two female characters appear, they're gone within five minutes, and never seen again. I understand a lot was cut from the film in terms of story, but the thin backstory of the brothers' parents dying has no real payoff, especially considering the ""twist"" ending. The explanation for who/what The Tall Man is kinda works, though it's also still pretty silly. Lastly, there's an absurd amount of guns in this film. The boys arm up like five times, and each time it's a bit ridiculous, feeling almost forced and reckless. Sure, slasher flicks would be over a lot quicker if everyone had guns on them, but in this sort of cerebral cosmic spooky flick, they feel out of place.I can understand the influence this film has on horror, but watching it now is a bit of a pain. Still, I'm saying this 40+ years after it came out so the fact that much of it does actually hold up is still a testament to its craftsmanship and vision.",Phantasm

243,blackknight273,I'm amazed this one is only 6.6 at IMDb! It deserves much better.,10,20 June 2009,"As a ""Phan"" I will concede some things that most ""phans"" won't. For one Coscarelli copied and pasted elements of just about every Horror, and SF movie and book pre 1978. He claims that the black robed dwarfs similarity to the Jawas in Star Wars was unintentional and pure coincidence. However if you look at the sphere it is fairly obvious that this was borrowed from Star Wars as well (the light saber trainer, and the ""torture ball"" in the interrogation scene between Vader and Princess Leia). He also ""borrows"" quite heavily from 1976's Burnt Offerings which not only used the same creepy mansion (The Dunsmuir Mansion) and even had a tall gaunt man who drove a hearse. Add to that some references from Frank Herbert's Dune, Plan 9 From Outer Space, Invaders From Mars, The Exorcist, Salems Lot and Suspiria. Still this movie works, and in some cases works better than those Coscarelli borrowed from.Yes you have to overlook some plot holes, bad (but well meaning) acting, and the borrowed elements of the story. What most people are forgetting is that this is essentially a movie about relationships. The bond between two brothers, the younger brother's fears of abandonment after already losing his parents a few years before, and his older brothers need to see the world why he is still young. It also touches on our fear of the unknown - especially death and what comes after.Mike is a thirteen year old in a small rural California town, who lives with his twenty something brother Jody. When one of Jody's friends is murdered (it's ruled a suicide which gets the weirdness going early), he is forbidden by his brother to go to the funeral after he had what is hinted at a breakdown after his parents death (more on this later). Being a typical thirteen year old who is told the word ""no"" by an adult, Mike does what any thirteen year old would do - he sneaks out to see the funeral. While this could be seen as a typical case of teenage rebellion, there is also Mike's problems with abandonment. As you find out later Mike follows Jody everywhere, not just to make sure he doesn't leave, but also in Mike's thinking as Jody's protector.After the funeral Mike witnesses mortician aka the Tall Man lift the coffin from the gravesite back into the hearse by himself and drive off. He realizes he sees something that is impossible and knows something strange and probably evil is going on at the mortuary, and sets out to convince his brother. His brother of course chalks it up to an overactive imagination, and dismissses it. Finally after a series of nightmares and strange encounters with the Tall Man, Mike sets out to prove once and for all that his fears are justified, which he finds out quickly are quite justified.. The rest you should see for yourself if you haven't already.SPOILERS One of the things I liked at the end was how not only Mike was considerably older looking at the very end of the movie (check the scene where he wakes up, then look at how he looks barely thirteen through the rest of the movie). He looks like he is about fifteen in the last five minutes. Another thing you notice upon returning to his room, that his room is completely different - the last few minutes are a different house entirely. He also reaches for a bottle of meds which gives you the impression the kid has had a pretty tough ride over the past year or so. It's a great setup for what comes next - the infamous ending which makes you question what was actually a dream, and what wasn't.",Phantasm
244,beingjohncarpenter,I loved it. Just wish Eli Roth starred in it and got killed!,10,10 April 2007,"Jody (Bill Thornbury) and Reggie (Reggie Bannister) attend the funeral of their friend Tommy, who apparently took his own life. Jody's teenage brother Mike (Michael Baldwin), who Jody looks after, isn't invited, because after the funeral of his parents he had nightmares for weeks. Nevertheless, Mike is secretly spying on the events at the Morningside Funeral Home from his hiding place in the bushes, and is surprised to see that after the mourners leave, a tall man (Angus Scrimm) picks up the heavy coffin on his own and pushes it into the back of his hearse. Couple that sight with the nagging feeling that he is being watched by something unseen, and Mike suffers a growing dread about what is really happening in the mausoleum...An example of the wonders you can achieve on a low budget, Phantasm was scripted (and edited, and shot) by its young director, Don Coscarelli, who wasn't afraid to give his imagination free rein in the story department. Starting off in the time honoured manner of many horror films, with its youthful protagonist trying and failing to convince anyone, but especially his older brother, that evil is present in their small town, it works itself up into a relentless series of bizarre setpieces, without bothering to pay much attention to having it all make sense.After nobody listens to him, Mike decides to collect evidence of the supernatural goings-on on his own, by breaking into the funeral home. Wandering the shadowy store rooms and grey corridors, he is suddenly chased by a flying silver sphere, which, in the film's most famous scene, pursues him until it is embedded in the head of a caretaker at the home, drills through the hapless man's skull, and drains his blood from a hole in the opposite side. And that's not all, as Mike is pursued by the Tall Man, trapping his fingers in a heavy door, then cutting them off, sticking one of the still-moving digits in his pocket, and escaping out of the window, narrowly avoiding being grabbed by cowled dwarfs.Despite being set around a cemetery, Phantasm doesn't fall victim to the clichés of past crypt-based chillers by adding in vampires, zombies or ghosts. Sure, it has its fair share of coffins, and gravestones do erupt from the ground at one point, but there's a macabre, science fiction twist to who the Tall Man is and what he is up to. As far as I can work out, he hails from another dimension and is harvesting the dead to transform them into wicked, diminutive slaves - sort of Jawas gone bad. Presumably to push the numbers up, the Tall Man also turns into a woman and seduces unwary men in the graveyard, only to kill them at the crucial moment, which is what happened to Tommy.By only following plot logic as far as it takes each scene into the next, the film could be needlessly confusing, but the accumulation of weirdness mainly for effect is an unexpected bonus to the production. The more strange things happen, the more Phantasm becomes like a nightmare, even if there are clunky bits of business as when the panicked Jody is confronted with his own car driving up to him (after a long pause it's revealed Mike is behind the wheel). It features more imagination than many, more expensive films, and in spite of its amateurish quality it rightly became a cult success. Followed by three sequels, which are more or less variations on the same theme. Music by Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave.",Phantasm

248,T-bird-7,30 years later and still rockin',7,6 January 2009,"OK, I saw this movie in 1979. I was 13 at the time, just like Mike in the movie. Well, I liked it a lot. I found it superb, flawless, scary, and I could go on and on. But I was 13 years old. I never saw ""Phantasm"" again, not even a segment on TV, never. Today, 30 years later, I watched it again with my wife. Scared? Sure I was scared. Scared to discover that the perfect movie that I still remembered from my skate and moped days was - in reality - a very mediocre film, with low budget, bad acting and embarrassing special effects. I was wrong. Definitely wrong. I liked it again, and this time I appreciated things that I couldn't notice when I first saw it, like the ingenious use of light, cut scenes and flashbacks (or forward?). The acting is not superb, but it doesn't matter. Effects are a little too-low budget, but again it doesn't matter. What's really important is the atmosphere that Coscarelli creates, full of dark forebodings yet very normal. Fantastic. It was a pleasure to hear the first notes of its ""Carpenterish"" score, and to see the Tall Man again. As the movie went on, I remembered every scene, it was just like tasting a cake little by little.They don't make movies like this anymore. My advice? Highly recommendable!!!",Phantasm
249,horrorreviews123,A Cult Favorite,8,8 July 2010,"Not much can be said about Phantasm to encourage a person who hasn't seen it to search out a copy and give it a watch. Phantasm is simply one of those movies you either love or hate, and there's no other opinion of it. People who respect 1970's horror flicks and b-movies typically respect Phantasm and what it has to offer, but people unfamiliar with the genre or can't appreciate films before their time will not understand the appeal behind the film.Phantasm isn't a movie that can be summed up in a simple plot synopsis. The story leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and it flows almost like the typical nightmare would. It starts off as a fairly normal film, but unravels into one of the most obscure American horror films. Questions are given but aren't answered, new side plots are started but aren't ended, the movies lacks continuity, and the atmosphere is surreal. Before the movie ends, the viewer will give up any and all hope of following the story. Many will be frustrated by this, but others will appreciate the dream-like quality and nightmarish atmosphere that movies like this should strive for. It's almost as if the movie is trying to imitate an Italian film from Dario Argento or Lucio Fulci.The atmosphere of the film is put out by the qualities that blend together like the spices in a Mexican burrito. The music is haunting, unique, and catchy. The visuals, the pace, the scares, and the location are all unique in their own right. Even though we've seen all of these in other films, none were ever presented in this fashion. The scares in Phantasm are driven by visuals, as the visuals are enough to be unsettling. The film is loaded with your typical jump scares, but these come off as more effective since you can almost see them coming in advance.The small town location has been attempted many times, but in Phantasm it's done extremely well as the town appears deserted throughout the film. There are never extras filling the sidewalks, cars driving by, or even a bird chirping in the background. It's this quietness that separates the quality of the first Phantasm from its sequels. Sure, the score may be turned up all the way, there might be gunfights, and there might even be a gore scene or two, but it never feels like an over-the-top action movie. This is where the sequels missed the mark, and it's almost disappointing. Of course the sequels had remarkably higher budgets than Phantasm 1, giving Phantasm 1 the grainy, quiet look of most low budget movies of the time.Of course no one can forget the Tall Man. One of the most unique villains portrayed by Angus Scrimm perfectly. Once again, the Tall Man is a quiet character. He never runs, he never kills anyone on screen, but you still understand that he's a dangerous character. This doesn't mean that the movie is lacking in action. Everyone remembers the famous ""flying sphere"" sequence that almost earned Phantasm an X-rating.The negatives of the film come with the positives. A surreal, nightmarish story will confuse a lot of viewers, leaving them dissatisfied with the film. Phantasm was also made with a low budget, implying the amateurish look and feel that can sometimes glares through the talent. Phantasm is one of those films that you have to decide for yourself if you will like it or not. If you think you'll like it, then you probably will. If you aren't too sure, then you probably won't care for it that much.Phantasm stands as a landmark b-movie from the 1970s. It started one of the most popular cult franchises of all time, as well as holding onto its own status as a cult favorite. It's Director Don Coscareli's best film, although Bubba-Ho-Tep gives it a run for its money.I recommend searching out the film and buying a copy for yourself. If you're interesting in films like the Beyond, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973), or Halloween (1978) then you might enjoy it. Phantasm is a unique movie that demands multiple viewings. Fans of 1970's cult horror classics should enjoy it, but fans of newer horror films and people who prefer a solid story may not see the appeal.",Phantasm

Michael Baldwin looks like an ugly little girl with a speech problem and everyone around him (especially the character of Jody) shows about as much emotion as a rock. This is an incredibly disappointing film.

The dialog is somewhat clumsy (""Boy!"", LOL) and the movie appeared to be really oddly cut leaving the feeling that you missed something. It is easy to see it as an average horror flick, but the movie is far from that.For my viewing experience these perceivable problems of the movie actually contributed heavily into creating a surreal feel, and the movie haunted me long after viewing, like a memory of a really creepy and weird dream. I also have to give the movie credit for the use of sound, as it played a big factor in creating this experience, with memorable soundtrack and the eerie voice of the Tall Man.So basically, the movie works as a whole and it makes its flaws work for its favor.

While at times I appreciated the subtle nuances of this movie there was a large tendency to drag scenes out waaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to much. Initially I withheld from fast forwarding through the repeated shots of cars driving or the Mike/Jodie walking somewhere. I figured that the director was trying to build some kind of prolonged tension. Eventually I just had to hit the button as most of this footage did nothing for the movie at all. In a word ""slow"".

266,vendividiviciousss,Iconic and brilliant horror film,10,9 August 2016,"As far as horror films go, Phantasm is a film with much on its mind. It is at once an elegiac meditation on life and death, a poignant story of a boy on the verge of manhood, while also serving as a macabre funhouse ride, bouncing recklessly between reality and the dreamworld, offering a robust mythology encompassing alternate dimensions, zombie dwarfs, and, most iconically, flying silver spheres that drill into the brains of their victims.The story is set in small town America circa the late 1970s, and focuses on two young men, 13-year-old Michael and his older brother Jody, in the wake of the tragic death of their parents. Jody has taken a break from his exciting life as a musician on the road to take care of his little brother, who idolizes Jody to the point of following him around town, in the fear that he will one day abandon him as their parents did. Michael's constant surveillance of his brother leads him to Morningside Cemetery, where Jody attends a friend's funeral, after which, Michael witnesses Morningside's enigmatic undertaker, known only as the Tall Man, scoop up the 200-pound casket in his arms, toss it back into the hearse, and drive off, leaving an empty grave. From there, the film's focus turns to Michael's investigation of Morningside, eventually uncovering the Tall Man's fiendish plot to wipe out the entire town in order to resurrect their corpses as demonic dwarfs and use them as servants in his ever-growing army of the undead.The loss of liberty, characterized by enslavement and brainwashing, is the central issue in the film. Those unlucky enough to be buried in a Morningside Cemetery plot are dug up by the Tall Man, shrunk down to dwarfs, and resurrected, only to serve for all eternity as the mindless minions under his control, tasked with furthering his reign of terror and harvesting more cadavers for his army of ghouls. It is no coincidence that the Morningside Funeral Home greatly resembles a Southern plantation (the shooting location was the historic Dunsmuir estate in Oakland), just as the Tall Man is dressed impeccably as a Southern gentleman of considerable means, for the character is playing the role of slavemaster, and his dwarfs, gravediggers, and murderous spheres are his slaves.",Phantasm

One must take into consideration the circumstances behind the production being reviewed, like budget, age of director, means of distribution. etc (the intangibles are endless). So with that disclaimer out of the way, here we go.....Phantasm is without a doubt, one of the most original horror, sci-fi,drama,comedy films of all time. (Did not realize that was a genre of film until now, how ingenious.Don't forget,made in 1979!) It is about a small town under siege by an other worldly, sinister, mortician. The story takes so many twists and turns, it is better watched then described. There IS plenty of character development, that is what made Phantasm so appealing. Even after witnessing something outlandish, because of the sense of family established throughout the film, you sort of entertain the thought that it could happen in Small Town, USA. You do care what happens to the brother's,and/or their friends. At it's foundation, Phantasm is about the loss of loved one's,and the impossibility of escaping death. Another innovative move on Don Coscarelli's part was making the hero , a young, innocent boy,who must confront evil in of all places, a creepy mausoleum.So all you nay sayers, next time you pass judgment, make sure you ""peel back all the layer's"" before you criticize the ""core"".This movie has stood the test of time, over 25 years.",Phantasm

The very first time that I ever saw this movie, I just feel in love with it. It really had me scared, and I love horror movies. That silver ball. Phantasm is my all time favorite of horror movies. This is definitely a movie you must buy it. The Tall Man, is a great actor, with his line ""BOY!!!!!!!!"" On a scale of 1-10, i rate this movie a 10+. I recommend this movies to all my friends. You have got to but this movie. As well as the sequels to it. Buy this movie. Watch it. Collect this one and the sequels. Savor them. They don't make horror movies today like these anymore.",Phantasm
273,mark_ferrell9105,i thought this movie was great,8,24 July 2006,this movie was great in my book especially for the time and the budget they was on the only thing i didn't really like was the ending then i had to wait ten years for the sequel but it kinda left u in surprise which is my kinda movie number 2 was basically filler because it didn't have Michael Baldwin in it or bill Throneberry which in my mind kinda took away from the movie but they returned with phantasm 3 which was a pretty great movie in my mind there was a lot more action in the third title than in the second then phantasm 4 came and i love that title like i said its a very suspenseful movie which i like and i really hope they come out with a third one before Angus dies cause u know poor old Angus can't live forever hes already 77 and plus he makes the movie happen in my mind but the phantasm series definitely has to be one of the greatest and more morbid horrors type films in the world,Phantasm
274,sean-gelles,Bad student film,1,26 October 2019,"I don't know why this picture has a cult following. It does have one or two very well crafted horror shots and the score is pretty good. Other than that it's barely watchable. The narrative is too ridiculous to be frightening. I see some fans playing up this idea of it being about death and loss and I agree that those can be powerful themes. However that doesn't redeem this movie because its few qualities get lost in the endless repetition of the same sequences, the terrible performances of the actors, and the amateurish overly contrived plot. It might have been okay if it had been shortened to a 22-minute TV episode. As a feature length film it's a catastrophe.",Phantasm
275,marcandonie001,The Music sets the 70's mood...,9,26 April 2008,"What an incredible feat for a few kids right out of high school. Don C. was just 20 years old when he wrote and directed this rivalry to other cult horror greats in the late 70's. For those who lived and waited for the possibility that the Soviet Union would be confused in some sort of war game and drop the """" on us, these movies did just as Stephen King said in ""Danse Macabre"". It performed catharsis in us at the time that we needed it. The layering of sublime funeral music was so sweeping that it became, in my opinion a fundamental aspect of the film. I went to one filming location of this film, Julian California, and was always surprised to find some of the plank boardwalks the Tallman walks on still there...lets not forget the incredible '70 Cuda eh!!I hope you enjoy the film...",Phantasm

My tastes and appreciation of films have evolved a lot over the years. This movie is truly awful. One of the worst that I've ever seen in my life. The only redeeming thing in it is the car, a '71 Plymouth 'cuda 440-6, a classic muscle car but not worth sitting through 90 minutes of schlock.",Phantasm

279,markdouglas303,Phantasm is Terrific!,10,20 November 2012,"The movie scared the hell out of me the first time I watched it. Phantasm also still holds up in the Horror Genre still to this day. I am very proud to say the special features on the disc were equally amazing. This film is definitely worth a watch or two... or three. The film has everything a horror movie should have. For an example: Scares, Laughs, a great pacing, a ""phantastic"" score, and some action and gore! This movie definitely represents the 70's horror genre at its best. Unfortunately the sequels are terrible, and never seem to wrap the story up. One thing I have never understood though was, who was the tall man, and why was he doing what he was doing? Is it another dimension? Was it all imaginary? Was it planetary? What the heck is going on? Never the less, this movie is amazing!",Phantasm
280,chrislawnsandgardens,SO bad all around,5,17 August 2013,"so i just finished this horribly acted terribly scored pointless, um THING. I don't know why i watched the whole movie, i kept waiting for something to happen because the reviews that i had read before viewing the film were complementary to say the least, in fact a lot of people really liked it. i am not one of those people. In fact i really disliked it. the music made me want to stab myself in the ear holes so i never have to hear such pointless synth noise (trying to make something about the movie scary, fail fail fail) there is nothing about this movie i liked and i recommend this to no one. seriously this movie was so unintelligent and boring i cant believe they made another 3 of them. on the other hand. nightbreed (cabal cut) is awesome and interesting and worth a viewing.",Phantasm

Many parts I had forgotten. 1.5 hours went by too fast! Extremely well written and executed. BOOOOOYYYYYYY! Angus Scrimm plays the Tall Man Masterfully. I would like to have seen more of the ""alien"" world... if that is what it is. Was a little put off by the way they transitioned into Phantasm 2. I miss Mike's Brother, and it is a mystery what happened to him. How to fill 10 lines, omg, it is hard without giving away spoilers. However, I must say this is a classic and any fan of Horror Movies must watch it. I am re-watching the entire series so that I can get to Ravager! Can't wait.",Phantasm
282,quirkylime,Most awful film of my life.,1,6 June 2005,"This is definitely one of the worst films I've seen in my life. The acting, if you can call it that, is horrendous. The plot, once discovered, is laughably weak. Even the villains in this movie fail to be frightening. The dwarfs actually caused those around me to laugh out loud and the little sphere that is supposed to frighten does nothing even close to that. There is nothing I can find in this movies that is even slightly redeeming, and the fact that it's a cult classic makes me wonder what people are thinking to turn this piece of utter trash into any kind of classic. Honestly, after watching this movie, I was angry that I had wasted two hours of my life, and the person who picked the movie promptly received a verbal thrashing from all who had watched Phantasm. Please, don't watch this horrible excuse for a film. The only thing even that is scary is the fact that people actually made this film. What was anyone involved in this film thinking?!?! So, if anyone around ever suggest watching Phantasm, run far far away.",Phantasm
283,joemeredith1,"Surreal, Strange and Superb!",10,5 November 2005,"I heard about this film some time ago when some friends were talking about 'That film with the flying killer ball', and Phantasm was that film. I found the idea of a film about an alien grave robber and his killer spheres quite disturbing and wasn't sure I'd like it...but after hearing of the release of all 4 films I began to be more and more intrigued. I'm glad I've seen the film - its an excellent mix of horror and Sci-Fi with its fair share of moments to make you jump (for example the part where Jody is snooping round the Mausoleum and the Tall Man's hand clamps down on his shoulder). The killer sphere scene resulted in the film getting an X rating in the UK originally, but it seems a bit tame by todays standards to be honest, though its still a good scene. Another eerily effective scene is when Mike falls through the Tall Mans space gate and sees the line of dwarfs walking off into the distance - especially when you hear the sound effects of their low growls as well. The film is remarkable when you think that it was made on a small budget over a relatively long period - about two years filming at weekends only. The acting is OK, with Angus Scrimm the standout as the Tall Man. I would say this is the best of the Phantasm series, though they are all excellent, with Phantasm III possibly the weaker of the saga.",Phantasm
284,johnsmithnumberone,Best horror film ever,10,12 May 2015,"For me it's the best horror film ever because it made me think a lot. Phantasm is unique because everyone who watches it can have his own different opinion of what is happening there. And no one is right or wrong. In my opinion in reality there is no The Tall Man. But there is just a local undertaker with a little bit strange appearance as we see him in the scene where he invites Jody and Reggie to the funeral or in the scene near Reggie's truck. But all his supernatural abilities, the dwarfs, the spheres are only in Mike's nightmares. And these nightmares are the reaction to the things that happened earlier(death of his parents) or are happening (Jody's probable departure) in the film. Mike is scared and depressed because of them in reality. And in his dreams The Tall Man comes with all his stuff as the quintessential symbol of all Mike's fears. And we can see that some things to which adults often don't pay much attention (fear of losing parents or close friends, for example) for children can be compared to the awful things that The Tall Man does in Mike's dreams. And the ending of the film speaks for itself. Until Jody was with Mike in reality The Tall Man was close but he could never catch him in his dreams. And once Mike knew Jody left (and left forever - he didn't go as Mike had feared, he was killed in the road accident) The Tall Man caught the boy and dragged him away. All in all Phantasm is a unique horror film. It has great music, unforgettable dreamlike atmosphere. And it has sense.",Phantasm
285,thecourtenayboy,Possibly the worst Horror ever,1,22 July 2005,"I have only seen 1 film that was worse than this and that was Shark Attack 3. Anyway, I know its an old film, and that these days its never going to be as scary as it once was, but this was really disappointing. I watched it with 2 friends who both fell asleep half way through it, which kind of says it all. Maybe the reason it didn't enter the mainstream was more to do with the fact that it wasn't a good film. Generally there's a reason why poor films tend to get almost forgotten about.For a gold old skool horror, stick to something like Halloween, Friday 13th, Dawn of the Dead (or even better, the new version!)",Phantasm
286,papawoody12,Worst Movie Ever. . . Seriously,1,23 June 2006,"Before actually seeing the movie, my good friend, and reliable source when it comes to cult horror movies told me that this movie was awesome. So i decided to purchase it on VHS since it was cheap.One day I decided to pop it in and have a gander. It was very clear from the opening scene, to the final scene that this movie was actually worse than the movie gili. For that matter, id actually rather eat ten tubes of tooth paste then immedatley after chug a liter of Listerine. If I had to choose between watching this movie and paying my taxes, id deffinatley rather pay my taxes. To quite simply put it, this movie is to the cult horror movie industry, what the video game E.T. is to the atari. No blood, no action, no nothing. If your a fan of 3 seconds of full frontal nudity and no action in your horror movies, then go right ahead and watch this. But I highly advise you to avoid watching this movie at all costs. I'm serious.",Phantasm
