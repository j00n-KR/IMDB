0,MartinHafer,So what if a 54 year-old guy hates it!,2,1 November 2018,"The audience intended for ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D"" is for kids to about age 11...at the most. So, having another review by an adult saying they hated the film isn't anything unusual or even totally necessary. The important thing is will kids enjoy this film that has managed to land on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list? I don't know....and assume for many of them the answer is no...though I am not sure.So why did I watch the movie? After all, I am not a kid and the film, by many standards, is terrible. It's because I have a weird hobby...watching as many films as I can from the Bottom 100 list. Some of the pictures aren't that bad...some are unintentionally funny...some are just terrible....it's quite the adventure seeing which is the case for each film.When I first started watching the movie, I was taken aback by the CGI. While it's one of the earliest CGI-intensive live-action films, compared to similar pictures (such as ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow""), it is hideous. Much of it is due to the color palate...and the colors heavily lean towards neon green, neon purple and neon pink. It's an assault on the eyes and my eyes kept threatening to either bleed or run away and leave me!! For adults, this alone make the film horrid...though kids often love garish colors (as seen in such movies as ""The Oogieloves"" and TV shows like ""Teletubbies"").The story is about a loner, Max, and his two new friends, Sharkboy and Lavagirl, and their attempt to save the world. The friends have obvious super-powers...so why do they need Max? Well, down deep he does have powers...the power of dreams (yick!). And, together they attempt to rid the world of its worst menace....George Lopez.I hated the film. The writing was sloppy, filled with cliches and the characters seemed like caricatures. To say the movie was like a bigger budgeted bad Nickelodeon live-action show is pretty much on target. But, and I must repeat, it was never intended to please adults....though making it this tough to enjoy hurt marketing because parents (at least sane ones) don't send little kids to the theaters alone....and imagining any parent sitting though this is pretty tough! In additon to the terrible writing and CGI, special attention should be given to George Lopez and his rotten and one-dimensional acting. You can't blame the kids for being bad and in a bad film...but Lopez should have known better. I wonder if he could look at himself in the mirror after making this mess. I hope not.Finally, I would love to know how this film cost $50,000,000 to make. After all, the CGI isn't good and was apparently rushed. Perhaps the bulk of the money went to Robert Rodriguez. After all, he has something like a dozen credits in this movie...writing, directing, acting and much more. Regardless, it seems like for the money, it should have been much better.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
1,TheLittleSongbird,Awful,1,9 January 2011,"I personally have no real problem with 3D, as long as it is done well and has a good story and characters. Sadly, that's where The Adventures of SharkBoy and Lava Girl fails. I like Robert Rodriguez and thought his first two Spy Kids movies were very enjoyable and while mediocre I actually thought the third Spy Kids film was better than this too. I will give some credit, the moral is decent if hardly original and there is some energy. But everything else falls flat.People might say the art direction was colourful and pleasing to the eye. Sorry, for me it was very tacky, gaudy and brash. And as for the 3D, it is actually some of the worst I've seen, it needed more clarity and sharpness and sometimes moved too fast. Also I found it distracting in alternative to enhancing. The soundtrack is rather plodding, generic and unmemorable too.The script is absolutely awful too. Any parts that tried to be funny made me roll my eyes to be perfectly honest with you, while the story is unevenly paced and very weak and predictable. The characters are just as weak and bland too, the two main characters have their likable moments but there is little chemistry between them and the audience while the supporting characters fare even worse suffering either from being underused or overacted. Overall, the acting is very uneven and way too broad in some cases.Other disappointments are the poor pace and plodding direction from Rodriguez. So in conclusion, the result is a pretty awful, overstuffed and disappointing effort of a family film. 1/10 Bethany Cox",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
2,bkoganbing,Charming Children's Tale,7,2 June 2010,"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D was probably better to be seen in the theater rather than on the small screen. It also helps to be not over the age of 9.Still bearing that in mind and trying to view the film with a child's eye it's a charming story about a young kid whose make believe fantasy superhero friends come to life and take him to where one of them is from. How'd you like to live on planet drool, as if some us might not live there already. That's where Lavagirl is from and the planet is in danger where kids are being held captive on an eternally moving roller-coaster. When one is on such a machine one hasn't the time to think or even daydream and in this world imagination is the enemy of the ruler, George Lopez who in a Wizard of Oz like turn is also the 3rd grade teacher in real life.Cayden Boyd is the day dreaming Max who even keeps a journal of the adventures of his two friends. Taylor Lautner and Taylor Dooley are Sharkboy and Lavagirl, Lautner has certainly grown up and out in the past five years and now has some considerable box office pull with the Twilight films. David Arquette and Kristin Davis are Boyd's bickering parents who don't quite seem to have the time for their kid any longer.Sharkboy and Lavagirl is a nice family film for those who have an eye for fantasy of The Wizard Of Oz kind.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
3,Leofwine_draca,Mindlessly moronic,3,14 April 2019,"THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL is another mindlessly moronic kid's adventure film from slumming-it director Robert Rodriguez. It might as well be a SPY KIDS sequel albeit with a different cast. The only amusing part is seeing twilight actor Taylor Lautner as a kid, and realising his acting talent hasn't changed at all in the intervening years. The story is a mundane one about a kid who enters a dream world to fight a maniacal villain; the characters in the world are inspired by real-life counterparts, as in THE WIZARD OF OZ. What this leads to isn't much, with endless lowbrow humour and awful CGI effects throughout.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
4,SnoopyStyle,CGI overload craziness,3,28 September 2015,"Max is ridiculed by the kids in Mr. Electricidad (George Lopez)'s class for making up stories about Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner) and Lavagirl. He writes it all in his notebook. Class bully Linus steals the notebook. Only Marissa (Sasha Pieterse) appreciates his stories. His father (David Arquette) like his imagination but his mother (Kristin Davis) wants him to stop. Strange things are happening. Then Sharkboy and Lavagirl come to take Max to help save the planet Drool.I didn't watch this in 3D. Honestly I don't think I would like the sensory overload of Robert Rodriguez's CGI world. Instead of a fun action adventure, this gets a bit aggravating with all the craziness. I wouldn't call the child actors that great but I don't put any of it on them. I just don't think this is a fun movie.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
5,Scarecrow-88,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D,4,3 December 2016,"I did like the ongoing message on the importance of dreams and the kids are sincere, but this is critically injured by the 3-D capture process, with only the aesthetic otherworldly sci-fi background offering a pleasing-to-the-eye backdrop for the action. Cayden Boyd is full of imagination and a diary he carries offers two distinct characters, superheroes Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley) and Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner) which schoolteacher George Lopez discounts as he feels the boy should make the effort to embrace reality and make real friends. There is a bully played by Jacob Divich who makes Boyd's life miserable. A make- believe mission sparked by Boyd's dreams manifests itself with Lavagirl and Sharkboy show up in his classroom needing his help to save their universe from a serious threat... Mr Electric and Minus, both resembling Boyd's supposed greatest nemeses in the teacher that wants him to invest in the real world and the bullying kid who keeps trying to grab the diary and destroy it. Mr Electric wants to use his light plug terriers to shock and maim when he isn't swinging his own cord- plug bolt-shockers in his attempts to put an end to the dreams of Boyd and his made-up heroes. Soon Divich is revealed to be using Boyd's diary to warp the dreams and make things especially difficult. The power of imagination and what dreams can create isn't totally lost on me in this film but the animation of the live action is distractingly impeded by lousy capture process undermining what visual splendor exists in the starry and planetary space occupying the background. David Arquette and Kristen Davis are Boyd's parents...they have this weird scene with a tornado towards the end which involves Sharkboy and Lavagirl rescuing them. Even Lopez's daughter is imagined as a ice princess who has a crystal needed to help defeat Mr Electric. The film emphasizes the troubles of Lavagirl dealing with hot lava, Sharkboy trying to contain his anger, and Boyd summoning the ability to daydream so he can lend a hand to the heroes. A lot of heart in the direction can't compensate for ill-advised decision to shoot using a process that doesn't translate well to the smaller screen without special glasses.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
6,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Hardly devoid of charm,5,7 June 2008,"As much as this is an indulgence, it is at least not the man himself, but his offspring and their dreams(as stated in the very opening credits, removing any possible doubt as to that being the case or not). Whether or not such a thing can be made into something amazing, that is not the case here. Few will contest that. But looking further, this does have some merit. By no means the greatest writer, Rodriguez does have both creativity and a well-developed imagination. He lets them roam free in large parts of this, and actually comes up with a clever thing or two, amongst that which isn't. Some of the humor is childish, and certain gags are repeated somewhat ad naseum. Downright cringe-inducing does it become when a character actually follows up his quip, painful enough already, with an explanation of the double meaning. And that even happens more than once. The puns most definitely could have been, well, done without entirely, in an awful lot of cases. Characters are terribly flat and one-note fleshing out never has been Robert's strong suit. Designs aren't half bad. The CGI could be better, if worse has been seen. The action is invariably quite entertaining, the fighting in particular. The acting varies, with a larger portion only reaching ""passable"". Like the first Spy Kids(I haven't watched the others), this has a moral to it, if a relatively naive one, and the content is perfectly acceptable to show even to the youngest family members. Everything is fairly simplified herein. I recommend this to fans of Robert Rodriguez, and/or those fond of comic books, a style captured rather skilfully here. 5/10",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
7,view_and_review,Sharkboy and Lavagirl stink it up,4,12 February 2007,"I don't know how, but this movie failed to be at least decent. Most kids movies, even the weaker ones, are at least OK. This wasn't even OK. The story was very bad, the acting was very bad, and they should have watched ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" to see how to mix real people with animation. I could gather from the story that it was a page out of ""The Never Ending Story"" in that the boy's dreams had a direct effect on the world of Sharkboy and Lavagirl. I could also gather that the boy, as well as the writer and director of this heap, had no imagination. Maybe it was a low budget film or just an artistic way of doing something that so many other films successfully did before, but the production was horrible. Fortunately it was for kids, because kids are the only minds they could lay this on and get away with it.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
8,anaconda-40658,Drown It or Burn It.,1,25 June 2015,"The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl in 3D (2005): Dir: Robert Rodriguez / Cast: Taylor Lautner, Taylor Dooley, Cayden Boyd, George Lopez, David Arquette: Morbid piece of eye candy crap about a boy who imagines Shark Boy and Lava Girl and is the brunt of bullying at school. Shark Boy is raised by sharks and Lava Girl burns everything she touches but unfortunately not the script. They enlist their young creator in saving their dream world. Lame plot tries to be creative but ends upon a foolish note. Directed by Robert Rodriguez with a production about as fetching as dog vomit. Rodriguez pulled off the creative elements to great degree with Spy Kids but here he gains a production that is on the same level as something you might fish out of a cereal box. Embarrassing performances by Taylor Lautner and Taylor Dooley as Shark Boy and Lava Girl. Why anyone would combined a shark with scorching hot substances is beyond me unless he was simply having a hot and cold faze. Cayden Boyd plays their earthling creator who needs juvenile therapy after this. George Lopez does his best as the electrical villain with plug hounds but the role is simply cardboard. David Arquette can add this to a stream of shitty films that includes See Spot Run and Ready to Rumble. This is empty headed entertainment that should be torn by sharks or burned in lava. Score: 1 / 10",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
9,JamesHitchcock,Everything that is or ever was began with a dream,7,11 August 2020,"Max is a 10-year-old schoolboy whose life is not going well. His parents' marriage is not a happy one, and he is not popular at school, often being teased by his classmates for his dreamy, imaginative nature. He escapes into an imaginary dream world named Planet Drool (yes, really). The two main inhabitants of this planet are two superhero-type characters, Sharkboy (who was raised by a family of sharks after his marine biologist father disappeared) and Lavagirl, who has the ability to produce fire and lava. The film follows Max's strange adventures when he is mysteriously transported into his dream world, where he meets Sharkboy and Lavagirl and characters who bear a strange resemblance to his teacher Mr. Electricidad, Linus the class bully and Mr Electricidad's daughter Marissa, another classmate.The film was not popular with the critics, much of the criticism being directed at the allegedly poor 3-D effects and the storyline. It does not seem to be very popular with reviewers on this board either; it is rare that I review a film with a rating as low as 3.5. Well, I myself cannot comment on the 3-D, as I saw it in a 2-D television version. As for the storyline, I felt that too many of the critics were forgetting that this is a children's film and trying to judge it by adult standards.Certainly, judged by the logic of the everyday, rational world the story does not make a great deal of sense. But that is not the logic by which the film should be judged. Its logic is that of ""Alice in Wonderland"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"", that is to say the logic of the dream. As Lavagirl says ""Everything that is or ever was began with a dream"". Much of the story was, in fact, thought up by the children of the writer-director Robert Rodriguez. This is, however, an ""Alice in Wonderland"" updated for the computer age of the 21st century. Mr Electricidad's alter ego on Planet Drool is the planet's electrician Mr. Electric, and much of the film's imagery is drawn from the world of technology, such as a robot or ""plughounds"", dog-like creatures made out of electrical cables. There are, however, more conventional fairy-tale elements, such as the Ice Princess (based on Marissa), who possesses a Crystal Heart which can freeze time.Trying to judge a film like this one is difficult for me, because I have no children of my own. I have to try and think myself back into my own childhood and ask ""Would I have enjoyed a film like this in those days?"" And the answer is ""Yes, I would"", even though ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" is very different to anything that was actually about in the sixties and seventies when I was young. Yes, the story may be eccentric, even at time silly. But that is just what many kids like. 7/10",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
10,jdesando,A bung-hole stopper,5,4 June 2005,"Robert Rodriguez stunned the cinema world about a dozen years ago with the low budget El Mariachi, a story of mistaken identity, a lethal guitar case, and a mariachi who just wants to play his instrument. Since then, the director has not had to scrounge for money and exceeds expectations with movies as varied as Spy Kids and Sin City.After seeing the lava scene in Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over, director Rodriguez' son, Racer, came up with the story for The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl. Dad then creates a song of praise to that imagination, certainly not in short supply in the Rodriguez family. Max (Cayden Boyd) dreams and makes real the fantastic heroes of his mind. The film labors to be cute and instructive, two characteristics better left by themselves in movies or kept the province of artists like animators at Dreamworks.One hero of Max's imagination can melt whatever she wants by ejecting lava; the other can do considerable damage with his teeth. Max's school bully and the electronics teacher are transformed through Max's imagination into look-alikes of Reddy Kilowatt and Flash Gordon's evil Ming the Merciless. Thus ensues an adventure not as sharp as Spy Kids nor accomplished as Frank Miller's Sin City.The didacticism (exhortations to believe in your dreams, dream with your eyes open, change your life through your dreams, blah, blah) is heavily administered through speechifying at almost every turn. Even the graphics are imperfect, cumbersome, dull, and by contemporary standards, pedestrian. Lava and lightening, sharks and ice cube monsters look like elementary school creations.Max has a McCauley Culkin innocent look without the effeminate innocence and wiliness that made us feel comfortable when he was home alone. The principals, Boyd and Dooley, lack acting skills beyond awkwardly flashing well-attended teeth. A little like the characters from Peter Pan, these children are variously looking for parents either to pay attention to them or work harder at staying together as parents, similar to the four teens of this month's Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, a superior young-person's film blessed with solid acting and believable setups. The Adventures of Shark Boy & Lava Girl in 3-D is even worse because the 3-D is still annoying after all these years to perfect that technology.Shakespeare in Hamlet described the range of imagination: ""Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till we find it stopping a bung-hole?"" This film could at best hold back the wine.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
11,StevePulaski,Oatmeal has more vibrant colors,3,6 November 2010,"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl is a poor 3D film made for kids and by an actual kid. Supposedly, Robert Rodriguez's seven year old son, Racer assisted Rodriguez in writing the screenplay for this film, but that doesn't mean I'll treat like anything less than a movie. Just because a seven year old probably wrote more than half of it, it's still a movie in a wide release. I have full right to nitpick it. While I will say Racer has creative and inventive daydreams, I don't think a movie was entirely necessary; especially in the tiresome, droning 3D.The 3D dates back to when RealD was never out. The Red/Blue glasses ruled mostly from 2003 - 05. I remember Spy Kids 3D: Game Over and this film being the prime examples and topics for best 3D movie in my school. I disagreed with both films. Both movies' 3D value really sucks. It completely tones down the color scheme and even in 2D the film still has the ""Glasses On"" thing informing you the upcoming scene will be in 3D. It should read ""Colors commencing off in five...four...three...two...one...off.So the movie's plot is dam sure a seven year olds dream. It reminds me of when some of the classic stories like Alice in Wonderland were written when the author was on drugs. I could almost drag out my bong and make something like this. Max is a loner at school. He's bullied by everyone, but there's much more than meets the eye about him. He carries around ""a dream journal"" in which he writes down his thoughts and ideas as they stem from his creative head.We then go into the world of Sharkboy and Lavagirl who magically appear during a tornado when Max is at school. They take him to ""Planet Drool"" where dreams rule (no pun). The goal is to stop ""Planet Drool"" from being taken over by Mr. Electric. So the whole movie is the protagonists trying every which way and going through every obstacle trying to achieve what one would assume be an easy goal.It's another kids film so don't expect much of the plot. The visuals are nice...if the 3D wasn't added. The biggest gripe of the film stems from the 3D as stated before. I dug out the DVD of it and watched it that way and my memories of my assumption of my vision being shot when I watched it all came back. I repeatedly ask my mom if my eyes weren't working because everything looked drab and lifeless. This is the kind of film that has a lot of vibrant visuals and some great shots of water and lava. Don't use 3D which tones down the brightness.The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl is a failed experiment of a movie. It's an unnecessary, predictable film ruined by it's lackluster 3D scheme. While all three kids are fun loving, adventurous, and likable protagonists and the moral of the story is a good one, I think kids will be too busy taking off their glasses, asking lots of questions, and wondering why the colors look like colored Easter Eggs that were put in the dye for thirty seconds to hear what the moral was.Starring: Cayden Boyd, Taylor Dooley, Taylor Lautner, David Arquette, Kristin Davis, and George Lopez. Directed by: Robert Rodriguez.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A few semi-decent messages can't save this utter mess from total disaster.,2,20 February 2018,"Whether making over-the-top shoot-em-up schlock, kiddy spy spoofs or pulpy graphic-novel adaptations, it's clear that the ever ambitious Robert Rodriguez is a versatile, respected and resourceful film-maker who's both able and willing to consistently push the boundaries of a limited budget to deliver new experiences seldom-seen at that kind of rag-tag level; a successful if inconsistent director who's reached the point in his career where he has the clout (or rather, the cash) to make just about anything he wants including this bizarre glorified family-protect of his. It is hard to get angry about the chocolate-milk induced ravings of an eight-year-old boy - Rodriguez's own son was responsible for the creation and development of the titular heroes - or even the fact that his father decided to use his skills to bring them to life, considering that this is much more a bonding exercise for one man's family than something to be shared with the world. To be honest, it is competently constructed (in a very nuts and bolts kind of way) with a few semi-decent messages in there for the youngest of the crowd, but that's not to imply that this is anything other than a dreadfully dull, wholly nonsensical, wildly inconsistent, criminally ugly, jarringly intangible, hammily acted mess that was clearly written by a child with a crayon. Imagination should be encouraged in kids and their creations should be stuck to the fridge, but they shouldn't be made into a feature film. 2/10",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
13,Cineanalyst,Lucid Dream,4,9 January 2021,"After having first seen the semi-sequel ""We Can Be Heroes"" (2020), which was generally awful despite, as of this writing, receiving a 69% Fresh score from Rotten Tomatoes critics, and then seeing that this predecessor ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" holds only a 19% rotten score, my expectations for it, to say the least, were low. Indeed, it's bad, yet no worse than its follow-up picture. The atrocious visual effects may've been marginally improved, but the kiddie, if almost psychedelic, dreamscape here didn't demand photorealistic CGI. More importantly, this one is more consistent in its reflexivity.So, I wonder, why the 50-point discrepancy between movies? I have three guesses: 1) the pre-""Avatar"" (2009) 3-D seen in theatres was that ugly, 2) critics don't actually care much for Martin Scorsese's notion of cinema, would rather enjoy the comfort of super-formulaic, shared-universe engineering and, as the sequel was released on Netflix, don't care much for the idea of movies released in theatres anymore, either, and 3) especially after 15 years, one shouldn't put much stock in a supposed consensus of curated entertainment critics, many of whom may not have any interesting thoughts on movies anyways. Of course, all three guesses, or any number of them, or none of them, could be possible at once.Regardless, for all its juvenile stupidity and eye-soar greenscreen work, the comic-book reflexivity and association of dreams to cinema underlying the narrative is fairly clever. More so, at least, than the generic alien-invasion, superhero team-up of ""We Can Be Heroes"" that is about the construction of the very same thing, as seen on TV mise-en-abymes within the movie. Even that, too, is largely secondary to the rest of the picture's less-appealing nonsense. This one, by contrast, is all about children dreaming their own superhero adventure and drawing and writing it down in a (comic) book--actually, two kids competing for narrative control, with the dream eventually seeming to take on a mind of its own. As opposed to the extended school metaphor of the sequel, here is a dream of escaping such constricts, including by ""The Wizard of Oz"" tornado literally tearing through the school. Never mind that volcanic ash actually blocks sunlight, there is some light to this one, whereas the artificiality of the extension cords and such here seem to have won 15 years later in the sequel. Plus, this one is funnier, as the humor relies on puns instead of on the obnoxious supposed cuteness of bad child acting.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
14,g-bodyl,It was alright but not great,5,5 December 2007,"A little while back, I brought this movie because I was bored and I wanted something new to watch. I saw this at the store and I brought it. I wish that I had rented it instead. This was a low-budget movie that does not have brand name actors, the plot revolves around a boy with shark features and a girl with lava powers, and the main idea for this movie came from a 7-year-old kid. The acting was OK, the plot was very basic, the script was not really good, and the score was kind of creepy. Also, the 3D was not the best 3D I have seen. In fact, it is not really realistic. This is not a film you should brag about seeing. I would rather see a movie like Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings. But hey, this is only my opinion.

If THIS is what Robert Rodriguez had in mind, I mean...if he did this on PURPOSE, I fear for Sin City 2 & 3, as he is producing, writing, and directing those, as well.But back to this trash.The characters have been poorly recreated, the setting is a planet, rather than a realm, and there is no Queen. The Nothing is replaced by the Darkness, and Atreyu/Bastian is now Max, whose adventure means nothing in the greater scheme of things, in place of the great quest of honor in search of truth, nobility, and self of Atreyu's tale.Also, some of this, like the Land of Milk and Cookies, felt more like Wonka's Chocolate Factory...or rather, a horrible disgusting CGI mess of it.Did I mention that this absolutely stinks?

Agreed some of the dialog in this movie is pretty lame, but this movie is not meant to be Academy Award Winner, and it was slammed by many critics, you remember Ebert and Roper, of course you do. But I felt this movie appeals to the 10-12 year old kid in all of us. Despite the fact it was not well acted. I really loved this for its special effects, it had quite the imagination. But the 3-D part of it gave a real Eye ache. The story starts with Max, an awkward 11 year old, who is mocked by other kids, because of his story telling about his two superhero friends named Sharkboy and Lavagirl. But he becomes a big joke when he starts telling everybody they are both real. But we soon find out that they are real, and they both want his help.

19,Polaris_DiB,Huh...,8,19 December 2005,"...I liked it.Yep: I thought it was good. I thought it was better than most contemporary children's movies. Why? 1) Sharkboy and Lavagirl have depth. No, seriously, as superheroes go, they take the angst of the Spiderman movies and adapt it well for a younger crowd.2) It's theme of imagination makes a perfect fall-back. So it seems the movie goes in a stupid direction, huh? Unfortunately I remember my childlike imagination going in that direction as well when I was that age. In fact, almost all of the stuff shown, right down to the ending, fit perfectly the type of random stuff I'd come up with when I was a kid. I related to it perfectly, and I'm usually the type of person who gets angry when a movie doesn't match the type of daydreaming imagination I had when I was little and spent all of my time walking around and around the playground, thinking of random child superheroes to have adventures with.3) At first the virtual reality world is, of course, too cartoony for real-world characters. However, what ends up amazing is how well they interact in such a fake world. It's seamless, and after a while I forgot how fake it was. Much more beloved and much more highly rated films have CGI/special effects worlds that it doesn't even look like the characters are moving in. This one has them walking along in them as if they're really there.4) Rodriguez may not make the most artistic or original movies, but he knows what he's doing when streaming together a line of images. Invisible editing and conscientious directing kept the story flowing pretty much as smoothly as the milk in the cookie land. It was nice to see.5) I didn't get to watch it in 3-D, but it felt like it was in 3-D anyways. GREAT cinematography.So yeah. Good movie. Better than Spy Kids.What probably sets people off are the ending scenes (barely, BARELY worked) and the first few scenes with Sharkboy and Lavagirl. They're very discombobulating and the acting isn't exactly the best. Finally, Linus/Minus isn't the best child actor I've ever seen, and his character wasn't as developed as it could have been. These are the reasons people have a hard time getting caught in the rest of the movie.I can't make other people like it, but I sure do.--PolarisDiB",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
20,dwpollar,Fun 3D family movie with inventive 3D dream sequences...,7,26 June 2005,"7 out of 10, 1st watched 6/21/05 Dir-Robert Rodriguez:Fun 3D family movie with inventive 3D dream sequences. This is probably the best 3D movie I've watched where the 3D and non-3D blend together so well. Rodriguez does a great job of introducing the characters and keeping the story going despite similarities to Wolfgang Peterson's ""Never Ending Story."" The premise revolves around a family that is falling apart because the parents aren't getting along and the child is caught between real life and a dream world and very often chooses the dream world because things work out the way he wants them to as opposed to real life, where everything goes wrong. Slowly the dream world of Shark Boy and Lava Girl blends with the real world and eventually things work out for everyone. Along the way, there are inventive villains, sets, and basically just a good old fashioned fun time at the movie's. Rodriguez sure knows how to hit the chord on the family movie and connects with the adult audience as well. Keep it going Robert, you are definitely a great alternative to Disney these days.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

No. But then again the target audience really is for families and kids. And for that target audience, I personally feel like it works. Taylor Lautner was pretty good in the movie, it's so funny to see him in this after you've seen the twilight saga, he's a baby! Lol. And the rest of the main cast does a well enough job too. The special effects were pretty good, it didn't look too cheap or anything. Now I really did hate George Lopez in this movie, I mean I hated him!!! That is my biggest complaint for shark boy and lava girl, George freaking Lopez! He was annoying as all get out and just didn't fit the role at all, not even close. The script was alright I guess, it sufficed. The acting was a little spotty at times, but overall it was alright. A 6/10 for sharkboy and lavagirl 3D.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
23,TOMNEL,"No matter what it says, I give it a zero.",1,13 July 2005,"This is the most awful and boring kids movie in the history of kids movies. It's about some kid named Max(Rosie O'Donnel is more convincing than him) that has stupid fantasies of superheros that are bad actors. It's a rip-off of Wizard of Oz and Peter Pan, and the only laughs are because of how annoyingly stupid this is. There are several horrid one liners told by Sharkboy(Lavagirl's hair catches on fire and he says, ""Let her cool off some steam"".) Any good reviews that you read of this are from kids 3 and under that learned to type, or mentally disabled adults. David Arquette lends his bad acting to an extremely pointless and brainless part. I had to cringe when Sharkboy started singing an off tune and non sensible song. One of the lines from the song is, ""Go to sleep you little bleep.""....what? What's a little bleep? Also, the 3-D was horrible and was so dark that I could only stand the first 2 minutes of it, then the glasses went off. All the other people in the theater were either sleeping or putting guns up to their heads if the movie didn't end in a minute. Don't see this horrible movie ever. After you see it, you'll be depressed.My rating-0%-F- 90 minutes(way too long). rated PG for poopy humor and some ugly computer generated action.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

It's nice that Rodriguez wants to make films for kids based on the dreams of his son, but that's no excuse for such a sloppy, annoying film. It's bright and obnoxious, constantly being in your face, even when viewed in 2-D. The effects are some of the worst around, and because the film fails to draw us into its imagination, they really do stand out. The performances are mostly embarrassing. But this leads to the one highlight, seeing Taylor Lautner singing and dancing, in an uncomfortably awkward scene. This film was finished very quickly, and it's not surprising. There's nothing to recommend it on unless you like bright things.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
25,aimless-46,Advice for Those Older than the Target Audience,8,18 October 2005,"Age six to ten audiences usually get the short end of the stick when it comes to major feature films. Although technically films like ""Elf"" and ""Toy Story"" target this demographic, the marketing people insist that these productions incorporate adult elements and humor to expand the target audience and maximize attendance; these are called ""family films"" and the additional elements take much away from the identification experience that children most enjoy. The only escape from these multi-generational things are preschool stuff like ""Clifford's Really Big Movie"" and ""Muppets from Space"" which no one in the 6-10 group would admit to watching, let alone liking.Then along comes Robert Rodriguez with ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"", a film that gives 6-10 audiences exactly what they want without even the slightest attempt to appeal to older viewers (well maybe middle schoolers will get crushes on Sharkboy and Lavagirl). Since this is a new animal to most critics, it gets blasted for not being what they wanted it to be, a family film. And teenagers complain that it is not as good as ""Spy Kids"", a Rodriguez film that not only targeted a broader audience but which most of them watched several years ago when they were preteens. To be fair, while Rodriguez did not make ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" for 14 year olds who saw ""Spy Kids"" 4-5 years ago, the distributors did attempt to market it to those audiences-who are now angry about being misled although I think the trailer gives a pretty accurate representation of the film.So don't let the negative reviews and comments discourage anyone in the target audience from seeing this film. There are plenty of positive reviews and comments from critics who have a clue about Rodriguez's intentions and from the viewers in his target audience. There will be a lot of Sharkboys and Lavagirls out trick or treating this year and the film will become a classic to those who first see it at a young age.Which is not to say that only those in its target audience will enjoy the film, it is a fun children's tale that might be described as a cross between ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Yellow Submarine"". But for most adults and almost all teenagers, the only really entertaining part will be watching the pre-teens (both girls and boys) totally getting off on the whole thing.In one respect it is better because almost all the actors are kids; Rodriguez understands that a lot of adult characters in a children's film is a less than zero situation. And it has very good messages: emphasizing the value of dreams, how dreaming better (i.e. unselfishly) increases that value, and how working to make you dreams come true maximizes that value (the young hero's name is ""Max""). Plus Sharkboy and Lavagirl are best friends who demonstrate a willingness to risk their lives to save each other.Speaking of less than zero, the advantage of seeing this on DVD versus in a theater is having the option to watch in 2-D. The 3-D version subtracts instead of adding, as much of the brightness and life of the film are lost to the crude 3-D cardboard glasses process they used. The only useful thing about the 3-D (other than a mildly interesting visual effect for those who have never experienced it) is the interactive aspect; as signs flash on the screen telling when to put on and take off the polarizing glasses. The DVD contains both versions and the 2-D one is first rate.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

28,lemon_magic,"Inspired, incoherent and wildly inconsistent, just like childhood itself",6,8 June 2007,"Have you ever (as an adult)watched your 7 year old nephews (or cousins or whatever) and friends charge around pretending to (quoting Dave Barry) ""...be Jet powered Robots or to be fighting invisible aliens who can only be defeated by spit""? Did you ever marvel at their endless energy and timeless absorption into the absolutely silly and juvenile? Observed how the kids can be simultaneously completely sincere and unaffected in their fantasies while at the same time religiously adhering to strict conventions of how things are supposed to be? Fascinating wasn't it? And yet, thin gruel indeed for an adult sensibility trained to enjoy structure and theme and veracity.Watching Rodriguez bring his young boy's story to life on the big screen is like that. The young actors here can be pure magic and then just plain hammy; the plotting can peer into the infinite realm of the imagination or ape the worst of Hanna-Barbera; dialog can be inspired and poetic or clank like a lead washer in a drying machine; the effects can be giddily wonderful or cheesy and irritating. What's more, all these aspects can pinball between the two extremes several times,not only in any given scene, but sometimes several times in any given minute. That makes for some exhausting viewing.IMO, the ratio of giddily-creative expression to cheesy-amateurish crap is about 70/30, which leads me to believe that once again Rodriguez tried to do too much, to throw in so many ideas and notions and neat touches that he simply wasn't able to polish it all and keep a consistent level of quality. I give the man an ""A"" for effort, but a B- for execution. But I'll keep going to see his films, because it's great to see a filmmaker pushing the limits of his abilities, taking chances and making films that may not be perfect, but certainly burst with energy and imagination.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
29,BrandtSponseller,A Huge Disappointment,2,5 March 2006,"I was excited to watch this. I love fantasy. I love kids films. I loved the first couple Spy Kids films and liked the third. I also love the rest of Robert Rodriguez' work, although I knew that most of it wouldn't be relevant here, of course. And even when The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl began, I loved the first twenty minutes of it or so--up until about the time they arrived at Planet Drool, this was cruising along at about a 9 for me. But then, almost inexplicably, the film falls apart. Rather than a nice, tight, fantastical, almost absurdist film about a couple superheroes, it becomes a random series of events taking place in a computer animated world that looks extremely rushed and unfinished.I say ""almost inexplicably"" falls apart above because as is well known, director Robert Rodriguez' son, Racer, came up with the story, which was supposedly inspired by his dreams. The material on Planet Drool does have a kind of dream logic to it, which in this case is to say that it basically has no logic to it. There are a few problems with this. Dream logic need not be ""no logic"". There actually is a kind of surrealistic logic that functions during most dreams, and most artistic works that we say have dream logic display this surrealistic logic. One event follows from another in a way that makes some sense; it's just surrealistic sense. Further, the material in the film prior to arriving at Planet Drool has that surrealistic logic rather than just no logic. And the most important point here--dream logic as the absence of logic during the Planet Drool section, which is the bulk of the film, makes it difficult to get into/care about what's happening on the screen. On Planet Drool, one event doesn't follow another logically, even surrealistically; it's all just random.So it's almost inexplicable, then, because obviously there was a different approach to the first section. Maybe Racer approached it differently, or maybe adults such as Robert edited/revised it in a different way, or maybe the adults tried to edit/revise everything in the same way but just dropped the ball on the Planet Drool stuff. Whatever the reason, when they're on Planet Drool, the rules of the game keep changing, there's no sense of progression or an arc from one event to the next, there's no rhyme or reason to the characters, including the villain, and there's an uncomfortable combination of derivativeness (of everything from The Neverending Story to Wizard of Oz to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to Tron to everything else that Racer has probably watched), groaner corniness (the puns based on heat, fish and dreams/imagination grow more desperate by the minute) and very poorly executed computer animation. The quality of the computer animation is worse than typical early generation PlayStation 1 games. It's not as blocky, but it is as rudimentary and incomplete-looking.Of course, defenders of the film keep bringing up, ""But it's a kids' film! You're not supposed to like it!"" There are a couple problems with that kind of argument. Whether I'm ""supposed"" to like kids' films or not, I do like the vast majority of them. I've done a good job staying in touch with that side of my nature. It's very rare that I see a kids' film--and I do watch them just as regularly as I watch anything else--that I dislike as much as I disliked The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl. I even love Rolie Polie Olie, and the last couple times (not that long ago) that I checked out Sesame Street and Mister Rogers Neighborhood I enjoyed them--although I know I can't enjoy them in the same way I did as a kid. I could easily see the quality of the material. And certainly this isn't targeted to a younger crowd than any of those titles are. So it's not that I would tend to dislike something just in case it is made to appeal almost exclusively to younger kids, and I doubt that's the case with any other critic worth their weight in movie popcorn.Secondly, most kids are not totally devoid of any sense of logic. I certainly wasn't when I was a kid, and I didn't have any friends who were either. It's basically hard-wired into our brains. It has to be so we can survive in the world. So I can easily imagine a lot of kids not liking The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, either, because in the absence of some kind of internal logic and consistency, there's not much to draw them into the story, not like there is in The Wizard of Oz and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Neverending Story and the Spy Kids Films and Follow that Bird and just about every other kids' film. I agree that very young kids--say, maybe around three of four, may be more prone to liking this film, because it sure is filled with pretty colors and lots of movement. And even slightly older kids won't care about derivativeness (because they won't know) or corniness or anything like that. But you don't have to be very old to tell that there's something missing here that isn't missing in The Wizard of Oz or any of those other films.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

For starters, ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" sounds like a good idea. It shows us what happens and revolves around our dreams. Simply, this idea sounds terrific, and the fact that director Robert Rodriguez's son thought up the story sounds the more interesting. But the final execution, when finally brought to film, is really disappointing. Too much 3-D, and not much story. I guess you know where this is going.It sounds interesting to see what dreams are made of, but is seriously disappointing when finally brought to the screen, as none other than a parade of effects. Sadly to say, sorry Mr. Robert Rodriguez, but this is not what dreams are, and supposed to be. Hollywood must learn by now that CGI doesn't amount to everything. What starts out nice, once again goes horribly wrong.Another thing, this movie is a family film alright, but only kids will truly appreciate this one. If scaled, perhaps only 5% of the 100% of the film will be entertaining to the adults.Overall, leave it to the kids to watch it for themselves. Adults may want to stick to Rodriguez's adult works.

32,cultfilmfan,The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl In 3-D,7,17 June 2005,"The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl In 3-D, is a live action film in which during the film you wear a pair of cardboard cut out glasses (given to you upon entering the film) and you put the glasses on when the screen tells you to (ninety percent of the film is in 3-D so you need to wear your glasses). The film is about a young boy named Max, who keeps a record of his dreams and one day shares with his class a dream he had about two superhero kids named Sharkboy and Lavagirl. After telling the class they all laugh at him and his teacher Mr. Electricidad, tells him to stop dreaming and one of the kids who bullies Max, named Linus steals his dream journal. Things also aren't going too well at home because Max's parents always seem to be fighting. One day at school Max's dreams come to life where after a tornado Sharkboy and Lavagirl appear to take Max with them to the planet Drool. While there they have to stop the evil Mr. Electric, who is turning the planet into an unhappy place to be. I usually tend not to see family films but the film is written and directed by Robert Rodriguez (who based this film on an idea he got from his son) who also directed this year's Sin City, which I liked a lot and plus I have always wanted to see a film in 3-D where I would have to wear a pair of cut out glasses so I decided to see this film. I was pleasantly surprised. The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl In 3-D, is very creative and interesting and has a lot of neat visual sight gags with the 3-D glasses and the story is also fun and entertaining and I think that with the 3-D effects and the creative and fun story that kids will love this movie.

Portions of the movie were regular, with vivid, clear colors and image quality. But most of the movie is in '3-D'. That effect was sooooo awful, it makes me genuinely puzzled as to how this decision could have been made. 3-D might have worked, sort of, but this particular version of it was horrible!Forgetting the thematic and artsy aspects for a moment--- I would have thought there couldn't be enough cocaine in LA to get people stoned enough to think this looked good. It was a pussy-green, and washed-out gray.

37,baileycrawly,Underrated,7,21 December 2020,"Sharkboy and Lavagirl really do check off all the boxes for a bad movie. And that's exactly why it's so good. This is a campy, relatively poorly acted (but you have to cut them a little slack because the cast was almost entirely underage), the effects are pretty terrible even for their time period, and it just has a general feeling of being off-beat from beginning to end, which is perhaps the only consistency the film has going for it.
Viewing this film in preparation for the sequel(ish), We Can Be Heroes was an interesting experience. There are some things that you just don't forget from childhood (the nightmare fuel that is the wonky CG robot-thing in the dream world, for instance, or George Lopez's hammy performance as Mr. Electric), but there were still some pleasant surprises, perhaps the biggest of which being how good of a singer young Taylor Lautner was before Twilight would slightly tarnish his reputation and leave all the girls lusting after his shirtless body.
It's hard not to view this film as a half-assed attempt to utilize Robert Rodriguez brand in a world that was experiencing major Spy Kids fatigue, because that's essentially what this film is. But there's just something about it that makes it special and makes it stand out among other children's films released around that time, something that would probably take an essay to really get to the bottom of. It's a movie that works simply because it works; one you can't question, just sit back and enjoy. A lot of people hated it (even more than I realized after taking a look at the IMDb reviews), and it's not great, but it's not all bad either. It held up in a campy B-movie kind of way, and it's still a ton of fun to watch today.

Everyone thinks he's making them up until one day, they show up to whisk him off to Planet Drool to help them fight the evil Mr. Electric (George Lopez) and Minus.The plot sounds like a film that only kids will like. However, it has Rodriguez behind the camera and he did a good job with the first two Spy Kids movies. Unfortunately, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D is no where near as good as his previous work. Besides for Rodriguez, I didn't really have high hopes for the film Spy Kids 3D was awful and the trailers made this film seem like a joke. While watching the film, I thought it really was a joke. It was really cheesy and it was quite bereft of entertainment. I was hoping the film would start picking up from the weak start. Unfortunately, it didn't.The acting is horrible which is surprising since the kids in Spy Kids were pretty good actors. Taylor Lautner, who plays Sharkboy, does the worst job and he gives a really wooden performance. Taylor Dooley, who plays Lavagirl, isn't much better and her performance is pretty weak. George Lopez just makes a fool of himself and he gives an over the top performance. David Arquette and Kristen Davis both give decent performances but they don't really appear in the film. The lead, who is played by Cayden Boyd, also gives a wooden performance. I know they are just kids but their efforts felt a little weak.I am really disappointed with Robert Rodriguez. The direction was really weak and the editing seem to have been done by a child. He spent too much time on the style instead of the story. Sadly, the film isn't even that stylish and it just looks like a mess. The story is pretty cheesy and lame. I know it was written by a kid but it was still pretty weak. Since the story is weak, the film is very dull. The sad thing is that the movie is only 85 minutes long but it feels so much longer since there is very little here to actually enjoy. The special effects are also pretty bad and they left me with a headache. In the end, this family film is better left on the shelf. Rating 2/10",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

There's not a whole lot to the story, but it has a couple things going for it: For one, I thought the George Lopez role was OK, he had a good line at the end about how a good teacher learns from his students. Also, Sharkboy and Lava Girl have a sort of neat symbiotic relationship with their superpowers. Mostly, the film is about the 3-D gimmick, though, which is quite an experience at times, and enhances a few of the action's more spine-tingling moments.

I think it's a genuinely lovely idea and a great story behind the scenes with Rodriguez and his son teaming together to make a big screen outing for his dreams (there's even a commentary on the dvd from them both which is awesome!). I do also think people have been really unfair in their criticism of the film. Unfortunately though it doesn't quite hang together fully as a film and patience will be tested the older you are. There are some fun performances particularly from George Lopez as the evil Mr. Electric who made me giggle on quite a few occasions.

I mean, this movie makes the dialogue from ""Twilight: New Moon"" sound great!

After he lets her go into the tornado, she gives out the fakest scream ever and Dad gets this ""regretful"" face and says ""No! No, come back, please..."" Yeah, really.Max's Mom to Max's Dad and then viceversa - *She comes out from the tornado with Lavagirl somehow: ""I'm not going anywhere..."" Despite the fact that you just said that to Dad to take care of you 'son'. Dad then says ""Neither am I,"" to her like he was in any trouble. Like anyone said or implied he was.I don't even wanna begin to write down Cayden Boyd's dialogue because I swear if I did I'd write down about 10 paragraphs. So to sum this down, the dialogue is the worst thing this film has to offer. You're better off listening to the dialogue from ""TNM"", ""Ghost Rider"" and ""Crossroads"".Cast and Acting: Taylor Lautner played his character throughout the whole movie like he had been stressed out and had a bad day. Taylor Dooley played Lavagirl so wooden that you're wondering how she didn't set herself on fire.Cayden Boyd can't act for nothing and that's a compliment. He looked and sounded like he was going to cry in the entire film. I'm not even going to begin talking on how bad of actors David Arquette, Kristin Davis and George Lopez were in this movie. Sasha Pieterse was pretty much telling us she wanted to be saved from this film, throughout the whole movie she looked forced to act.Characters: The hero of the film, Max, was useless and weak; he should have just jumped into the lava pit with Lavagirl and died. Lavagirl was some weak, pathetic excuse for a heroin who is nothing but a distraction, and the same could be said for Sharkboy. Both of them should have died. Lavagirl is an idiot who thinks has no rational thinking in her head. Really, when Max said they had to go find the ice princess, she says ""She is ice and I'm fire, we MUST be enemies"". Really logical thinking, right?All that Sharkboy does is be a bully to his own creator, and then complains and whines about how he doesn't have his strength because Max didn't make him the king of the ocean.The two villains - Mr. Electric and Linus - were so bad that they should have married each other. They make Gargamel (Smurfs) and Prince John from ""Robin Hood"" (1973) look like Shan-Yu (Mulan) and Cruella de Vil (101 Dalmatians).Plot/Story: Apparently the whole point of the film is for Max to find his true purpose in the world of dreams and defeat the villains who are making the whole place a nightmare world. Like we haven't heard that formula before. You have one plot point in the film, another story element added there and then one arc added somewhere else. It's a cluster of inconsistent and incoherent plot points and stories that frankly you're wondering what the real point of the movie is. We have how the characters travel from one point to another for certain things that later have very little to no use. I still don't even know why Taylor Lautner had to sing in the film. I'm not saying he sang badly (he was surprisingly good at it), but the way they executed the singing here was like the film was going to have some more musical numbers into it.Effects: Even back then when I first saw this film I was able to tell how bad they looked. I wouldn't be surprised if the effects in the movie were the only thing they bothered to pay attention to make right. I can compare the special effects to ""Son of the Mask"" and that movie had some effects itself. I didn't watch it in 3D so, I wouldn't know how bad the 3D was.Final summation, this film is so bad, it's just bad. It a mishmash between ""Spy Kids"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Never Ending Story"" and two elements of Japanese anime for kids (i.e. Doraemon): male primary teacher on charge and a mention to sushi (the only missing thing was a gym class scene, where the P.E. teacher were female, like in Japan); in a very cheesy and laughable way. Go watch some other laughable movie that's actually bad enough to be good. Even Barney and the Teletubbies together is better than this garbage.How this movie scored over a 4% is beyond me.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
45,ScottDMenzel,Another Creative 3D Adventure by Robert Rodriguez,7,27 June 2005,"""The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl in 3D"" was barely advertised. I just happened to see the trailer for it because I worked at Nielsen and got to see the trailer when we were testing it. I also saw the trailer once again in ""Kicking and Screaming"" but other than that, I never saw any advertising for the film. Therefore, I didn't really know what to expect when walking into the theater today to see ""The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl."" ""The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl"" is about a boy named Max (Cayden Boyd) who has a vivid imagination and is a big dreamer. In his dreams, he creates Shark boy (Taylor Lautner) and Lava girl (Taylor Dooley). One day in class, Max tells his class the story of Shark boy and Lava girl, but the class doesn't believe a word of it and just makes fun of him. After class, Max gets in a fight with Linus (Jacob Davich) who takes Max's dream book. You see Max keeps all his dreams written in a book so he always remembers them. When Max, goes home that night he wishes that he doesn't have to return to school but of coarse that doesn't happen. However, the next day something interesting happens, Shark boy and Lava girl show up at school and seek Max's help Max then goes with Shark boy and Lava girl and this is where the fun filled adventure begins.One thing I can say about Robert Rodriguez is that he has a knack for film-making. He makes movies that are both creative and have unique stories. I actually liked this film better then Spy Kids 3D but not as much as the original Spy Kids or Spy Kids 2. However, in a Robert Rodriguez film once you throw in the 3D element you lose a little story. But this doesn't make the film bad or any less enjoyable. What amazes me about Mr. Rodriguez is how he can make films like ""Sin City"" and ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" and also make great family films such as the ""Spy Kids"" series and this film.I don't understand why critics hated this movie but then again I don't always understand the critics. When watching a movie like Shark boy and Lava girl, you have to remember one thing that this is a movie made for the enjoyment of little kids. So if you think in that mindset you will really enjoy it. It's extremely creative and unique. It's a movie where your imagination can run wild. If you get into the film, you feel like you're a little kid again and that's a great feeling.If you go into the theater expecting a cinematic gem you're not going to get it. The acting isn't as good as it was in the ""Spy kids"" movies or any of Robert Rodriguez's other work. The story is decent but won't blow you away. However the film is visually appealing and is fun for people with vivid imaginations. Like I said, go into the movie and take the movie for what it is, a great family popcorn flick that both adults and kids together can enjoy if you put your mind to it.So in conclusion, If you go into ""The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl"" knowing what to expect you will really enjoy the film. It's like Spy Kids 3D but slightly better because it's more visually interesting and the story is better. I always enjoy Mr. Rodriguez's movies and this one is no different. His directing technique is amazing and he manages to make films for cheap no matter how large the cast or amount of special effects. This movie is a lot of fun and is well worth the trip to the multiplex. It's a great film to bring the kids to and their eyes will be glued to the screen for the entire 95 minutes. I think if you enjoyed the ""Spy Kids"" series then you will probably enjoy this film as well. It's a fun film that is truly underrated.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl in 3D"" is a 7/10.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

47,ryan_kuhn,"""But when Max snoozes, he wins.""",4,7 October 2005,"A colorful and occasionally imaginative film, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl (In 3-D!!!) is an overall disappointment, a movie that had good intentions at the beginning, but devolved into a cheesy ""message for our youth."" The movie revolves around Max (Cayden Boyd), the picked-on grade school student who would rather create his own world rather than live in the real one. Of course he's picked on by class bully Linus (Jacob Davich), of course his parents are always fighting (David Arquette and Kristin Davis), and of course Max lives life as a miserable school student who has very little going for him. Writer/director Robert Rodriguez formulated the entire movie, from story to special effects, based on inspirations provided by his children. There are reasons that most movies, even the bad ones, are not made by children. The movie is well meaning, but relies on too many familiar story devices: class bullies, mean teachers, quiet kids who save the day. We've seen this movie before, but the colorful, Super Mario-Mushroom Kingdom-like worlds that inhabit the movie does add some to the entertainment value. Max is taken to his dream world, known as Planet Drool, by Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner) and Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley), the two superheroes of the world. Each superhero contains some depth, not as much as the superheroes in The Incredibles, but the nice little subplot of each character trying to find their place in the world was a nice touch. For instance, after one difficult scene to watch, we now know Sharkboy cannot rap well at all. Otherwise, the characters are each have one note. George Lopez hams it up, most likely intentionally to offer a cheese element to this movie, but I found his characters to be annoying. The movie's plot lacks any imagination, and the world of Planet Drool does feature some creativity, but not enough to save an otherwise pedestrian family feature. This movie is Rodriguez's second foray into the 3-D genre, and though I did not use the 3-D glasses while viewing the movie, the scenes accenting the technology are pretty obvious to the casual observer and distract from the overall viewing experience. I really enjoyed the visual style Robert Rodriguez employed in Sin City, and that movie may have even been enhanced with a few 3-D moments, but Sharkboy and Lava girl was a move in the opposite direction for the maverick director.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

As an adult, this movie is hot garbage, while really overstaying it's welcome! Although it was stylish & original in it's own way, it is very corny & very cringey! The script is probably top 5 worst I've ever seen. The animations were just unforgivable with horrid green screen backgrounds.

I saw only a few minutes of the movie when I realized how much worst the movie was from every movie Robert Rodriguez had ever made including Spy Kids. The acting was the worst acting that I had ever seen! I couldn't believe people were actually watching the movie without rioting at the waste of time and effort they were experiencing! So after a few games of ""lets see how long you can stay in the movie before leaving"" i eventually saw a massive amount of this movie with large regret. Parents coming out of the movie with kids looked amazed that they spent money on it and a few wanted refunds. I just thought I would share my agony with others to ensure that no one has to ever go through what I went through. I obviously do not recommend this to anyone unless they are using it to torture foreign prisoners for information.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
50,leilapostgrad,Austin Movie Show review,7,12 June 2005,"The Matrix meets Spy Kids when 10 year-old Max (Cayden Boyd) blurs the lines between the dream world and the real world in The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl in 3-D. Did Max simply dream up Sharkboy and Lavagirl in some psychosomatic response to his parents' failing marriage? Or did he really go to Planet Drool to fight the evil Mr. Electricity (George Lopez)? Though his 7 year-old son, Racer Rodriguez, technically came up with the story and characters in the film, Sharkboy & Lavagirl is clearly a metaphor for writer/director Robert Rodriguez and his philosophy on life. This is a movie about dreams, passions, and working hard to make your dreams a reality. There is no bigger dreamer in the entire film industry than Mr. Rodriguez, and no one works harder and gets less sleep (he shot this film and Sin City at the same time). But he makes his dreams into realities, time and time again (he works at ""the speed of thought,"" to use his favorite expression). And his dreams also tend to make Miramax and other studios a lot of money, too. But I digress.Very few movies, even traditional ""kid movies,"" honor kids and their ideas like Sharkboy & Lavagirl does. The heroes of this film are the characters with the biggest dreams and wildest imaginations, while the bad guys are those intent on crushing dreams. Kids are so often belittled in film, depicted as troublemakers or whiny brats. This movie, on the other hand, shows how much Rodriguez loves and honors his kids, and respects the imagination of all children.Besides the great message of this movie, it's also a blast to watch! I have to admit, this was my first 3-D movie, and I was blown away. I literally reached up and tried to grab bubbles. Why don't more people make 3-D movies? They're so much fun! The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl in 3-D was made by kids and for kids, and kids everywhere are going to love it. And the parents, siblings, and babysitters who have to take them to the theater are going to love it, too.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
51,rooster_davis,Better than they say it is,6,30 December 2018,"I've seen lots of trash created for kids to watch and I think this movie is a lot better than many of them. The story is creative, positive without being overbearing, the story is extremely imaginative and moves quickly. Acting by the kids involved is not bad at all compared to some I've seen, in fact it's generally quite good.My 7-year-old son is not easy to hook into watching anything like this but he happened to wander into the room while it was on the TV and in a few minutes he was sitting on the floor, transfixed by the story and the special effects - which were appropriate to the story but not overdone for their own sake.I don't think this is such a bad movie at all, for kids of course but there's so much worse out there.

This wasn't too bad. I'll certainly say that it's better than the third ""Spy-Kids."" However, the story still lacking a bit. But that's to be expected seeing as it's directed towards kids, not to say that they don't have a clue of what's going on, but it's still directed toward the ones who don't have to think too hard about what's going on. They can just watch a movie that is great entertainment. I sometimes wonder how Rodriguez and his own kid, who did help out with the story, come up with this stuff. It's amazing. Plus, it shows how much Robert Rodriguez loves his son, in that he made this movie for him. Still, if you have children of your own, see it with them.

But other than that this movie was a total drag, for its unfunny jokes, and its really lame acting. Don't get me wrong this was a good idea, it should have been better in those spots. This movie tried to be appealing as Spy Kids, but it gets an effort for trying. The movie starts out with Max, an 11 year old.

56,jantoniou,"Limp, bizarre kiddie fare",3,22 November 2005,"Sequestered away on his Austin, TX ranch, much like George Lucas on Skywalker Ranch and ILM in the Nicasio Valley of California and Peter Jackson's digital wizards at Weta Digital in New Zealand, Robert Rodriguez has seemingly created for himself a haven to explore not only his own creative juices, but also whatever creative whims seem to be floating through the minds of his children.Have you ever had a small child tell you a story? It usually goes something like ""And then... blah blah blah... and then... blah blah blah... and then..."" In other words, it rambles ceaselessly with no apparent meaningful beginning or end. This movie is just such an example--and an object lesson that just because you can do something doesn't mean you should, no matter all the nifty gadgetry you have on your ranch.In short, that is ""Sharkboy and Lava Girl""--coupled with some reigning in by dad who didn't want an otherwise nonsensical story about ""dreams"" or ""the power of dreams"" or ""dreamers"" (or whatever it's about) to wander off too far from a movie's standard three-act set. He squeezed his kid's dreams reluctantly into the movie mold.""Acted"" by three kids 99% against green screen, the CG is laid on thick and unimaginatively. This is CG for the sake of CG, because it's way cheaper to pay 10 mouse jockeys $50K a year in Texas then it is to build millions of dollars worth of sets.The movie starts actually with decent potential, but the story and plot meanders after Max arrives on his dreamt ""Planet Drool,"" when the CG is put on like a garish suit. Max ultimately discovers his ""true power"" and becomes a ""day dreamer"" and ferrets out the true identify of his dreamt Shark Boy and Lava Girl. This is all accompanied by a mystical synth. track that reminds us which certain moments are epiphanies.""Shark Boy"" is a spiky-haired ADD case with WAY too much hair gel and kick-butt karate moves and flips (yes, the ""actor"" is a black belt Karate champ) and ""Lava Girl"" is an uber-cute misfit who is too hot to handle. Lava Girl does a lot of very wide smiles directly into the camera to remind you how cute she is. In other words, there's more ham on the set then there is for Christmas Dinner.Truly designed for kids who could care less about niggling details like plot, story, structure, and dialog, your wee ones will appreciate the surreal story line and bizarre graphics.

57,Blackace,For Kids Only. About As Good As Spy Kids 3-D.,4,16 February 2011,"Let me get the story out of the way first. The film is about a boy (Max) who is picked on at school and decides to conjure up his perfect dream world to escape the real world. His world in on the Planet Drool and the superheroes that protect it are Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner) and Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley). When trouble occurs on the planet Drool, the 2 heroes materialize on Earth. They seek out the only person who can save the planet, which is Max. From there the wild adventure begins.Now, if you have seen the awful SpyKids 3-D, then you have some idea as to how this movie will look. I didn't care for either movie. The story was just badly written and definitely didn't have anything interesting in it to keep adults attention. Whereas movies like Toy Story 3 and Up have enough entertainment to keep both kids and adults glued to their seats, AoS&L will make you want to run out of the theater. There are some nice special effects and some funny moments, but not enough to keep you there for 93mins. I do get what Robert R was trying to do and he does it right if only 4-12yrs old are going to see his film.Kids 4-12yrs old will probably love this film. It's aim squarely at them just like the movie ""Shorts"". If you were going to the movies, you'd send your kids in to see this and then you would go and see Robert's Grindhouse (Planet Terror) or Machete flicks instead. I do enjoy most of Robert R. movies. I was a big fan of Grindhouse (Planet Terror), Sin City, El Mariachi, Desperado, Spy Kids 1 & 2, From Dusk Till Dawm and even The Faculty. Movies like Shorts and AoS&L just can't keep my interest. They are just too kiddie for me. I'm hoping Robert and Quentin will give us another Grindhouse film, but have it focused on Horror or Japanese Giant Monsters like Godzilla. I would be interested to see how then would make movies in those genres.If you are an adult or teen older then 12, don't even waste your time on this flick. Not worth a rent or purchase. If you have kids who are 4-12yrs old, pick up all the Pixar and Disney flicks you can find.

59,DJ_Shilo,Burning or Drowning? Whichever is better,2,13 June 2016,"""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" is not a very good film and the 3D is terrible. ""Spy Kids 3D: Game Over"" looked the same and I still can't believe Sylvester Stallone was the villain in that film. I kept thinking he was broke and that was his excuse for doing it. I have no doubt this film will do well among the children that go to see it but the adults will find themselves sleeping in their seats. Robert Rodriguez is known for his violent films and it would occur to me that he made this film for his kids, which is true. With a budget of $50 million, we should get more out of it that than agonizing 3D. The story is bland, the action is ridiculous and the acting is terrible.It's about a young boy, Max (Cayden Boyd) who creates an imaginary world called Planet Drool. Here, he creates two characters; Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner), a boy raised by sharks and Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley), who lights everything on fire. When a bully, Linus (Jacob Davich) steals Max's Journal, a tornado rages outside his school so Sharkboy and Lavagirl appear to take Max on an adventure to save their home planet.If you can make it through this picture without the 3D hurting your eyes, you're a trooper. It's the same 3D used for ""Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over"" and Rodriguez seems intent on being the first director to use 3D technology in a long time. The 3D to the film is called ""Anaglyph 3D"" which is a stereoscopic 3D effect achieved by encoding each lens using filters of different colors. When viewed through the glasses, they reveal an integrated stereoscopic image. When you go to the theater, you are given the glasses and they are made of crappy old cardboard. The real irritation is trying to wear these for 90 mins. I'm not sure why Rodriguez decided to use this old technology when new 3D technology exists.I found myself doing some research on the film after viewing it because I knew there had to be an origin story of some sorts. If you know some of Robert Rodriguez's previous films ""From Dusk till Dawn,"" ""Desperado"" and ""The Faculty,"" he is no stranger to gory violent pictures. Anyway, the idea for this film came from his son Racer who told him a story about a boy who grew up with sharks and a girl who had fire elements to her body. He encouraged his son to keep working on the story and now he has brought his son's vision to life but why not make it a good one? He scored a home run with ""Spy Kids"" and ""Spy Kids 2: The island of Lost Dreams"" so we know he can do kids movies.As the film progress, we are told at certain points to put on the 3D glasses. The 2D scenes are the real world and the fantasy scenes are the 3D but I had to rub my eyes a few times because it got annoying really fast. There is an innocent and interesting idea here but it feels lazy. The special effects are boring and the characters are just not interesting. Sharkboy and Lavagirl take Max to their home planet which he creates in his mind to save it from destruction in 45 mins. It has the same feel as ""Spy Kids"" and it resembles a lot of that picture. With a screenplay written by Racer Rodriguez, you can expect a lot of weirdness: The Steam of Consciousness, The Sea of Confusion, The Train of Thought and something called a Dream Lair. These all left me with questions marks in my head. Since this is a children's movie written by a child with a wild imagination, maybe I'm not supposed to understand this picture but I would like to.There's an interesting idea to explore at the beginning of the film involving bullying but it doesn't even touch on this subject. The idea of a boy in a shark suit and a girl wearing a pink suit resembling fire must be more appealing and it leaves the idea alone. The young boy Max is a loner who loves to use his imagination and that's the basis for this story. We are given scenes that show how Sharkboy was raised by sharks. His father studied Great White Sharks, that talk, and his dad called him Sharkboy. A storm causes them to drift apart in rafts and the sharks choose not to eat them citing ""Don't take a bite out of him, he's a friend."" They take him to their cave and raise him in the ways of the shark. Somehow a boy is born half human and half shark and after being raised by the sharks, he grows gills, a fin, and his teeth become sharp. I suppose we're supposed to suspend disbelief because this is a kids movie.When this picture is released on DVD, in a few months, audiences will be able to see it as it should have been in 2D. When ""Spy Kids 3D was released on video, it came with the horrible glasses so I'm sure this one will to. However, I am not recommending this picture to any audience. Everything is lazy, the characters are boring and Sharkboy's Sharkship that he uses to transport the kids to Planet Drool looks ridiculous. None of the characters are worth mentioning and performances from David Arquette and Kristin Davis are wasted and George Lopez as the villain with plughounds, Mr. Eletric is cardboard. What we have is a good looking children's movie, minus the 3D, that fails in every way as an adaption when it could have been much better.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
60,mrrockey,Insulting to Children's Intelligence,2,2 November 2013,"The Adventures of Sharkboy And Lavagirl sums up many of the problem with children's entertainment these days that isn't made by Pixar or DreamWorks. It's stupid, insipid, insulting, painful, and every other hateful term you could come up with. Why is it so bad? Here's why.Firstly, the story. While the initial premise may not sound too bad(I'm not gonna describe it since this is IMDb so you could easily find it), the execution is what makes it so horrible. Firstly, the dialogue is laughable. I know these are supposed to be Grade 4 kids but good God, the dialogue here is so fwcking stupid! It's hard to describe so I'm just gonna put down a few examples, Linus(the bully): ""I'm gonna burst your bubble, dream boy!"", Mr. Electric(the villain): ""This is gonna hertz! Get it, hertz? As in electrical frequency?"", (Lavagirl walks by and burns some paper), Linus: ""She's hot!"", and the worst one of them all, Max(our protagonist): ""I wish I could just escape this loser(emphasis here) world and go to Planet Drool!"". Great dialogue, huh? Quentin Tarantino, eat your heart out!But if the dialogue wasn't bad enough, the kids'acting is... HORRIBLE! They don't even look like they know what they are doing half the time and it wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that the script requires them to do DRAMA! Every time one of them got mad, every time one of them broke down and cried, I never bought it. It actually feels like I'm watching a school play at times. The adults on the other hand, are OKAY in their parts with George Lopez seeming to have fun with his part as Mr. Electric but boy, is David Arquette bad in this! There's a scene where his wife is about to be sucked away by a tornado and he sounds like he's mocking the script! I literally bursted out laughing at that scene when I was supposed to be touched by his change of heart! And it's strange because from what I've seen of David Arquette in the Scream films, he's not a bad actor. He's no Brando but he can do comedy and he's good at playing shy and awkward. So I don't know why is he this bad in this film.Now since this is a superhero movie(sorta), you'd expect great technicals, right? WRONG! The special effects in this film are easily some of the worst special effects of the 2000's. Well, at least theatrically. Just oh my God, is the CGI bad! This movie was shot on a soundstage with nothing but a greenscreen 70% of the time, which isn't something I'm fond of even if it's done by some of the best CGI artists working today but it wouldn't bother me that much if the script and acting was good but here, it isn't so it just makes it worse! I never for a second, believed that these actors were actually IN the world that the script put them in because of how overly digital everything looked. They also try to throw as much junk as they could in front of the camera since this movie was released in 3D and it's just stupid. You don't need to throw that much crap into the camera just because it's 3D.The comedy in the film is so freaking juvenile! All it is is stupid jokes related to butts, farts, and poop! Now I know this is a kids'movie but come on, you could try harder than that.So yeah, this movie is pretty freaking terrible. The acting is poor, the dialogue sounds like it's written by a fifth-grader, the effects are incredibly cheap, and the comedy is just plain juvenile. Seriously, don't show your kids this, show them something from Pixar or DreamWorks instead. Those films are much funnier, much better made, much better written, and most of all, doesn't insult the intelligence of children.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

I'll tell u what its about. a stupid kid dreamer named max(played by the even stupider Cayden Boyd) who dreams up the incredibly stupid duo of Sharkboy and Lavagirl(played by gay Taylor Lautner and Taylor Dooley)After Sharkboy and Lavagirl take Max to planet drool, totally stupid, they must save the planet from Mr.Electric(George Lopez)And guess what, the bad guy is the bully at school and the ice princess is max's crush!!it is stupid and pointless. i hate it and don't plan to ever watch it again.I recommend that you don't watch it.here are some reasons why; 1.it has VERY bad acting 2.it has the worst plot ever 3.its dumb The last is, its not even 3-D!

Looking back now, it all looks completely absurd, but for a while, these sorts of movies were really popular (I suppose they have a successor in the similarly tacky superhero blockbusters of today, but I digress). What this one has that puts it above the rest is a totally insane plot that jumps from incident to increasingly bizarre incident with no regard for any sort of internal logic. The whole thing is tacky and ridiculous, loaded with bad acting and corny dialogue; but yet it exerts a strange sort of ironic appeal.

68,Travis_Moran,Both of us say...Dream on,5,18 November 2005,"This is sort of a double review cause me and my girlfriend watched this together and we both have ""thoughts"" about it.My 9yo cousin gave us this movie just cause he liked it...he even got us a couple pairs of 3d glasses to watch it with.Both of us thought the movie was kid junk, but really isn't that what it was supposed to be? There were some fun spots though.TRAVIS: Most of the characters I hated. (Too bad Mr. Electric didn't do away with some of em before he was defeated.) They were weak and poorly acted...esp. Max. But I liked Sharkboy for the most part. He had that cocky attitude that sort of appeals to me. And, although not original, some of his one-liners were cool.ANNETTE: Travis is a bit harsh (as usual), but I'll agree with him about weak and poorly acted characters. I couldn't even identify with Lavagirl, although I thought she was quite attractive. Sharkboy was a really cute guy though. Mr. Electric/Teacher was nothing short of annoying.TRAVIS: Story was really lame, but it's probably good enough for younger kids. It pretty much bored me tho. Some of the 3d was okay and I noticed it looked a heck of a lot better on our LCD TV than the old one.ANNETTE: Yes. The story was very weak. But it was colourful, and as Travis noted, should appeal to a younger audience. 3d was fun, but not the best I've seen. We watched this on a 27-inch LCD screen with quite nice results.ANNETTE: I thought the scene where Lavagirl zaps Sharkboy out of jealousy was the cutest part of this movie. And the way Sharkboy copied the tone of the Jurassic Park character's false calm in his ""yell...scream"" comment when they were on the ""train-of-thought"" was sort of humorous.TRAVIS: Yeah Annette. You would like that zapping scene! My favourite scene was when Sharkboy says ""ouch"" with that sh*t-eating grin on his face when Lavagirl kisses him.Well, anyhow, as you can see, we didn't totally abhor this movie. Although I think we both agree the only decent acting was by Sharkboy. For the most part this movie was boring. But that's most likely because we are too old for it. If you've got younger kids, it will probably entertain them adequately. Avg. rating=5.TRAVIS: I rated this a 4 cause it seemed to be cranked out without much thought. With some extra work it could have been a lot better. The only reason it gets as high as a 4 is cause I liked Sharkboy.ANNETTE: I rated this a 6 because it seemed to appeal to the audience intended. But I also agree that with more time and attention there certainly could have been a lot of improvement. Perhaps if Rodriguez decides to make a sequel, he will obtain a better story with better actors and surprise us all.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
69,-628,Good concept; poor 3D,6,30 September 2005,"Robert Rodriguez has managed to duplicate his achievements in Spy Kids 3D: he has written and directed a creative story with excellent special effects but spoilt the process with very poor 3D. The 3D effects themselves are a high standard but the glasses are the old style one-red, one-green eye which don't give a clear image and which reduce almost all of the colour. Lava Girl's hair colour with the glasses off was ideal for the role. However, with the glasses on, which they had to be for the majority of the movie, her hair was almost devoid of colour - very poor effect.

71,bigdinosaur,Could we have an future cult classic on our hands?,2,16 December 2005,"Well, well, well. I claim the very dubious honour of having watched this...er...movie twice. Once with a friend and her kids; And again with my 14 year old.Of course it's a stinker. But then many movies that managed to attain cult status have been worse stinkers than this one ('Attack of the Killer Tomatoes' for example).One method whereby movies rise to cult level is by negative recommendation. People tell friends how bad it is, and the friends watch it to see why. And I've certainly noticed a whole lot of negative comments regarding this movie. For a long time 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' was regaled as the worse movie made. I and many of my acquaintances watched it just to see why it got that reputation. 'Plan 9' now enjoys a modest cult following.Another contributing factor is unintentional humour. My second viewing of this movie had me chuckling at Lavagirl's constant Cheshire grins, and at some of the tacked in nonsense to show off the 3d effect (Sharkboy throwing a glass of water toward the audience during his ""dance"" routine, for example).Sometimes deviating radically from the ""norm"" can project a film into the realm of cult status also. This movie, while not engaging in major deviation, still has enough strangeness about it to give it a little push in that direction.Who knows. Perhaps in the future, droves of teenagers (and maybe adults too) will throng to theatres late at night, 3d glasses in hand, to see this little piece...as they do now for 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'.Right now the future looks grim for this oddity, but I would certainly not be surprised to see it pop up out of nowhere sometime down the road.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

But there is trouble in Drool as Mr Electric  who seems to us to be channeling Dr Evil  is the worst bad dream yet, trapping kids on a roller-coaster of endless fun to stop them from dreaming. Max is the secret weapon that can stop him, if only he can remember his dreams.The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl is sometimes more sickly sweet than the Land of Milk and Cookies, but it is also packed full of the random, bizarre and hysterical stuff that dreams are made of.

Wouldn't it be great if your father turned round to you and say...hey, why not make a movie together? That's the way Sharkboy was made-by a six year old kid and his dad. The story is of young Max, a dizzy daydreamer who is bullied because of his 'WILD' imagination. He magics up two superhero's, Sharkboy and Lavagirl, who happen to be real...sort of. Well, now Max's enemies better hide in shame, as his creations blast through the walls of school to take us all to Planet Drool, the hype world which the hothead and the coldfish so happen to live on. Confused? you will be in the muddy 3-D effects that follow. Turns out that Max is needed to dream the planet back to life...But he has forgot his dream journal!!! Oh no! Like I said, the effects don't work in 3-D and the world of Planet Drool is totally over-the top. Fans of Spy Kids and Robert Rodriguez and kids won't be too disappointed, but those over 14 and really unhappy children won't see eye to eye with the CGI. The cast is relied on three young amaetures (Lautner and Dooley as Sharkboy and Lavagirl and Boyd as Max) however, it is the young cast, and not Latino God George Lopez who carry the story. That is why it has got a higher mark- For its younger casts enthusiasm. The adults are easily out-acted by the young sprogs. Lopez can'y be bothered, Kristin Davies plays the bored mom and David Arquette (the movies most famous star) shows up on screen with boring quotes for just twenty seconds. In fact, the movie has no real stars. just amaetures willing to boost their young careers. Oh well, Drew Barrymore wannabe all round.If you like really whacky movies then see Sharkboy.

And when they broke into a classroom? I cracked up at those scenes. Wait, it gets funnier, after they find Max and fly off to Planet drool, Max's face expression was funny while the ship flew faster than a hurricane. In the roller coaster scene, it was hilarious when the kids hung upside-down and their faces were like they saw a monster. It was so cool how Sharkboy and Lavagirl can not only jump very high, but they can stand on an upside-down roller coaster. I think this is why people decide to hate this movie, because the 3 adventurers went through a field of brains with a bus. It was nasty, but that doesn't stop me. Sharkboy said that everyone should yell or scream and they did, like little girls.When Sharkboy fell in chocolate in the Land of Milk and Cookies and then he ate it off his shoe, then he spit it out. Max tried using a marshmallow as a pillow to dream some more and when Lavagirl decided to try it, she burned it. They later got attacked by giants. When the giant tasted the cookie, he spit it out. I loved how Sharkboy and Lavagirl sing a lullaby to Max, then Lavagirl burns Max's ass to wake him up. And Sharkboy's funniest quote was ""Still hungry, Max? How about a knuckle sandwich?!""When they got to the Land of Ice, I liked how Lavagirl had to sleepwalk to walk over an ice bridge. Then Sharkboy and Max p*ss her off by awakening her and the bridge was falling apart so the bad guy won't chase after them. Lavagirl is funny when she's mad, and when she burned Max's diary, she yelled ""Why did you make me like this?! WHY, Max?!"", then got sprayed by Sharkboy. It also gets funny when it rained brains all over Minus, which also could be why people decide to hate it. And when his brain farted causing his head to become giant, I had a laugh attack.The scene where Sharkboy and Lavagirl die, it was heart-breaking, but that doesn't stop me from giving this a 10/10. At least Sharkboy came back to life, but he had to throw Lavagirl in a volcano to save her life. Then she later kissed him on the cheek. And it was funny how the Ice Princess froze the main antagonist of this movie and he exploded. The ending was marvelous where Sharkboy and Lavagirl became somewhat boyfriend and girlfriend.

86,moniker_jones,More Like Pathetic Boy and Crap Girl...Am I Right?,2,6 November 2005,"Robert Rodriguez has been rapidly releasing films since his low-budget miracle El Mariachi debuted thirteen years ago. That film reportedly cost a mere $7000 to shoot, but it instantly became its creator's meal ticket. Despite his obvious talent behind the camera and impressive work ethic, Rodriguez had never delivered another unique picture until this year's Sin City. Sadly, he has followed up that groundbreaking effort with a sappy 3-D nightmare based on a short story written by his 7-year old son. It would have been better for audiences everywhere if Rodriguez had simply taken his son's story and posted it on the family refrigerator. Instead, he has taken advantage of his current good standing in Hollywood and manufactured one of the worst films in recent memory. The story, paper-thin as it is, revolves around 10 year-old Max and the title characters that exist in his dreams. If you have seen The Neverending Story, you've witnessed a far superior interpretation of this film's familiar themes.The 3-D portions of the movie, which constitute most of its 92 minute running time, are shoddy and rarely engaging. It's ironic that a 3-D feature should be populated by such one-dimensional characters. The abundance of painfully corny humor is made worse by the unskilled actors who deliver it. Equally annoying is Rodriguez's inexplicable need to repeat the themes of the film in nearly every line of dialogue.

Once you accept that dream-logic is at work, it begins to make more sense.I wasn't expecting much from this movie; it looked, frankly, like it had been made specifically to be a McDonalds tie-in. But I found it took itself lightheartedly enough that most of the plot holes are easy enough to overlook. The acting was spotty, but not atrocious (I wasn't a fan of Max, but both Sharkboy and Lavagirl were fun, and Linus was the perfect little a**hole kid). The score was good, excepting the overly literal closing song. The CGI was only a bit better than TV series quality, but that fits in with the childhood-dream motif. What really surprised me was the impressive fight choreography, esp. where Sharkboy was concerned (and I thought the plug hounds were kind of inventive).The weakest spot was Max's home life. I've seen parental troubles done better in plenty of kid movies. Not sure what David Arquette as thinking. The whole ""You're my best friend!"" scene looked like a walk-through for both of them. I found George Lopez's performance spotty as well, but that may have been a reflection of the dialog he had to work with. Yeah, the dialog was kind of stilted sometimes, but it seemed to happen in conjunction with people trying to put on airs.Oh, don't get me wrong, there were some plot holes. Why did they tell Sharkboy to swim away from the eels when he could have gotten out of the water? Why did the ice king say the thing would work i it wouldn't? Idunno. But it was fun.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

I am forever grateful for the discount cinema. Aside from loosing about an hour and a half of my life, I was out less than $5. She loved it, I couldn't wait for it to end. The movie starts almost like a bad after school special. Max's parents are fighting, and his mom, one day, tells him to make sure he comes ""straight home"" after school...they live across the street from it. He has a teacher that tells him in no uncertain terms to ""stop dreaming,"" and seeing George Lopez as both his teacher and one of the bad guys was just a bit much.

If you have a boy between the ages of 5 and 12, you are probably going to have/get to see this film so here's what to expect:More of the same... only less. Sorry if that doesn't make sense but it will. More of the same because it's just like ""Spy Kids 3-D"" on the way it looks and unfold. It looks like a video game and is very predictable. Less is because there is, unfortunately, hardly any good 3-D sequences. Nothing pops out at you the way it did in SPY KIDS except for when someone sneezes or throws something, and that is not too often. The 3-D in the action scenes was poor and barely noticeable. You can't expect too much from the RED AND BLUE 3-D but this was a step backwards from SPY KIDS.The good news is that you will probably not get a headache from the 3-D like SPY KIDS. My 6 year old loved it and did not say a word throughout (a minor miracle), so i guess it does what it is supposed to do. Entertain the kids.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

That sounds like a pretty cool theme but the disjointed plot and the weak writing undermine it terribly. The characters are cartoonish - not just Lavagirl and Sharkboy but the 'realworld' characters too. When I read that Rodriguez's 7-year old was given a writing credit it made sense - it comes over as written by a 7-year old, its just embarrassing that it was also written by his Dad.Bet it was the seven year old that included a girl as a main character that wasn't a love interest, though. Rodriguez accidentally let that through, but made sure it doesn't pass the bechdel test.Still, once you accept you are watching a cartoon - don't expect anything much beyond comic-book characters - and run with it, it is quite fun. My kids delight certainly helped me enjoy this, but I gave myself up to the daftness. The 2D visuals were bright though basic and no more was needed. I'm slightly embarrassed to say it, but watching this with my kids I did enjoy this movie.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

The characters are over the top geared more to be made fun of than laugh with. Having a kid movie is fine, in light of all the more abrasive elements out in the world, but making a bad move!Plus marketing it to be the vein of Spy Kids is bad planning on part of the film makers. It is NOT Spy Kids, it's trying to be one but falls way short.Children will go to see it if other kids are going, but I don't see this film as being a repeat performer as a must have kid classic.

102,noahhaye,Well...it has 3D.,3,27 May 2015,"This movie was released by the same guy who made Spy Kids and Spy Kids 2. They might have aged a bit throughout the years, but I can still manage to enjoy it. However, instead of seeing this as the director of those 2 classics, I see him as the director of Spy Kids 3 and 4. Why?Because it was filled with obnoxious 3-D, terrible acting, and CG-i that I can only describe as something Foodfight would show in their movie...just without the sexual innuendos and fetishes. But I just can't really hate it. Besides, much of the ideas in the movie was from the director's son Racer. Plus, it was laughably bad. It's just one of those instances where it's just so bad it's good, kinda like The Room or Catwoman. It's still ugly and the 3-D is annoying, but it's a laughable and enjoyable sort of annoying.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
103,hoosierrevue,"Good concept, bad execution, and terrible in 3-D",2,24 June 2005,"I'm sure kids will like this movie, but I found it to be a bit tiresome and at times absurd.The 3-D effects that Robert Rodriguez seems to insist upon using in his children's movies (e.g. Spy Kids 12: Game Over, Man) were completely useless and extremely distracting. There are far more expensive ways to create a 3-D movie, and while I understand that Rodriguez is Johnny-Low-Budget-Director, I don't see the point in using 3-D if it's just going to look crappy on screen. I don't know how many 3-D movies you might have seen lately, as it was a trend that went out of style back in the 80's and all, but it's almost impossible to see anything out of those ridiculous glasses because of the dark red lens on your left eye and blue lens on your right. Most of the color is therefore zapped out and you're left squinting and crossing your eyes, all in an effort to see the fabulous 3-D bubbles that appear to float at your face. Wow, thank god that was in 3-D because otherwise it would have just been 2-D bubbles. And come on, that's just lame.Anyway, so Max is a nerdling whose parents (David freaking Arquette and Kristin DavisRodriguez doesn't bother to give the parents actual names) fight a lot and might be getting a divorce. Max also has a really hard time making friends at school, so he retreats into his imagination and dreams of a far better, more desirable world. A world of drool. Yes, I can see how that would be much better. This dubious planet o' fun is ruled by kids, chiefly Sharkboy and Lava Girl, who are the beloved superheroes of Max's imagination. Max is discouraged from dreaming, however, by his friendly and well-intentioned teacher, Mr. Elecricidad, who encourages him to try and make friends in the real world. Max decides to take his advice, at which point his dreams (Sharkboy and Lava Girl) materialize in the real world using a random tornado (?) and enlist his help to save Planet Drool from destruction.This is all well and good from a creative standpoint so far, so Max wanders around Planet Drool with Sharkboy and Lava Girl, trying to find an ice crystal that can save the planet or some damn thing. His classmate and friendly neighborhood bully, Linus, is cleverly renamed Minus in Planet Drool, and he evilly attempts to destroy the place in the same manner that he destroyed Max's dream journal in real life. Sharkboy and Lava Girl will have none of that, as they would prefer not to be eliminated by some bully who is really just sad and lonely inside (as all bullies are of course). Lava Girl, amidst searching for the crystal, asks Max what her powers are every five minutes. Um, you're made of lava. You've been shooting the stuff out of your hands throughout the whole stupid 3-D movie! But, I guess that particular power is simply not good enough. Sharkboy then takes the opportunity to chime in and whine to Max about his lack of an army of sharks, all the while yelling at Max to please dream up some cool new stuff, yo.All of this nonsense is supposed to convey the message, don't stop dreaming, damnit! The audience is mercilessly beaten with the message in 3-D every few minutes. I think it's odd that the one grownup who doesn't stop dreaming, David Arquette, is an unemployed loser on the verge of a divorce. Yet despite this obviously dismal future for dreamers, Sharkboy and Lava Girl tirelessly repeat the message to Max (and the visually assaulted audience) every two seconds. In 3-D.You know, I'm sure that kids will enjoy this movie, but I can't help but feel that there should be a standard for quality in kids' movies. This one, while conceptually pretty creative, falls way short of the bar.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
104,dss-2,i liked it,6,28 November 2005,"I did not see this movie in the theater, but I have seen it twice at home on DVD. On a 52 inch HDTV the 16:9 enhanced DVD and DTS sound is really neat. I agree that the 3D effects don't jump out all of the time, but a shark in the lap is not too bad. I am much older than 6. I have not seen any of Robert Rodriguez's work before, but based on this movie I will get more. I personally think that 3D has a lot to offer and remains one of the unexplored areas of cinema. The acting does leave much to be desired, but against the fantastical digital background i am not sure great acting would be of any benefit. Put the kids to bed and watch it while having a nice glass of wine. The movie might ""grow"" on you",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
105,Anthony_Boyd,Good for kids,8,15 June 2005,"Well, I didn't like it. Or, at the least what I mean is that I just saw a movie with tons of plot-holes, childish themes, and so on. However, you better believe my kids loved it. My son actually hooted and hollered when Sharkboy started fighting the plugs. He grabbed my shirt and motioned for me to watch, even though I already was. I think I just witnessed my son discovering his first hero.My daughter laughed and laughed. She loved Lavagirl. She thought it was hilarious when Lavagirl zapped Sharkboy because he said someone else was prettier. And my daughter is old enough to understand the themes of pursuing your goals and remaining strong in the face of discouragement. So I think she walked away very pleased with the film. She said she wants to be Lavagirl for Halloween.If you're 16+ this movie is a loser. You won't like it, and that explains all the low scores you're seeing here. This movie just isn't for adults. But if you are a parent looking to entertain your kids, this movie works. And if you are reading this near the end of 2005 or later, you should probably know that renting this as a video will be a fine way to keep your kids occupied.-Tony",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

The plot-pointless adults wandering about (the alternatively wooden and simpering David Arquette and Kristin Davis) to the overt posturing by the kids (especially Taylor Lautner) kept me checking my watch every so often. George Lopez was the one slightly bright spot of the film, but even his caricature teacher or ""Electricity"" villain wore thin after the first half of the film.Again, my boys and their friend loved it; children this age rarely catch gaping plot holes when sharks are jumping at them from the screen or a kid's karate chops can defeat an ornery electrical cord.

121,yaalaast,Adults beware...Leave it to the kids!,7,20 November 2005,"I hadn't planned on wasting my time reviewing this mess, but there are some subtleties that crept into my consciousness after the second forced viewing which may enhance a prospective viewer's experience.First of all, this movie obviously was designed for younger kids. That fact alone has a detrimental effect on a review done by an adult (as can be seen by previous reviews). However, it should be noted that a movie for the target audience will most likely be attended by their parents or guardians, and should be at least bearable for them also. This movie falls short in that regard.My son, who is 5, absolutely raves about this movie, and will no doubt wear out the DVD in the next few weeks. But my younger brother, who is 17, walked out five minutes into it. Kids under 12 will probably be best entertained by Sharkboy & Lavagirl. It is a very colourful movie with a lot of motion and many bizarre graphics. There is nothing offensive in this movie by the way. Even the ""fight"" scenes are mild and clean.Now, the main subtlety on my mind is that Sharkboy (who was the best actor in this colourful, but mindless drivel) has obvious hidden talent. This movie, however, was not the right venue to expose that talent. Sharkboy moves well in action scenes and would be more aptly suited to a martial arts style role. Also, Sharkboy has a wide range of facial expressions (although the ones emphasised by this movie consisted mainly of scowls and frowns). With continued training, suitable roles, and of course (and most importantly) proper direction, Sharkboy could go far with his acting career. Also, he is a decent looking lad, which seems to be a requirement for an acting career these days. I'm certainly hoping we'll be seeing more of Sharkboy in the future.Another noted item: If you have the 2D version, it seems to be far superior to the 3D. My son thought the glasses were fun the first time, but after that he didn't want anything to do with them and now only watches the 2D version. Possibly this 3D effect is better if viewed in a theatre.I'm giving out a rating of 7 for this title, simply because it certainly has the ability to entertain the kids...which was its purpose I'm sure. I would definitely recommend Sharkboy & Lavagirl if you have younger children. For adults it has no value whatsoever.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

The movie tries really hard to get you interested in the characters but you just can't, even when Lavagirl or Sharkboy are in danger the overall response is apathy. The humor was received in the very same way no groans no anything.Most of the adults in the theater i saw it in had to be woken up by their kids when it was over perhaps the best summation comes from the mouth of my 8 year old who said ""That was the most boring adventure movie i ever saw."".Sorry Mr. Rodriguez but you can put glitter (in this case 3D) on a pile of manure and it's still a pile of manure.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

I think that explains why my kids were drawn to the trailers and totally loved the movie. It also explains why I thought the movie was so imaginative and original.

Kids won't understand what the point of the speech is if you take them to see this movie. They'll probably like the action and all, but they will think the whole speech thing is a snore. All I'm saying is that maybe we should try not to make that many kid action movies again for a while, because this is a perfect example of getting carried away with the fact that the main characters are supers.

I think that most kids would enjoy it, one example of this is as i was walking into the theater, a kid walking out from the last showing was very excited and said he loved it.To parents, or teens, the movie may not be your type unless you are in to the ""cute"", funny, ""out of this world"", childish storyline type of movies.

135,steve-1882,A film that doesn't care what damage it does,1,29 August 2005,"Sounds like an excessive statement for an ostensibly harmless fantasy. I wanted to like this. Admittedly, it's crass and confused about what it's trying to do and the resolution makes no sense whatsoever. But it's well meaning enough and Rodriguez is clearly in touch with something of childhood. In fact, Rodriguez is probably not altogether grown up himself, bearing in mind this is the man who made the sexually bewildered, adolescent and masturbatory ""Sin City"".There is however one absolutely fatal problem with this film... The idea that a child on the brink of a family breakup has the power to make his parents love each other again simply by dreaming it strongly enough is nothing less than callous. It follows that the child who dreams his parents back together - and fails - has no one to blame but himself. Not clever, not helpful, and if any child buys into this fantasy, god help him.Fantasies are probably an important way for children (and everyone) to deal with emotional pain - but precisely because they are fantasies - They can have power for (the inner) us, but they simply don't apply to the rest of experience. Not only to confuse fantasy and reality, but to make some sort of half-baked moral imperative of it has the potential to cause enormous damage, or at least to exacerbate damage already caused.If the child you plan to take to see this is in any way vulnerable to such fantasies, I'd strongly recommend you don't.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

There are scenes no kids should see (two parents arguing in front of a child, and criticizing each other to the child), and other scenes that make no sense whatsoever (the giants and the cookies?!). In addition, the 3-d is a complete waste of time.

I know a lot of people like it and that's fine, but I hated it. Yes, I know it's for children, but the thing is, it isn't even dumb fun to me, and while I don't expect too much for a kids movie, this is so stupid I feel as if it talks down to them, obviously the director had good intentions which is the only good thing I can say, and the scene with Linus' bad acting in the line ""Send him to the principals office and have him expelled"". Apart from that, this movie was boring, it had eye straining with bad CGI, stupid story, dull characters, cringing jokes and bad acting. The song dream also sucks, it is so cringing bad and the dancing is a no no, the singing is... oh god...Okay, with it's horrible CGI visuals, which I know is Roberts trademark style but it's way too gimmicky and it doesn't mean I have to like it, though I liked it on the original Spy Kids, which is a way better movie than this. The colours in this movie hurt my eyes so much and the wacky and awkward movements don't help. The characters do the stupidest things, even though Lavagirl was aware she would burn things she holds the journal and this movie just keeps on continuing... ugh... The burning of Lavagirl is very inconsistent as well. I could point out all the problems I have but this should briefly cover my thoughts on this enough.I might be nitpicking on this movie at some points and yeah it's a dumb kids movie that doesn't age well for many, but even as a kid, I didn't like this. I loved Spy Kids so much I might have expected too much from this. As I said, if you like it, that's cool, that doesn't mean you're stupid or anything, but for me, I'm putting this movie at #3 or #2 worst in my worst movie list, it's not the most frustrating thing ever and it's more like groaning, but the quality and acting is bad so...",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

Evan was wearing a neck restraint, holding his head against the chair. In front of him was a television and next to him was a table with a knife on it. After screaming for help and attempting to rip off the neck restraint the television switched on. On the television was a dummy with red swivels on his cheeks. The dummy then said: ""Hello Evan. I want to play a game. So far in what could loosely be called your life you've been making bad movies to **** of the general public. Well now it's your turn to be ****** off by the worst movie of all time. This film has made people go mad. You may of noticed that you are wearing a neck restraint. Since your eyes are directly in the way of this television set you will will be forced to watch whatever appears on this screen. When this message ends the television will show a film from the start. When the film ends you will receive a key that will remove the restraint around your neck which will allow you to exit the room.

143,Shinan,I can remember this one,6,3 November 2005,"This film is not the most awesome ever, I'll admit that but it is not as bad as everyone seem to think it is. In a way I can relate to this story, when I was a kid we used to play around in all kinds of fantasy worlds, where the ultimate coolness was a few lame one-liners and a lot of fighting against weird monsters.Now this film basically takes me back to that. These aren't the exact stories that I used to dream about but they're damned close and the way they are presented are also very close to 'backinthedays'. The film is played out like a video game, with levels and obstacles to overcome, back in my days these obstacles were all in the 2d or top-down view from Mario or Zelda but I imagine that today they are more in full 3d and with much better graphics. The film had all that.But as a film. This isn't all that good, it's not the worst ever. And it does have a certain cute playfulness about it, which, I'll assume, would make it good for its target audience. I don't know exactly who the target audience is though, but I suspect they should at least pretty much identify with the protagonist of the film.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

He sat through about the first hour of it and then lost interest.They had the ""you must keep dreaming and make your dreams come true"" speech about ten times too many and the ""Who am I..REALLY?"" whine about ten times too many also. And they also had to throw in the "" my parents just don't understand"" subplot (they hint at the parents splitting up but never actually say the word divorce) and the mandatory ""evil teacher changes his attitude"" character.Then at the end, everything in the world is absolutely perfect and beautiful. The school bully has learned his lesson, the parents have fallen in love all over again (which has absolutely nothing to do with anything else that happened in the movie),and the school nerd is a now a hero. Nothing in the movie connects with anything else in the movie. The special effects were dismal. I think someone spit out food about 97 times just so they could have 3-d chunks blowing at you. The 3-d glasses were too dark on the red side causing the effects to be out of focus. Sometimes, I had to take the glasses off just to see what was supposed to be happening.The only reason I gave it a 2 was because it kept my son interested for about 1 hour,...otherwise, a big fat 0.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
145,sdoughman1,""" Horrible special effects and broken storyline...""",2,3 June 2010,"I recently just finished watching the movie ""The Adventures of Shark boy and Lava girl"". I have sisters and I managed to catch the movie with them while I was bored, and words can't describe how much I have come to hate this movie.The movie involves a boy who's emotions inexplicably shift during the movie, a villain who clearly has George Lopez's face pasted in the middle, and a little kid with a mow-hawk for a villain. The movie is almost entirely shot in front of a green screen, and it shows. Sometimes the acting is poor and sometimes it isn't, and the environment looks so bad that it made me want to puke, especially because the background rarely matched up with the actors. The layout for the entirely computer-generated world seemed to have been chosen at random by a pre-schooler. I won't reveal the ending, if a viewer can make it that far, but it makes zero sense.The acting is sub-par, George Lopez wasn't meant to be a villain, or a comedian but that's my opinion. Shark boy and Lava girl do OK, but they take themselves to seriously. The entire environment is to serious for it's own good. Most of the non-title characters did a poor job, and the villain would hardly even qualify as bad, in a villain sense, not an acting sense. Some say that the 3-D version of the movie drained the color, and that would explain how the movie managed to be so colorful, but have such a dull environment.The story-line is so broken down, twisted, and out of whack that by the end of the movie, you can hardly even describe what happens. I will try to describe this to the best of my ability. There is a boy named Max who is obsessed with dreaming and creativity, and is scolded for it. He writes all of his dreams down in a little dream journal, which is vandalized by a bully named Linus. His teacher doesn't like him and one day during school, Shark boy and Lava girl show up out of a tornado and are real somehow. They take him to the Planet Drool to help them save it. They go on several adventures, with little continuity, eventually trying to save the world in time from Linus (clearly inspired by the bully as they are played by the same actor), as well as trying to find a purpose in Drool for an over-emotional Lava Girl. I won't reveal the end, but it's anti-climactic, and is really when the movie takes a nose-dive into the trash-heap of poor movies.In short, the movie sucked, and my little sisters spent all of their time during the movie, either making fun of the poor green screening, or the main character Max. So this movie isn't for kids, it isn't for anybody because it sucked. The only reason to watch this abomination of mankind, is the fact that Taylor Lautner is Shark boy. I am not a Twilight fan, but it's funny to see the kick-flipping actor at twelve years old, kick flipping some really bad looking bad guys. That is the only reason I gave this movie a two, that and George Lopez.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

I thought that the special effect were something out of a 6th grade play. The acting, even though by children were terrible, because they both should be experienced actors/actresses. It really looked like a dream of a boy, and not a movie. Once again the main things what made this movie as it was, was the acting, and the ""cheesy"", and ""corny"" special effects. I think that if there was to be a sequel the director would need to seriously think about changing all the actors/actresses, and whoever was in charge of the special effects needs to go back to their school. Overall I thought this movie was a waste of my time, directv really wasted their time by putting on public television. It was a cartoon production.

I came into the movie, and within the first 5 SECONDS I was already gripped into this story that hasn't even begun yet. As I progressed through the movie, I only got more and more baffled by all of the negative reviews and comments people were leaving. EVERYTHING about this movie is perfect. Everything was done with the utmost care and all the characters are deftly woven into deep, relatable characters that you really care about and want to succeed. The music is fully orchestrated and truly epic, a soundtrack to truly fit the eminence of everything else in the movie. The CGI in the movie is done extremely well, with certain camera tricks and acting makes it look real. I must say all the computer engineers did a great job on their part, precise to the smallest polygon or pixel. The story is an absolute roller-coaster, one emotion to the next, each scene more breathtaking than the last. In short, everything about this movie was perfection in every aspect.In conclusion, do not trust the low IQ nonintellectual degenerates that call this movie ""trash"" or ""only kids stuff"", this is a movie, like many others, which is only for intellectuals and requires a very high IQ to truly understand the depth of what is playing on your television screen.

The 3D worked on me, and while things weren't flying in my face the whole time, it did give the movie a strange depth.So what can I say, I was in no way expecting cinematic brilliance but I did enjoy most of what I say created before me. I'm 20 years old, and I think I understood what they were trying to do.So, I don't know... give it a chance. Take a kid to see it, or just try to enjoy it for what it is. But try to remember this, when you are a kid your imagination is insane. My brother tells me the most foolish, crazy stories... because he is a kid. The movie lets imagination run free, and I think that is a good thing.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
162,louli89,Nightmare,1,13 August 2007,"I just wanted to include my thoughts on this movie, although they are rather late. First I would like to say that I watched Spy Kids and loved it. Almost all the movies I watch are kids movies, in fact. This movie was a disaster.The acting was horrible - even the Teletubbies can do better. The plot is just about as lame as it can get. I mean, Lava Girl spills the plot early in the movie, and in a flat tone. Even in the scary parts, the actors sound as though they're reading their lines of a paper. The whole movie is dry and tasteless and very boring. Even the supposed climax is lame.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
163,Lord_Ghaleon,Absolutely terrible! A cinematic mistake...,1,11 June 2005,"Over the past few years, I have noticed that many bad movies have been released. Joining this list of mistakes is Sharkboy & Lavagirl in 3-D. I was forced to see this movie, and I realize that I just lost about an hour and forty minutes of my life. Sharkboy & Lavagirl is just an excuse by its creators to show off their 3-D skills. However, the movie is still bad. From what I have learned, this movie was created by Rodriguez's seven year-old son, and the movie actually plays out like it was directed by a seven year-old. The movie has almost no plot, and the characters are mostly one-sided. I am a movie buff, and I have seen some bad movies; I was not prepared for Sharkboy & Lavagirl. Most of the movie makes no sense, even though most of the film takes place in a dream: Sharkboy grew fins, gills, shark-like teeth, and claws in a few years as he was raised by sharks, but for that to really happen, millions of years would have to pass. Sharkboy has the ability to breathe and walk on land, but he has gills - the movie makes no mention of him being amphibious (even though this can be inferred). Lavagirl is said (towards the end) to be the embodiment of light, but she is lava-powered - lava is more destruction than light. The plot is quite simple: The main character, Max, is a dimly creative, loserly kid who is antagonized by the class bully, Linus. Max keeps a dream journal, which is full of information about the super zeroes Sharkboy and Lavagirl (what a surprise). He loves to dream and during one day at school, he is ""rescued"" by Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Max is taken to Planet Drool, the most idiotic planet in movie history. On Drool, Max, Lavagirl, and the moronic Sharkboy go on an adventure to stop ""the Darkness"" from destroying Planet Drool. On Drool the trio battle the cliché villain Mr. Electric and Linus' evil alter-ego, Minus. The end is very sappy, with Minus becoming a good guy and a friend of Max, Lavagirl and Sharkboy fulfilling their dreams, and Max's parents becoming friends again. Sharkboy & Lavagirl in 3-D is one movie you should never see.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

""Dad, I've got a GREAT idea for a movie, and by the way, I want to star in it!!!"" How this one ever got made will be a mystery to me. I know that the whole point of a kids movie is to please the kid, but come on, please! There have been LOTS of kids movies, that while they weren't that great, were pleasant to watch.

166,tnscones,"Sad, but true -- Rodriguez's vision exceeds today's theaters' current technology",8,6 June 2005,"After attending the premiere of this film (see comments below) I was amazed that it was poorly reviewed until I saw it at a local theater *without* polarization, multiple digital light projection, an IMAX screen, and state-of-the-art 3-D/non-disposable glasses. Now I know why people complained. What a mess.All I can say is this: Robert Rodriguez's cinematic prowess exceeds most theaters' current technology. This amazing kid's film is great fun when viewed digitally. Seeing the polarized version not yet shown outside Austin was like stepping inside a View Master projector -- something I always wanted to do when I was a kid. Unfortunately, what Robert has conjured up can't yet be seen the way he designed it. Someday soon, perhaps!--------- earlier comments, posted in June 2005:Little did I know yesterday that when my eight-year-old granddaughter and I went to see The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl in 3-D we would be viewing a polarized print of the film made exclusively for the Austin premiere. As Robert Rodriguez explained what we were about to see there was no way to imagine beforehand how the 3-D experience would be transformed by the killer combo of the polarized version shown on an IMAX screen through multiple DLPs. Once the movie started, however, I immediately realized I was watching something light years beyond anything I had yet seen. Trust me when I tell you that when Rodriguez waved his magic wand over the audience we caught an unforgettable glimpse of a child's dreams, as well as the future possibilities of cinematic fantasy.Don't listen to those who say there's nothing new to be had here, or that the story's derivative, or it's just for kids. Forget what you hear from cynical reviewers unable to momentarily access their inner child. This story, written by a kid for other kids, hasn't been tainted by anyone's opinion about keeping the older film-goers entertained through adult-themed inside references and innuendo.In making this film, Robert Rodriguez has wisely protected and preserved his son Racer's unique vision without the addition of dumbed-down ""mature"" wisecracks. Mr. Rodriguez, along with his producer--who just happens to be Robert's wife and Racer's mom, Elizabeth Avelan--knows that when it comes to children, play *is* their work. By respecting and valuing the realm of childhood imagination, this unique family team together share a story with us about the myriad ways creative thinking can impact the real world. Awe and wonder are not treated lightly here but rather offered to viewers in a much less adulterated form than that to which we have become accustomed. Today when I think about it, I simply close my eyes and smile.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

I was expecting a fun, engaging movie along the lines of Spy Kids for my two kids (5 and 7) and I got exactly what I hoped for. So nice to have both male and female protagonists! The humour was juvenile and very appropriate; my children were screaming with laughter at some points. The acting is good, the costumes are fun, and the characters likable. Let your kids make the decision on this one and just go along for the ride--you may not be overwhelmed, but your kids will be acting out Sharkboy and Lavagirl for weeks.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
168,maydupp,This is a fun movie for 8 & under kids,7,13 January 2006,"The criticisms of this movie are ridiculous. It is not made for adults. Many of the best kid's movies are also fun for adults, but this is not one of those. The acting is a little stiff, the dialog is silly, and the special effects are uneven. But young kids won't care. The story is about and for kids. My 7 year old boy and 4.5 year old girl really like it. (It would probably be to scary for under 6's to watch without a parent). I was able to enjoy watching it with my children on a rainy Saturday morning, but mostly because of their joy at the wild visuals and weird environments. So, if your an adult who is a fan of animation, special effects or sci-fi, please give this movie a pass.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

After the movie, I was HOOKED ON IT! Anything that had to do with dreamed up characters interested me....so much that when I bought the DVD with a few pairs of 3D glasses, I set out to watch the movie from beginning to end ALL OVER again. But after this long ride over and over, I began to get sick of it and stopped watching all together....that is until a few days ago, when I was searching for something and I found the DVD of this film, all pairs of glasses still intact inside, despite being a little dusty. I slipped it into my blue-ray player and have been watching it ever since! This movie was, despite what critics say, AWESOME! Taylor Lautner and Taylor Dooley were the BEST Sharkboy and Lavagirl I have ever seen!

They seemed to enjoy it, however there other movies that offer better bang for the buck.The plot was thin ( even for a kids movie)the special effects were less than spectacular. There is a ton of 3-d time. There are some middle of the road actors doing a satisfactory job in this flick, the pace is fast enough to hold the kids attention, however it should be said that I actually fell asleep in the theater( granted I was coming off a night shift and had only 3 hrs sleep) But I have never ever fallen asleep in a movie theater. We went to the cheap theater so it only cost $8 for the 4 of us for a matinée- it was our little guys 1st movie( 5yrs) and he didn't like the glasses- but he was excited by the whole experience, as was his 9yr old sister- not the best for parents but your kids will love it -particularly if they liked spy kids:3d",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
171,stentygee123,my childhood superheroes coming to life on TV,7,9 November 2014,"While in today's time, this film is outdated and could have had way better graphics and quality, The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl opened up viewers minds to a whole host of different opportunities for superhero movies- whether thats the traditional superhero movie with superheroes that save the world or a whole country and do all that whilst falling madly in love with someone and not being able to give them your true identity. Or whether it is simply a made up superhero world dreamt by a young boy. This film enlightens the younger generation to widen their imaginations and create TV's next superheroes. While the film itself is inspirational to the younger generation and where their mind will take them, the graphics and quality of the film are low, even for 2005's standards. However, overall I would give the film a 7/10 for a young child's imagination brought to life, along with the astonishing performances from both actors that made the emotional response from the audience possible.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

The movie had some good morales which is very much lacking today in just about every movie. And just as an added plus I enjoyed the movie as well. I see nothing wrong with knowing who your audience is. There are too many supposedly kids movies that have no concept who their audience is and do nothing more than bore the kids and offend the parents.

Instead of lingering on screen like a good scene of 3-D does, it goes by so fast that you don't have the chance to enjoy. Unlike the first 2 Spy Kids movies, this film by Robert Rodriguez does not have the same writing quality that made ""Spy Kids"" a hit. If your a child just as outcasted as Max (the main character)this movie does not teach you how to deal with your problems. It just makes up a solution that a troubled child cannot use in their lives.

179,julianeumann-57872,THIS WAS MY AND MANY OTHERS' CHILDHOOD,8,5 June 2019,Hello everyone. I'm sure everyone doesn't care about this movie anymore. Since I'm writing this review in 2019. I just have to say my thoughts about it though. I am 17 now. And saw this movie in 2007 when I was 5 two years after the movie came out. And I need to share an experience my friends and I had recently. We were all at a trivia for our school when suddenly we saw a question that reminded us of this movie. We had all seen it since it was a childhood film of ours and we absolutely loved it. So after that trivia night. We went straight to my house. Found it on on demand. And watched the whole thing. Sure. The movie has poor CGI and it has fart jokes. But half the fun of watching the movie is making fun of it as you watch. It's a children's movie. Made in 2005. What do you expect? But it doesn't matter. Cause I can almost guarantee that your children will be inspired by the creativity of this movie. And will want to dress up as the characters for Halloween. This movie is amazing because it brings kids together. And really stirs up their creative side. And if a group of 15-17 year olds can laugh and have a good time watching this movie. Your kids definitely will. Thank you for reading.,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

The Adults judging it have forgotten to dream.The point of this is dream. What a wonderful notion. It speaks about how a young boy (ease connection between father and son also) is told by others to give up dreaming.I won't go into what happens but I will say the effect has a ripple effect. The reason I love this is because by watching this, we all start to remember where we stopped dreaming. Maybe it was peer pressure, maybe by those we love. But the effect was the same. Growing up doesn't mean fantasy life and dreaming. This is perfect a movie for writers, perfect for people looking to relive a simpler day when all was possible.This is also perfect for those who have forgot. A open heart makes a huge difference. I plan to buy this, not because of what it has in it, not for how it is set out. But because maybe by watching this, owning this.

198,deamatre,"Captures childhood adventures in ""Pretendingland""",9,27 March 2006,"This movie makes no sense- at least, not in the linear, neat, tidy, world of adulthood. But, it captures the messy, gritty, disjointed, weird, raw, non-linear, funky, wild, whimsical, internally inconsistent world of true childhood fantasy better than any film I can remember. The story is based off the ""dreams"" and stories of the director's then 7 year old son. As a mother and teacher, I can tell you that while the characters and situations are unique, they are also completely representative of the types of stories and imagination games that I have heard again and again.My own children have certainly created their own superheroes steeped in the same balance of derivative lore and imaginative elements that Sharkboy and Lavagirl possess. When faced with similar fantasies played out on screen, my children responded gleefully. Heck, even before we got the DVD home their imaginations had been so captured by what they read on the box that they could not stop discussing it. And, once they had viewed the film, the conversation continued (and continued and continued!). Almost immediately, characters from the film began showing up in my children's own pretending games- only, not *quite* as they had existed in the movie. The characters grew and evolved and were changed and fluffed until they fit seamlessly into my daughter's world of ""Sigalates"" and my son's ""Robotland"".In other words, the film did beautifully what all good fantasies do- it inspired others to create, examine and expand their own. In my opinion, that is a near complete success.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

Shortly thereafter they meet the evil Mr. Electric, an evil George Lopez robot who's puns (such as ""I'm gonna hit you were it hertz"") are ironically the only parts of the movie that didn't have me laughing, especially since he feels it necessary to take an extra minute to explain them. And just to add to the evil of Lopez's character, he constantly attacks the three daring adventurers with his army of electrical cords. Yeah, it's as bad as it sounds.However, this movie did make me laugh harder then anything I've seen since Anchorman. Don't believe me? Watch this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDHye4Vmho. And that's probably Taylor Lautner's best scene.So, in short, Robert Rodriguez needs to retire and become a plumber, what with this and Spy Kids he's gotta be getting used to crap, and George Lopez needs to fire his agent. At least Taylor Lautner solved all his problems my running around without a shirt on for a couple of hours.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

I enjoyed parts of it, but the plot needed tightening and the Planet Drool truly needed more light. As for the acting: only Linus/Minus really did any that was worth watching; I feel that the actor who played Max was badly miscast, earning more pity than empathy. As for the two Taylors: Shark Boy came across as sulky rather than macho, and Lava Girl reminded me of a badly shot commercial for some kind of off-brand doll. The parents were useless and their scenes bogged down what action there was; George Lopez had some good moments, struggling to emerge from those that were merely tiresome. It is a pity that this film was so poorly realised, because the story itself was fascinating and, in the right hands, would have been amazing.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

He has a wild imagination and enjoyed seeing a movie about a boy with a similar imagination. Taylor Dooley is adorable, and Taylor Lautner has some great moves in the movie. I asked my son for a quote about the movie: ""It is exciting, adventurous, and the 3-d effects could have been a little better, but if it wasn't 3-d it wouldn't be good at all"".

(If you scroll down the reviews until you find his, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about)But basically ""repoed2"" says that the boy that plays shark-boy is an ugly, little moronic kid. He also says a friend of his knows the boy that plays shark-boy in real life (because they went to the same school). And finally, he finishes with the fact that he's not very popular and gets made fun of a lot. Well ""repoed2"" I really hope one day that you come back to this page and see this because as it turns out that boy that played sharkboy is Taylor Lautner who's now one of the most famous, attractive, talented, and successful young Hollywood actors!

203,gilbert_gumphrey,Most perplexing viewing experience of my life.,5,18 April 2006,"I can't remember the last time a movie confused and tormented my filmgoing soul as much as this movie did. Everything inside of me, everything in me that loves Shawshank Redemption and Vertigo and Raging Bull and all these great great great classic movies tells me that Sharkboy and Lavagirl was awful. And it was. Drastically awful. And I enjoyed almost every minute of it. Let me try and explain it this way - I have written ongoing lists of the greatest films ever made, and the worst films ever made, and Sharkboy and Lavagirl is the only movie I've ever seen that has gotten a placement in both lists for me.Sharkboy is about a young child named Max who dreams up wonderful fantasies and adolescent superhero type adventures. Eventually he travels into this dream world aided by the aforementioned Sharkboy and Lavagirl as they fight to keep the dream world a happy go lucky place from the evil Mr. Electric. So there's the story. Simple, childish, and a bit reminiscent of Neverending Story. I knew this plot before my 6 year old cousin made me watch the film and I sighed. What a waste of two hours this would be. Then something strange happened. I got a chill. Then Lavagirl and Sharkboy appeared and took Max into their spaceship, and I got more chills. Throughout the course of the movie, especially in the end, I was enthralled and received more goosebumps than when I watched Braveheart, much to the embarrassment of my dumbfounded girlfriend.I have no idea how to explain my reaction to the film. I was pleasantly surprised, obviously, and I had a lot of fun watching the movie (I'm excluding the terrible 3-D version of the film, which is a pointless distract-or and takes away a lot of the magic). Then why am I only giving this movie 5 stars out of 10 (a middling mark to avoid giving it a 10 or a 1)? For the same reason why the movie is both on my list of most hated and most loved - it's a bad movie. To say it's a guilty pleasure to me would be underestimating guilt and pleasure. The script is silly, the special effects are slapdash, the editing is at times incoherent, the acting is atrocious, and there are moments where even my 6 year old cousin grimaced at the lame dialogue. But damned if this movie isn't a lot of fun.So I can't really recommend the movie to anyone over the age of 10. I still can't believe that I, a 17 year old classic film lover, enjoyed this movie as much as I did. But I can definitely tell that it's a movie younger kids, especially boys (for I'm pretty sure every boy this age has dreams and fantasies just like the ones in the film) will love. I harkin this bizarre feeling I have for Sharkboy to when you find an old cartoon you used to love as a young child and watch it again. Even though you're reciting the lines and the songs like you did when you were young, you know deep down that if it wasn't a childhood favourite and gave you so much nostalgia, you'd hate it just as much as everyone else. This is what this movie was like for me. It was the childhood flick I never got to see. Maybe that warrants a recommendation. Maybe still not. I really don't know - you'll have to see it for yourself and find out.Or maybe not.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
204,deardra_2,The kids will like it!,6,10 June 2005,"We just got home from viewing this movie and it was pretty good. You have to go into this movie knowing it is made for the younger kids and the subjects dealt with are very important to these children. The awkward age of wanting to still believe in your dreams and accepting reality is a hard time for children. Throw in some bullying, parents having issues and lacking self-confidence and you pretty much have what is happening to today's pre-teens. Learning to believe in yourself and stand up for what you believe in is such an important lesson. The messages are delivered in a fun way that the children will easily take in and gives the parents an understanding of just how much stress a child is feeling. Adults may be a little bored with it (although I found it cute), but a movie theater full of children having the time of their lives should tell you something.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
205,beauti_queen_,Very very bad,1,27 September 2005,"I went to this movie and it had everything in it that could possibly make a movie bad. It was horribly cheesy and any attempts at 'touching moments' just made me cringe. The children's acting was pretty bad- but the dialogue wouldn't have helped, the only relitavely good child actor was Max, who worked well with some pretty shocking lines. The movie was incontinuous, jumping around with no real point to a lot of stuff that was happening, and the 3D effects were pretty disappointing- the glasses gave a 3D headache. Although this movie was not made for my age group, i can still see it not appealing to younger kids, even little kids will not fall for the cheesy lines. definitely the worst movie i've seen, and a waste of 2 hours of my time.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

As a 13- year-old, of course I didn't watch it in my desire (I'm not dumb to watch these stuff) but my bro made me watch it. Let me just tell you that from first sight I told him it was dumb, and I was true. Please, don't watch this for your own sake and credibility. Come on, trust me, there's nothing funny about that. That gave me a heart attack. What makes it worse is that the storyline is written by a 7-year-old. To summarize, this movie is, well, an utter waste of time. Beware. Stay safe.

I understand that kids should be taught that they should follow your dreams, but showing them that if they dream fictional dreams ""hard enough"" they become real. When I was little I too had dreams that in reality were abstract but I was also told that those dreams are only dreams. Also, dreams are meant to be selfish. It is your own dream so if you are the queen or the king that is fine. Yes, you should think of others but not in your dreams. It was kind of odd that everything became better when Max didn't dream for himself anymore. Also, puns just aren't funny. Mr. Electric was far to corny even for a kids movie. He made me want to gouge my eyes out with my shark fin glasses. So what I don't understand is what Max actually learned. At first he was told not to dream. But then everyone was excited about his dreams. It didn't make any sense. In summation, WTF.

The part that bugged me most was not the terrible plot (holier than a Mafia target), the ""kids are oppressed"" vibe, or even the dialog (no adjectives can describe it). What I hated beyond all else was the way they cleaned it up to the extreme. For instance, in a crisis, a man says to his wife, not ""I love you,"" but ""You're my best friend."" That should give you an idea of what we're dealing with here. Every 5-year -old has seen love in every other movie they've ever seen.And plus, ""from the director of SPY KIDS?""

Not all internet sites will ship to us. So we rent it, which we are fortunate enough that a local store has at least two copies. That said, we have rented it so many times that we recognize the individual disks that we get from the store.To say that this movie is my kids favorite movie of all time would be a great understatement. The kids will play ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl"" on their own in the backyard or at the park or wherever they happen to be at the time. They fight over who gets to be Sharkboy and who gets to be Lavagirl and who is Max and who is the Ice Princess.

216,hula_girl_48,"Overall rather cheesy, but a good kid's movie",4,25 June 2005,"Coming from a thirteen-year-old's point of view, I'd say it was pretty cheesy. Especially the part where Max's parents are about to be sucked into a tornado and Dad says, ""You're my best friend!"" Now what kind of husband would say that to his wife? That's something a little kid would say to his stuffed tiger.Sharkboy and Lavagirl's acting were good, except for the ""dream dream dream"" song sang by Sharkboy and Lavagirl's constant smiling (wouldn't her cheeks eventually get so tired she HAD to frown)? She is very pretty though, I will admit and both did a good job of acting.One problem with the movie was that it seemed half finished. Where did Lavagirl come from? Why did she suddenly show up at Max's bedroom door, asking for Sharkboy to come with her? Why did Mr. Electric all of a sudden turn evil? And if Lavagirl burns everything she touches, how come she didn't burn Sharkboy (in one scene Sharkboy was attemtping to knock out Max and Lavagirl was holding him back, he didn't even flinch???) It seemed like it was a thrown-together kind of movie and needed more editing to it.I suppose it's a good kid's movie if you look at it from a seven-year-old's perspective. The action was high which would keep a kid's interest. If you're any older than 10 I suggest seeing another movie, mostly because of the headache 3D and the cheesiness.

It is an absolute blast to watch it with your 5 to 10 year old, in the very front row. The critics have panned this film, but Rodriguez didn't make it for them either. He made this movie for KIDS, and he knows what KIDS like, period.Parts of the film felt as though they were heavily influenced from the original ""Neverending Story"" -not in plot, more like a sub-textual feeling. I went to see this film with my 7 year old daughter, and completely immersed myself in the experience. It was an absolute blast. I had no idea who was starring in the film. Cayden Boyd (Dodgeball, Freaky Friday) did an excellent job as Max, and was backed up well by Taylor Dooley as Lava Girl and Taylor Lautner as Shark Boy. (Lautner was absolutely amazing in some of his action scenes -that kid can FIGHT!!!)As with Spy Kids 3-D, the audience is told when to put on and take off the 3-D glasses, although it felt like there was more 3-D time in this film. And also as with Spy Kids 3-D, some of the adult actors surprised me with their appearances. (In my humble opinion, anybody who gets a chance to work with Robert Rodriguez on anything is a lucky person indeed). David Arquette (Eight Legged Freaks, 3000 Miles to Graceland), Kristen Davis (Sex in the City), & George Lopez (George Lopez man!), and Rodriguez's kids (cameo appearances) all show up as well.

Taylor Dooley as Lava Girl and Taylor Lautner as Shark Boy will definitely be the next big thing in Hollywood. Two thumbs up for any kid to go see this movie.No matter what the critics say... As a mother I thought it was a great movie... I think there should be more action adventures for young kids to get into.... I would definitely go see any movie Robert Rodriguez does, whether its his sons ideas or his. He obviously can take any idea and run with it.

So I decided to do a little research on the movie and check out the reviews of the movie critics. When I read them I found that they thought it wasn't as good as the other films this director has done. I have to admit, I have never seen any other Robert Rodriguez films so I wasn't sure what to expect. With this thought in mind I went to the movie and looked for the actions that annoyed the critics so much. With this said I think that if you go into the movie with high expectations (like favorite movie potential) you might be disappointed but if you go in with low expectations then you actually might like the movie more than you thought you would.

Max is a young kid whose parents are fighting, and he escapes into a fantasy world of superheros, robots, alien planets, and milk and cookies. Max is bullied in school by all the other kids, and even by his teacher, who likes Max, but believes he should leave his dreams behind.The Sharkboy and Lavagirl sequences play on Max's need for dreams, and his struggle to avoid losing those dreams as his mother, his teacher, and the other students try to force him to abandon his fantasy world. These sequences, on the planet of Drool, are childlike and goofy, but are meant to be. Rodriquez has stepped into the mind of a child to create a world to delight children. This world has all the scientific plausibility and complexity of an eight year old's fantasy. It is not a film that speaks to adults on an adult level while entertaining children--like, say a Pixar film. This is for kids.It's not Barney, though, for better and worse. Sharkboy is an annoying character at times, with displays of belligerence that might upset some parents. Lavagirl begins the film with no story or special purpose--unlike Sharkboy--but she pesters Max throughout the film to give her more meaning. To me, this was a deliberate commentary on the way women are portrayed in films--as one dimensional props. In this case, the character fights back, demanding an extra dimension.The ending is weaker than the rest of the film. No spoiler coming. It wasn't bad enough to ruin the film, but a better ending could have added something to it.Overall, my kid loved the film. She sat on the edge of her seat, bouncing with anticipation when the movie became exciting. There was nothing to scare her, but she was kept in suspense. I was reminded of one critic, who said he wasn't impressed, but his young son said it was the best movie ever made. I was a little more impressed than that with the storyline of holding onto your dreams while still growing up.Rodriquez's skill seems to be in creating wonderfully visual sets, not in story telling. He has a vision here, and that vision seems to be to create a world a kid would create (obviously his son helped create it). He succeeds at that, and there are points when even the story reveals a bit of vision by the director. It's enough for the audience the movie is aimed at. It is a long way from the worst movie ever made, but it is not a movie many adults would really want to see on their own.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

230,krankin-1,Cruel and Unusual Punishment,1,20 June 2005,"I promised my 6yr old son he could see this movie as soon as it came out. So, my husband and I drug along our 12 yr old son and trudged to the theater. After the first 5 minutes I knew we in trouble! My husband got a migraine from the poorly done 3-D effects and I ended up with double vision that lasted 30 minutes after the movie. My 12 yr old fell asleep about 15 minutes into the movie, which probably was a blessing for him. That had to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Not just the worst kids movie, the worst movie. When you go to see a film made for children you expect a bit of cheesiness, but this was way over the cheese quota. The acting was horrific, the storyline was lame and the special effects were, well, not so special. Yes, I know his son wrote part of it. My 6 yr old wants to be a director and writes his own ""movie scripts"" from time to time and directs his friends. Some are good, some not so good. Everything your child writes doesn't necessarily need to be produced! Save your money, your vision and your sanity, wait for video and left your child watch it alone........",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
231,fernando_piquero,Same idea as Neverending Story with elements of Wizard of OZ,8,7 September 2005,"OK, maybe this is not one of the best movies of Robert Rodriguez but even so is a good kid movie. I think the 3D animation didn't work very well at moments because it shows colors a little distorted. However I consider the script OK. It reminded me of ""Wizard of Oz"" mixed with ""Neverending story"". I enjoyed this movie a lot. I hope there will be a 2D extended release for DVD market. I'm sure this will work much better. Your kids will going to have a lot of fun and time will convert this movie into a cult movie. Maybe most of the negative critics about this movie come from the fact that it was released the same year as ""Sin City"" which is definitely the Robert Rodriguez masterpiece so far.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

GOOD JOB TAYLOR LAUTNER!",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
233,runningice_4eva,Sparking your Imagination: Sharkboy and Lavagirl,5,27 August 2005,"Well, after seeing this film with my younger sister, the only really word that strikes my mind is ""original"". This movie, although very interesting and original in its own way, reminded me a lot of ""The Never Ending Story"".I'm not going to go to ""slay"" this movie, fair to say that I didn't enjoy it as much as other Rodrigeuz films. But the reason for that is plain and simple...it-is-a-kids-film. The film's story was thought up by Rodrigeuz's seven year old son, Racer. And in those terms the story is very fitting for children of around that age group. My 10 year old sister loved it! And I'm sure many people here would agree that it was a ""poor"" film, or a ""bland"" film or a ""Rodrigeuz's weakest"" film. But simply, the vast majority of every member on this website is above the age required to enjoy this film! It sparked my sisters imagination, and my cousins. So, from a 16 year olds point of view, I'd give this a 5/10. From a child's point of view, I'll give it a 9/10. I'd seriously recommend this film to children below the age of 13, for it was intended for that age range. However, the 3D ""gimmick"" doesn't really live up to expectation, and it makes the colours of the film very two-tonal (red and green) and I think that the film would be much better if it was just simple 2D. The film is very cheesy, but it's message is received loud and clear and adds a certain ""feel good"" factor to the movie. To adults that factor may be ""thank god its over"", to children, it'll be so much more awe inspiring and imaginative! Your kids will most likely start keeping dream journals and invent characters of a similar calibre to Lavagirl and Sharkboy! A film that re-defines imagination as being something that should be open, outspoken and above all cherished. Something that is becoming increasingly rare with children, due to the steady rise of ""video games"", ""TV shows"" and ""Films"",",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

235,danielorenstein,I hated it - the kids loved it.,3,8 August 2005,"I hated it.My two kids (5 and 7) thought it was the best movie of all time. And they've seen lots of movies. Let's face it: we can't always dictate what the kids should like. This one simply appeals to them, and from a parents perspective, its basically harmless (except to the older crowd - then it is painfully boring).I would recommend bringing a book.Or a pillow and a sweater.Or, at least some thoughts that you wanted to concentrate on for a while.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

She talks to lava girl on the phone on a daily basis. She keeps telling me I need to take her to see it again because it will be way too long until it comes out on DVD. It is the first movie I took her to that she actually stayed in her seat. No bathroom breaks, no switching seats, etc., that is one for the record books for my daughter. I would recommend taking your kids to see it. I actually did not mind sitting through this one either. It is very imaginative and promotes using your imagination.

239,mjblink,not a good movie by any means,1,20 September 2008,"this movie was conceived by a child and after less than 5 minutes of watching it, you can tell. i'm sure its target demographic of 6-10 year olds will love it because it has bright colors and kids as the lead actors, but that in no way makes it a good movie. by the way, the son of the director (whose idea the movie was) was 8 at the time the movie was released. movies like the shrek trilogy are also targeted to younger audiences but are very enjoyable for adults too because they have good writing, a good plot, and a great cast. this movie has none of those things. it does have a decent director, but that doesn't help a movie that is lacking in every other major film category.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D
240,savannahthorne,Excellent children's film,9,25 August 2005,"I thought this was an excellent children's film, hearkening back to the days of The Phantom Tollbooth, The Pagemaster, Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal, and Neverending Story. It combines entertaining action with real moral lessons (that are not preachy or political): you can only make your dreams a reality if you work hard to make them true; those who have had their dreams smashed will seek to smash others' dreams; you cannot escape fear because it exists in your mind; do not dream selfish dreams when the world needs you to make it a better place; and unfinished, unrealized dreams will die inside your mind. Certainly, the characters were somewhat flat, but name a children's film in which they are not. At least this film is smart and fun. It mostly takes place literally in the main character's dream world, a dark 3-D universe where things are changing and he must strive to set things right. The combination of self-sacrifice, maturity, and valiance saves the day and even characters in the real world learn important lessons.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

It's a really different approach to cinema that Sin City. I can't see this kind of film...I hope Robert answer me with the continuation of spy kid series and the second part of Lava and Shark...It's not only a film for boys in my opinion. Thank you and Good bye to everybody who read this words... I hope you likes this films like I really do...And also that you like this kind of films who are similar to game boy toys.

243,redsoxfreak01,Good but bad 3D,8,1 October 2005,"This was a pretty good movie, but the 3D graphics weren't the greatest. I suggest that you watch the normal disc instead of the 3D one. The 3D just makes it blurry, even with the glasses on. The movie is a little confusing, but worth watching. It has good humor and a decent plot line. It is pretty appropriate, but Mr. Electric (a bad guy) may be frightening to younger viewers, and Sharkboy's 'Shark Frenzy's may be frightening as well, as his teeth grow pointed at he appears to lose control of himself. Sharkboy also calls Max ""little bleep"". The movie's overall message is good as it tells children to dream, but it also makes it seem like all of your dreams will come which may disappoint some kids. For a full review on plot content go to pluggedinonline.com and search for The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3D. I would recommend watching this movie because overall it is entertaining, but mostly for children. The adult I watched it with found it boring and uninteresting, but the children I watched it with really enjoyed it. It has memorable lines and a memorable plot, and is quite original, not the same plot that has been used over and over again. I would say watch this movie, especially if you have kids. NOTE: This movie is based on a true person's dreams, so that is a good lesson for children as well.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

This movie would be good if it was used for interrogation. If forced to watch it, anyone would do anything or say anything just to be spared. I think the acting was horrible by all who was in the movie. I would like to say something more positive about this movie but I can't seem to think of anything. As with most kids my daughter will watch it many times over, she doesn't ask me to watch it with her anymore.

246,dazeaddy-misc,Surprisingly fun!,8,4 January 2006,"Now honestly, when you see the words, ""SHARKboy and LAVAgirl"" what kind of movie do you think it's going to be? Add to that, boy with fins and girl with purple hair and... well, what kind of movie are you expecting? I think that hating or loving a movie hinges on the level of your expectations. And frankly, I wasn't disappointed. I was expecting a mass of convoluted ideas and melodrama (which this director has been known to indulge in), and instead found a coherent, creative, unabashedly imaginative kid's classic. Of course, there was still a touch of the corny side (especially with the 'believe in yourself' and boy-loves-girl overtones) but generally, more subtle than I've seen in a kid's movie for years.Overall, the best aspect of this movie was the casting. As a patient older sister of a seven-year-old I've become rather disenchanted with pre-teen/teen actors (refer to 'Catch that Spy' and 'Spy Kids' throughout). While most of the dialogue in this movie was tuned for kiddie audiences, some of it was rather too grandiose for a thirteen-year-old. And if it depended on dialogue alone, this film would've simply melted into that realm of my consciousness reserved for Australian Tax Laws. But, surprising me once again, the kids they picked to play the part of exaggerated super-heroes/villains actually pulled it off. They were perfectly credible and, to my great relief, didn't take themselves too seriously. Really quite refreshing.The story itself was upbeat and, well... original. And I have to say, I quite enjoyed discovering whom Max had based his Lavagirl and Sharkboy.Perhaps not your cup of tea. But then maybe you just need to take out your dusty old banana-split boat and enjoy the ride.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

248,alan-b-bernier,Which books and videos are on Racer Max's shelf?,8,1 February 2006,"I took my boys to see this movie, they are aged 12, 9 and 7 and they enjoyed it almost as much as the Spy Kids series. The ideas for the movie are supposed to derive from the dreams of Racer Max, who is of course Richard Rodriguez's son. But as I watched the movie I could not stop thinking that I had read and seen very similar ideas before. It dawned on me that the basic premise of the movie is taken straight out of the Neverending Story by Michael Ende. If you are not familiar with it go get the book and then rent the video, it was a bestseller a few years ago and it is considered a fantasy classic. I wonder if little Racer Max has the video or the book at his home, or maybe his father read it to him at bedtime? You can hardly blame a young kid for blending ideas taken from material he has been exposed to with what he thinks are his original dreams, but to have it actually become a multimillion dollar Hollywood production in 3D no less without anyone checking for similarities is incredible. Still, the movie is entertaining enough for the young crowd. My wife did not go to the theater to see the movie last year, but she just saw a few minutes of it of the DVD version we just purchased. Guess what film she was reminded of? Yes, The Neverending Story, and no I had not said anything to her about the film. I wonder why critics have not noticed the many parallels that exist between these stories.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

But whoever who watched this movie over 12 years old understands that this movie is a pile of dirt with horrible acting and a dumb plot. This movie is about a boy who believes in imaginary characters from his dreams and they rescue him from his classroom to help him save their planet. The plot is predictable, often boring and the acting is disgusting. The writer didn't spend enough time to develop the characters and they were often one-dimensional. What I don't understand is how Max's teacher seems like a nice guy in the beginning of the story but later he is the bad guy in the story who is trying to destroy their planet.",The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D

All you need to do is see this movie with a child or let yourself remember your own sense of wonder and this movie will jump off the screen whether you've got 3-D glasses or not! The fact that Rodriguez lets the children have real worries and problems and a trial-and-error approach to dealing with them while learning a universal theme has all the traits that make children's stories timeless.
