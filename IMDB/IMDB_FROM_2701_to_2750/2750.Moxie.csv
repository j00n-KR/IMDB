0,Calicodreamin,Modern Moxie,6,5 March 2021,"A very modern film depicting the teenage perspective on feminism and equality. As an elder millennial, I got a solid vibe from this film. It touched on all the hot topics in a message heavy but easily understood way. Acting was okay. Plot was a bit lost, but that wasn't meant to be the focus.",Moxie
1,siderite,"Nicely acted, a bit too heavy handed, but a nice feel good teen feminist film",8,3 March 2021,"So this film is about feminism. If you remove that from the story, almost nothing is left. But that doesn't make it a bad movie. I liked the girls, they were so beautiful and vibrant, and the idea that some people are being ignored and stepped on systematically should feel disgusting to all, so it was a story worth telling. The acting was very good for young people and the direction was good, too.Yet it's not a perfect film. There was a moment when a girl admits to tripping one guy who broke his hand and not apologizing about it because that's feminism. No, it's not! And while the girls were from all kinds of races and had their own well shaped characters, the guys were just black and white: the nice sensitive down with feminism guys and the total complete asshole athletic rapists or complete morons. Other than about 4 guys, the others just don't have any lines, it's solely about the girls and their viewpoint. The message here is ""shout out! express yourself however you want! nothing can stop you!"" when reality is that, yes, it can stop you quite hard. So for that reason alone, I call it a feel good movie, because it was like an extreme caricature of life.Bottom line: yes, it's an Amy Poehler vehicle to push her agenda, but it is also a feel good movie about girls finding their voices. I also felt that Lala stole the film, because she came off as much more centered and powerful (not to mention beautiful) than the lead actress. Also, the poster for the film almost made me skip it. You have to get past it.",Moxie
2,Cineanalyst,Teachable Moments,5,5 March 2021,"I generally dislike such message movies, or social-problem pictures, regardless of the merits of the message because they're blunt and didactic--inherently patronizing and at worst propaganda. All the more so when couched in the dramatics of young adult fiction. But, I can appreciate the mechanics of it. ""Moxie"" is especially direct and reflexive in its lecture, and that's worth at least begrudging respect. After all, it's a lecture that takes place in classrooms. Teachable moments involving teachers and students. It's adapted from a book about a writer of the titular bathroom magazine. It's directed by the same woman who plays the mother who inspired the movement. It contains lectures and speeches within the movie that itself is a feature-length lecture and speech.In the spirit of Women's History Month and since I've been reviewing a bunch of silent films lately, this construction reminds me of one of the first filmmakers to make such modern cinematic morality tales, Lois Weber. Her films may be infuriatingly preachy, but the best of them are also exceptionally artful. They, too, included lectures-within-lectures and featured academic, priestly and lawyerly characters in classroom, church and courtroom settings that would allow for the most direct address of the morals or social messages at hand. She could also be subtle in her films' artistry, though.That's where ""Moxie"" fails. There's no doubting its message, but the art is lacking. A movie partially about the revolutionary potential of music that suffers from obnoxious underscoring of dramatic moments. Trite arguments so that the main character will need to reunite with her mother, boyfriend and friends in the end. A single, paper-thin villain. A boyfriend who is nauseatingly perfect to the point that I'm glad his idea of a first date was to break into a funeral parlor, as at least he did one wrong thing. The new girl who inspires the protagonist to soon thereafter be lost from the main plot. On the other hand, the feminist organizing of the Moxie group is admittedly sometimes fun, and the social media and texting aspect is handled relatively well in a narrative where print media manages to reign supreme. That's probably a sign that an adult wrote this for youngsters if ever there was one. We also see more videos on TV than we do on phones, but I appreciate it, at least. Plus, I've read ""The Great Gatsby,"" and it is overrated.",Moxie

4,cruise01,Movement for the ages,7,10 March 2021,3.5 out of 5 stars.Moxie is a pretty fair drama film about a coming of age story with a young teen who notices her high school is sexist when there rules about what girls can wear or they are ignored about there responses or opinions while guys get listened too.The plot is pretty fair as a teen creates a movement and have every followers doing acts like having stars on there hand for the movement. Or every girl wearing tank tops at school. Or nominating a girl who is captain in her soccer team while she is easily forgotten cause the principal and every guy is focused on trying to get there captain of the team nominated.The cast ensemble is a variety of young talented actors who did great with there roles.It is a strong drama film about a message. I did think the movie did run a little too long. Could have been trimmed down. But has great performances. Plot. And a message for todays issue with equality and feminism.,Moxie
5,matthewssilverhammer,Predictable and Glib,4,3 April 2021,"Sadly, Poehler is perfect proof that just because someone has impeccable comic timing & style in front of the camera, that doesn't mean they can control it from behind the camera. This awkwardly directed & extremely predictable empowerment ""comedy"" will be meaningful to certain people, I have no doubt...especially young women. Unfortunately, the film's inability to choose a strong position about its protagonists (brave & important, or immature & silly?) makes it feel irresponsibly glib.",Moxie

7,alindsay-al,An Above Average film about feminism,6,8 March 2021,"With the world still being stuck in this pandemic, it means we don't have that many new movies coming out but Moxie came out last week and today I sat down and watched it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a teenager inspired by her mother decided to take a stand against the sexist and toxic ways at her high school.Main Character
Hadley Robinson plays the main character and she does a decent job here. She is a young and pretty inexperienced actress but she does well with the material that she is given, you care about the struggles she is going through for some of the film and the elements of the film that the film does well she does to. The issue is I just thought her character took a complete turn late on in the 2nd act and she actually became annoying, yeah by the end she basically gets you on side again but I can't help and think about the parts of the film where she is unlikeable.Supporting Characters
The collective group of friends she have are all pretty good here too. I mean they are all pretty stereotypical characters but I thought the performers all did decent jobs and hopefully could have long careers ahead. Amy Poehler plays Robinson's mum in the film and she is also good, they have a nice chemistry together and you see the influence she has on her as a mother and the actions she takes forward. Ike Bariholtz is usually an actor I am not fond of but I thought he filled his role as the English teacher well and for a film that isn't that funny I thought he was probably the funniest part of the film. I mean this film has a small role from Clark Gregg which is great to see, even if the film does waste him for sure.Story
The story looks at certain ideals in feminism and equality which obviously these are subjects that should be mentioned and talked about in film and this film does it okay with one really powerful moment happening towards the end of the film. But you can't help but notice that this is one of the most stereotypical and generic stories ever told, if you have seen a high school drama you know exactly what is going to happen here and it becomes very predictable in its execution.Script
The script is okay, there are some decent dramatic moments here, especially the one that takes place at the end of the film. But there is plenty of high school drama, and teen angst that is dull and uninspired as is in the majority of these types of films. Plus there is a romance here that feels unnecessary and kind of even goes against some of the messages put in place here.Style
The film has a pretty exaggerated style to it, I mean this story has some pretty mad conveniences to it but they are so overblown that it works. I dunno, it is just the film doesn't maybe go hard enough with what it is trying to tell and I could have done with more scenes with Poehler and Robinson to really sell that bond and connection.Overall
Overall, this is an above average film. It does what it wants to quite well but there is plenty around it that falters and that stops it from getting a full recommendation. For me it isn't probably worth a watch, but if you do watch it you won't think you wasted 2 hours of your life at least.",Moxie
8,kwenchow,"Another worst film! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Not recommended!",1,25 March 2021,"This film start with a girl ""Vivian"" waking up from her dream, and she browsing with her laptop scene! As turnout, this film is about Vivian start up a feminist club ""Moxie"", after she inspire by her friend ""Lucy""! Entire film full of boring conversation, and super annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the listening song scene, overuse of the dancing scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the kissing scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the watching TV scene, overuse of the texting scene, overuse of the browsing with laptop scene, overuse of the brushing teeth scene, overuse of the playing dumb scene, overuse of the speech scene, overuse of the copying flyer scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the searching things scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the staring at phone scene!

9,yusufpiskin,Really?,3,16 March 2021,"Pretty much every single secondary character was better than the main girl...
i love feminist cinema but honestly lucy would have been the better choice for a main protagonist!!! i loved how diverse it was but some of it felt really performative and we have seen this from a white persons perspective so many times that i just wish the other characters were focused on a bit more",Moxie
10,r96sk,Undoubtedly has its heart in the right place,5,4 March 2021,"It undoubtedly has its heart in the right place, but 'Moxie' is heavy-footed and cringeworthy in most areas.I don't think anyone can disagree with what the film is attempting to shed light on, it gets kudos for what it is trying to say. However, judging it for what it is - a film - it's not good. The dialogue and the way characters act is cringey and done in a way that is so forced. It tells us what we already know, then that's it.None of the characters stood out to me. Of course Vivian (Hadley Robinson) and Lucy (Alycia Pascual-Peña) are the two main stars of the story. The former irritates more than anything, while the latter is poorly written - e.g. for the first 15 minutes or so she's pretty unlikeable, before belatedly and out of nowhere becoming pleasant; in and around Vivian & Co. I mean, not Mitchell (Patrick Schwarzenegger) obviously.A shorter run time as well as a bit more depth and creativity with the characters/plot would've went a long way. It's nothing absolutely terrible, granted. Lastly, cool to see 'The Walking Dead' alum Sydney Park (Kiera) involved.",Moxie
11,jfgibson73,More like this,7,29 April 2021,"I like this movie. It had a very likeable cast. I was totally rooting for the girls to achieve their goals. I thought it had an emotional ending as well, and I'd be happy to see more teen movies done this well. It's got a great sense of humor and well written characters. I'm not sure if the mother-daughter relationship was totally realistic, but it was nice to watch.",Moxie
12,rannynm,"Wonderful Comedy, Drama and Terrific Message In This Coming-of-Age Film",10,4 March 2021,"I love the coming-of-age movie, Moxie! It has comedy, drama and a terrific message, while handling very serious topics. The cast is perfect, and the music gives the film a lot of energy.Moxie is based on the novel by the same name by Jennifer Mathieu and follows a 16-year-old girl named Vivian (Hadley Robinson) who prefers to be under the radar. This all changes when Lucy (Alycia Pascual-Peña) comes to her high school. After witnessing Lucy ""holding her head high"" during an encounter with another student, Vivian notices all of the horrible ways that girls are being treated at her school and decides to publish an anonymous zine that sparks a fire in all of the other fed-up girls at her school.Amy Poehler directs the movie and plays Vivian's mom. She also happens to be my favorite character, because she is very clever, inspiring and is not a ""traditional mom."" The rest of the cast plays their characters so well. We see Vivian's journey from follower to leader. Lucy is such a bold and confident woman, standing up for what is right. Seth (Nico Hiragra) comes across as a really cool love interest of Vivian's and male ally to the female revolution. Patrick Schwarzenegger's portrayal of Mitchell Wilson is terrific, as I just hated him in the movie. The supporting characters are very diverse as we see people of all shapes, sizes and races, including a girl in a wheelchair, which I rarely see in movies, plus an all-girl band.The key messages in this film are: to be the change you want to see, and friendship can support that change. You should know that the film has some mild profanity, shows underage drinking and handles some mature subjects.I give Moxie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults.

15,Sir_AmirSyarif,Amy Poehler's 'Mean Girls' for the #MeToo generation,6,6 March 2021,"Amy Poehler's second directorial outing, 'Moxie,' undoubtedly has its heart in the right place. The film addresses issues about female empowerment, toxic masculinity, sexism, harassment, and rape. The only problem is it's all delivered with no subtlety or nuance in the way the film explains its ideology. Too heavy-handed to win hearts and minds. 'Moxie' also suffers from half-baked writing of its characters. Aside from its painfully bland main character, the other characters have little to no characterization or development throughout the entire film. Still, it's difficult to dislike 'Moxie' as it has its charms and enganging approach to a substantive topic.",Moxie
16,sweidman-28016,Good Message But Too Much Like an Average Teen Movie,6,22 March 2021,"""Those girls got moxie. In fact, this entire school's got moxie, am I right?""Directed by Amy Poehler, Moxie follows the high school journey of a girl inspired by her mom's rebellious past and a confident new friend. She then publishes an anonymous zine calling out sexism at her school. Foremost, this movie is a fun watch. It's one of those high school movies there to give you an entertaining time. There are plenty of moments to put a smile on your face. Most of the time, the jokes land. And with moments of proving a point make you internally (or verbally) cheer. Amy Poehler has always been good at bringing audiences joy and she delivered on that aspect. The acting, for the most part, is fine considering these are younger people. I'm a personal fan of Alycia Pascual-Pena's performance and character in general.Where Moxie vaulters comes down to the script. By no means is it bad, it just falls into the classic teen movie tropes which makes the effect not as strong as it could be. With tackling the subject of feminism geared towards a younger audience, there's much to say and get out there for us all to ponder on. The first 30 minutes has trouble getting this across and more towards ""all men are awful"" which is fine, if that were the whole thing, but it switches. It overplays that adults and boys won't listen to these girls just a tad too far. It grows along the way getting deeper into the subject. The main character, Vivian, though a character with much to say, undergoes a period where struggles overtake her. That's one of those parts where the ""no one understands me"" trope is taken too far. We lose some character while looking at struggles, and this does happen to other characters. I like Moxie and it does put out a good message, I just wish it weren't so typical in approach because it's losing audiences that way. It's based on a book so it could just be source material, but I just felt wanting a little more.",Moxie
17,ethanbresnett,Top tier teen movie,8,2 July 2021,"Moxie nails it in so many different aspects.Firstly it has a fantastic plot. It is well thought out, well executed, well scripted, and just enjoyable to watch. It will make you angry and frustrated at the world but will ultimately leave you with hope and promise after building to a heartwarming ending. The comedy elements work, the romantic storyline feels relatively authentic by teen movie standards, and the feminist message is well executed and powerful.The characters were all well done. Some were a little over the top and on the nose and I think it would have been interesting to bring in a few more male characters to explore more subtle instances of sexism and micro aggressions, but this is a relatively small criticism all things considered. The cast were all pretty solid, particularly the central performance of Vivian.The direction from Amy Poehler was great, carrying a great tone and style throughout the film. I loved the soundtrack as well which I think always elevates a teen movie a little more.I had a great time watching this film and think it delivered on its purpose very well.Most definitely worth a watch!",Moxie
18,joelwatchesmovies,Contrived and awkward writing lets down its important message,6,16 March 2021,"Girls and women have a lot to be angry about (more than I could imagine), and the way Moxie brings it to a head in the big scream hits hard. The one-off speech by an unnamed character immediately afterwards though encapsulates the film's awkward and contrived script that bungles its message everywhere else: Love the character diversity and intersectional awareness but when they're limited to just random scenes or lines it reeks of tokenism and rids the story of most of its momentum and cohesion.",Moxie
19,faer_kr,interesanting proposal,7,4 March 2021,"A teenage feminist movie based on a book.

Quality.
Entertaining
Light jokes and sarcasm.
A good approach and development that falls at the end of the film, because if he has a good proposal he decides to end it in a generic and hackneyed teenage romantic comedy, without meaning.
It talks about the power of women to speak out, gender equality, fight for ideals before the system and how to do it. On the line what is there between fighting for ideals and going crazy for them. On social claims and showing that the most important social change starts with oneself.
Worked with a lot of hormones for being a teenager but always focused on what is going on, except in the last act.
A topical and slightly reflective film about gender equality and female recognition.
A risky and interesting option.",Moxie

First of all, the date in the funeral home was just creepy and weird. Also, it really didn't feel like Amy Poehler's character would have brought up that field trip story when she meets her daughter's boyfriend for the first time. It bothered me that she worked so hard on the excellent colorful zine collages and then made black and white copies! The plot touched on a lot of little stories and themes but could have gone a lot deeper into a smaller number of them. Plus, the resolutions at the end were pretty quickly glossed over. Overall, it was definitely both enjoyable and moving for a family movie night.",Moxie
22,MIssM19,"Love the feminist message, but...",7,5 April 2021,"I have mixed thoughts about this movie. I liked most of it. I liked the girls coming together for a cause, standing up against injustice, standing up against bullies, abusers and I love the fact that young girls and even little girls will watch this and understand that it's okay to speak up, to support other girls. That's the main message and I love it.There were few things that I was confused about. There is a particular scene, the dinner one, that had me wondering whether I had missed a scene or something. Maybe that was just me. I wished we knew more about the girls in Vivian's group, they were all great. I also liked the diversity in it.My least favorite part is Seth. I thinki it was unnecesary. Moxie was supposed to be a movement for women by women and he should have been supportive, from the outside. You know how ""feminist allies"" tend to be the worse of men? I was expecting this character to go in that direction and when it didn't I was surprised.I also would have love to see Mitchell's downfall.",Moxie

24,Golden_Hope,Empowering,7,3 March 2021,"I think that this movie is going to wind people up. Which is hilarious because that is the whole point of the movie to get under peoples skin and make them think.Most people that see this film and dislike it are going to do so because they see them selfs reflected in the people the movie is talking about.I think that this movie will really be an empowering movie for teenage girls. Lots of films try to do this but i think that this movie succeeds where others don't because it doesn't pander to its audience. It was grounded for the most part.Some characters did border on cartoony, which brings me to my biggest issue with the movie. The actor of Mitchell. He wasn't a very good actor anyway but the worst part was how old he looked. He is nearly 30 and i know that this happens in lots of shows and movie and probably he isn't the only one not playing his age in this movie. The issue is that he just stuck out like a sore thumb. Every time he was on screen i was like ""Oh there is an adult man"". It was just incredibly distracting. He was meant to be 16?Another small issue i had was the back end to the second act and the beginning of the third. It seemed to lose its focus and fell off the tracks a little bit for me.Thankfully it finds its way when it begins to wrap the movie up. I think the ending is really great, i do wish it wasn't over as abruptly. I think this could have been fixed by trimming the movie down and then just giving a few of them minutes to the end.This movie was really good and i think that people should see it. I do however think that this movie is going to get a lot of hate and bad reviews because it is a feminist movie so make sure you watch it and support it.",Moxie

The comedy is there, sometimes work sometimes it doesn't.
I know it is easy to hate this movie for his feminism content. But hey, I as a man, think it was pretty enjoyable. Please don't rate this bad just cause it's a feminist movie.

Moxie has some powerful and meaningful messages, but it's heavily drowned out by its modernity and clichés. It's modernism isn't subtle in the slightest using modern liberal white girl slang and some typical dialogue you hear thrown around in modern day ""progressive"" films that waters it down as almost like a corporate ""we understand you"" type of way. For a high school film it's not too bad, but extremely unrealistic how high schools run and act that make for some major eye-roll moments. The story is powerful enough to get some movement behind it, but it just feels like a typical high school rebellious film with a lot of feminist activism thrown into it that felt heavily forced. I get that the movie is about that, but it felt like it had to shovel it down your throat for you to get the point when it could've been way more subtle and therefore, I feel, more impactful.",Moxie

I'll be the first to say I am a woman and sometimes feminists take things waaayy to far. Like I'm not gonna March with a pu$$y hat on, Because I'm more than what's between my legs, and I don't need to wear that on my head. That being said, I went in very skeptical, thinking this would be one of those ""ugh...why did they have to go there??"" movies. I was wrong, it really had heart and was done well. Women sticking together instead of standing idly by while others rip us apart. Reminding us who and what we are to them. Putting us in a little box. Never once considering how it affects us. I'm still amazed at the ""lists"" that happen in high schools all across the land. Usually now they're just digital, so they're around forever...gross! The only way we'll ever be free is to take the sex and race box off of EVERYTHING!!! This movie didn't bash men or elevate women above them. It's simply about fairness, and that is something sadly, we're still a long way from. Women rule the world, everyone knows it, few admit it. Men get bigger salaries just because of what they have between their legs. How anyone could argue this point is beyond me. I hope I live long enough to see race and sex don't define you. And I'm not talking all this pronoun bullsh*t because that confuses everything and a lot of it makes zero sense to me. I mean just equals, plain and simple. I'm giving 10 stars to make up for all the low ratings from feminist bashing men and women who don't support one another. Thanks for not making feminist a bunch of men hating crazy lesbians. Because let's be honest, that's how lots of people picture feminists. When really feminism is about nothing more than equality and support from your fellow humans...female and male.

It is just poorly done. It is on the nose. Nothing is subtle. The movies tries way to hard. The actors are mediocre, nobody stands out in any way. It is plastered with pop songs in basically every second and most importantly there is no depth to it.

I feel the script didn't do the topic justice. I think it had the potential to be a great movie, but the script felt very robotic and like it was written by an amateur writer. In this story the subject was just thrown into your face, rather than giving it depth.The principal was written too one dimensionally for instance, as to where it wasn't believable. I also found the lead teen a bit irritating at times. Yes, it's an important issue but the dinner scene with her mother and her new boyfriend was cringe and made me lose a lot of respect for the character. She acted like an immature child and her mother literally didn't even tell her to stop once at the table, until she stormed off to her room. Things didn't go well for her at the time, but there's no reason to act like a spoiled brat. Not even an apology to her mother was shown. Also, the 'List' that was going around school, would've resulted in an automatic suspension in the real world today. All in all, it's worth watching and it has a good message, but needed improvements.",Moxie
32,Doublej20005,An Enjoyable and Uplifting if Flawed Film,7,18 March 2021,"This is very much on the nose in its messaging, and there are a lot of more complex ways that this subject matter could be explored. The overt and straightforward way that this tackles extremely complex subject matters will definitely not work for some people. But I think the film is definitely aware of this fact, and instead tries to create a more upbeat and simple portrayal of feminism, and in that regard I think it works well. Amy Poehler's direction is solid, the performances are good and the first two acts in particular are pretty enjoyable. I do think the focus should have been more on some of the side characters, who all things considered were much more interesting, but that doesn't mean that the lead character's arc wasn't pretty strong. It is a bit too long for its own good, and again oversimplifies a complicated topic, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that I had a smile on my face when the credits started to roll. Overall, it's an uplifting and enjoyable if flawed film, and I'd definitely recommend it.",Moxie
33,stefstars,I Mean it's Cute,4,11 March 2021,"What drew me to this one was the preview clip on Netflix's front page and seeing Amy Poehler as the director had me sold. Well, that clip was the only entertaining part in the movie. The film had good intentions but it was just executed in a poor way. It brings up good points about how certain ""promising young men"" are always well protected by schools and how said young men are 95% of the time absolute walking garbage. It brings up the psychological and emotional damage those school lists can do and how much worse it is now in the age of social media, but really that's mostly what the film does - bring up good points and then get lost in silliness.The jokes weren't all that funny and the dialogue was very unnatural and preachy. You would think maybe that was done for comedic effect but it's not even funny. The way the principal talked was just ridiculous, you could tell it was for laughs, but it wasn't funny. A lot of the things in this movie weren't, not even Amy Poehler. I mean you can argue this movie is more aimed at teenagers and maybe they will enjoy it more, it has a good message for them. Still, as a film, it's not very good. I think the best way to describe this film is a Disney Channel version of A Promising Young Woman. It has a similar storyline, just more tamed and more kid friendly. A lot could have been done here but guess they were comfortable with what they had. I second the notion that this movie could've worked better as a series.As my review's title says, it's cute and that's pretty much what it has going for it. Also has that 90's nostalgia factor to it, so if you're into that, here it is.",Moxie
34,ravenclaw_girlrules,Absolutely love it.,8,4 March 2021,"Feminist review alert!I absolutely adore this film. The music is so freaking awesome. The cast is diverse. My only criticism is that the Mitchell plot ends in a sort of generic way (allegations). I liked the incorporation of the classic books vs. modern books debate.

It's also an interesting story, especially for a coming of age drama, with complex characters and it could easily be a TV show. If I could change anything, I'd make Lucy the protagonist, even though she's more obvious as a main character, I think it'd pay off. Very nicely done overall.",Moxie

Many important questions.I liked how the movie showed how much can change with just one small act. How important it is to speak up, and even more so if it's hard or scary. I also liked how it showed importance of female friendship. And how not being white, cisgender, straight and able-bodied comes with additional sets of issues that cannot be dismissed or overlooked.I liked how in the third part when they faced the first set back Vivian just lashed out at everyone showing that she is still just a kid who is overwhelmed with life and all the problems it keeps flinging at her.I really really liked the ending. It was hopeful. And showed that people are constantly learning and evolving and also the strength of unity.I liked the characters, especially Amaya, Lucy and Seth.

But as a man I feel most of the time those movies are cringey.They pictured female as these super power figure and the male was as dumb as possible. Something that really unrelatable to most people. But Moxie is different, it is relatable, has a good drama and funny as well.In Moxie our protagonists are going against ordinary obstacles that women faced everyday. They were objectified, labeled, being unheard, ignored, harassed, and raped. How will they overcome those things? Well you have to see it for yourself.Moxie is a good movie, but I think they could expand this movie into series. There many interesting characters that can be developed. Everyone seems to have their own story. From Claudia (protagonists best friend) who comes from strict immigrants family, Kiera the athletic soccer captain, and of course Seth, the boyfriend that everyone deserves.I really recommend anybody to watch this movie.",Moxie

47,Idle_Hands08,Good teen flick...!,6,7 March 2021,"It was refreshing to see a good quality teen flick that wasn't about the main protagonists trying the get 'laid' by prom night... This had some strong female characters, and a simple but interesting premise. Fighting back, high school style, against the social inequalities and sexism that unfortunately still exist today... They could t seem to get any real traction or help from those in the school system that should be there to help... In the trailer you hear the Principal say 'don't use the word harassment, then I have to do a whole heap over paper work.' Pathetic to think this may actually be the reality for many young people in need of help in our state school system.The main antagonist, captain of the football team, although a stereotypical character, was needed for the narrative to move at the pace it did. This character was a bit too cartoonish and over the top at times, and would have been better if it was played more restrained and realistic.The fact that the main character used an old school paper newsletter to spread her thoughts, and get other people on board for the cause was great. You see her manually cutting and pasting words and images to make these cool little booklets, then ride down to the local copy place to make photocopies. This could have so easily been done as an 'on-line' blog or similar. But it wouldn't have had the same visual impact as seeing all those high school students socialising by reading and discussing the newsletters content... So good.I felt it finished a bit abruptly and really could have 'kicked off' with an unexpected ending that the audience didn't see coming. As it turns out, the ending was fine, just too easy and obvious for a film of this nature. If you have seen 'promising young woman' this could have been organised to be a very clever prequel from their high school days...Enjoy...",Moxie
48,johnpmoseley,Hell yes,10,10 April 2021,"I'm just posting this to bump up the ratings, really. I've read a lot of the reviews and, while I haven't yet found the offended misogynists, I'm reading a lot of people saying it was badly executed, and I don't see it. I found most of the characters plausible, both the sympathetic and the unsympathetic, and I thought the plot was well constructed.Most of all, I was just really moved by it and spent loads of it either with tears in my eyes or laughing delightedly. There were things you could quibble with - I'm not going to bother - and realistically, it's probably more eight-stars than ten, but I'm fighting the tide that's currently dragging it down to 6.5 because, quite simply, I think it's a movie people should see. It's partly that straight men like me do need to see what it's like for women and partly that I really hope it really can empower teenage girls, especially, as much as it obviously means to. And more universally, I think its endorsement of punk rock and screaming your head off for what ails, oppresses and hurts you matters like hell, and I just don't see that acknowledged anywhere near enough.",Moxie

Yeah, I butchered the quote, but I thought it fitted well. I really liked what this movie tries to say. Yes, it makes some mistakes. The third act is a bit messy. It kinda feels like it completely forgot what it was trying to say, but picked it up again after a while. It also is a bit awkward with the way the teens speak. I'm a teen myself and I have never heard someone say: 'That's rad!' But I have to admit, it was really nice to see these girls stand up for themselves. The 'villain' of the movie is a bit too much in my opinion, but there are people in this world like him. There are human being who behave like that, and it's really uplifting to see the girls unit. I actually stood up at the end speech because I felt what these girls have been trough. The movie is really cleverly written, and it makes it so that we really start to care for a girl that we don't know.

Why is it the younger generation feels the need to complain about everything??? This movie portrays them as if they are the only ones that have furthered women. How ironic that they choose to ignore the women who came before them. Women who paved the way and helped give them rights that they exploit today such as Frida Kahlo, Rosa Parks, Margaret Sanger, Betty Friedan, Shirley Chisholm or any woman involved with Suffragette.The girls of today are more focused on tearing down men and less on lifting up women and that's not my definition of feminism. How can we expect to succeed if we're trying to make all men evil instead of helping our fellow woman? Why should schools have to revamp their entire curriculum to suit the needs of these children? Shouldn't the curriculum be expanded so there can be open discussions about the changes seen over the decades? Shouldn't they be pushing for additions of more relevant authors? No, instead the younger generation wants to erase history to make it fit their agenda. They are no better than the people they attack.I'm severely disappointed in this movie. This could have been a wonderful movie with an important message about women and girls joining forces to make positive changes and instead I saw girls lashing out much the same way their male counterparts did without much accomplished. Badly done indeed.",Moxie
54,DeckerDigital,Another Netflix inclusion flick.,6,10 March 2021,"Amy Poehler gets her licks in at an inclusion movie for Netflix Original. The movie ends up having high production value, decent acting, but poor screenplay and story.

There were two items that were memorable. Lauren Tsai as Claudia is a scene stealer and breakout actor. The cover of Moxie magazine claims the athletic vote was rigged!

55,linda-846-907013,I expected better from Amy Poehler,4,13 March 2021,"The movie was really good at first, but it tanked in the end. Nothing was resolved and nothing changed. Pointless property damage stood in for actual change.The principal's trophy was a good example. Real change would have been shown by her realizing, thanks to the actions of our spunky heroines, she was contributing to the problem. Then she looked at that trophy and understood she wasn't the best principal and destroyed it herself.Or the rape accusation - sure, it's great the girl said it out loud and was believed, but does anyone think anything will come of it? We all know what the legal and social system is like. He'll claim it's more of the persecution he talked about in the morning announcement segment. Plus, the one girl admitting she tripped the guy who's the Pirate mascot? That's not feminism, that's assault.And what did they do when the girl lost the scholarship? Nothing. They didn't find someone to give her another scholarship that was even better. They didn't show the guy giving the scholarship that the soccer team was worth supporting, they didn't ask for a count of the votes. It was just forgotten about.Vivian never took responsibility for her unhelpful and cruel actions - we never see her apologize to her mom or her mom's boyfriend. She gives a small ""I'm sorry"" to Seth, but I wasn't convinced.This seemed exceptionally performative and poorly thought out.

And that's it.It is as manichaeist as it gets. The bad guys are constantly bad, as irredeemable as possible. The good guys are saints, only lacking the halo. Sexism is not shown, it is shot like a missile at the scream. Subtlety simply does not exist.The acting is subpar, but that's understandable, as it relies on mostly young and inexperienced actors.With that, it is very hard to stay engaged with it. There is no actual thinking needed, as every situation that is presented is black and white. So, when it ends, it'll just fade. It provokes nothing, it changes nothing.

My biggest let down was that, sadly, this movie doesn't walk the walk itself. It's filled with double standards. It talks about not judging women by their appearances, but then has a slo-mo shot of the ""good guy"" pulling up his shirt while skating, as the main female characters drool. It doesn't address how good guy Seth is also being portrayed as a hero, while litteraly just behaving like a normal human being. That would have been a great way to show how women have to be extraordinary in order to be noticed, but men are celebrated for being civil. A lot of the characters are extremely cliché and cringy and I agree that this movie doesn't really work outside of the US.

At times it did feel tokenistic (don't hate: I'm a feminist) , but only because it felt certain characters and issues were rushed through for the film and to be representative.Nevertheless- I feel it achieved it's aim: to raise the issues facing female teens, to give a voice, to encourage them to use that voice.I (as a teacher) honestly loved how annoyed, angry and defiant these students got and only hope my own students - all genders - can feel confident enough to stand up and speak up - which was the message of this film : stand up, speak up.If I had a teenage daughter, I'd want her to watch a film like this and be inspired to speak up and put against the double standards and issues faced.",Moxie

82,Shana1212,10/10 Must watch!,10,3 March 2021,Finally a teenager movie that raises important questions about feminism and the patriarchy! Can't believed we are still fighting for the same equal rights our ancestors did a million of years ago...,Moxie
83,vovazg,So much emotion..,10,9 March 2021,"Bering a father to a little baby girl I want to believe one day she's going to be all that she can be and not be a part of a world I grew up in where women were just leveled to body parts and second place feeling behind us men. Gender doesn't matter in life, it shouldn't. Race doesn't matter. Nationality doesn't matter. Religion doesn't matter. Only we matter. Humans. If we do it right the whole Planet will prosper, children, animals, plants, nature.... everything. Just have emphaty. Just have understanding. And help and respect each other. Tomorrow our children will follow. This is why it doesn't matter how cliche this movie is made, or the introvert details or the bad writing.. what matters is the message it carries. Those who think otherwise I'm sorry but you never had to walk the shoes of many around you who suffer every day and you can't understand something fully if you didn't experience it. That's why emphaty and understanding is so so important it's a game changer. And that's why I give this move a 10. Apart from that the movie is really good all throughout with a great lead cast and great soundtrack. I really enjoyed it. It has important message and it presses the right buttons. So disregard the rating it's better than the numbers show and I hope more like this comes.",Moxie
84,TV_viewerno1223455678910,Much needed for young people,10,6 March 2021,The movie pulled me in from the start. Lucy's character is fearless and refuses to shrink and mould herself to other notions of who she should be. I would have loved to have seen Lucy as the main protagonist. Her character is intriguing and deserves a more significant story arch. The film has a refreshing approach to the high school movie genre. It captures some of the changes that are happening right now amongst young people who are far more socially aware than their predecessors.,Moxie
85,chukwukelumarvelous,INSPIRING AND POWERFUL BUT..N,5,8 March 2021,"The movie talks about a lot of themes that are avoided in mordern day conversation and I will give it props for that. But unfortunately,it follows a very regimented teen movie timeline. It is like watching radio rebel all over again. Loved it and it is packed with the right message but I wish it could have been written better.",Moxie
86,darylkulak,Is There Anything Higher Than a 10??,10,18 May 2021,Such a great movie. It pulled us in from the start and kept getting better. Do not confuse this with a standard high school movie.

89,rachelvanwelzen,This movie speaks facts and facts only,10,5 March 2021,Half the comments are people (lets not lie especially white men above 30) who dont understand that this is actually happening.

90,SanciR,A lot of thought and care went into this,10,4 March 2021,"Most movies don't DARE talk about feminism, opting for more subtle approaches out of fear of triggering men with sensitive egos... and those who do, play into this whole ""girls vs boys"" mentality that further promotes inequality. Moxie on the other hand IS a true and carefully crafter feminist film. It touches upon so many issues and does it without villainizing men, but rather villainizing misogyny... it is conscious of the different intersectionalities within women issues (race and transness)... and it shows the IMPORTANCE this movement has and the ways in which it can empower women, which at the end of the day is the most important part.Sadly, I am sure this movie is doomed to fail thanks to the men who are not willing to look inward, who continue to disregard the voices of teenage girls and who cover their ears as soon as they hear the word ""feminism"". So please don't look at the rating of this film to decide wether or not you should watch it, at least give it a chance and form your own opinion.",Moxie
91,nat_mt,Rebel Girl!,10,4 March 2021,"Awesome music, awesome film based on an awesome book! We need more like this especially to appeal to the younger generation of women! The dream where Vivian has no voice is particularly powerful, as a woman I have often felt that I do not have a voice. I am pretty sure the younger generation feel this even more keenly and no social media has not given women more of a voice, not with all the trolling that happens. This film will not have a high rating, let's face it some will mark it low due to the content. Do not be put off Rebel Girl, we should all have a little or rather a lot of moxie in us.",Moxie
92,Killerb44,What?,1,30 October 2021,"Why is it that films continue to be made about messages that are untrue? Womean are not treated like this movie wants you to believe and men don't get free passes, unless they come from money, but the same is true for women in rich and powerful families. It's dangerous to teach young women that society treats them poorly or that sexism is one of the biggest problems in today's society. If that were true, then what progress has feminism ever made? This is the usual message of man bashing vs really delivering a message of female power. Victim hood is not an empowering message.",Moxie

94,dandbhouse,Too light for big issues?,6,21 April 2021,"This film attempts to tackle some big issues such as bullying and sexual assault. However, it tries to do it with a level of lightness that does not fully work. Should it have been a more serious film? That is a question that needs to be answered by those who watch it. But sometimes serious subjects need to be presented in a more serious fashion. The age group that this is targeted at can take it because they are on the front lines of these issues. The portrayal of strong young adults with a social conscience is never a bad thing. That is what makes it a movie to watch and not totally dismiss.",Moxie

96,smilesandmusic,"Light movie, strong message - left me in doubt?",6,6 March 2021,"The movie, obviously, has several flaws. At times it feels rushed and unnatural, but I actually like the way it stays pretty light despite the difficult topic it is dealing with, so I guess it's kinda good for younger audience. It has sweet and good moments, but some are pretty questionable and may show feminism in a wrong way (it's not actually feminism, but it's supposed to be in the movie...).",Moxie
97,eamjmoore,Not perfect but inspiring and worth a watch,8,11 August 2021,"I'll admit there's some flaws to the movie, but overall I think it's a really great movie with an amazing message. Telling women and young girls that they don't have to put up with sexism and double standards, they can fight back and make a difference. I really feel like going out and fighting the system now! Definitely watch it!",Moxie
98,hi-floyd,Had potential but was so poorly written,3,8 March 2021,"The concept of the story was very strong but it was so poorly executed by the screenwriters. There were way too many storylines that, as a result, all fell flat. Moments of the story that were clearly meant to have a lot of emotional weight felt completely empty because there was barely any build up to them. The writers should've chosen one of the arcs to focus on and really honed in on that; Kiera's storyline would've been great for this.If the majority of Moxie's attention turned towards working on Kiera winning the scholarship, as in, they spent lots of time and energy campaigning only to have her lose to Mitchell who only won due to his reputation, popularity and generally him just showing up, then her loss would've hit much harder. Seeing all of the characters cry when she lost felt so forced, it was honestly cringy.Also, the tokenism was real. It would've been so lovely to see the girl in the wheelchair or the transgender girl have a significant role. Instead, they just kind of float around on the sidelines, not really contributing to the action of the story. The fact that I can't even remember their names is telling. Frankly, it felt like they were just shoved in to spice up the story with 'diversity' when really it felt lazy. The transgender girl's aspiration to play Audrey in the production of Little Shop of Horrors could've also been a major storyline, a campaign that Moxie really fought for.It is even mentioned that the transgender girl is facing a lot of discrimination and that intersectional feminism is key, yet these topics/themes are never picked up again or given the time of day. Again, it feels like these parts were just thrown in for the sake of slapping on a 'diversity' badge and then the writers called it a day. It isn't enough. It's time that these characters who represent marginalised demographics actually provide something for the story.Overall, it was just a very weak attempt at representing fourth wave feminism and I don't think it did the movement justice. Also, it legitimately just like, wasn't funny. Like, it was meant to be a comedy and genuinely the jokes just weren't good. So, big nah.",Moxie
99,heyyyoliver,''I am so angry I could scream'',7,26 March 2021,"The one thing that kept going through my head was: ''God, I wish we had movies like these when I was in my early teens''. I loved this movie, thank you Amy Poehler for making it. Now, let me be clear... Although black girls, Asian girls, trans girls, girls who are survivors and others were represented, it also sucks that not any of them were the lead. It makes the movie a bit shallow, with a slight white savior theme, rather than using white privilege for everyone's benefit. If you see this movie as an educated feminist, you know in America it's usually women of color who are at the forefront. Then again, I also understand. A lot of people who watched this movie probably wouldn't have seen it if any of the other girls were the lead, because white people only listen to white people. So I understand that they firstly need to make a movie like this, which is inclusive, but white led, so that enough white people get educated and use their privilege to spread the message - so that one day girls with different ethnicities and identities can get the spotlight and everyone can deservingly get the chance to be the freaking lead. It's not right, they need to do better for all girls, but especially little girls of color who are long overdue representation. It makes me angry and I too want to scream, but it's the world we live in and it's movies like this that are slowly, but surely getting us there, because they're educating younger generations. It's not enough, it just isn't. ''But what are you going to do? Nothing?''
Thankfully, young girls are sticking together and educating one another over platforms such as Tiktok, so plenty of them are aware of things I am speaking of. This movie is for those whom the message hasn't crossed yet. Support the girls! Support women!",Moxie
100,tashwelch,Under-rated gem,9,9 March 2021,"I didn't have much expectations of this but thought I would give it a go.
I was slightly triggered by the abusive tactics but this is a reflection of the film reflecting it well, instead of silly bullying tactics that most teen films show. This film covers a lot of areas that we should be aware of. Some in smaller doses than others. This is a really good film that I will be showing on family film night. 1. It's just a good film. 2. It opens up conversation and thoughts on so many areas that should be discussed. I actually even got a l'il teary at the end. Well done.",Moxie

No one is excluded from supporting change, progress and equality!",Moxie
102,pjinver,Compelling and enjoyable,9,10 March 2021,"The issues in this movie of women being treated as less important, being silenced or their issues being trivialised is something women of any age or nationality can relate to. I appreciated the way this movie addressed these issues in such an empowering and feel-good way, weaving them into a story about courage and friendship that was probably not groundbreaking but definitely more enjoyable to watch than the usual dark and gritty approaches to such serious topics. It's also fun to watch how in movie review sites like this the misogynist trolling of movies with feminist content has become so predictable and mundane that the resulting rating has now become meaningless because everyone knows why it wasn't better.",Moxie

104,miguelasampaio,Great movie,9,16 July 2021,I just finished watching after a long time hearing about it and I was amazed it is much better than the imdb rating says...mostly because people want to complain about it not being a ultra length movie that will talk about all the things feminism and all of its representative forms...The movie was fun. It was inspiring and I believe the world is a better place cause this movie was a hit and we get to see it being done.Looking at the critics its sad that the movie praises a movement that complains about not being fully represented in every way possible. Feminism is a huge thing and the movie is less than two hours so people could chill a bit.I guess some movies can learn with a lot that is said on Moxie ...Great camera work and acting btw.,Moxie
105,millerwilliamh,smash the patriarchy!,10,13 March 2021,Amy Poehler knocked it out of the metaphorical park. Everyone who poorly reviews this movie has an axe to grind against social justice.

So all the other girls wear tank tops to school for one day to support her, and then they all go back to wearing regular shirts and tees. Kids do not get to wear whatever they want in school. It's been that way forever. The tank top girl shouldn't be harassed or made fun of, just like the others on ""the list"". She should just dress appropriately for school and save the tanks for other times if that's her choice. Inappropriate for school. I also think the Principal's attitudes were difficult to believe in these days of women's awareness and ""MeToo"". There were some mixed-up messages in this movie, and it wasn't very funny.",Moxie

The film is pro feminist and does raise awareness on the inequalities girls still face in today's world.
My mother watched the movie with us and was appalled to realise girls were still in need to fight against so many inequalities. Inequalities already existing in the late 60's!
It starts like a light hearted film and turns into a stronger message. It is definitely an American take on these issues but most teenagers around the world will be able to relate to the situations.",Moxie

The bigger picture has a much stronger message and yes, the beginning of the film was cringe and poorly written, but this is the type of content we need to make change. I wish they had made this a tv show instead of a movie so there was more time to go in depth further.Moral of the story, finish the whole movie and then form an opinion.

It's very empowering and even when the characters make mistakes we see them try to learn and grow. However with a movie that obviously tries to aim at making a good message and representation for feminism, it would've been nice to see a bit more accountability on the main character's part for the times she said insulting and rude things to her loved ones. However since the end of the movie focused on the larger message I see why those arguments didn't get a better resolution. Still it damages the message a little when the main character for feminism doesn't take an appropriate amount of responsibility for the toxic way she spoke. Even though she did do something uplifting for all women in the end, she should've handled those interpersonal relationships better cause feminism matters but it doesn't trump how you treat the people in your personal life.",Moxie

131,eap-45189,A Genuinely Good Movie,9,14 August 2021,"I stumbled upon this by accident, and I stayed for Bikini Kill. I genuinely enjoyed this movie. I think what some people are forgetting is that it is just a movie. They have to condense everything into 90 minutes. At the end of the film, the main antagonist is revealed as a rapist and is taken to the principal's office, presumably for punishment. While the school/legal system often fall short here, the movie doesn't have the time to show every single part of this (otherwise it'd be long and miserable, not exactly fitting for a teen flick). But it does open up conversations. Conversations about the way women are treated in society (after all, I've been harassed by several older men as a teenager), but it includes intersectional takes, about black women, Asian women, other WOC, trans women, LGBT+ women, etcetera. Additionally, there are supportive male characters, and the main character learns that attacking every man she comes across isn't the solution, but instead takes larger action. Is it a perfect display of every single issue that women face? No, and it would be offensive to even assume that it could all be fit into a single teen movie. But I genuinely enjoyed the film, all the characters were supportive and loving, even if they were flawed. Definitely worth the watch, especially for young people.",Moxie

This film is inclusive in all ways.The film is a 12 I think in UK certifications and it does tackle some pretty serious issues, but they are issues any high school child will recognise in this day and age.It opens up conversations with your child about consent, race, representation, sexism. Theres a bit of swearing too, but nothing feels gratuitous.The sound track is absolutely energising and present throughout the film and for viewers of a certain age, going to bring back a lot of happy memories of the early 90's.It's a ride, there are sad bits that really touch you, but overall me and my kiddo, felt energised just watching.Grrl Power!",Moxie

143,mrtyoung,It's OK if you're a man to enjoy this film.,9,6 March 2021,The film depicts people not hearing what you have to say really well. Anyone that has ever felt like they are struggling to talk to the wider populous and felt uncomfortable growing up will have something to identify with it.Yes being a woman is huge identity of this film but it isn't the only thing it should be identified as.This is a great film. Well worth a watch.,Moxie
144,amesrichards,A film with an identity crisis,2,13 March 2021,"I had high hopes for this film which were very quickly dashed. The main problem is that it doesn't know what it is. Is it a teen comedy, a coming-of-age tale, or a hard-hitting commentary on the systemic sexism and toxic masculinity that persists throughout society? For the most part it is nothing more than a very predictable, formulaic teen comedy, it just happens to also have a plot that proports to tackle the very vaguely labelled 'sexism' in the protagonist's high school. There's no reference to this being a wider problem, it is very much centred entirely around one 'bad apple' in one high school, and in doing so dismisses any idea that this might be global, systemic issue. Throughout the film we see constant sexual harassment, toxic masculinity, gaslighting and gross failures from teaching staff in their duty of care that's tantamount to abuse. And yet, ironically, none of these acts are depicted with the severity they warrant - it's all just considered 'sexism' and it largely remains light and 'funny'. Blink and you'll mis the trans character, who mentions that she's not allowed to audition for a female role in the school play, like its just an annoying inconvenience and not a child being discriminated against by her teachers. I did actually blink and miss the same sex kiss between two of the girls. Both really important issues that are introduced and then totally ignored thereafter. But worst of all, literally minutes before the end, the film decides to get dark and a rape is introduced (just another example of this pesky sexism)! But again, after shoehorning in this totally random 'plot twist' minutes before the end, again, there's no follow up - not one person suggests the victim report it to the police, the rapist gets no comeuppance; it's not even implied by maybe a shot of a police car approaching the school; he's not even stripped of his scholarship, nothing other than the totally inept, part-of-the-problem, neglectful, abusive head mistress calling him to her office! In a film that is claiming to be challenging sexual abuse and misogyny, it's infuriating that they didn't bother seeing this last-minute addition through to a conclusion that would have supported that message! But hey, the victim got to put on a pretty dress and go to a party with her new girlfriends, who all show their support by saying they believe her, so thank goodness for that! At best disappointing, at worst dangerous.",Moxie

It's really realistic of any high school you go to, and the harassment and double standards girls face. I thought that part was really well done, and the entire movie has great inclusitivity. There are just a few parts I don't understand why they were included. Two of the girls kiss once and its never addressed or developed. I understand that they don't want to take away from the overall theme, but to me it just felt like a token scene, like they threw it in to seem ""woke"".

While I did not feel like I related to this movie with my own high school experience three years ago, I know others who would probably say otherwise. This movie gets a really thinking about things, and if there are schools that have become just as toxic as the one shown the movie which is entirely possible, then this movie holds some truth and reality. There are people who will knock this movie saying it's just the classic crazy feminism(the type that says all men are bad and and doesn't shout equality), but this movie I think hits on point of the right type of feminism that promotes unity and respect, and equal treatment of women who don't get heard when they speak up.",Moxie

Things were glossed over and it became boring with about 45 minutes left.

This movie is utterly empowering, watching this movie made me want to do something like it in protest, and I know I could because the plot was realistic and stuff like this actually happens all around the world. This movie made me feel super confident and I 110% recommended. Most of the bad reviews are from men pointing out the fact there was one scene which included vandalism -- painting the front of the school floor ""r@peport"" in protest of the captain of the football team r@ping a girl. I see no reason why that is a bad excuse for vandalism, considering something like that has already occurred and probably will continue to occur.

Literally none of the character is three-dimensional, starting with the protagonist and her ""struggles"" , following with her ever supporting boyfriend, the nerdy best friend, the new rebel friend, the a-hole jock etc.. on top of all it just cannot decide whether to be a drama or a comedy and it's incapable of finding the right balance between them.

I had my hair cut in a cute pixie cut, and because of my hair, the fact that I spoke my mind in classes, didn't dress like a perky cheerleader (think grunge people), a rumor started going around the school by 'popular' jock guys that I was a lesbian. Simply for the facts stated above. I received a lot of harassment from these guys for it my sophomore year. It didn't bother me that they were calling me a lesbian, what bothered me is that because I had a VOICE and knew how to use it in opposition to what they thought and demanded from the other girls in my school, in their minds, the ONLY conclusion could be that I was a lesbian. I love this movie because for me and I know for MANY other grown women and teenage girls alike, it shows what it is we really go through, trying to navigate our lives in a male dominated world (especially 25 years ago). We've made progress, but still need more to happen. I have two sons and you better believe I am teaching them the power of womanhood, right along with their own power and uniqueness as men. I'm trying to teach them the value of both genders and what they have to offer. Is the movie perfect? No. But it's definitely worth the watch.",Moxie

It's a better reflection of the behavior of highschoolers compared to other movies and it IS indeed well made and I'm happy it doesn't have the cringy need to relate to millenials and gen z vibes...I'm just tired of the same old spiel.

The problem is how they get too nitpicky with what men do that is wrong. Of course it's NOT fine to make a list ranking women or slapping their asses and not at all raping them. But it's the fact that they hate on the fact that the queen in a card game is weaker than the king, like what is that going to do?

221,tarakiernan,"Good intentions, poor execution.",3,18 March 2021,"Moxie seemed to be a great film at first.
The main plot is about fighting for equality- which is something I love and wholeheartedly support in cinema.
However, a sub-plot was about racism and white privilege. I believe that this film could've been really great if they delved into these issues deeper and explored them more. Sadly the shallow approach was taken and the main character was portrayed as ignorant towards her privilege and preachy towards non-white people who are actually experiencing racism.
It was extremely hard to root for her when she adopted all the ideals her black, asian and LGBTQ+ friends possessed and twisted them into being her 'original ideas'.
In fact, the lead female in the film is black, LGBTQ+ and far more interesting than the main character could ever be. So... why wasn't she made the protagonist instead of the white, privileged, cardboard cutout of a main character?
Yes, some parts of the film were empowering; and that contributes to my three star rating.
But the rest of it was sorely disappointing because it could've been so good!

It's a nice movie to watch if you're looking for something empowering and has a nice message. The characters are well written and they have actual personalities. They even revealed that Vivian and Claudia are INTJs!And speaking of Claudia, I think this movie could've been better if it was in Claudia's point of view.If Claudia was the main character, I'd like to know more about her relationship with her mom and I'd like to see her point of view when she starts feeling distant towards her best friend, Vivian.Although I really liked the acting of the girl who played Vivian, I didn't really like her character that much. Sometimes she goes off too much with her feminism, like that one time her mom's nice boyfriend came over at their place for dinner. I think it was very rude of her to snap at him and bring up gender equality in almost everything. Sje even broke school rules like vandalism on school property. I mean she could've done better...
Seth Acosta is one of the best leading man I've seen for awhile. He's proof that you can be a feminist even though you're a man. He's really sweet and supportive. He's also not your stereotypical famous jock that falls in love with the shy girl no body notices (thankfully)This movie is worth the watch.

But I think it needed to have a lighter touch at times so the film seemed more approachable for a wider to group of people to feel they could watch it. It wasn't just about white feminism but shows that black women are always there showing up and without whom no movement could have been made. I do think however, even though Seth was Asian which was amazing, Netflix or most casts only have one lead that's non white otherwise they believe it's a bombardment to the viewers sensors if there's too many POC as the main romantic leads.

This is not fiction, this is truth. The high school in this movie was my high school. The male toxicity, controlling what we wore because God forbid we ""distract the boys"" from learning...because we were made responsible for the actions of our male peers.

251,DustinBoone,"Good movie, GREAT message, terrible principal.",7,12 April 2021,"I liked this movie a decent amount. I do have 1 critique that severely bothered me, though I'll save that for the end since I think it's more important to focus on what's good about it: the message. The importance of people speaking up for female equality in schools (and life, but this takes place in school) is such a good message. Especially when told in the way this movie did. The story, actors, cinematography...etc. All came together to make a movie that sucked me in & fueled me to be reminded that I want to have women's backs as well as ways that I can be.Okay... now to the negative critique. WHO MADE THE PRINCIPAL BE THAT WAY? Don't get me wrong, I know these cliches are based on reality, but it was painfully overboard. I would be sucked I to the movie, feeling it to be real enough despite some cheesy moments, but then we have the principal be BLATANTLY NEGLIGENT to the harassment. Again, I know this happens in real life. But the cheesy way it was done in the movie was SO jarringly disrupting from the reality the rest of the movie portrayed. Every time I saw the principal, I felt like I was watching SNL with how absurdly she was acting (and without even trying to hide it from the students.)
This was such a contrast to Amy Poehler, who is actually FROM SNL, because she portrayed her character in such a lovely, realistically refreshing way. Like a real human. Was is the directors notes to act so absurd to prove the point SO hard? Don't know, don't care. Was it the actress acting that way because she doesn't know how to act? I hope not.All that to say, it's still a great movie & message to the point that I'm still rating it a 7/10. I'm glad I watched it.",Moxie

254,dejohnam-98420,Could have been great,5,15 March 2021,"While having never read the book, the premise of the movie was intriguing. To me, it seemed like the perfect wish fulfillment, a movie about girls fighting back and making waves. Ultimately, I was left feeling a tad empty and like many of the ""intersectional"" moments in the film were unearned.Without spoiling the film, I want to say that intersectionality is more than simply including women with various identities. A transgender character is given one line about dead naming, but then isn't given any sort of character arc. Two characters are revealed to be LGBTQ+ in a single kissing scene, but we don't see them really speak to each other the rest of the movie? My cynical side believes this was done so the movie could be shown in more countries by editing out these moments. Much space is given to the main character and her journey with feminism, boys, and her family, which I think was a mistake. There were really fascinating characters that could have built a fantastic, intersectional ensemble cast. Give this cast a plot that investigates the nuanced, experienced journeys of feminine people! Instead we're given throw away lines about gender, disability, ethnicity, race that feel like a screenwriter checking off boxes. Only the character with a mobility disability is ever actually funny with her quips at able-bodied extras.Despite my qualms with the story we were given, this is a well directed movie with great performances. Only in a few scenes did the absurdity of the plot get in the way of believability (the principal knowing dismisses a few things that at most high schools would have resulted in at least an investigation). I won't watch again but I'm glad this movie exists for today's high schoolers as it portrays a positive representation of a high school cishet relationship, friendship among girls, and (of course) feminism.",Moxie
255,benbutler-74030,Lots of flaws.,5,5 March 2021,"I'm trying to avoid spoilers so forgive the vagueness of this review. This film actually started out very promising, I thought it was actually a very accurate depiction of high school, a little bit exaggerated but still very accurate. However, the problem with this film is really the lost opportunities and missteps it takes. The film begins to show a more nuanced look on its subject matter, opening the door for some interesting dialogue. However, the film quickly abandons this nuance and actually tries to twist the other side of the coin into another positive element. Also, a lot of dialogue is included in the film that doesn't really add to the plot, themes, or setting. Again, sorry for the vagueness but perhaps a good way to put it, is this film is like Lady Bird but completely unaware of its self. Also, I have to say, there is a scene I found sort of racist. Let me explain. There is a character whose mother is a first generation Chinese immigrant. This character gets suspended from school and ends up in severe trouble with her mother. When her friend, the protagonist of the film, goes to talk to her, the character says something along the lines of ""You can't understand what I'm going through, because you're white. My mother came into this country and has worked hard for me to get an education. You don't understand the pressure."" This scene really rubbed me the wrong way, because it perpetuates the stereotype of Asian-Americans living in strict households where success in school is the most important thing for children. It also implies that this is exclusive to Asian-Americans, hence the character saying ""You don't understand because you're white."" However, despite the flaws, the film was entertaining and has good moments. I also have to say it is a major improvement from Amy Poehler's last major film she directed, Wine Country. So, I hope to perhaps see her make something even better.",Moxie

Relationships are barely explored and a forced love plot is dropped in for good measure so it can attempt to tick every box on the Netflix bandwagon, whilst character development is all but ignored for most characters. It's worth giving it a shot and you may get a lot from it but don't expect something ground breaking. I'd recommend the much more progressive and overall better Swedish ""We Are the Best!"".
