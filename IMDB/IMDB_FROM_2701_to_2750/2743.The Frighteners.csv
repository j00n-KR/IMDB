0,Leofwine_draca,Switch your brain off and enjoy,8,19 July 2016,"Peter Jackson's quirky horror comedy acts as a showcase for a whole slew of impressive special effects - which, like in the similar MEN IN BLACK - work well due to the whole comic-book feel of the film. In a serious thriller or drama, they'd of course look fake and ludicrous, but in Jackson's brightly coloured world of ghosts and spirits, they're gobsmacking. While THE FRIGHTENERS is certainly a fun film to watch and a nice film to look at, sadly as is the case with most blockbuster's, it's hardly what you would call substantial, but that doesn't matter in this film's case.This has the most basic of plots as well. Basically, it pretty much consists of one action scene after another with a little bit of history/background information thrown in to pad it out. This seems to have been done for necessity rather than any real reason; this is a purely superficial film. A manic energy keeps it watchable but the ending is a bit of a mess, with a need to tie up every loose end imaginable it quickly becomes a simple series of climaxes becoming ever more ludicrous.Thankfully a team of interesting actors and actresses almost make it all worthwhile and give us something to listen to in between all of the ghoulish gags and special effects. Michael J Fox plays the film's lead, a fine enough actor to cope with all the happenings going on but a sorely shallow person to play. We never learn much about his investigator, save that he saw his wife die once and that a car accident caused him to have psychic visions. That's it. An unrecognisable Dee Wallace Stone plays a former mental patient caught up in the chaos while Trini Alvarado is the solid female lead.Elsewhere, Jackson seems determined to fill his supporting roles with the most psychotic actors available. In particular we have Jeffrey Combs in a rare mainstream appearance (rather more substantial than his blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo in HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL) as a whacked-out FBI agent who has become more insane than the people he hunts. Combs looks incredibly odd in what I like to think is a dig at Fox Mulder's weirdness in THE X-FILES. While his acting is fine and good use is made of his expressions, his character's oddities quickly become grating and in the final third his role seems rather extraneous to the rest of the plot - his appearances eliciting sighs rather than the chuckles Jackson was hoping for.Also on hand are Jake Busey (Gary's son, briefly showing in STARSHIP TROOPERS), as the film's resident psychotic murderer who is actually pretty good, R. Lee Ermey playing a riff on his role in FULL METAL JACKET, and old favourite John Astin as a decrepit ghost who has problems with his jaw. As mentioned earlier, the CGI effects are the best things in this film with all manner of glowing ghosts, flowing Grim Reapers flying across the sky and things reaching out of walls and floors to attack people. Impressive they most certainly are, and they make the film. A macabre sense of humour makes things more amusing than they rightfully should be, but again with Jackson this is all style and visual effects over anything else - as was the case with his frenetic yet hollow BRAINDEAD. Worth catching if your brain is switched off.",The Frighteners
1,SnoopyStyle,Interesting CGI but not funny and aggressively annoying,5,19 October 2014,"There is a rash of heart attack deaths in Fairwater. The town is still haunted by a psychiatric hospital orderly Johnny Bartlett who killed 12 people 32 years earlier. Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) is a psychic investigator. Ever since being in a car accident which killed his wife, he has developed psychic abilities. He has befriended some ghosts who haunt houses allowing him to perform exorcisms at a nice profit. Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado) is the new doctor in town. She treats Patricia Ann Bradley (Dee Wallace) but her mother won't let her leave the house. She was the underage girlfriend-conspirator of Johnny Bartlett. Lucy's husband is a boorish brute who got into a fight with Bannister. Bannister sets his ghost friends on the Lynskeys. During the exorcism, Bannister notices a ghostly number marked on Ray Lynskey's forehead. Soon Ray is dead from a heart attack.There is an annoying factor about this movie. It's trying so hard to be weird and funny. The fact is Peter Jackson is not good at writing comedies. Michael J. Fox had never been one of those broad comedic actors anyways. He's a little jittery and playing a slightly annoying character. The ghosts are too aggressively ugly and really aggressively annoying. Ray is definitely annoying. There are a lot of annoying things going on in this movie. I can appreciate Peter Jackson's attempt here. The CGI is quite advanced. The wild ghostly ways are done with quite a specific vision. It's an interesting idea but not that funny and really unappealing.",The Frighteners
2,mark.waltz,The creepiest characters are the living.,8,20 October 2021,"The characters played by Jeffrey Combs and Julianna McCarthy go down in film history as two of the most delightfully bizarre characters you'll ever see in a film, and it's truly a delightful surprise to see the kindly matriarch Elizabeth Foster Brooks from ""The Young and the Restless"" playing such a delightfully hideous mother. Wearing a wig that resembles the older Vlad the Impaler in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", McCarthy is manipulating daughter Dee Wallace over a family secret that has brought on demons to haunt her, and other mystical creatures, the demons that appear throughout the film are indeed the scariest. The actual ghosts that are in Michael J. Fox's mine are simply trying to recapture some of their life, whether enjoying the foods they loved, the spouse they adored, an apparently wronged judge, and in the case of a very militant marine officer, keep all the ghosts in line.While this is more about the special effects and photography and Danny Elfman's magical score, the story is quite interesting with box able to see dead people because of a car accident that he was in that killed his wife. Now Fox communicates with the living whom the dead want to contact and this of course has him branded as a fraud. Everywhere he goes, he gets into trouble because of this magical power with security guards in the Museum of Natural History wanting to shoot him to shoot him on sight.An absolutely delightful combination of horror, science fiction fantasy, romance and comedy, this is a surprising find for me as I had somehow missed even hearing about it. Fox gets one of his last great roles, feisty and strange and romantic and funny. With the Danny Elfman score, you'd think that this is a Tim Burton film as it does possess the magical impact of Burton at his best, but it was Peter Jackson behind the director's chair. Trini Alvarado is a great heroine, and the voices of the ghosts ( including John Astin as the judge) are letter perfect. ""The Frighteners"" is a positively perfect title because like any good horror film, you find yourself laughing at your reaction to the frights, and I also experienced practically every other emotion other than the feeling of anger having wasted my time. This absolutely was not a waste of my time.",The Frighteners
3,claudio_carvalho,"Weird, but Entertaining and Original",7,8 November 2017,"After the traumatic experience of losing his beloved wife Debra (Angela Bloomfield) in a car accident, the architect Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) acquires the ability of seeing ghosts. He quits his profession; abandons the construction of his dream house to live with Debra and becomes a con man, using the ghosts Cyrus (Chi McBride), Stuart (Jim Fyfe) and The Judge (John Astin) to haunt houses and then charging the dwellers to exorcise their homes.Dr. Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado) visits the reclusive Patricia Ann Bradley (Dee Wallace-Stone), who was a former delinquent and girlfriend of the serial–killer Johnny Bartlett (Jake Busey) that lives with her mother, she notes that Patricia has bruises. Lucy returns home and together with her husband Ray Lynskey (Peter Dobson), they are haunted by a poltergeist. She calls Frank and soon Ray has a heart attack. Lucy meets Frank in a restaurant and he realizes that Soul Collector is marking numbers in the forehead of his victims before killing them. Frank becomes prime suspect of the police due to his knowledge about the murders and he is arrested. Meanwhile the psychotic FBI agent Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs) comes to the city to investigate the murder cases. When Frank finds that Lucy will be the next victim of the Reaper, he takes the ultimate decision to fight the entity to save her.""The Frighteners"" is a weird, but entertaining and original film by Peter Jackson. The story is too violent for comedy and too silly for horror; therefore the genre is indeed a combination of comedy, romance, horror and fantasy. The special effects are excellent and state-of-art for a 1996 movie. Michael J. Fox shines in the role of the psychic Frank Bannister and Trini Alvarado is perfect in the role of his romantic pair Dr. Lucy Lynskey. All the characters are interesting and peculiar, and the cast has great performances independently of the special effects. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Os Espíritos"" (""The Spirits"")",The Frighteners
4,gavin6942,The Only Fright Was Looking at How Much Time I Wasted,5,9 September 2005,"After a car accident in which his wife, Debra, was killed and he was injured, Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) develops psychic abilities allowing him to see ghosts.I first watched this film several years ago with my then-girlfriend because I was a big fan of Peter Jackson's ""Bad Taste"". I watched about a half hour of it again in 2005, and I got the same reaction as years ago: who is the casting director and why aren't they shot? You have R. Lee Ermey, who is a quality character actor. And you have Jeffrey Combs, who is the second greatest living horror actor today behind Bruce Campbell. But Michael J. Fox as the lead? Fox cannot do horror, he can only do family films (he soared in ""Back to the Future"" and on the TV show ""Scrubs""). So you are left with a film that is half family and half horror. And this fails. It is too creepy to be a good family film, but too cutesy to be even in the Top 250 Horror Films category. Combs, known as villains from Re-Animator and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, is held back by this genre. So even his role, which shouldbe the scene-stealer, is muffled. With this hodge-podge of acting-talent vomited on to the silver screen, who even bothers to notice the plot? Peter Jackson's worst film is what this is, and something that should be burned at the stake rather than be played ad nauseum on the Sci Fi Channel. Not recommended, not even if you are drunk.Watched the film again in 2011 and found that I had forgotten almost every part of it. I think my above review is a bit harsh, but I stand on the position that Fox was poorly cast and this is Jackson's weakest film. Who saw this and decided to give him the LOTR movies? But I will bump it up from a 4 to a 5.",The Frighteners
5,lee_eisenberg,get this,7,9 August 2006,"Years before the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and ""King Kong"", Peter Jackson made this very quirky flick with Michael J. Fox. Fox plays Frank Bannister, a sort of ghost-buster: he has several ghost friends, who pretend to haunt houses, and he comes to the rescue to get them out. This has basically turned him into an outcast in the town, until he starts seeing numbers on peoples' heads. These numbers turn out to relate to...OK, I don't know how much more I can tell you without giving everything away, but I will say that ""The Frighteners"" is one of the most interesting movies that I've ever seen. Aside from the original story, there are some clever scenes. For example, R. Lee Ermey plays a ghost seemingly based on his character in ""Full Metal Jacket"", and one of Frank's ghost friends decides to get slinky with...a mummy! You read that right. Plus, there's Jeffrey Combs's loony detective; I don't know how such a person would ever get to be a detective! Obviously, this movie isn't any kind of masterpiece, but it doesn't pretend to be. This is all about being far out, and they do just that. This may be Michael J. Fox's coolest movie ever. If it has any problem, it's probably what a previous reviewer identified: it's a little bit formulaic what happens to Frank at the end. But other than that, you're sure to like the movie. Also starring Trini Alvarado, Peter Dobson, John Astin, Dee Wallace (that's right: Elliott's mom in ""ET""!), Jake Busey and Chi McBride.",The Frighteners
6,jboothmillard,The Frighteners,7,9 August 2007,"From director Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) and executive producer Robert Zemeckis this is quite a good supernatural comedy thriller. Basically Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) is a man claiming that he can talk to and see ghosts, but he is in fact a conman. Not because he is lying to them, but he can get ghosts Cyrus (Chi McBride) and Stuart (Jim Fyfe) to cause reason for a haunting in whichever house is chosen, and he lives with them and The Judge (John Astin). All this goes on until one day strange deaths are occurring in the town, while love interest Dr. Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado), whose husband has died the same cause, goes to the house of deranged Old Lady Bradley (Julianna McCarthy) who keeps her grown-up daughter Patricia Ann Bradley (E.T.'s Dee Wallace) locked up, saying it is for the good of everyone else. Soon enough, even the ghosts are in danger of this deceased murderer, known as ""The Soul Collector"". It is therefore up to Frank, Lucy and the ghosts to find out how to end the fiendish killings, while also trying to get deranged Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs), who possibly also can see ghosts, off their backs. Also starring Peter Dobson as Ray Lynskey, Starship Troopers' Jake Busey as Johnny Charles Bartlett, Troy Evans as Sheriff Walt Perry and R. Lee Ermey parodying his role of Sgt. Hartman in Full Metal Jacket, playing Sgt. Hiles. The special effects are impressive, there are some good giggles and engaging thrills, a good film. Very good!",The Frighteners
7,Woodyanders,A hugely enjoyable and inventive supernatural horror comedy treat,9,10 August 2006,"Superslick phony baloney psychic parapsychologist Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox in excellent unapologetically parasitic sleazeball form) has one hell of a novel and effective scam going on. You see, Frank's in league with a motley trio of unrestful spirits -- hot-tempered 70's funky black guy Cyrus (a hilariously hip Chi McBride), sniveling bespectacled nerd Stuart (an amusingly dweeby Jum Fyfe), and cranky, weary, pistol-packin' cowboy old-timer the Judge (a marvelously cantankerous John Astin) -- who ""haunt"" various houses where rich folks reside; Frank arrives on the case and collects himself a bountiful fee for exorcising the unruly ghosts. But lately things are beginning to go awry for Frank: the locals in the sleepy town of Fairwater are starting to catch on to Frank's crafty con, a loony FBI agent (a fabulously frantic Jeffrey Combs) wants to nail Frank, lethal mass murderer Johnny Bartlet (a creepily on-target Jake Busey) and his fragile, sheltered, possibly innocent accomplice Patricia Bradley (beautifully played with touching vulnerability by Dee Wallace Stone) further complicate Frank's already strife-ridden life, and, most ominous of all, a powerfully nasty and malevolent long dormant murderous supernatural entity reawakens from its lengthy slumber to start killing anew. Only Frank knows about this evil thing's actual existence, so he has to go into action to thwart it before it racks up a hefty body count.Director Peter Jackson (who previously gave us the gleefully over-the-top splatterific treats ""Bad Taste"" and ""Dead Alive"" before tackling the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and the ""King Kong"" remake) and co-screenwriter Fran Walsh have concocted one wickedly twisted, complex and inventive fright film scenario, deftly blending pitch-black humor, starkly horrific scares, elaborate, but judiciously applied special effects, a breathlessly speedy'n'steady pace, madly careening and expansive cinematography, a typically lively, jaunty score by Danny Elfman, and an absorbingly tricky and winding surprise-laden narrative into a deliciously dark and unnerving cinematic brew. It's genuinely refreshing to see a horror feature from the mid-90's that isn't specifically targeted for a no-brainer teenage audience, that has the strength of its own grim convictions, that delivers laughs and jolts aplenty without one canceling the other out, that even doesn't punk out at the very end with some weak, pat, everything-gets-neatly-tied-up-with-a-bow wimpy conclusion. In short, this baby qualifies as a true praiseworthy rarity: a pretty recent full-blooded no-nonsense big budget major studio mainstream shockathon that's every bit as smart, spooky and unsettling as any really up to snuff horror movie ought to be.",The Frighteners
8,BA_Harrison,Peter Jackson directs M. J. Fox in this brilliant scary and funny ghost story.,9,12 July 2006,"The Frighteners, Peter Jackson's fifth feature film and the first to have major studio backing, is a near perfect blend of comedy and horror-a mix so many fail to get right but which is nailed right on the head by the Kiwi prodigy.The always superb Michael J. Fox stars as psychic conman Frank Bannister, who, along with his three ghostly pals, makes a living 'cleansing' haunted properties in the town of Fairweather (in reality the 'hauntings' are planned by Frank, with his dead chums doing the spooky stuff).But the people of Fairweather have more to worry about than the paranormal scam artist and his buddies; someone or something is killing the citizens of the small town and no-one has a clue what is going on. That is until Frank witnesses one of the slayings; a supernatural cloaked figure (resembling The Grim Reaper) is behind the deaths and Frank, his three deceased companions, and the wife of one of the recent victims set out to solve the mystery of exactly who or what the killer is.With an amazing cast including horror faves Dee Wallace-Stone and Jeffrey Combs, toothy Jake Busey, and Lee R. Ermey from Full Metal Jacket, Jackson expertly crafts a tense tale of terror, punctuated with loads of funny moments. This film also marks the moment that Jackson started his love affair with CGI, and he pushes the technology of the day to its limits, delivering some truly astounding effects.As the story unfolds, Jackson cranks up the horror aspect, building slowly and carefully to a great finale in which all of the plot threads tie up nicely. The Director's Cut, which I recently viewed on DVD, answers any questions I had when I first saw the film in 1996 and I highly recommend watching this version. The extra 14 minutes of footage really helps, explaining the opening scene and exactly why Comb's character is such a basket case.My only gripe with the whole movie is that there is some inconsistency in the power of 'The Grim Reaper'; at times he seems almost unbeatable, yet when it suits the story, he sometimes appears more easily subdued. But it's a minor quibble, which doesn't stop me from awarding top marks.*** EDIT - 12th May 2019 - After a rewatch, I have decided to reduce my original 10/10 rating to 9/10. It's still a lot of fun, but those CGI effects haven't aged at all well. ***",The Frighteners
9,Quinoa1984,One of the few 1996 horror movies that's above the level of tolerance.,8,24 March 2002,"The Frighteners is really a good little sleeper of a horror film, gruesome in some ways for the die-hard fans (though nowhere near the cult film Dead-Alive, if any film could be that delightfully gruesome), one that has director Peter Jackson written all over it (if at a slightly lesser key, go figure, than the splatter-galore of Dead-Alive). This is really, if anything, a watchable 'popcorn' kind of horror movie, where the humor is raked up in dark devilish, sometimes stupid height, and even when its plot goes into weird gears Jackson and his crew use the special effects for delirious fun and thrills. And it also features a really terrific cast to boot. It gives off such an array of craftsmanship and comedy that it becomes entertaining without being obscene. It's like taking the elements that were so successful in Jackson's previous horror efforts, only this time with a few Hollywood stars (and one outrageously good character actor) and styling of a Zemeckis produced feature such as this is. A tricky mix, but it works pretty well, especially with Michael J. Fox in what is, in fact, something of a change of pace. It also contains a really terrifying- and eventually creepily funny- form of the Grim Reaper. By the way, a genius casting touch for this movie is having Combs, of Re-animator fame, as a nervy federal agent.",The Frighteners
10,BandSAboutMovies,A forgotten even at the time classic!,10,5 March 2019,"Peter Jackson and his partner/co-writer Fran Walsh conceived of the idea for this movie during the script-writing phase of Heavenly Creatures. Robert Zemeckis nearly directed it as a spin-off of the Tales from the Crypt TV series, but he was so impressed by Jackson and Walsh's first script that he decided that Jackson should direct. Universal granted Jackson and Zemeckis total artistic control and the right of final cut privilege.At the time this movie was shot, it had the most complex visual effects ever attempted. Jackson's Weta Digital and Weta Workshop created computer-generated imagery, as well as scale models, prosthetic makeup and practical effects. The studio was inexperienced with computers, which led to an arduous eighteen-month process of creating the film.The long shoot was also because there were several scenes where ghosts and humans interacted, which needed to be filmed twice: once with the alive humans on set and again with the ghosts on blue screen. This called for precise timing from the actors. To make sure the film could make it to the screen in time, $6 million more was given to add more animators to the team.Sadly, The Frighteners wasn't a success. It's a hard movie to classify. It's humorous and full of wonder in one scene, then completely terrifying in others.It's all about Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox in his last big movie role before he went back to TV for Spin City), an architect who loses his wife in a car accident and gains the power to see ghosts. He becomes friends with three of the: Cyrus (Chi McBride), a 1970's gangster; Stuart, a geek from the 1950's and The Judge (John Astin with 5 hours per day of makeup making him look like a zombie gunslinger).The ghosts haunt houses until Frank "" exorcizes"" them for a fee, fleecing people out of their money. After Frank cleanses the home of Ray Lynskey and his wife Lucy, an entity called the Grim Reaper (which looks like something out of Michele Soavi's Cemetery Man) marks Ray as his next victim. Only Frank can see it and he can't save the man. He then realizes that his wife had a similar mark, a number, when she was found dead. Now, the police and FBI agent Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs, who completely and utterly owns this role, a man driven insane by all his work with the occult) are after him, thinking he is a serial killer.After the newspaper's editor attacks Frank in an editorial, she's killed despite Frank trying to save her. The Grim Reaper strikes again, but the police arrest our hero. Now, he's targeted Lucy, who has fallen for Frank. Dammer then kidnaps Lucy, revealing that he was a victim of the Manson Family and we learn that the Grim Reaper is the ghost of Johnny Bartlett (Jake Busey), a hospital orderly who killed twelve people in 1964 before he was caught and killed. He always wanted to be the best serial killer ever - better than Charles Starkweather - and his girl Patricia (Dee Wallace Stone!) is still in love with him and helping him up his number from beyond the grave.Can Frank save Lucy? Can anyone stop the Grim Reaper? The story will go beyond life and death to give you the answers. I really love this movie and watch it at least once every few months, then get sad that so few people dig it as much as I do. Come on, people!",The Frighteners
11,Coventry,Who ya gonna call? Frighteners!,8,23 June 2008,"If you ask me (nobody ever does, of course, but still ) ""The Frighteners"" is a criminally underrated 90's horror effort and the script has at least one terrific trump that distinguishes the film from the majority of all horror-comedies ever made. It's actually funny when it's supposed to be funny and grim, disturbing and unsettling when it's meant to be grim, disturbing and unsettling! The first half  approximately  of ""The Frighteners"" showcases exquisite special effects and introduces a handful of amiable characters, but in fact it remains little more than a forgettable slapstick story about a fraudulent psychic abusing his gift of being able to communicate with the deceased for setting a profitable little business. Yet, unbelievable but true, the tone and intensity level of the film completely flip-flop when the Reaper character enters the scene, and sure enough ""The Frighteners"" turns into a compelling and genuinely macabre horror film with disturbing themes and malevolent new characters. Frank Bannister, paranormally gifted ever since he narrowly survived the car accident that killed his wife, sends his ghostly accomplices out to poltergeist people's houses and then comes to the rescue by cleansing the place with holy water. The residents of Fairwater don't really like Frank, but they have bigger things to worry about since the town is stricken by an alarming and seemingly unstoppable series of spontaneous deaths. Very much against his will, Frank is the only person able to see who's responsible for the supernatural murders and  moreover  to predict who will become the Reaper's next victim. Fairwater's infamous mass murderer Johnny Bartlett escaped from hell and has set his rotten mind to becoming the most prolific murderer in history.Peter Jackson's talent and skilled ability to amalgamate no less than four main story lines (apart from the previous two there's also one sub plot revolving on Bannister being the medium of a couple separated through death and another one revolving on the female doctor trying to get in contact with an introvert woman with a dark past) into one coherent and easy-to-follow horror movie is perplexing, to say the least. Successfully blending horror and comedy elements is difficult enough already, but simultaneously narrating four engaging little stories truly requires the touch of a highly professional director. His script, though co-written by his wife Fran, is well-structured and fast-paced and it's literally stuffed with eccentric gimmicks and character drawings that are often downright brilliant. The supportive character of Milton Dammers, an FBI agent who clearly worked on one too many delirious cases, is almost too fascinating to describe and actually even deserves a whole separate spin-off movie revolving on himself! Another fabulously jaw-dropping character is psycho-killer Johnny Bartlett who  especially during the flashbacks and news archive footage  pretty much represents the embodiment of madness, greed and pure evil. Of course, both these characters owe a lot of their powerful impact to the actors that depict them, namely Jeffrey Combs and Jake Busey.It's typical for my taste to admire and focus the most on the malignant characters, but Michael J. Fox gives a stellar performance as well. In fact, one of his best ever next to the legendary ""Back to the Future"" films. Frank Bannister is finally another character that requires an equal dose of comical charm and emotional depth, and Michael J. Fox provides this balance splendidly. ""The Frighteners"" contains a massive load of impressive special and visual effects that sadly cost a lot more than the film made at the box office. It's most unfortunate that few people opted to see the film on the big screen, as I imagine that's exactly where the stupendous effects are at their most mesmerizing. Danny Elfman's haunting score and the awesome soundtrack (including Sonic Youth and a nice cover version of ""Don't Fear The Reaper) put the cherry on the cake.",The Frighteners
12,hitchcockthelegend,When a man's jawbone drops off it's time to reassess the situation.,8,25 December 2018,"Peter Jackson's The Frighteners is an odd blend of outright comedy and supernatural thriller, if able to get onside with that then there's a whole lot to enjoy. Plot essential has Michael J. Fox as a psychic who really can see dead people, so much so in fact that he has befriended three ghosts and makes a living out of setting up hauntings and charging people to exorcise the spirits. However, things turn decidedly deadly when he encounters a grim reaper like spirit that is killing people and putting a number on their foreheads. It seems there is a serial killing spirit on the loose.Frank Bannister (Fox) is grieving from the death of his wife and he has become a conman, this is an interesting characterisation for Fox to play and he does so with relish. Initially the pic is all about the comedy, with Bannister's interactions with the three ghosts devilishly funny. Ok, the effects work now look a bit crude, but there's a vibrancy on offer both visually and orally.Come the second third the pic shifts into a serial killer investigation and the narrative gets dark. Oh there's still fun in the mix, but Jackson and his team are toying with the very real facet of a celebrity serial killer (ebulliently played by Jake Busey). Trini Alvarado (what happened to her?) is playing what ends up as Bannister's side-kick and love interest and the pair of them are thrust into a frantic final third of a life and death battle with Busey's psychotic spirit Johnny Bartlett. Bartlett in turn is aided by mentally ill Patricia Bradley (horror icon Dee Wallace Stone), while an outrageously over the top Jeffrey Combs is in the mix as a damaged FBI agent intent on destroying bannister and all he stands for.When you strip it down it's a live action horror comedy cartoon, which when you look in context to Jackson's early work is not surprising. It's also not surprising that The Frighteners has become a cult movie of some standing. The bonkers plot, the close to the knuckle humour and choice narrative threads make it a fascinating viewing experience. 7.5/10",The Frighteners
13,preppy-3,Bizarre but fun,8,22 April 2008,"Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) has the ability to see ghosts and is a broken down psychic investigator. His wife died in a car crash and he can't forget her. Also the town he lives in is marred by healthy people falling dead of heart attacks! He meets Dr. Lucy Lynsley (Trini Alvarado) and starts falling in love but then he discovers that the sudden heart attacks are being caused by an evil spirit. There's more to it but that should give you an idea of the plot.This was supposed to be a hit. It was made on a big budget (u can tell), was supposed to be rated PG-13 and was released as a big summer movie in 1996. BUT the MPAA stupidly refused to give it a PG-13 (purportedly the ghosts looked too real) and the R rating hurt. Also it came out the same time ""Independence Day"" came out. ""ID"" was inexplicably a massive hit and this bombed. Too bad. This is a good movie.It's a strange movie--the plot itself is VERY odd but it moves along briskly and director Peter Jackson always has things moving around. The opening sequence alone grabs you. The special effects are superb--even by today's standards. I just sat there stunned by some of them--the ""Soul Collector"" especially knocked me out! The acting is good too. I never really liked Fox too much but I gotta admit he's pretty good here. Alvarado matches him and the supporting cast really has fun in their roles. Jeffrey Combs especially chews the scenery. It does get a little overly convoluted at the end and goes on a bit too long but I still loved it. It's got mystery, horror, romance, some very black comedy--a little bit of everything. Not for all tastes but if you like strange horror comedies pick this one up! Recommended. An 8 all the way.",The Frighteners
14,LeonLouisRicci,Indulgent But Impressive,7,11 August 2013,"This one has received mixed Reviews. It's hard to imagine that anyone could be critical of the imagination that went into this entertaining, if overblown, Movie. It has enough energy and creativity for three Films. But it doesn't know when to quit. It just goes on and on, almost, but not quite, draining the fresh flourishes from the Film.There are Artistic touches that impress and it looks very much like the Cartoony Movies that Jackson had made up to this point. But this may have suffered from too much Zemeckis and too much Money. The Director never needed a lot of Money to make Cool, Off-Beat, and Artistically rewarding Stuff.Just one example, in the opening Scene we see an Evil Entity haunting a Women and it is shown protruding from behind walls and carpets. It is different and diabolical. But it won't be the last time this effect is used. Suffice to say that repetition is the bane of this really good Film.There are Plots on top of Plots and not just in the Cemetery. It could be just a bit too much for some, and yet it is so charming that others may say, give me more.",The Frighteners

There are two versions of The Frighteners available, the original theatrical cut & the obligatory director's cut which runs for just over 10 minutes longer, I will be basing my comments on the theatrical cut. The script by Jackson & associate producer Fran Walsh moves along at a nice pace, it has a decent story with a reasonable twist ending & it doesn't take itself too seriously. I have always liked the character's in Peter Jackson films, he always manages to give them personality & a likability. The film gallops along from one over-the-top set piece to another & as a result the story suffers a little as a few things go unexplained but at least something is always happening to take your mind off it. There's a fair amount of imagination on show, there are some funny moments & one-liners too. I felt the film maybe went on for a little bit too long & I didn't like the overly sentimental & mushy 'happily ever after' ending.I am a huge fan of Peter Jackson's early splatter/comedy films, Bad Taste (1987), Meet the Feebles (1989) & Braindead (1992) are three of my very favourite films & you can see Jackson's playful style here, you can see that The Frighteners was his biggest budgeted film to date & he lets loose on the CGI effects, camera tricks & visual flair. Some of the CGI effects aren't up there with the best on show these days but they're generally fine. He has had to tone the outrageous gore & splatter down from his earlier films which comes as a disappointment, there is a scene in which someone has their head shot off but that's about it. The comedy isn't as gross or offencive either, basically everything that I loved about Jackson's earlier films is toned down for his Hollywood debut which came as a disappointment.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 The Frighteners was a well funded film that flopped at the box-office & looks great with flashy cinematography, atmospheric sets & plenty of special effects. The acting was good, Fox puts in a decent, likable performance.The Frighteners is a good comedy horror, it's not as good as I had hoped as I feel Jackson sold out somewhat but taken on it's own it's a highly entertaining film that's lots of fun to watch. Well worth a watch, it's as simple & straight forward as that.",The Frighteners
16,Boba_Fett1138,A delightful entertaining horror-comedy.,9,8 November 2008,"Before the entire world knew who Peter Jackson was, he had already made some great movies, this one included. ""The Frighteners"" always have been one of my favorite movies to watch, in terms of entertainment, since the late '90's. This is a very underrated and overlooked movie.Horror and comedy is not really something that gets mixed together too often, at least not very successfully. Whenver you decide to do so, it almost immediately turns into a cult movie and not one to take very seriously. There are also however some exceptions and movies that are good in a more serious way but of course not without being entertaining. It's very rarely that both the horror and comedy works out just as effectively in such a movie. ""The Frighteners"" however is such a movie in which both works out great. It foremost is an entertaining movie but also really one with some real good horror in it.The movie uses an amusing concept and some characters that work out comically for the movie. It ensures that the movie at all times remains an entertaining one to watch. However the movie its horror is done- and handled just as professionally. It's a good looking movie with some surprising good early special effects. The special effects in this movie look just as good and convincing looking as gets featured in movies now days. And the special effects do play a big part in this movie. Normally special effects and horror don't form a too great combination but this movie and its horror truly benefits from its fine special effects.It's true that the movie gets more serious and darker as it heads toward its ending though. It shows how difficult it is to maintain a good balance of comedy and horror throughout an entire movie. Still this movie succeeds in that for about 90% of its running time. Still too bad that the more serious second halve of the movie isn't as good as its fun first halve.The movie is well cast, with Michael J. Fox in a good and entertaining movie role. He seems out of place within a horror movie but he plays his character mostly entertaining and as a sort of average Joe, which works out perfectly for the movie and his character in particular of course. The movie also has some other fine and well known actors in it such as Jake Busey, Dee Wallace and Troy Evans. R. Lee Ermey greatly spoofs his own role from ""Full Metal Jacket"" within this movie and Jeffrey Combs just plays one fine classic character, that is totally crazy and over-the-top but very entertaining. He is an actor with a real cult-status within the horror circuit, due to his role in the ""Re-Animtor"" movie and its sequels. It's the reason why he often pops up in a horror movie, in often some small but memorable roles. This one is perhaps his most classic and entertaining movie appearances.One perfectly fine entertaining movie to watch, with some great horror in it as well!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Frighteners
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Somewhat original, with good atmosphere, but ultimately pointless and unsatisfying",5,11 August 2004,"First off, let's get one thing straight; I *hate* Peter Jackson. It seems like everyone thinks he's god because he made the popular LOTR(which I haven't seen, and don't plan to see) films, and everyone forgets how many horrible films he made earlier in his career. I saw fifteen minutes or so of the zombie film he made, Dead Alive, or what it was called, and couldn't bring myself to watch more of that garbage. (Un?)fortunately, I managed to sit through this creation of his, and I can't say I enjoyed it very much. The plot is somewhat interesting, and the idea is fairly original, but it just never really manages to thrill or scare you, as much as it seems absurd and illogical. The films logic is holey and doesn't hold up, even by it's own twisted ""logic"". One scene contradicts the other, and the director does nothing at all to hide this. The acting is somewhat decent, but nothing special at all. The characters are all annoying, tired clichés, especially the ghost characters. Furthermore, half of them seem psychotic, and the other half isn't too likable either. Even the main character comes off as a moron, and a jerk. The special effects are great, no doubt about that, but they are the only positive thing about this mess. Jackson clearly knows effects, and atmosphere, but, apparently, nothing else. The story is reasonably original, but it seems fairly superficial. The killer lacks a real motive, and the film doesn't have particularly many good scares. It's also marred by the lack of interest and care toward the characters. Most of them, you're just happy to see them go. The dialog and humor consists mainly of bad puns and tired ghost/other-world jokes. The writing seems dull, and too much of the humor is just there to gross you out, probably in order to wake the audience up. Some of the humor is plain disgusting. All in all, a decent attempt, but just fails on too many levels, and is, at best(barely) worth watching once. I recommend it to, I guess, Peter Jackson fans, and big fans of horror films. 5/10",The Frighteners

Except that Frank really can see ghosts. But when the ghost of a mass murderer returns, intent on continuing his handiwork, Frank's directionless existence must, of necessity, acquire some focus.This comedy horror film is effective as both. It occupies a pivotal place in Peter Jackson's filmography: Bad Taste showed that he could do good things with limited resources, Heavenly Creatures showed that he had some artistic chops, and now The Frighteners showed that he could be trusted with someone else's money to marshall script, effects, and performers into a pleasing end product. Next stop, obviously, The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, then and now the biggest logistical and financial production exercise in the history of cinema and, then and now, a major financial and artistic triumph.The Frighteners is much smaller scale, of course, but with its own genre, it is a very successful film - exciting, amusing, suspenseful, and somewhat scary.",The Frighteners

Fox, Dee Wallace Stone, Trini Alarado, Jake Busey, John Astin: Enchanting yet disarming visual feast that regards fear from both a human and spiritual aspect. The plot is obviously inspired somewhat by Ghostbusters. Michael J. Fox plays a scheming Ghostbuster who lives with three ghosts and together they scare households while Fox collects money to rid them. Dee Wallace Stone is under guard by her ruthless mother ordered by the court after she was an accomplice in a murder spree. The murderer was put to death but he was known for carving a digit into the victim's head to keep count his murders. His spirit returns and Fox can see digits appearing on the heads of potential victims. Director Peter Jackson is backed by production here that is inventive. He previously made the acclaim Heavenly Creatures. Fox is amusing as a Ghostbuster who mourns his wife and struggles with this new case. Stone steals scenes in her demented state. Jake Busey plays the spirited murderer set to kill again. Trini Alvarado is weak as a woman who lost her husband. She is involved in a shameless scene where she nearly helps Fox commit suicide before reaching a corny happy ending. John Astin plays a gun slinging ghost who provides a little humour.

20,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Far more fantasy than horror but still enjoyable,7,3 September 2013,"Accused of murder, a small-town psychic charlatan learns that his skills in dealing with the deceased are put to the test for real when the murder spree continues despite everything he can do to stop it and must keep the spirit from harming his friends.This here turned out to be quite an infuriating and quite troubling if somewhat interesting effort. Most of this is due to the fact that the film is far more of a fantasy effort that a straight-forward horror effort which is strange considering the subject matter at hand. This is mainly found in the finale at the hospital about the subject being sent into a heavenly arena and all the different after-effects on the body being adjusted to life back on Earth, all this just makes for a rather confusing time being that the main purpose is to stop the rampage of the ghostly figure throughout the town that only he can see and believe, so the sudden influx of mystical elements that this does at the very end makes for a confusing time. As well, the fact that these scenes force the film along far longer than it really should as the lengthy running time here really kills this one in that last section, not only with the sudden influx of fantasy but the mindless need to pay off far more plot- threads than it needed. Overall, this really could've used a few minutes shaved off here by deciding to abandon a few of these plots. That said, there's a lot to like here especially the scenes of the hooded ghostly menace in action, most notably the kinetic sequence in the holding cell where the good ghosts go fight the hooded ghost and take the fight between the walls and they good barreling through the different sections of the room as the humans watch and wait for them to appear and disappear, as well as a couple stellar attacks on a moving car that look absolutely amazing, an ambush in a graveyard and finally the hospital confrontation that makes for a lot of fun, so as an action film and horror film it definitely works wonders. As well, the CGI used is actually well-done and doesn't look cheap or fake at all, and gives the ghosts a fluidity that actually comes off nicely and makes up for some of the other flaws.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",The Frighteners

We have the great effects that we expect from his movies, but the humour that is in the movie doesn't always hit the funny bone like previous efforts, braindead and bad taste. fox is on top form as the con man, and there are some very creepy moments, but one cannot help but feel that Zemeckis had the final say in the editing suite.The ghosts are good, and the best thing about he film, bu it plunders too much toward the end, and although Combs is great at first, he soon becomes annoying circa Chris Rock in the fifth element.The rest of the support is good, and there are good references to other movies, but it feels more like a Hollywood studio interfered movie, rather than Jacksons own pet.",The Frighteners
22,Aaron1375,Just missing something.,7,23 April 2003,"For the most part I liked this movie of a paranormal con man that must use his gifts of seeing ghosts to find the reason behind mysterious deaths in town.  It just seemed to be missing something.  I am not sure what that may be though.  Fox is great in this one as is all the cast, especially Jeffrey Combs who has quite the over the top performance as an agent who specializes in rather weird crimes.  Maybe it is the fact Fox is the one blamed for the murders.  I generally don't care for the hero being blamed for crimes and he does stuff to further incriminate himself.  Not much gore in this one, but this was supposed to be Peter Jackson's big movie to make himself known over here in America.  Unfortunately, he wanted the movie in the fall...the studio though put this one up against the Olympics and then they didn't advertise it very well.  This one starts out more comedy then shifts to a more of an action-horror.  I wouldn't say just horror though as it doesn't seem to be trying to be very scary.  All in all a good movie that is just missing a certain something.",The Frighteners

Director Peter Jackson did a great job directing this film, and Michael J. Fox gives one of his most unusual performances as a ""ghost buster"" who has a rare gift that allows him to see the dead. All in all, a unique film that is very different from its competition in the horror drama and really only falls apart towards the end, when it resorts to the typical slasher ending with plot twists.

25,sddavis63,Ghost Busters Turned Dark,4,13 September 2009,"""The Frighteners"" starts out as a sort of rehash of a ""Ghost Busters"" type of story, in which Michael J. Fox plays Frank Bannister - a guy who has the ability to see ghosts, and who then enlists the help of some local apparitions to ""haunt"" local houses, into which he then comes as the ""hero"" to exorcise the troublesome spirits afflicting the happy home. The ghosts he worked with were kind of fun, and this looked to be shaping up as a silly but enjoyable comedy. Fox did reasonably well with this portrayal of Bannister as a con artist. About halfway through, though, the movie takes on a much darker feel, as it becomes clear that a number of mysterious deaths that have occurred (which we've known about all along but which haven't really been front and centre to this point) are actually the work of the spirit of a deceased mass murderer who was executed for his killing spree in the town years before. Although there's always an attempt to mix some humour in, this part of the story certainly loses the fun and almost whimsical sense that the first half had. My own sense was also that Fox didn't handle the role so well when things became more serious. For whatever reason, Michael J. Fox has never really overwhelmed me as an actor. I enjoyed his work on ""Family Ties"" and thought he handled the ""Back to the Future"" stuff pretty well, but when he takes on serious roles, I find it difficult for some reason to take him seriously. That was the case here, even though his battle against the mass murdering ghost - while serious - was certainly in the spirit of a very dark comedy. There were other weaknesses to the story. I was never able to buy into the relationship between Frank and Lucy (Trini Alvarado.) He came out of nowhere to save her house from poltergeists, and was obviously a fraud - and yet she seemed to fall for the guy right off. There were also a couple of characters who were just too over the top to even be funny - especially Lucy's husband Ray and the FBI agent. It also seemed to be two largely unoriginal plots (the ""Ghost Busters"" type beginning, with an ending that sounds like the basic plot of a horror-type ghost story) joined together to result in an unoriginal movie (although I suppose the idea of joining them together was original.) On the bright side, mind you, there was some excellent work done by the special effects people involved with this. It wasn't a horrible movie in any way, but it really didn't connect with me either. 4/10",The Frighteners

Which, unknowingly for the occupants the trio of spirits that are causing the havoc happen to be part of Frank's scam. Frank manages to communicate and see the dead because of a scarring trauma he had. While, his set-up might be going to plan, the strange deaths keep on rising and Frank starts seeing numbers engraved on peoples' foreheads and one night he encounters a malevolent spirit shaped as the grim reaper who's performing these killings. The town believes Frank has something to do with the murders and a FBI agent is brought on the case and tries at every opportunity to pin the deaths on Frank.Well, Peter Jackson has made a name for himself with his last four blockbusters, but just before those epic films he made this odd ,comedy-horror caper that was aimed for a mainstream audience, but it sadly went by unnoticed, because it just didn't appeal to everyone's tastes. I've seen it a couple of times and I don't mind it, even if the film's all over the shop. The distinctively, novel film is brimming with creative images, oddball bunch of characters, masterfully constructed CGI effects, deliciously, quirky black humour and spontaneous jolts. So, whats not like! Well, despite these great aspects the film feels overly convoluted with many ideas and back-stories that makes the tone shift back and forth in such a unsteady rate. You just don't know what it really wants to be and it just feels like the film feels the same way too. The comical humour and ghoulish horror doesn't always gel, with the first half of the flick being more humorous, then suddenly it shifts gear with the second half going for some fast-paced thrills and shocks, but here Jackson never manages connect the two that successfully. That's not to say I didn't find it amusing, because it is. Its an entertaining caper and an ingenious thought, but it throws around so many paths the film could've taken instead of just fleshing one out and going for it. The meaty script is an complete muddle with many scenarios that only scratch the top of the surface and it seems to just go on for too long. While, the material might have been incoherent, it's Jackson's sharp visual eye that screams at you with the film's stark, Gothic fairytale style. Jackson always makes great use of the scenery and here is no exception with a murky colour palette that has a tonne of atmosphere about it. The twitchy camera-work is always on the move and Danny Elfman's score beats out a spaced out vibe that goes highly strung when the pace picks up. Jackson succeeds in creating around these kinetic aspects, slices of unexpected turns, pumping action and firmly, constructed suspense. But the film's big show stopper is the FX bonanza with it's extravagantly slick effects that shows Jackson demonstrates supreme control in his vision. The glaring getup of the Grim Reaper is the most artistic and forcible of the lot. Though, if you're looking for some gross-out, make-up effects there's none of that to be found and that's the same for any kind of campy nature. This project does seem more colder and distant than that of his previous efforts with the humour side of the things feeding more off the black misery than the goofiness. The film has a great cast on show with Michael J Fox who fits well as the sympathetic lead Frank. Trini Alvarado as Dr. Lucy Lynskey is good too. Dee Wallace Stone is great as the on edge Patricia. Jake Busey is equally good as her evil-minded boyfriend who's back from the grave committing murders. Chi McBride, John Astin and Jim Fyfe play the ghosts that teamed up with Frank and they add to the humour and so does Peter Dobson as the self-assured Ray. But when in frame its Jeffery Combs who steals the show as the eccentric FBI agent Dammers, who's one real nut! Also there's a amusing cameo from R.Lee Ermey mimicking his performance from ""Full Metal Jacket"" as a Sgt. Hiles a spirit of a graveyard.A flawed, but enjoyably agreeable dark comedy-supernatural flick.p.s. This review is on the theatrical release.",The Frighteners
27,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The comedic and horrific are balanced well in this surprisingly dark but inventive fright-fest.,7,16 April 2018,"'The Frighteners (1996)' balances its comedic and horrific elements well, with the picture getting surprisingly dark towards its final act and the mystery that propels its plot forward being a rather interesting and occasionally enigmatic one. There are a number of moments where the CGI doesn't hold up so well, but for the most part the piece still looks remarkably good. It also helps that the world is a uniquely off-kilter one filled with odd-ball characters that are a joy to watch. Michael J. Fox gives his best performance outside of his iconic 'Marty McFly' role, with a turn that's incredibly unique and wholly believable. The infrequent, almost slapstick gory moments add a gritty and darkly funny punch to the flick, too. It does sometimes seem to get a bit too dark for its own good, likely a result of the numerous clashes with the MPAA that resulted in Jackson stopping aiming for the 'PG-13' and going straight for the 'R', but it's arguably a more distinct and compelling picture for it. 7/10",The Frighteners

29,CuriosityKilledShawn,Jackson will never do better.,6,4 July 2000,"I used to love The Frighteners and I was one of the few people who actually saw it in cinemas back in the day. Peter Jackson used to be so full of imagination and potential. He started off doing raw, gory horror films (actually broad comedies) like Bad Taste, Braindead, and Meet the Feebles. The Frighteners was his first Hollywood film, and for better or worse, the first film in which his love affair with CGI seized control of his vision.Michael J. Fox (in his last live-action lead role) is Frank Bannister a psychic investigator/con man with a tragic past who uses his ghost pals to scare people and run a fake ghostbusting racket. His hometown of Clearwater is in the midst of an epidemic in which seemingly healthy people are dying of heart attacks but Frank soon discovers that there is a much more sinister reason behind it and tackles the dark forces before they claim the life of his new love interest.The mystery and plot twists in The Frighteners are all well-written and keep it alive (pun intended) for the entire running time without the slightest lull. I honestly do mean it when I say that this will probably remain the best film in Jackson's career. Yes, even better than those tedious, overdone LOTR movies, better than King Kong, better than...etc.So why the 6/10 review? Believe me, back when I was a teenager I would have given this 8/10 without hesitation, but I just cannot stand Jackson as a filmmaker anymore. For a director who began making gritty, in-your-face horror with practical make-up and special effects he come along way/fallen far from his roots. Nothing this guy does these days is 'real'. Nothing is genuinely there, tangible, in front of the camera. It's all a CGI and fake, and The Frighteners was the tipping point for that particular trajectory. Even the Lovely Bones, terrible as it was, had CGI enhancements all over, even outside of the 'Heaven' scenes. Nothing is REAL with this guy, not anymore! He needs to go back to making movies with a camera, some 16mm film, and a boom mike if he wants to get any respect from me or scrape back any shred of credibility. The generic Danny Elfman score, which sounds like absolutely everything else he's ever done, didn't help either.Universal took a gamble with releasing The Frighteners in the summer season of 1996 (it didn't reach the UK until February 1997, and even then only for about a week) and it was a gamble that they would come to regret. Summer 1996 was an effects filled season with movies like Independence Day, Twister, and Eraser doing huge business. The Frighteners (much more suited to a Halloween release) had a truly terrible trailer, to the tune of Alan Silvestri's annoying Death Becomes Her score, that made it look like a light-hearted comedy. The R-rating was also joke, and a stupid decision. Jackson cut 14 minutes from the movie to lessen the tone but the MPAA still slapped the movie with an R despite the fact that there really, really isn't anything, even in the 124-minute director's cut that warrants such a rating. Plus, the fact that Jackson shot this in rainy New Zealand (doubling as the Pacific Northwest, I assume) meant that a dreary, drizzly, depressing-looking movie fought for box office takings against happy, upbeat, sunny summer movies, and in a year when America was hosting the Olympics too.Bad move, Universal, very, very bad move.",The Frighteners

I'm glad I watched ""The Frighteners"" with low expectations because I ended up really enjoying it.The concept is pretty creative and I couldn't get enough of it. Mixing serial killers with a physical form of The Death is something to dig. Also, the paranormal business Frank Bannister runs was a clever sub-plot. The first twenty minutes of the movie really make you wonder ""what is going on?"" because there isn't a defined main plot situation. Then, the movie starts to get shape and that's when you are totally hooked in. Also, the good f/x and non-sense but witty dialogs really captivate the audience. At first I had trouble with the ghosts physical form; I mean, I didn't like the ghoulish glow. But then I get used to it and I understood that it works perfectly for the movie's tone.The acting is great, great. Michael J. Fox is splendid in his role and he takes it seriously. I dug his performance. Also Jeffrey Combs delivers a fantastic , weird, hysterical performance. John Astin, Peter Dobson, and Jake Busey were also great on their roles. Trini Alvarado is not only beautiful, she's a good actress.Watch this movie with low expectations and you might like it a lot.

I think the reason this film belongs in this category is because it belongs to a subgenre that churns a lot of them out. It's a campy ghost movie with corny effects and a light and airy plot.Peter Jackson, whose Heavenly Creatures is diverting in a completely different way, directs The Frighteners with his tongue firmly lodged in his cheek, knowing the boundaries of cheesy comedy coming head to head with bloody B-list horror and having a natural feel for this mysterious atmosphere that I love and don't get enough of from the movies.And the cast is almost pathologically filled with faces that are notoriously not well put with names. Them, and Michael J. Fox, whose career never scaled on past the 1980s. I think this adds to the charm of this film's coziness.

Jackson's early style tends towards slight goofiness mixed with gore. And for a ghost story that works just fine.I especially enjoyed how Jackson managed to tie together so many separate story elements and make it seem effortless. These are some really weird individual ideas coming together, but somehow it just works.",The Frighteners
35,jtindahouse,Plot Booo-less!!!,8,23 April 2005,"If ""The Frighteners"" wasn't riddled with so many plot holes it would be an even more outstanding movie which is really disappointing since Peter Jackson is such a great a director. Something that really bothers you (if you're the kind of person who cares) throughout the film is the rules that the ghosts have. I think it must have been decided by God, in the movie, that the ghosts could touch living things at any time as long as it was going to make for something interesting to happen. I mean that the fact the ""The Grim Reaper"" could reach through someone's skin and bones but then be able to grab someone's heart and still be passing through the skin and bone. However if you are kind of person who can just put that kind of measly stuff behind them and enjoy the movie (as I wish I could do) then completely ignore this paragraph.The first thing that makes up for the plot holes is the amazing acting this movie contains. It's needless to say that Michael J. Fox is a genius and made this movie about twice as good as it would have been without him. He was entertaining from start to finish. Jeffrey Combs (Dammers) was given a fun role to play and obviously enjoyed it (how could you not) and pulled it off reasonably well. He'll certainly be glad he made the journey down under because it is said that his role in this movie led to his roles in ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""House on Haunted Hill"". The rest of the cast was fairly straight forward acting. At the end of the day there really wasn't any weaknesses in the acting department.The film itself is a good fun movie that would make it hard to sit there with a frown on your face (because you didn't get to see Poke'mon) for the entire 110 minutes. The story line was certainly original enough at the time of release to escape complaints in that department. Peter Jackson definitely made a good claim too for the rights to ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" with this film however I'm sure he would have appreciated the budget he got for LOTR for this film. Certainly don't go and play bowls over watching this movie and let's just be thankful it wasn't made as a 5 minute skit on ""Tales of the Crypt"" as it was originally written to be.",The Frighteners
36,dee.reid,A Great Comic Book Idea,10,25 January 2002,"After a deadly car accident kills his wife, Frank Bannister(Michael J. Fox) gains the ability to see disembodied spirits.  So Frank becomes a con artist and uses his newfound ability to his advantage but at the expense of his customers.  So then he begins to run a highly suspect business in which he exorcises ghosts from people's homes or at least that's what his business card says.  With the help of three ghostly apparitions: Judge(John Astin), Cyrus(Chi McBride), and Stu(Jim Fyfe), Frank is able to run a very successful but suspicious business.  Now Frank's small town is being plagued by several mysterious deaths in which people seem to be dying of what appears at first to be heart attacks.  Frank begins to suspect that there may be higher forces at work here that he is not even sure that he can control.  With the help of a recently widowed doctor(Trini Alvarado) whose husband was one the victims, Frank sets out to get to the bottom of this mystery.This movie has such great potential to be turned into a comic book.  The idea of a guy who can see ghosts but no one else can is a fresh concept that unfortunately is not worked out to its full potential here.  The idea would probably be deeper explored and worked out to its potential if it were to be turned into a comic book or animated television series.  Michael J. Fox is awesome here.  I don't know why he isn't cast into better films.  R. Lee Ermey even does a mockery of one of his past movie roles(Full Metal Jacket) as First Sergeant Hiles, the ghost who runs the cemetery.  Jeffrey Combs is here too as an eccentric FBI agent who comes to town to help with the investigation into the deaths.  The special effects are pretty cool.  The look of the ghosts is pretty tight looking.  ""The Frighteners"" gets a 10/10.",The Frighteners

In order to make himself a quick and easy buck he gets a small team of ghosts to scare residents into believing that their homes are haunted. However, when performing an exorcism at one house he discovers a demon that isn't part of the act and Bannister soon discovers that this demon is killing both the living and the dead. Bannister finds himself having to use his psychic abilities for a good cause and with the help of Dr Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado) and his ghost friends he sets out to try and stop the demon.The Frighteners is certainly a film that I fully expected to enjoy - at least that's what I thought after watching the first 5 minutes. It looked like the sort of film that might have been a daft bit of fun, but for me sadly the sense of fun only came in very short bursts.Initially, the story presents itself as merely a slight re-working of Ghost (only presumably a more fun version), but it expands slightly on this concept as the story progresses. I was unsure when watching this film whether it was intended as a satire or as a comedy horror. Whatever it was trying to achieve it mostly failed as it wasn't well-observed enough to work as a satire, nor was it funny enough or scary enough to work as a comedy horror. The script itself generally lacked any sort of wit and I didn't think that the film flowed all that well - it probably didn't help that I also didn't find the story all that involving. I also didn't think Bannister's ghosts were that funny and to be honest I found them irritating more than anything else.The final third of the film was silly, over the top and utterly ridiculous, but to be fair it did seem to at least bring some fun and excitement to the table which seemed to be lacking for the bulk of the film. Adopting this tone throughout the film wouldn't have necessarily made it a particularly good film or even a memorable one, but it would have at least been an enjoyable one.The only positives about this film are the special effects which were great for their time. R Lee Ermey's cameo in this film is brief but it was easily the funniest and most memorable thing about this film. Michael J Fox is pretty good here and does try to bring some energy to the film, but with so much working against him this always seemed like a lost cause. All in all it's a disappointing film considering its credentials.",The Frighteners

Jackson made an very entertaining film that mixes it with Supernatural, Comedy, Thriller and Horror very well. This was a Box Office Disappointment in the Summer of 1996. The film plays better on Video and Television. But it was a must see in the theater, for it's amazing Digital Effects. Fox gives one of his best roles, Combs steals the show in the film. The movie's supporting cast are:Peter Dobson, John Astin, Dee Wallace Stone, Jake Busey, Troy Evens and R.Lee Ermey.This Review is the Director's Cut for new DVD. Which the film is now 14 minutes longer than the theatrical cut. DVD has an sharp anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an entertaining commentary track from the director from the original 1998 Director's Cut Laserdisc. This new DVD has the same features from the Laserdisc, including the original 4 and ½ hours documentary. Which the documentary also has deleted scenes, outtakes, interviews with the cast and more. The problem with this DVD is a flip-side disc, which one side is the film and other side of the disc is the documentary. The documentary is been trimmed down for the DVD but side A does have the 45 minute long storyboard scenes with commentary by the director. Which is not on side B on the documentary of the DVD. Although be careful with this DVD, since it's a flip-side disc and it could get scratches easily. This Director's Cut adds some funny moments and some character development (especially from Combs character). This is a one of a kind film from the increasingly talented filmmaker-Peter Jackson. Don't miss it. Executive Produced by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future Trilogy). Written by Fran Walsh and the Director. Nice music score by Danny Elfman (Batman, Nightbreed, Red Dragon).

40,Jonny_Numb,it's good...for a while,6,14 February 2003,"""The Frighteners"" is an imaginative variation on ""Ghostbusters,"" a film destined to be lumped in with horror but delivering more (intentional) laughs than scares.  As a matter of fact, the special effects, no matter how well-executed they may be, make a rough transfer to video (none of that early CGI will impress anyone).  The film is generally good--it has the meticulous look of a Tim Burton film, over-the-top, ""Re-Animator""-ish humor, and a cast who's up to the challenge of the generally ridiculous material (Michael J. Fox stands out in an unconventional role).  But, alas, for all the momentum director Peter Jackson whips up in the first two acts, the last section of the movie becomes a series of people running down corridors in abadoned buildings, getting trapped in elevators, etc.  Also, the 'heaven & hell' climactic sequence went too far into Monty Python territory for me to enjoy.  ""The Frighteners"" is OK, but could have been better.6/10",The Frighteners
41,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Fun Ghost Film with some Deeper Meanings,9,23 August 2019,"This is an interesting film that follows a man that can see ghosts after the death of his wife. His life has been derailed since then and he can't seem to move on. The official synopsis is after a tragic car accident kills his wife, a man discovers he can communicate with the dead to con people. However, when a demonic spirit appears, he may be the only one who can stop it from killing the living and the dead.Now this film I checked out, because of one of my favorite podcasters was a big fan and spoke highly of it. I do have to say, that after seeing this I enjoyed it quite a bit. I'm surprised I never saw it as it came out in a time when I was watching horror and it would have been at the sweet spot age-wise for me. The only thing I could think is my father wasn't interested, so I never got around to it. This film actually has a really good story, but I'm not surprised in that it is co-wrote and directed by Peter Jackson. It actually has some dark undertones, despite being part comedy. Interesting enough as well, this film feels like a long Tales from the Crypt episode, which I wasn't surprised when I saw Robert Zemeckis was the executive producer.Michael J. Fox appears as Frank Bannister, who is the paranormal detective. The thing is that he actually can see spirits, but what the people in the town don't know is that he is actually causing the paranormal events to happen. He is doing this through Cyrus (Chi McBride) and Stuart (Jim Fyfe). They are two spirits he is having go into houses for his con-game. Also working with them is The Judge (John Astin). This goes much deeper though that he is depressed at the death of his wife and he's not moving on. What is good for the build-up that while we see him with his con, there are a lot of funerals going on in the background, but Frank doesn't notice at first outside of possible business.There are two stories that are running concurrent with this as well. The first is following Dr. Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado). She is newer in town and goes to visit Patricia Ann Bradley (Dee Wallace). This is the other story as she lives with mother who is controlling. This is because when Patricia was younger she was involved in a mass murder at the hospital, but she claims she had no part in it and was a victim herself. Her mother is not nice to Lucy. She wants to help Patricia, but her hands are tied. Lucy is also married to Ray (Peter Dobson), who has a run in with Frank. The two men have an eerily similar connection as well in that they both are somewhat neglect toward their wives.All the while, there is a Grim Reaper figure that is going around killing people, with a number appearing on their forehead. I thought the look of this creature was good. What it turns out to be was predictable, but I didn't mind that. What I did mind was the comedy. I thought some of it was fun, but I thought it ruined tension at some points. There also were some things that happen in a police station and a car that I don't think could happen, which hurt the story just a bit for me.The film does have some good editing. The film builds tension throughout and I love that the film will introduce plans that soon after fail. It is good writing and with the stakes being constantly raised, it builds up the tension. I also like there are things that are referenced earlier in the film that come full circle later. That is really well done.Acting in this film was really good across the board. I wasn't sure what I was getting coming in knowing that Fox was the star, but I thought he was really good. He fit the persona of the conman well, but I think many of his roles were similar to this we are just not seeing him as seedy normally. He shows some depth to the character that worked well also. Alvarado was good as well. Astin, McBride and Fyfe were all funny in their roles. It was fun to see horror vets Jeffrey Combs and Wallace in this film. Both of them were good. I do really need to commend Combs for how out there he plays this character. Jake Busey was also good in the role for the film as well. The rest of the cast round out the film very well for what they needed.Something that was hit or miss for the film was the effects. Being that the film came out in the mid-90's, the CGI doesn't hold up completely. I thought the look of the ghosts were good. I also thought the Grim Reaper looked good for the most part as well; there were some times where the effects didn't work. The film overall was shot very well though and looked great.For the soundtrack of the film, it was composed by Danny Elfman. I bring that up, because it was great. It does have a Tales from the Crypt vibe here as well, but it fit for what they were going for. It really helps to heighten the tension and I have no complaints. Not necessarily a score that stands out for me to own, but no issues.Now with that said, I found this film to be good overall and quite enjoyable. The story of the film has quite a bit of depth to it and is quite dark as well. The comedy is good at times, but at others I think it alleviates too much of the tension. The film is edited well to build the tension and it never gets boring despite its almost 2 hour runtime. I did think that the ending was a little bit too cheery for my liking though. The acting in this film was really good across the board along with some of the effects that are used, but there were times it just doesn't hold up. The soundtrack of this film is solid. It fit what was needed and helped with the tension as well. This is actually one you could watch with someone who is getting into horror while still being good in my opinion.",The Frighteners
42,Samiam3,"Ghostly goofiness,",7,3 June 2010,"Peter Jackson's the Frighteners is very much a throwback motion picture. It feels like (for lack of a better metaphor) it graduated in the same class as Sam Raimi's Evil Dead, Tobe Hooper' Poltergeist, and Ivan Reitman's Ghostbusters. The production has the look of something that came out of that decade, and personally, I'm fine with it.Although one could also also argue that The Frighteners is a muddled rip-off of all these films (plus maybe a few others) I think it is fairly ambitious. It ain't as funny as it could have been, but the story is frequently amusing, and it builds with every bizarre twist and turn. Sometimes it feels like Jackson is having too much fun, and is pushing the premise a bit. In fact anyone with a short attention span may get lost occasionally, but I will say this for the Frignteners, (and THIS is the important part)...It ain't dull.Ever since the car accident which killed his wife, Frank Bannister (on account of traumatic stress) has had the ability to see ghosts. He has since used this ability to run a cheesy little con business, where a couple of his ghostly friends haunt houses and leave Frank's business card. Once he gets a call, Frank show up a paranormal investigator to fix the mess. Times are currently not so hot for Frank and his buddies, and they are about to get worse. Soon Frank finds himself involved with some not-so-friendly ghosts. Next thing he knows, he is fighting death itself, while being followed by an unstable, oddball fed.The Frighters doesn't work all that well as a horror, but it is pretty successful as a comedy. The recipe requires a lot of goofiness to keep it tasty for a hundred minutes. It is funny in the same sort of way that Scooby-Doo is; not so much laugh out loud, but rather darkly cute or cartoonish. The Frighters is occasionally unstable, but it keeps you going. Though not everyone in the film can act, most people seem to be having a good, time, and more importantly, Peter Jackson, does enough to ensure that we the viewers are having a good time as well.",The Frighteners
43,raulfaust,The Spirits,3,29 January 2014,"You know, there is a strong reason why I find this movie utterly badly done: it starts out of nowhere. The story begins with a bunch of ""spirits"" and a medium talking lots of things. The get go is to messy to make you feel any interest for what's gonna happen next. Besides, spirits play very ridiculous, making you feel like you're watching an ""adult"" version of 1995's ""Casper"". Not only that, but you can also feel like it's a bad parody of the classic ""Ghost"". Given that I found the story utterly boring and it lacked any fun, 50 minutes were enough for me to turn it off, and that's something I rarely do. In the end, I don't know what was the real deal with this film-- or even it had one--, but it just plays bad for most of the time. Maybe it's just a cheap ""Ghost Busters"" wannabe.",The Frighteners

One flaw I guess is that the scary reaper is defeated and replaced with a lesser menace well before the final conflict - I'd reserve the best till last. Also the FBI guy is a bit of a plot convenience.The effects are very good, but one thing that annoyed me is almost every minute is filled with dramatic music.

46,Terrell-4,"An over-the-top romance featuring Patricia, Johnny and big, sharp knives, with a fine Michael J. Fox and lots of special effects",7,15 February 2008,"The room was full. Almost everybody had filled their white styrofoam cups with black coffee and had taken their seats. When I finally got the nerve to stand I felt so self-conscious I wanted to crawl under my chair. ""My name is Charley DeRiemer,"" I finally said, ""and...I...uh...I'm a fan of...uh...The Frighteners."" But I'm disappointed in a lot of it, too. This horror-comedy has too much humor and wit and not enough cheese to qualify as a cult flick. All the film's Computer Generated Flatulence, for me, eventually loses impact. The CGF so clutters up the story-line, which already is complicated, that I think Peter Jackson, the director, must have fallen in love with his computer toys and forgotten there was a story to tell. It doesn't help that while most of the movie is over-the-top funny, the last part sinks into to an old-fashioned scare-um gore-fest without cleverness, just Jake Busey grinning with a lot of teeth and people jumping out with big knives in their hands. So why is this movie so likable? First, most of the time the script is funny and clever. Second, several of the sequences manage to create a great blend of humor, raunchiness, special effects and drama (the funeral and cemetery, the museum party in the Egyptian wing) or a real jolt of dread and foreboding (Lucy in the mansion with Patricia Ann, the beginning of the psychiatric hospital scene). Third, the movie has some fine, grotesque acting that is weird and unsettling (Jeffrey Coombs, Dee Wallace, Jake Busey) or weird and funny (John Astin, Chi McBride, Peter Dobson). Fourth, you can't beat a love story that reaches beyond death into eternal devotion. For Patricia (Dee Wallace) and Johnny (Jake Busey), love is forever and means never having to say you're sorry. Fifth, and to my mind most importantly, it has Michael J. Fox as Frank Bannister. Fox has the personality and star firepower to be able to turn a typical nice-guy character into a man we really like. Fox has been a master in portraying flawed, vulnerable nice guys we almost instantly sympathize with. It's a rare talent. For me, he manages most of the time to overcome the continual show-off intrusion of all that Computer Generated Overkill. The exception is when he's involved with a massive tube to heaven that looks like a Slinky on steroids. When he's on screen, even when he's enmeshed with silly blue-screen aerobics, he makes the film human and grounded. It's a shame Jackson had all that money and all those computers to play with. He didn't really need them. Just watch how he builds dread when Lucy arrives at the creepy old mansion to whisk Patricia away to safety. It's one of the best, most skillful scenes in the movie, and there's hardly a computer effect to be seen until the last of it...when the dread and suspense are swept out and the ""wow"" stuff is swept in. There's a lot of great stuff in this comedy about serial killers, demonic possession and a scamming psychic investigator who brings along his own ghosts. There's a lot to be frustrated by, too. For the most part, I just use my fast-forward button now and them. I do like the movie even with its faults. Now if only someone would make, ""Johnny and Patricia versus Mommy and Daddy,"" featuring the knife-wielding Mommy and leather-suited Daddy from The People Under the Stairs. That would make a tag-team match worth watching.",The Frighteners
47,gizmomogwai,Questions haunt this supernatural thriller,6,8 October 2009,"Ghost stories are a staple of Halloween and I've been reviewing horror and Halloween-themed movies and TV episodes throughout this October. The Frighteners is a ghost story that tries to blend horror and comedy, and it's not a home run in either department, but it's not without some entertainment value. The director is Peter Jackson, who went on to direct Lord of the Rings and King Kong (2005)- though the feel of the film is fairly Tim Burtonish.Michael J. Fox plays Frank, a ghostbuster/conman who can see ghosts and has them haunt people so he can get rid of them at a high price. A ghost of a serial killer, however, is still killing people from beyond the grave and Frank may be the only one who can stop him.Among the things I enjoyed was the special agent, a weird man who thinks others are weird. He tells us a mysterious car wreck story about Frank and gives us the interesting theory that Frank is killing people with his mind- maybe not consciously. Johnny and Patricia make for good, psychotic villains, obsessed with outdoing other famous killers. ""This record should be held by an American,"" Johnny tells Patricia.While I liked the villains, the good guy ghosts just aren't as lovable as they're supposed to be. I also had a number of questions about this movie that I don't think got answered. For one, why do these ghosts work for Frank? They evidently don't like it. What's their compensation? How come ghosts can walk through Frank, but at other times they can hit him (like the soldier ghost does)? How can you kill a ghost? Why is Lucy so trusting of Frank and Patricia? You can't say she's an excellent judge of character because, while right about Frank, she was wrong about Patricia and it nearly got her killed. How did the serial killer ghost avoid hell (or escape from hell)? Was it her mother who hurt Patricia, or did she have an abusive relationship with Johnny? When Frank comes back to life after going to heaven, how did he escape suspicion for the deaths and punishment for the chaos that went on around him? Finally, why bring Frank back to life? Did they just think a happy ending would please people? I would have been fine with him dead, it's not like he was Peter Venkman, and certainly going to heaven wouldn't be a bad fate. Oh well- we can always watch Ghostbusters.Happy Halloween.",The Frighteners
48,ODDBear,Outstanding horror comedy from Jackson,8,11 October 2008,"This movie is probably the reason why Peter Jackson landed the directorial choir for ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. This is, in most respects, an outstanding film.It is essentially a horror spoof but the blend between comedy and horror here isn't always very obvious. While Michael J. Fox certainly gives his role a winning comedic tone the film is chock full of nasty and horrific set pieces that gives full blown horror films a run for their money.I just watched this film a few days ago and I still think the special effects are awesome. And what's more here, they actually enhance the film instead of taking complete charge. My favorite scene is near the end when Fox and Trini Alvarado are in the deserted hospital fleeing from a deranged Dee Wallace Stone where past and present blend together in magnificently eerie fashion. Wonderful special effects realize this scene and it's one of my all time favorites.The cast here is perfect. A sort of change of pace for Fox, who here handles the role brilliantly, showing both his comedic side (which we all love) as well as pulling off some dramatic acting with panache. Others here are top notch as well, particularly Jake Busey as the homicidal ghost who's nearing Ted Bundy in killings. A mention must also go to Jeffrey Combs, here playing a very eccentric FBI man. There are two versions available of this film and in the longer version Combs has some additional dialogue scenes which do make the extended edition well worth the viewing. There are very few films that manage to mix so many genres (horror/comedy/supernatural/slapstick/) and pull it off so well. Hats off to Jackson and this underrated gem deserves better than to be completely in the shadow of his ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.",The Frighteners
49,one9eighty,Dark and humorous supernatural fun.,8,23 July 2018,"Michael J. Fox plays Frank Bannister, a paranormal investigator, after a near-death accident which killed his wife he's been able to see and communicate with ghosts. The small town he's living in in the grips of a plague of death, people are unexpectedly dying, all with the same symptoms of a crushed heart. Fox accidently stumbles on clues which slowly help him piece together what's going on. Along the way he discovers that he's more embroiled in things that he knew. I first watched this in cinema in the 90's, I thought it was great. A fun mix of dark supernatural thrills with tongue in cheek humour too. Watching this about 20 years later I still enjoyed this film. By today's CGI standards and refined productions this does look a little dated but it's still a fun film which has a great story, plot and delivery. Directed by Peter Jackson, this film came at an in-between period, going from low-budget films, via this to bigger epics like Lord of the Rings. He retains his ability to spin a good story - but when you are vested as a writer you would expect a certain narrative drive - which is delivered here. Danny Elfmann's score fits this movie so well, and gives the film a charming feeling - close your eyes and this could be a creepy Tim Burton film - Elfmann has that ability to turn cooky and creepy into charming and be recognised. The cast is great; Fox tries to remain straight while humour is all around - in fact his acting should be commended as he's delivering his lines alone a lot of the time and drives the film forward for the audience; Busey is a fitting nutcase, Coombes and Wallace play oddballs really well too; Alvarado plays the naive Dr Lucy well, a good love interest for Fox mixing clever with delicate - even the cameo's and small parts are done well - I loved seeing R. Lee Emery as the graveyard drill sergeant!I don't think this film got the credit it deserved when it was first released, and I'm surprised that even now it doesn't have a bigger cult following. I've brought it up in conversation before and people look at me with blank expressions. I enjoyed this film when I first saw it and again recently. It's definitely worth a watch; it's fairly family friendly now-a-days; it's in-offensive; it's got a good story; it's clever; and most of all, it's entertaining.

There are a couple of things that do not hang together though. Why can the spirits go through walls, doors, etc but a vehicle that runs into them carries them along? Why did the murderer spirit's hand pass through Lucy's head and then he could punch her and Frank in the face and bodies? How about that FBI agent? Talk about a whack-a-doodle!!

52,carbuff,How I like my horror--light and humorous.,9,10 May 2015,"Fun movie which, as another reviewer commented, seems like it's out of the 80s when it was actually made in the mid-90s, although, for me personally, that is not a bad thing, since I enjoy a lot of stuff from 80s. This movie is a light action/comedy/horror mix and it plays very well with decent acting, production values and special effects. The unusual and pretty unpredictable story keeps moving, and I liked that the horror was not extreme, unlike so much that is produced today. (True horror fans aren't even going to acknowledge this movie as horror, but it's not far short of as much as I myself want to experience.) Whereas I can't really imagine watching this movie at a theater, since it really doesn't have that blockbuster vibe, it is perfect for a slow night at home on a big screen TV with popcorn and a coke.",The Frighteners
53,spookyrat1,"Too Much of a ""Good"" Thing!",6,14 November 2018,"The Frighteners pedigree highlighted by the writing and directorial credits of Peter Jackson and the production influence of Robert Zemeckis is on show for all to behold from the first frames of this would be supernatural horror- comedy hybrid.Like many Jackson/Zemeckis films, it boasts excellent production values, a not untalented cast, appropriate New Zealand locations, an underlying, almost tongue-in-cheek comical thread and a special effects driven narrative.Unfortunately like some of Jackson's earlier exploitation horror comedies, it also suffers to the point of tediousness, of excess. It has excessive plot lines, characters, an almost boring repetition of some sight gags and an overwhelming surfeit of special effects, which detracts from the telling of the main storyline, which by the way, appears to borrow heavily, very heavily indeed, from Jerry Zucker's 1990 Ghost.How many times can we see spirits/demons forcing a misshaping of walls and floors without becoming bored, rather than surprised/shocked? It's really not funny or even remotely amusing when we soon realise that every time Frank Bannister attempts to drive his car, we know he will crash into other parked cars, fences, rubbish bins, phone boxes ...in fact just about anything on the street apart from humans. And really why would we seriously accept that Bannister lives, or is even allowed to live in a house that isn't even remotely built to completion? Again, we are given a lame excuse, which adds little to the narrative thread. Yes, Jeffrey Combs is a well-known figure in ""B"" horror movies. However his completely unrealistic, deranged FBI agent in this movie, adds absolutely nothing to the story and one is left to wonder why he was included in an already overcrowded storyline and cast. One might also question why the near death experience weapon is used predictably more than once, rather than as a singular surprise twist.This is a film, where a little less indulgence and a lot more moderation and disciplined direction, may well have produced a far more polished, entertaining cinematic final product.",The Frighteners
54,aesgaard41,Looks about Right,10,27 January 2001,"Several of the ghost movies that Hollywood puts out are usually pulled right out of thin air and are probably as as insulting as real as they are to the people who made them. This is a movie that shows a pretty good assessment of the relationship between spirits and people, except for two things: ghosts don't haunt cemetaries, they'd sooner return to the places where they were happiest in life and two, the rapport between Fox and his spirit buddies is a little too straight forward. There is supposed to be a little bit of ambiguity. On the plus side, Fox does a wonderful job, as does the lovely Trini Alvarado. Jeffrey Combs is comicly appealing as the psycho F.B.I. Agent and Dee Wallace Stone for-goes her looks to add to her role as the demented daughter. The special effects are above par as they show the differences and likenesses in ghosts, astral projection and place memories. The serial killer back story is tastefully done to give a certain substance and mystery to the top script and remarkable cast.",The Frighteners
55,ajs-10,Interesting...,7,28 June 2011,"I hadn't heard of this film before I got more involved in reading and writing about films. I became interested in the work that Peter Jackson did before he embarked on the 'Lord of the Rings' epic trilogy. So, when I can, I'm slowly going through his back catalogue. This is quite an interesting film with some nice ideas and some really great effects (for its day) but it does suffer from a slightly over-complicated plot and being a little too long. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first.Frank Bannister makes a living as a Psychic Investigator. After an accident five years ago, he can see and speak to ghosts. One of his clients is Ray Lynskey, who he had had a run-in with recently. Just before he leaves, after removing some troublesome spirits, he notices a mystical number on Ray's forehead but thinks nothing of it. The next day Ray is dead. His wife, Dr. Lucy Lynskey, asks Frank to communicate with Ray and from this they form a friendship. More people die and it begins to look like Frank is the culprit, but he claims he's innocent. The FBI even get involved in the shape of, the very strange, Milton Dammers. Eventually Frank and Lucy link it back to a serial killer, Johnny Charles Bartlett, who went to the electric chair many years before. Will Frank be able to stop Bartlett before he claims Lucy as his next victim? Well, you can probably guess, but you didn't hear it from me right.As I said at the beginning, this film does suffer from a rather over-complicated plot. The first-rate special effects go some way to making up for this, but not quite. Having said that, it's still quite watchable with some decent performances; chiefly from Michael J. Fox as Frank Bannister and Trini Alvarado as Dr. Lucy Lynskey. Also worthy of note are Peter Dobson as Ray Lynskey, John Astin as The Judge, Jeffrey Combs, who was really off the wall, as Milton Dammers, Dee Wallace as Patricia Ann Bradley and Jake Busey as Johnny Charles Bartlett. Oh, and worthy a special mention, it was nice to see a small cameo from R. Lee Ermey as Sgt, Hiles.I must admit I did quite enjoy this film, there were many sight gags that I found amusing and the musical score was pretty good too. A very well made film with some decent cinematography and, as I've already mentioned, some excellent effects, both CGI and animatronic. It does suffer though from the very complicated plot and it does seem to drag a bit towards the end, probably because it's too long. Having said that though, it's worth a viewing for some very interesting ideas that you might recognise from Jackson's later works Recommended.My Score: 7.1/10",The Frighteners
56,rebeljenn,A little comedy/romance and less gore in the average horror film,5,3 August 2005,"The Frighteners is one of the best horror films I have seen, complete with a little comedy and a decent storyline - the film itself is engaging and interesting, and it's paced well throughout. On top of the engaging plot and the conflicts and twists between the characters, the computer graphics are very good and believable.This is the perfect film for those of you who like a little romance and a little comedy and less of the gore/horror that many films in the genre have. Acting, cinematography, and pacing is done very well, and this is the type of film easily watched during some autumn evening. (My rating: 5/10.)",The Frighteners
57,Ben_Cheshire,Black comedy with Michael J Fox front and centre makes for terrific entertainment.,9,20 July 2004,"Frank Bannister (Michael J Fox) is a psychic investigator who preys on the families of the recently departed.This was the movie where Jackson first put his skills to something beyond novelty films. Its still horror comedy, but here its also resounding entertainment with great characters.Its one of a small class of movies I can put on at any time, and many times over, and enjoy it.I can't express how great it is to see Fox on a movie screen again, in a lead role, having an absolute ball.

58,kuarinofu,A little too much creativity,7,28 April 2018,"I love getting back to the movies I've seen as a kid. You always find something new, something good or bad, some missed details, hidden messages and stuff.
After watching this approximately 20 years after the first viewing I feel a little confused. It was interesting to see early Peter Jackson, see how some of his visual ideas have evolved, his love for cameos and stuff. It's interesting to see what changed inside him and what remained the same.
This movie is a lot of things, it's very tonally different and this is one of the good things it has. However, this kind of draws the focus out of this movie. It drops additional plot lines half-way, forgetting about some characters and situations, introducing others and not developing those either.
It keeps you wanting to see more, but never gives you enough to fully enjoy the moment. Starts like a Ghostbusters like movie, boom, now it's a comedy with bizarre characters, boom, now it's an action adventure, boom, now it's a drama about life and death, boom, it's a serial killer thriller...
I'd still recommend you give this a try if you love cross-genre movies, 80's horror comedies , Ghostbusters and Michael J. Fox. It will, however, disappoint you at times, as well as leaving with a rushed unsatisfying ending as well.",The Frighteners
59,tomimt,Fast paced and enjoyable horror comedy,8,14 June 2007,"Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) is a con man, who ironically enough is the real deal in his business: He uses real ghosts to scare people in order to get them to pay him the ""clening"" of their apartment. When he arrives at the home of his next customers he sees a strange glowing number in the forehead of Ray Lynskey. Soon enough he witnesses how another man dies horribly in a restaurant bathroom, when a ghastly figure squeezes the mans heart. The man of course has the same number on him and Bannister realizes he's the only one who can see the ghost and stop the killings.'The Frighteners' is almost a prime example of how to do an action oriented, fast paces horror comedy. The movie moves constantly and doesn't give the viewer a change to doubt what he sees, which is always a plus whit this kind of a story. The direction is a fine statement of Peter Jackson's skills, in both, action and comedic timing. The dramatic elements of the story are, while a bit clichéd, nicely written and they give Bannister more depth than usual in this kind of a film. Also the soundtrack is very good and Danny Elfmans music fits in very nicely.Special effects are very good considering when the film was done and what is the budget of the film. There also is great attention to detail in the movie, especially in the flashback scenes taking place in the 60's and when we see a glimpse of old grainy news footage showing Bartlett (Jake Busey) killings. The acting is also good all around. Michael J. Fox does one of his best roles as Bannister, reaching depths I didn't know he even had. Other nods to John Astin from his role as ghost Judge and Jeffrey Combs, whose FBI detective Dammers manages to be so twisted and paranoid, that he looks like he'd escaped from a Lynch movie.The Frighteners is a good movie, but it does require some amount of check your brains at the door attitude. If you start to think it too closely, it might lose a half of its charm.I give it my recommendation.",The Frighteners
60,LebowskiT1000,"Good fun, excellent film.",9,17 October 2002,"I thought this film was fantastic.  The story is entertaining, the characters are awesome, the special effects are spectacular, and the comedy is hilarious.  The only complaint I have about the film is some of Peter Jackson's camera work.  He loves to zoom in on people's faces very quickly, drives me nuts!  He didn't do it in Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, thankfully.The cast is fantastic in the film.  Michael J. Fox pulls off an excellent performance as Frank Bannister, a very likeable and interesting character. I had never heard of Trini Alvarado before she'd done this role, but I will forever remember her from this role.  Peter Dobson did a great job in the film as well and was quite funny at times.  Jeffery Combs played a very strange character, but nonetheless, did a great job with the character.  Dee Wallace-Stone, Chi McBride, Jim Fyfe, John Astin and Jake Busey were also great.This film is basically a comedy/thriller with super-natural/paranormal themes to it.  So if that sounds like a film that interests you, then by all means, go see it!  If you do see it, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",The Frighteners
61,SkullScreamerReturns,Quite good horror comedy but maybe not for everyone,6,10 June 2021,"This movie is a bit difficult to describe because I felt like it has a lot of different kind of elements. It starts with a bit more comedic style in the vein of Ghostbusters or Casper but then occasionally adds more horror and intense action. This kind of changing of atmospheres made it a little bit puzzling experience. I think I liked the comedy moments more, and there was a little bit too much of too serious action towards the end.A lot of good ideas and cool scenes. My favorite was maybe when there are people fighting and ghosts fighting at the same time at the graveyard. That was new!The special effects are a bit funny looking by nowadays standards because it's the 90s early computer effects. But it's also charming because it was so experimental. There was no golden standard, so I think Peter Jackson and his team let their creativity flow when they invented new kind of effects. Even though it's a much cleaner film compared to Jackson's early splatters, you can still sense his adventurous attitude.I watched the Director's Cut version which is longer, and I think the shorter version could have been better for me, unless it's missing some good parts. Two hours for a horror comedy is a little bit too much I think, especially when the plot here is quite a rollercoaster. If you like movies where the plot is full of twists and a lot of stuff going on all the time, then you might like it. I was left with a little bit dizzy feeling.Worth checking out but not my personal favorite.",The Frighteners
62,PyrolyticCarbon,"A cleverly combined story of horror, thriller and comedy with great performances",8,30 December 2000,"This is quite an unusual movie as it manages to play out over a number of styles all the while managing to keep each unique style intact and not suffering on either one.There's a lot of comedy, undoubtedly, but there is equally as much darkness and the real feeling of death, personified in the ghostly Death like apparition. Also, apart from the stock love interest story there's real humanity with Michael J. Fox's character whose wife has died and his whole world has collapsed around him leaving him as a pretty despicable character.With all these threads going on, mixing the humour and the blackness together you would think that something wouldn't work out. However the strands compliment each other and manage not to make the movie too much of the other and providing a very entertaining dark film.Fox is excellent, and it is this very despicableness that makes him work in the role, I don't remember ever feeling this way about him, and it's only at the end of the movie that the Fox persona fits the character in the stereotypical way. His trauma over his wife and the beaten character, best identified in the broken and unfinished house, takes you away from the comfortable realms of the traditional Fox role and lets you see a better side to his acting. His character will lie, cheat and even then just get by at it to extortion money out of people, he even uses the Ghosts that aide him as nothing, not even the dead, matter to him at the beginning of the movie.The character played by Jeffrey Combs who is not only devilishly funny, but also so disturbed and off balance that he makes you laugh and then shiver with disgust straight after.This combined with the interweaving of comedy to darkness makes this movie an excellent film to watch, and pulls you in to the movie taking you from laugh to uneasy dread to just plain freaked out throughout. It carries just the right level of each, inter-playing them when the audience needs pulled back before they are taken too far. An excellent movie to watch, with wonderful skills of storytelling combining thriller, horror and comedy with a most enjoyable cast.",The Frighteners

Three funny friendly ghosts talk to him regularly, hang out in his house & ride with him in his car. He's good friends with them & they help him drum up business. You see Michael advertises that he can rid a house of ghosts. When someone calls him thinking their house might be haunted he brings his ghosts with him on the first visit. The ghosts help Michael J. Fox by haunting the house while he's checking it out & writing an estimate. By the time he's done the owner is begging him to come back at any cost! It's really funny. The DVD is better.

66,curtis-8,First Half is Classic & Inventive. Second is Overstuffed and Confused,5,18 January 2018,"I just rewatched the Frighteners years after having seen it in the theaters. I remember being disappointed when I left the theater way back in the day. But I thought I'd give it another chance. I enjoyed the first hour immensely and figured that has misjudged the movie all these years. Then the second half kicks in and the whole thing devolves into a mess of too many characters, too many ideas (there is such a thing in a story), and too much frantic, teen-minded violence. Part of the problem is the change from strictly spooky stuff to the more ""serial killer"" tropes. It turned on a dime from a clever twist on ""GhostBusters"" to ""let's joke about slicing people up."" The tonal shit was jarring for me. 
Another part of the problem was the performance of character actor Jeffery Combs. Don't get me wrong--he is GREAT in the film, like a uber-creepy, coked up Tony Perkins. It is such a vivid characterization, so bizarrely powerful, that it throws everything off--he's just too crazy, intense and interesting to be the plot device his character is. He deserved his own movie. As it was in this one, though, the point where his character takes center stage also marks the point where the film starts to collapse under its own weight (especially considering he is neither the hero or the real villain). Anyway, the set up of the Frighteners was SO good. It's too bad the punchline was such an overwrought mess.",The Frighteners

Fox puts down a fine performance as a psychic detective but the best performance comes from the freaky ""Mulder"" FBI agent Jeffrey Combs,his role and dialogue plus his facial expression a truly Jackson style.It reminded me quite a bit of several ""Braindead"" characters.There is also a hilarious performance by R.

A severely overlooked film.,8,25 September 2009,"A surprisingly dark and exiting movie that starts out as a comedy but turns into a well written thriller. In the start you get a bit of that 90's comedy feel and it reminds you slightly of Casper. But as the movie unravels it turns into a very dark comedy/thriller. I must say I'm surprised I've never seen this before now, also it was Peter Jackson's last film before his success with lord of the rings.Also the fact that Michael J. Fox has the leading role may make some people believe this won't be a serious film, well there they're wrong. Michael J. Fox's performance in this film was excellent. Funny thing I was watching ""Back to the Future"" when I noticed this on another channel and it quickly got me interested.Basically it's about a man called Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) who after a car accident gets the ability to see spirits. He decides to make a living out of it and uses his ghost friend to scare people then he ""exsorcise"" them and earn money. But soon people start dying for seemingly no reasons and he stars suspecting a spirit that somehow can take lives. His only lead are a bunch of mysterious numbers that appear on the future victims head, but which only he can see.

The movies plot is Michael J Fox's character is involved in a car crash in which his wife is killed, after the crash he is able to see the spirits of ghosts. To make some extra cash, he gets the ghosts to frighten people then he performs an exorcism for a fee. Soon deaths start occuring in the area which are very similar and linked to his wife's death (numbers carved into the foreheads). The finger is pointed towards Michael J. Fox. But the real serial killer is is trying to kill as many people as he can, and the only way he can be stopped is by Frank Bannistor.(Michael J Fox) There are a few twists and turns here and there that keep the excitement going all through the movie. There are great special effect used through out this movie, especially with the ghosts. Like all Peter Jackson's films, comedy is present which makes the film so much more enjoyable.

The movie is kind of a scary horror comedy and it is as funny as it is scary. My favourite part of the movie is when R.

77,steeleronaldr,Not quite a perfect 10,8,31 March 2021,"This is a very entertaining movie with some very interesting characters indeed. For one side you get the time and again characters. Michael J. Fox as Frank Bannister isn't that interesting in fact it's almost like he's again playing Marty Mcfly. Sure Marty Mcfly was good in Back To The Future but this isn't that movie. To me he's a one trick pony who's strained every ounce of likeness out of the Mcfly thing. In this movie he had a great opportunity to play someone more interesting but failed to do so. The same with Jake Busey, yeah he can play a villain and does a great job hear but again he plays the same type endlessly. Dee Wallace Stone on the other hand had a field day with her character, the innocent Patricia Bradley or isn't she as innocent as she proclaims. Jeffrey Combs also has a field day as a over the top FBI agent out to prove Frank Bannister a fraud and that he's guilty of his wife's death. Bottom line here is while we get some overused characters we do get some new ones.The premise of this movie was actually original for a change. A ordinary guy who gain's a psychic ability after his wife's death after a car wreck. His assistants are two souls a nerd and a pimp who helps proclaim him power's. We get a little comedy, drama, suspense and horror all in a great story. Each character could have shined but only a handful do, sadly Michael J. Fox doesn't. Still he manages to deliver the goods at a descent pace and still keep it interesting.A ghost hunter who uses his two assistants to get the unsuspecting to hire him to rid of ghosts. A reporter who believes in him while her husband feels differently about. Patricia Bradley's mother who warns those who tries to speak to her. Patricia Bradley who's haunted by her cereal killer boyfriend and Johnny Bartlett (Jake Busey) returns to continue his bloody acts of death. All together they form a interesting story which never gets the full treatment it deserved.The effects, the stunts, the costumes and the plot are the real star's here and they outshine most of the cast. Somehow by the end it feels like the entire cast is ready to call it a day. Most of the characters starts to get boring and the gags start to seem overused to the point where they become predictable. I love this movie but only for the story it tells. I would love to see a remake where other actor's play these role's and see if they can livin' up the characters.Not to criticize myself, it is a good movie for a boring night but for being Michael J, Fox's last movie should have been much more better.",The Frighteners

From the humour to the special effects to the dialogue, everything about this movie really just clicks. It's too bad that when released in the summer of 1996 against the juggernaut known as the summer Olympics, the film failed to find an audience. Thankfully it did find enough of a home on video and the success of its director has led to a DVD release that will hopefully bring new fans to the film. Fans can spot the director as a multiple piercing punker, and revel in great scene chewing roles by Dee Wallace Stone and Jeffrey Combs. Supposedly, Melanie Lynskey is to be seen in a cameo roll as well, but I have never personally seen her there.

Fox does scary!,7,12 September 2020,"We caught this last night when flicking through channels and Shell loved this when it first came out and I remember being terrified by it, but also really enjoying it. Michael J. Fox is and always will be a legend of an actor and this was a departure for him at the time. Normally he was involved in family friendly comedies or action films, but this and The Hard Way was his venture into more adult fair and proved that he was more than capable in any genre of film.Admittedly it has lost some of the scare factor, I think as viewers we have become more immune to these types of films as film companies are able to up the horror through modern CGI, but still Jake Busey makes a great serial killer and his movements through walls and objects can still be unnerving, but it is Mr Fox and his likeableness that makes this film, you put such a likable actor is a dangerous situation and as a viewer you cannot help but be worried for him.
This is definitely worth catching again, it might not be as a scary but is very much up there as a good film. Not The Frightener but The Worriers would be more appropriate, a 14/20 for cast and nostalgia.",The Frighteners
82,mcca-62051,Um Ghost Busters with Marty?,6,12 October 2020,"The movie has so great characters and story. I enjoyed seeing Michael Fox be the paranormal type guy to get rid of ghost. Like my title its GhostBusters with Marty McFly together. I found the backstory of why his character is in the job he is was well done. The movie was very goofy at times, and I had the impression that the special agent could have been casted for Jim Carrey. Based on the film poster I expected to be more creepier. The movie has many twists and turns to develop the story. Overall a decent movie.",The Frighteners
83,ToldYaSo,Can't deny this film's strong appeal,8,20 July 1999,"Something keeps drawing me back to this film. I truly can't put my finger on it. But it's not really a ""guilty"" pleasure. I finally caved in and bought the video when after having already rented it twice, found myself wanting to see it again. And no one's more surprised than me. I must've seen it five times by now.Michael J. Fox teams up again with ""Back To The Future"" director Robert Zemeckis. Sounds like a winning combination. And it is. But something didn't sit well with the masses. Promoters didn't know how to run with the ad campaign, which I think hurt its performance.I know the film was a bit of a box office disappointment, but that doesn't mean it's not a good film. It's an original treatment of a black comedy/adventure/horror. OK, so maybe that's its problem. This film suffers from the ""too-many-categories"" syndrome.It does have some funny moments, but they're not knee-slappers. It does have some horror elements, but they're not bone-chilling or terrifying. Its most common theme or state is that of mystery chase.The special effects are top notch and not over emphasized to the point of nausea. They are used throughout the film to enhance the supernatural setting the film is set in. It's another strong example of how computer animation has taken filmmaking to another level where almost anything is possible, to the benefit of an awestruck audience. But who knows, in a decade or so, these may be regarded as crude, low-grade, parlor tricks.This was a post ""Gump"", pre ""Contact"" effort that is the recipient of at least the same care and effort of the other two. A signature of Zemeckis' films of late, where attention to detail seems a high priority. Of course, like any other film in history, there are flaws, but in my opinion they are forgivable. Spoiler guidelines prohibit me from elaborating, but unless you're really critical of films, you will probably miss it. Any film of supernatural subject matter should be given a certain amount of artistic license.Basically, ""Frighteners"" is fun to watch, fast paced and has something for everyone, but it must've failed on some level for some people. I've recommended and loaned this film to a number of friends who've enjoyed it. Their responses were not too emphatic, but they enjoyed it nonetheless. I know what you're thinking, and I believe they'd tell me if they didn't like it. At least, I hope so anyway.I guess all I can say is, if you were thinking about seeing it, or maybe just in the mood for something different, then give it a shot. You could do a lot worse. But don't take my word for it. See for yourself.",The Frighteners
84,wbhickok,Not Peter Jacksons best,6,20 September 2001,"The main reasons I rented this movie were the facts that it was directed by Peter Jackson, and that Jeffery Combs and R. Lee Ermey were in it. And, while they were both great, the rest of the film is kind of a let down. The over use of computer enhanced special effects was annoying, and MJF seemed to be uncomfortable in the lead, even though it was interesting to see him in such a different role than he usually plays. But still, rather tame for a Peter Jackson flick.",The Frighteners

86,rams_lakers,I'd see it again,7,28 September 2004,"Horror, fantasy and comedy, 3 of my favorite movie themes. No wonder I enjoyed seeing the Frighteners on video back in 1997. I also like Michael J. Fox, so this movie couldn't lose for me unless it was really awful.I wouldn't suggest this for some, though. I was watching it with a girlfriend who let out a few frightened shrieks when the reaper kept popping up. I had to look at her to make sure she was serious....she was. Though to be more sympathetic she did have a real life ghost experience before.If I have to say one bad thing about the movie it's that the reaper guy looked a little fake at times, but I'm a graphic artist who sees that stuff occasionally.And a few words to those attention seeking anti-Peter Jackson/LOTR idiots, get over yourself. Placing that stupid, lame Pulp Fiction (I walked out of that one) ahead of LOTR reveals what a moron you truly are. Frighteners gets a minimum 3 1/2 out of 5 stars from me.

88,dorotka24,Loads of Fun,8,25 October 2007,"I was pleasantly surprised by my enjoyment of this movie the first time around, and it was just as much fun on the second viewing. Unusually for Peter Jackson, the man behind such gross out over the top gore classics as ""Bad Taste"" and ""Dead Alive (Braindead),"" it is light on blood, relying more on its action, humor, and great performances.Horror fans will appreciate the key roles, not just cameos, from veterans John Astin (Gomez from Addams Family), Dee Wallace, and Jeffry Combs. It was refreshing to see Michael J. Fox play a character that is different from his typical typecasting. R. Lee Ermey even shows up to parody his role from ""Full Metal Jacket!"" I really can't think of anything bad to say about this movie. It was so much fun and such an original concept that its flaws are easy to overlook. Go rent it and have a blast.",The Frighteners

Fox in any type of horror films. The idea of the movie was Fox's character could see, talk and interact with the ""other side."" I guess this could be a good thing! Later on in the film, the woman who he falls in love with, has to ""temporarily"" kill him to go after the ""bad guy."" In order to save him, she freezes him and tells him she has to bring him back within a few hours. I really liked the effects. It kind of reminded me of the movie ""Ghost"" with Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg. That movie was pretty similar to this one I thought.",The Frighteners
90,charlietuna,A solid cross-over film,7,28 May 2001,"With this effort, Peter Jackson cemented his reputation as being a versatile director.  Yet, as is the case with any cross-over effort, those who remain true to the genre will be disappointed.  Lets face it, by the time Elvis Costello started working with Burt Bacharach he pretty much sucked.  Thus, those who felt Jackson was king after ""Brain Dead"" may have been let down by this big budget effort. Still in my view, this was a credible horror/comedy suitable for funding by MCA.  Just like a Costello pop song, Jackson gave us enough quirky characters, and intelligent tongue in check humor, to smooth over the boy meets girl happy ending. This deft handling of the big budget dollars and his effort in ""Heavenly Creatures"" ease my fears that someone other than Terry Gilliam is directing the ""Lord of the Rings"".  Worth a look, especially if your too squeamish to find humor in gore.",The Frighteners
91,MidnightWarrior,Could have been scarier,7,26 December 2005,"This film is very enjoyable. The visuals are pretty good (if not stunning), the story is delightful and the cast and crew did a fantastic job on this film.My only complaint is that it could have been scarier. It hardly deserved the R rating it received. Also, I didn't think the lady who played the female doctor was appropriately cast. Nevertheless, she did do a good job.There are small instances of humor in the film which make it almost something of a comedy than a real horror, suspenseful picture. Also, the cover shot of the film doesn't make any sense.All in all, I'd say this film could have been more ""frightening"" but is not a bad film to watch. 7/10.",The Frighteners

I was younger and had a very vivid imagination so it scared the hell out of me. Today I went back and re-watched this movie I have not seen since then and while my imagination is still vivid, I respect the movie now because of it.The movie starts off I would say 80/20 Comedy/Horror. You get to see the shenanigans that MJF and his two ghost cohorts pull off. Watching the transformation of his character as he slowly realizes that he's up against more then he thought. The story develops unbelievably well. The characters (living and dead)are well thought out and brought to life, with such great enthusiasm it's amazing. The story evolves slowly and dramatically, each minute bringing more and more to the story.The acting is amazing. MJF, awesome. Playing both the con artist, and then the hero. Jake Busey pulls of crazy well, but then again he is his fathers son. The CGI I think is pretty awesome for the time. The grim reaper shots, still give me the creeps.Over all I have a love for this movie that makes me want to keep watching it again and again.",The Frighteners
93,januaryman-1,Fun and frenetic,8,5 September 2013,"The Frighteners is a fun little movie from the mid-90s. It has an pleasing mix of stars who hit their stride in the 80s (Fox,Wallace, and Ermey) and others who count this as among their first works (Alvarado, Busey, McBride). It is an odd mix of horror and humor from Peter Jackson and had state-of-the-art special effects for the time.The Frighteners, filmed and produced in New Zealand, was the biggest special effects movie made at that time outside the Hollywood movie base. It made extensive use of blue screens and had over 400 computer-enhanced special effects. Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh wrote the script and Jackson directed and produced the film.The Frighteners has an overall tone of whimsy but also has some impressive horror movie moments. The Danny Elfman score fits the movie perfectly. Frank Bannister, played by Fox, is a widowed psychic investigator exploring supernatural goings on in a placid rural town. Newcomer Alvarado plays his romantic interest. Veteran actor John Astin plays a ghost called The Judge who has seen his better days. Ermey plays drill instructor (go figure), Sgt Hiles, who is in charge of the local cemetery. He has several lines and a general demeanor that pays homage or satirizes (depending on your viewpoint) his character in 1987's Full Metal Jacket. Jake Busey plays a good bad man, and McBride plays a funny role as Bannister's ghostly aide.The Frighteners is amusing, frightening, entertaining, and a bit exhausting. It is a great Fall or Halloween movie.",The Frighteners

96,jimboduck,Please see this movie. It's damned good.,10,19 January 2005,"THE FRIGHTENERS is a movie directed by Peter Jackson, who has had his fair share of designing blood and guts. Here he dabbles with a horror-comedy genre with Michael J. Fox, an already established sci-FBI-horror icon. What is the result? More focus on the CGI!

97,bujinbudoka,The Frighteners,8,24 January 2006,"This movie focuses on Frank Bannister (played by Michael J. Fox), a troubled architect turned paranormal investigator, who, years before was involved in an accident which leads many to believe he murdered his wife after an argument. Living in an unfinished house of his own design with several ghosts, including John Astin as a wild-west cowboy called ""The Judge), Bannister scratches out a living taking down the very ghosts who work for him, through having them ""haunt"" the unsuspecting populace.His job takes a horrible twist, however, as he begins to see numbers on the foreheads of the town-folk, beginning with his love interest of the movie, Dr. Lucy Lynski (Trini Alvarado), and her husband, Ray (Peter Dobson.) After investigating their home for spooks, he sees the number clearly on his head. The next day Ray drops dead from an apparent heart-attack, even though he's a health nut. This, in addition to the local newspaper editor dropping dead after meeting with Bannister, leads the public to suspect him as a murderer, and setting a troubled special agent on his heels, Milton Dammers (played magnificently by Jeffery Combs, of Re-Animator fame.) His casting in this movie is reason enough to see it. And you've got to see the scene with the inflatable dough-nut...it practically defines the character. Think Monk meets Frank Drevin of Police Squad.Through many twists and turns, however, Bannister and Dr. Lynski eventually find the source of the murders, stemming from a decades long relationship between a young girl (Dee Wallace Stone) , and her late boyfriend (Jake Busey). As it turns out, Death is taking an extended break, and Busey's character is taking charge, with horrible results.All in all, the movie is great, with few things needed to make it perfect. Its one of those movies I had a fun time watching, and could watch again and again if I wanted to. I give it an 8 out of 10 stars. If you haven't seen Peter Jackson's American movie directing debut, then watch it. You won't be disappointed in the least.",The Frighteners

It quickly falls into formula and becomes quite predictable. There is also something just a bit off about all the characters, as it's difficult to find one likable enough to identify with. I was never able to get anchored in the story. Maybe it's because the New Zealand as America scenery is unsettling.",The Frighteners
100,mylucylumpkins,Frighten-ingly Disappointing,4,7 September 2014,"This film did not live up to it's hype or its potential. I missed it's initial release and just watched it very recently, having heard of it for years and really buying into the hype, I found that there just wasn't really much to it. The main issue I have is that it is not successfully horror or comedy. The over the top and sometimes slap-stick comedy was ridiculous. There was not a single point in the film when I felt the urge to laugh out loud. As far as horror, there really wasn't much. Of course there were ghosts, put they were more or less just characters in a murder mystery. My next gripe pertains to casting. Michael J. Fox was the only person considered for the role, and for obvious reasons. He does good with the slightly self deprecating roles. The audience finds it easy to sympathize with his characters because he portrays them slightly pathetically. Also, I have issue with Dee Wallace. Peter Jackson has said that she was cast because of her overwhelming sense of innocence, especially recently coming off of E.T., unfortunately that effect is lost with the years. She is now a major player in numerous B-Horror films, roles which I identify her from more so than E.T.. It is more that E.T. was the exception and roles like Patricia Bradley are the norm. As soon as I saw her I thought to myself ""she is in someway responsible for all of this."" Moving on from casting there are the obvious issues with the special effects. 1996 was a big year for special effects and CGI releases, but this one really missed the mark. If you look at other films released around the same time (Independence Day, Twister, Mars Attacks), although they are not perfect, they are a whole class better than the the effects from this one. CGI shadows didn't match the direction of the light source, the main threat was just a blanket of muddy CGI, and there was no real quality threshold for the ghosts, they really varied from one to another. The last and most apparent fail was the title. I get the\at he has the ghosts that work for him (although their compensation for their services is not readily explained) and the are frighteners because he uses them to haunt potential clients. That being said, they really took backseat to all of the other story lines of the film. The title makes you expect things that the film is not going to follow through on.Although I did not care much for it and it did not meet my expectations, I was not bored while watching it, which counts for something. It was entertaining while it was on, though I doubt I would watch it again. The best thing about the film was cameo of Peter Jackson looking absolutely hilarious.",The Frighteners
101,Adec,Great fun all the way...,8,1 July 1999,"'The Frighteners' is a superbly directed, supremely offbeat horror comedy that has a style and demeanor all it's own. Director Peter Jackson's visual sense is in full flight here and his direction on this film is nothing short of superb, with some truly inspired set pieces that he gives his own distinct visual punch to, creating a truly unique and quirky atmosphere that belies his obvious vision, talent and love of the subject matter.The script, by Jackson and his wife Fran Walsh, is both strikingly original and brilliantly clever, with dashes of the truly inspired mixed throughout along with Jackson's trademark kooky weirdness. Add to this some truly impressive FX that really helps to bring everything to life (so to speak), with some of the creations being particularly inspired, such as the design and movement of the Death-like 'Soul Crusher' proving particularly effective. Likewise Danny Elfman contributes another of his trademark fantasticly kooky, weird atmospheric scores that underlines the film perfectly.Thats not to say that this film is perfect, it does have the occasional hiccup or plot inconsistency (such as why ghosts can fall through one thing, yet be stopped by hitting the ground), but all in all any of these very minor flaws are hardly worth mentioning and don't detract from the film at all, and to point the finger at them is just being overly nit picky. One flaw the film does have however is that the horror and comedy elements don't always gel quite as well as they perhaps should do, however these instances are few and far between and the overall negative effect on the film is thankfully slight (if any).Performance wise Michael J. Fox is perfectly cast in this film, and is so right in the role of slightly dodgy paranormal investigator that he almost outshines the rest of the (talented) cast, in fact this is probably his best role since 'The Hard Way'. Trini Alvarado meanwhile makes a very attractive female lead and shows definite promise judging by her engaging and well balanced work here. Jeffrey Combs, John Astin, Jake Busey, Dee Wallace Stone, Nicola Cliff, Julianna McCarthy and especially Chi McBride and R. Lee Ermey (in a wonderful piss take of his famous Full Metal Jacket drill instructor role) all add significantly to the fun, while the rest of the cast (Peter Dobson, Troy Evans, Jim Fyfe, Elizabeth Hawthorne, Angela Bloomfield, et al) all provide good, solid support.Great, horrific (in a good way) fun and as such highly recommended to both horror fans and everyone else.8.5/10",The Frighteners
102,Isau,Surprisingly entertaining,8,14 June 1999,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie, but after actually viewing it, I have to say that it was quite entertaining after all.  While the film is neither very funny nor very scary, its frantic pacing, combined with excellent acting, a fantastical premise, and very well done special effects make it a fun movie that everyone can enjoy.",The Frighteners
103,Was-it-All-a-Dream,The Frighteners (1996),2,7 May 2009,"This looks like it cost a lot of money to make. That would usually be a criticism. But in this case, the film is able to afford to look good in its' seasonal setting. It's almost always raining, the sky is always overcast in the film. This manages to create a bit of mood. One the movie desperately needs. This is another one of those ultra-silly horror / thrillers. Like 1993's Army of Darkness, 1987's House II: The Second Story, Or 1990's Tremors- although that was an enjoyable movie. Frighteners is a big budget Hollywood movie. And it's so dumb, so insulting to the intelligence that it feels more like Space Jam (which yes, was even more fun than this pile of garbage) or Free Willy (no comment) than it does Jackson's earlier horror masterpieces. It's like- horror for kids. Really dumb kids. Filled with ear-pokingly (makes you want to) one-liners, fake-looking CGI, and actors going so over the top that it makes 1989's Meet the Feebles look restrained!It was pretty obvious this film would go the safe route by hiring Michael J. Fox (Mr. Family Ties) to be the insurance policy. What killed this film financially? The R rating and nothing more. Because the success of movies like Tommy Boy, The Blair Witch Project, and Dumb and Dumber proves that people will watch anything. Perhaps the fact that it was also 2 hours long and featured a pair of nasty serial killers viciously murdering people in flashback was also a bit of a turn-off. I won't even go that far. I pretty much stated my case back there. It's too loud, it's too talky- all the talking being really bad jokes, there are too many characters in it, almost all the special effects are computerized, and the movie's sense of humor is so aimed toward children. It's as though Jackson just wanted to do another gagfest, like his previous splatter films, but had completely run out of good gags. So he just has the cast inhale a few pounds of sugar before each take and we have to watch them hop around, acting goofy. Except for the sadly miscast John Astin, stuck playing an old coot who not only is tired and saggy, but is killed half-way through the movie. And he was the only ghost I could stand!This movie is so cliché-heavy, it's oppressive. Not to mention it's yet another one of those ""do as many mean things as we can to the protagonist to put the audience through hell""... After the first 25 minutes, the entire remaining 1 hour and 35 (shy of the credits) are a series of misunderstandings and set ups to make things more difficult for Michael J. Fox, who was already showing the signs of suffering from Parkinson's disease. So it's twice as upsetting to see him as the constant butt of cruel jokes. It looks like he's really suffering. This is not funny. It's genuinely rotten and offensive in addition to not being amusing. I think the genre had already had its' fill of this kind of plot. Especially in Wes Craven's Shocker and The Serpent and the Rainbow. Who wants to watch a ""pity the poor guy"" movie anymore? If they're going to make a stupid comedy, that's one thing. The ""stupid comedy"" genre always has room for more. But this is supposed to be horror. A genre Peter Jackson has a lot of experience with. His previous films, Bad Taste and Dead Alive, clearly dried up his entire reserve of talent.Since this is an attempt to bring Jackson's horror to America, he recruited a few big horror names. The best cast actor here is Dee Wallace, the scream queen with roles in such high-profile films as Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes, Joe Dante's The Howling, 1983's Cujo, 1986's Critters, and 1990's misguided but still fun Popcorn. She plays the frumpy old spinster daughter of an even older creepy woman, played brilliantly by Julianna McCarthy, who has a face that was made for a horror film! The only good scenes involve Wallace's character playing helpless victim to Trini Alvarado, begging her to save her from her tyrant mother... just wait until that frail little victim gets hold of a shotgun and then see how helpless she looks! Fox is always pro. And a lot more tolerable and sympathetic here than in his usual 'party-guy', show off hero routine. He ages and matures a lot by this role, which is a shame that he wastes his new talent on this lemon. He's a very beautiful man when he isn't fooling around as much. In fact, in this circus freakshow, he's the ""straight man"" with the fewest wild gestures. A bit of a first for him.The rest of the cast are pure annoyance. There's a stereotypical black ghost, a stereotypical nerdy white ghost, the stereotypical Horace Pinker-like obnoxious serial killer (played by Jake Busey, taking all of Fox's old over the top-isms, and strongly resembling the actor who always taunted him in the Back to the Future films), and a stereotypically lame, irritating soldier-captain ghost who talks too loud and gets right in the camera lens, shouting army terms. There is perhaps one exception- Peter Dobson. Yes, I find him kinda hot. But that's not why I bring him up. He's actually pretty funny (come to think of it... HE looks a little like the actor who taunted Michael J. Fox in the Back to the Future films too!) and he's equally good in the 1999 comedy Drowning Mona where he plays a bumbling sheriff. But the icing on the cake is truly Re-Animator's import, Jeffrey Combs. A man I have a lot of respect for, but an actor who has a habit of picking really lousy roles that are so unlikable, you just want to punch him! And the character he plays here will forever be the most annoying character in horror history!",The Frighteners
104,Motorskallen,Creepy ...,10,12 January 2004,"This movie is really creepy. I watched for the first time when I was about 10-12 years old, and I had nightmares for weeks! But at the same time, it's really funny. A great combination of crazy humour and damn creepy horror!!!

Peter Jackson is great!",The Frighteners
105,juubei-2,Not all that frightening and not all that funny either,6,7 August 2006,"Peter Jackson certainly made a name for himself with Heavenly Creatures and since then Lord of the Rings, so I was curious about checking out some of his older ones. Passing over Meet the Feebles I went with The Frighteners.Michael J Fox is great, and the effects are mostly pretty good. But the story logic and gags are kind of off, as if Jackson was unsure what to give his audience. Should he be true to his roots and give us a real slasher flick, or a mainstream comedy with a few scary bits? In the end its sort of like Ghostbusters crossed with Scream. I mean, on one side of the coin you've got a bunch of ghosts making sexual jokes, and on the other side you've got a homicidal killer who likes to carve numbers into people's foreheads after murdering them. Every now and then it veers off in one of these directions and I can't help but feel it would've been better if it was more to the extreme one way or the other.I watched this primarily to see Jackson's pre-LOTR work and I wasn't too impressed but if the mood strikes you for something really off the wall, you could do worse.",The Frighteners
106,ablebravo,"ROCK ON, Mr Jackson!",8,5 June 2005,"There have been enough synopses on the plot of this film so I won't go there but I feel compelled to comment on Peter's directional ability and overall film-making skill. This guy could make an Oscar winner with an 8MM camera and a cassette recorder! Jackson, Selkirk and Walsh have outdone the ""best"" that Hollywood could possibly put out, even if they did have to lame down a story that probably could have been as intense as Brain Dead as far as in-your-face jolts! The SFX, though a bit dated-looking are perfect for the film, and the casting director should have gotten an Oscar for a really great ensemble. The chemistry between all the characters was utterly believable- and very special mention should go to Jeff Combs (The Re-animator series, Castle Freak, Necronomicon, From Beyond...as well as 2 characters in ST-DS9- Weyoun and the Ferengi Brunt...AND in ST Enterprise as the Andorian Shrel) for the funniest FBI agent in film history. Just as in Brain Dead, there are points where Jackson seems to be trying to make you laugh and puke at the same time, but even with the iron hand of American exec. producer Zemeckis (Back To The Future, Contact) holding Jackson's truly demented creativity down to a Hollywood trash heap level, Jackson's sheer genius still shines thru the dreck. The script alone was enough to make this one of the best films of the 90s... and maybe one of the best horror films of all time. (George Lucas, are you reading this??) Another thing I really liked was the casting of mature actors, not a bunch of brain dead teens (pun intended) that seem to populate 99.99999% of all the other so-called horror films that are being churned out of the Hollywood fertilizer factory these days. I love horror films even though I am usually bitterly disappointed in those I see. The Frighteners is a really refreshing change and I fervently hope that Jackson and his wonderful creative group have not abandoned the Horror genre. This is a must-have for any horror (or Peter Jackson) fan's permanent collection.Oh, I didn't mention Michael J Fox in the lead....NO ONE ELSE could have done this role' with as much flair, charm or energy as good ole Mike. Funniest sequence in the whole film was the restaurant scene- that alone is worth the DVD's price!C'moon Mr Jackson... Give us another one but leave Hollywood out of it and do it in New Zealand! We're all waiting!May WingNut films live forever!",The Frighteners

109,ColtPython82,Awesome movie if you love movies like Beetlejuice and Ghostbusters!,10,14 March 2019,"As a kid this movie always gave me the heebie jeebies... Especially the scenes with the Grim Reaper and the flashback at the end. But, as an adult I see how awesome it is and it never deserved the low reviews it got from critics. It definitely takes cues from Beetlejuice's humor and soundtrack and the ghost visuals of Ghostbusters. Watching this you can see how Peter Jackson will eventually be a great director for the LOTR trilogy. And of course the movie features America's favorite 80's actor Michael J. Fox and that man can do no wrong. I highly recommended this movie as a late night chill flick and it won't disappoint!",The Frighteners

This film wasn't meant to be taken seriously, its just a good romp into a comic book-ish tale about killing beyond the grave and goofy ghosts, along with the occasional scare and disturbing scene.  If you enjoy Michael J. Fox, or a pseudo-horror film, then I suggest you take the time to watch this sleeper gem.",The Frighteners

The ghosts; Stuart and Cyrus really add necesary laughs and the grim reaper effects are very cool. Frank's crooked 'Ghostbuster' scheme is clever and the plot rocks. I recomend this to anyone looking for a good laugh or a quick scare. This film can definitly provide both. I also like Dhamers character. He is amusing in a pathetic way and the way he dies is weird. This films climax in the hospital where the murders took place, complete with ""Claudia Style"" flashbacks is very effective and thrilling.Grade: I give this movie an A.",The Frighteners

Frank is helped by a former customer of his, Lucy (Trini Alvarado).This movie is extremly funny and its even dark at some points.

115,buddyboy28,"A roller-coaster ride of comedy, thrills, and special effects. My favourite Peter Jackson movie.",10,14 May 2013,"Michael J.Fox (in what sadly became his last live-action movie role) is on fine form as troubled con-man, Frank Bannister who has the ability to see ghosts, and uses his unique gift to make money in the small town of Fairwater. He has his ghost ""colleagues"" haunt the houses of the residents and then offers his services to evict the spooks. It's the perfect scam until more and more healthy people start turning up dead, seemingly from heart attacks, and Frank soon realises that he must use his gift to stop a genuine evil spirit.Starting out like an all-out fantasy comedy, the film brilliantly switches tone around the halfway mark and becomes darker and more violent but director Peter Jackson never stops supplying the laughs either. The twisty plot takes in a host of unforgettable and quirky characters along for the ride. Trini Alvarado plays Lucy, probably the most normal character as a woman who loses her husband and finds herself becoming more involved with Frank and the strange goings on. John Astin, Chi Mcbride, and Jim Fyfe are hilarious as Frank's ghost pals who reluctantly help him out. Most of the film's funniest scenes feature these three characters and Frank's interactions with them. Peter Dobson as Lucy's dead husband Ray also adds a lot of fun into the proceedings. His banter with Fox is brilliant, especially in the scene where he goes to his own funeral. And last but not least is Jeffrey Combs' character, FBI agent Milton Dammers who is one of the weirdest lawmen in movie history. A deeply disturbed individual who has been undercover over the years so many times in different cults, without any therapy, that he has become insane himself.I've always loved this film and thought it was underrated and now I've seen the director's cut I enjoy it even more. This version of the film makes the events and characters much more clearer. The mix of genres and the performances combine to fantastic effect. A top-notch black comedy thriller.",The Frighteners
116,The_Dinosaur,Don't fear the reaper,8,24 October 2006,"Well maybe you should fear him. I just watched this film for the first time in a long time. I think it is a great mix of horror and comedy.The story is about a man who can interact with the spirits of the dead, but people start dying and he sees these deaths and soon gets blamed for them, when actually it appears to be the grim reaper.This film has a lot of strong characters like 'The Judge' who is the ghost of a judge from the old west, who is probably one of my favorite characters in this film. All the actors did a great job portraying the characters. It is just a really good film.The story flows well, it can keep your attention even after the first time you have watched it. That is one of the reasons I liked it because I can watch it more than once and still enjoy it.",The Frighteners

Was everyone on Vacation the week it came out or something? This movie has it all: Horror, suspense, incredible special-effects, laughs, excitement...you name it, it's in there somewhere! Michael J. Fox stars as Frank Bannister, a man who has the ability to see spirits of the dead (thanks to an unfortunate automobile accident).  The movie gets off to a humorous start as He takes full advantage of his ability by making friends with a trio of ghosts who haunt houses for him so that he can ""Exorcise"" them for a handsome fee.  But now the terror begins as we find out that the spirit of an executed serial-killer is killing residents of Frank's town and Frank sees visions of a number carved into the foreheads of some of the unlucky victims before they are murdered...UH-OH!!! Here is where the film begins to blend the spooky realism of a serial-killer with the haunting supernatural and the result is a non-stop ride of chills, thrills, excitement, and incredible special effects that are both frightening and mind-blowing at the same time!  The ghostly effects and images are a triumph for the world of film and they are so creative, amazing, and fun that you will want to enjoy them again and again! It's a journey of excitement, suspense, and amazement asFrank (played superbly by the likeable Michael J. Fox) and his ghostly pals try to stop the murderous terror of the evil serial-killer in this enthralling, intelligently-written, and spooky thrill-fest.

121,byStevenRamirez,It's Remake Time!,8,20 February 2017,"I got a chance to watch this cult movie (which means it didn't make any money) again after having only seen it once when it first came out, what, twenty years ago? And I'm here to tell you that I enjoyed it even more this time.There's a lot of wicked humor—not the least of which is provided by the talented John Astin as The Judge. What a hoot! And then there's the inimitable Jeffrey Combs as FBI special agent Milton Dammers. This guy looks like Adolph Hitler minus the moustache and with the edgy charm of Norman Bates on crack. I guess he felt he had set the bar in 'Re-Animator' and was obligated to outdo himself.Never mind about the plot—this isn't a movie review. Let me point out, though, that this thing has just about everything in it—including a serial killer, a haunted house and time travel. I'm not sure what New Zealanders dream of at night but some of their movies are pretty out there. To that point, Peter Jackson had previously co-written and directed the outrageous 'Dead Alive' (1992). So I guess Universal decided to give him a shot at a ""mainstream"" movie for them.And 'The Frighteners' isn't exactly mainstream. First off, it was shot in New Zealand using mostly American actors. Because of that it has a bit of a dreamy, unfamiliar quality to it. Interesting factoid: according to a Wikipedia article, the movie was originally supposed to be directed by Robert Zemeckis, who exec produced. After seeing the wicked 'Death Becomes Her' (1992), I think that wouldn't have been a bad idea.The only thing I have against this movie is the vfx, which were probably state-of-the- art at the time but whose quality, like that in 'Ghostbusters,' looks cheesy by today's standards. Which leads me to my next point.There aren't a lot of movies that should be remade IMO but this one could work. And, let's face it, you've got to get Woody Harrelson in there somewhere. CGI is so good now—not to mention IMAX—this thing is begging to be remade.",The Frighteners
122,thegarf,One hell of a film !,8,22 February 1999,"Wahooo ! This movie is a masterpiece of entertainment, comedy and mystery ! Yes, it's possible ! I won't repeat the story other people have told, but I want to underline the great performance of Michael J. Fox, ectoplasms Columbo (just look at the car !). The wonder duo Zemeckis/Fox once more brings a great moment of fun and action, this time turning to the deads world... Michael J. Fox is the perfect desperate man living upon scams, of a very particular kind. But I think the real best performance was Comb's. I do particularly like this kind of character, the complete weirdo, totally mad, paranoid, aggressive and terrified, but above all completely unpredictable. They are the real elements of surprise, what scrambles completely the story you were in... and he does his job superbly ! Finally, a word about the FX... splendid digital tricks, the Death looks more real than if you'd seen it in front of you. It's an animal, vicious, powerful and hideous,the mind of a madman with the power of demons... This movie is a great achievment, and guarantees a great evening.

123,ross-41,"so much promise, so much of something....",6,7 March 2001,"This movie tried to be so much, it was bursting at the seams.  You had Michael Fox and the three ghosts in an interesting scam.  You had a ""Carrie"" style mother-daughter relationship. You had the ""soul collector"" visual effect of unstoppable danger.  You had the young widow who can't help falling for Fox.  You had the Drill Sargent from hell guarding the cemetery. You had the goofiest FBI agent this side of X-files.  You had a psycho murderer who wanted to go for a high score.  All these would have made a genuinely interesting story, but none of them were in the same story or genre.  Jeffery Combs obviously had the most fun in the picture, but his performance seemed edited in from his goofy cult films.  This was so haphazard, so confused, and visually dis-orienting I had to stop myself from saying aloud, ""This is so... stupid.""When I found out that the Director of the Lord of the Rings movies was the guy that did this, my eyes rolled in fear.  Hopefully with an actual script, Peter Jackson will be a little more coherent. ""underrated movie""?  yeah right.4/10  one star for the special effects, one for John Austin, one for Jeffery Combs, and one for Lee Emery.

125,Evil_Chihuahua,Could this be the most under-rated of all time,8,20 March 2006,"Why is it not many people have seen this film, or even heard of it? Why is it so under-rated? Why has it only recently been released on DVD? They are a few questions about this film I'd like know, because this is the best non-LotR/King Kong Peter Jackson film I've seen (I've yet to see Bad Taste and Brain Dead).The movie centers around small town psychic con-artist, Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox), who can really see ghosts, but uses his ""gift"" to his own advantage. You see, he sends his ghost buddies around to people's houses to ""haunt"" the place. The residents call Bannister, who comes over to do a bit of ""ghost-busting"" and collects the cash. Anyway, he starts to notice numbers on the fore-heads of the people around town, which only he can see. Strangely, these people wind up dead, and according to police reports, it seems someone or something had (literally) crushed the victims heart. After a while, Frank sees the killer: a large Grim Reaper like specter, who maybe linked to a mass murder committed by serial killer Johnny Charles Bartlett (Jake Busey) that happened in a local hospital years before hand.And if trying to warn the towns people of this ghostly killer isn't hard enough (of coarse, being a movie, no one believes him), he has to deal with a ""psychic detective"" who thinks Bannister is the killer. Perhaps Bartletts girlfriend, Patricia Ann Bradley (Dee Wallace-Stone), knows the truth, but why does her mother forbid her to make contact with the outside world?So, why is the film so underrated? One answer may be because of it's box office failure. Critics were confused over the film when it was released. They didn't know whether the film was a comedy, a horror, a thriller, a drama or a family film. You see, it starts off with a scary scene, goes on to something more dramatic, then some light hearted, family friendly comedy, then some crude humor (the Judge, a ghost played by John Astin, having his way with an Egyptian mummy) and then back to being a horror movie. Because of their confusion, the critics reviewed the film poorly, so not many people went to see it.So, is the film worth seeing? Of coarse. Sure, it's not Gone with the Wind, but it's fun. The characters are enjoyable, the story is fun, the acting is great and the SFX are awesome for it's time (1996). So check it out one day. It'll be hard to find a film like it and it was the last PJ film that was his original idea, before going onto his Oscar winning Lord of the Ring trilogy.Now for some trivia:Peter Jackson wanted the film to be given a PG-13 rating, but it was given an R rating instead (although in Australia it was given a simple M15+ rating).PJ realized it was now possible to put the LotR on big screen after seeing how well the ghost effects came out in this film.Sean Astin was inspired to audition for the LotR after his father, John Astin, enjoyed himself during the making of this film. John Astin also auditioned for the role Gandalf the Grey.R. Lee Ermey makes a cameo as a ghostly Sergent, which is a send up of his famous role in Full Metal Jacket.The film was inspired by a supposed real life ghost encounter PJ and his wife had.PJ makes a cameo appearance (as he does in all his films). He is the scary looking biker dude with piercings Fox bumps into near the beginning of the film.",The Frighteners

I know they are sometimes seen in Halloween, But There is one Ghost movie that is very... Interesting, The Frighteners, Now As you all know Peter Jackson is one of most Recognizable Directors in Hollywood, He did Movies like The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit Trilogy, And his Remake of King Kong, But he also did projects that I thought where the guys Film-College experiments, This is one of his movies that I'd say was a Nexus of his Directing life, And Remember Michael J. Fox, He is in this movie I always thought he looked like Matt Damon back then, Also I have this movie on Blu-Ray while Mr Jackson has it on Laserdisc (While might have been the Prototypes to DVD's HD-DVD's and Blu-Rays)... First off I have to point out that This poster of the Movie is pretty Confusing then Scary, I mean WHAT THE HECK I'M I LOOKING AT HERE? This was the best you could come up with Peter Jackson? All we see is a Face of some strange Smiling Alien skull Pressing his face against a Wall of Fabric, Gives me no idea what the movie is about, Well seeming that Oliver Harper Review this movie, Don't know if the Critics from Channel Awesome have done this yet, But At least I'll be second place.I seen this movie many times in the past on when it was in the TV and on Blu-Ray... Well, I never thought Id say this on a Peter Jackson movie but... I thought it was an alright movie, Arthur McCartney might not have been into this movie but for me... Well you know, I found the Story interesting, Mr Fox was alright in it, There where some cleaver Ideas in this, using ghosts for exorcist profit was a original idea, And there are some Jump-Scars that would work for anyone that's never seen this before, But this movie does have problems, Some of the Jump-Scars will get old, And seeming it was made in the 90's the CGI would look dated, I found Heaven and Hell very strange, But I'll give this movie credit on the look of the ghosts, They look more Realistic in some strange way if we are able to see them, (YEAH TAKE THAT CASPER!!) I know there is a Novel of this movie that's based on the Original script, But there is an extended version of the movie that is included in Blu-Ray, Two disk special edition DVD's and possibly on the Laserdisc Special Edition, I seen the extended version and let me tell you, It's a lot better, has more to the story then the theatrical release, If this movie was released in the Halloween season, then it would have made more money out of it, But it's an Average Peter Jackson Movie from his Early Days of Movie making.As Oliver Harper once aid on his Review in this movie, You will return to it on a Regular bases!Here is a link to his Review of this movie, Now if you excuse me, I'm off to see is my Old TV down stares is not possessed! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYI5KrZDjcA",The Frighteners
128,DaveKerr,Expertly Crafter,10,27 December 1998,"The Frighteners is an excellent horror-comedy-drama in which Michael J. Fox plays ex-architect and now psychic scamster Frank Bannister. The film revolves around the premise that Frank, after being involved in an accident which resulted in the death of his wife, can now see disembodied spirits and runs a scam in which the ghouls haunt houses under the order of Frank and then he 'exorcises' them for a fee. However, a series of murders begin in Frank's town and it becomes achingly clear that these murders have something to do with his wife's death. The romantic involvement comes in the form of Trini Alvarado (Little Women) who plays a doctor who's husband was killed by the evil forces at work. This film achieves many things, it manages to create a comic atmosphere at times whilst being able to make us feel real sympathy for the character of Frank and his tragic circumstances. This is a truly under-rated film and it is well worth watching.",The Frighteners
129,Hollie_H,One of a kind,7,20 April 2007,"I just saw this movie today for the first time and it was better than i expected i think it was because its one of a kind no one has really done the whole killer/ghost/comedy thing. What makes this work is Michael J Fox. who plays Frank Bannister somewhat of a con man who makes a living claiming he can see ghosts which he really can. He plays this character really well and gives it a lot of depth, he is a likable character you can just automatically like. This movie takes a bit of brain power to guess what is going to happen. Of course this movie has all your elements and comedy and that's what adds to me liking this movie its got witty one liners in it that will make you laugh for about 2 seconds but that is the good thing about this movie you are never bored.I would recommend seeing this movie it was a good movie and i enjoyed it thats why i have given it a 7.",The Frighteners

This literally has everything I like in a movie: a well-written, complicated story-line; clever dialogue; intriguing, well-developed characters portrayed by talented, well-cast actors; appropriate music; awesome special effects; intense action sequences and a romantic subplot that is neither overplayed nor overshadowed. This movie is a masterful blend of horror and humor and director Peter Jackson (who himself has a Hitchcock-like cameo) did a wonderful job putting this masterpiece together. Michael J. Fox is wonderful in what I consider to be his strongest performance, and John Astin as the Judge is a real hoot. Sure, the film is not without its flaws (it has a couple of tiny visual continuity errors as well as other little nitpicky things too small to justify mentioning), but there is no great film that is without flaws.

The Frighteners was, to quote a friend of mine, extraordinary only in its mediocrity; a film totally bereft of Jackson's usual spark and wicked sense of humor.Though I have faith that he will redeem himself somewhere down the line, I find it difficult to let him slide so easily with this film: in all of its many facets it is unentertaining and uninvolving, and gives him a bad name.",The Frighteners

The Frighteners can't claim to be in the same league as Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, but I would say it's better than both of these! It is a darkly humorous tale that owes more to Ghostbusters than Scream.A very underrated film, and very well-written, the blend of occult horror and humor makes this film simply brilliant to watch! Most of my friends only saw it because I told them about it and they all loved it! It is a clear example of the sort of films that are discarded by the critics simply because they experiment with a new idea.Good storyline, funny characters (especially the dead ones), this film is not really meant to be taken seriously. It isn't very scary so you should try to watch it with an open mind, and don't expect Scream in another guise. And anyway, any film Michael J. Fox in can't be that bad.",The Frighteners

145,ajbzerosignal84,Very enjoyable black comedy horror flick,8,28 November 2004,"Michael J. Fox plays Frank Bannister, a man who parades himself around his local town as a exorcist, dispersing ghosts in neighborhood homes. However, he's a conman, ripping people off so that he can maintain his already crummy lifestyle. But he can see ghosts though, and he has 3 of of them whom he has befriended and uses them for the cons he uses on people.Its only when he starts seeing numbers appear on the heads of certain people that disturbing events begin to occur, as these particular people meet their demise at the hands of a ghost that's assuming the form of the Grim Reaper. And as Bannister is the only one who can see, hear and also predict who's next on the killer's list, its up to him and his spiritual friends to try and thwart this insane entity. Peter Jackson's 6th film was another one of his steps towards Hollywood fame and showcases what an exceptional Director he really is. Michael J. Fox gives a very credible performance as Frank Bannister, a man trying to cope with everyday normal life with the fact that he has a sixth sense no-one knows about. This film has many delights and laughs come in high numbers. ( especially from Jeffrey Combs as the mega-weirdo FBI agent Dammers) It will appeal to people outside of the horror genre and gain enough appeal to watch over and over again.Score: 8/10",The Frighteners

I got to this late admittedly, but it hasn't aged well as I've heard very good things about this movie and was excited to see it. It was just a bit too corny for me, the effects were bad enough that they were distracting and it was a bit of a tough watch.I like the concept though, if there was less focus on the slap stick and the ghosts weren't such over the top character, I feel like this would be a good candidate for a remake. Focus a lot more on the horror and occult aspects, less on the bumbling comedy. A con man who can see ghosts using them to trick people into making a living but running into a malevolent spirit / Death has some potential I think.

Although The Frighteners did not do well at the box office, I thought it was a intelligent movie that displayed many new ideas.  Michael J.

Another great thing about this film is how Jeffrey Combs stars as the goofy detective on the hunt for Frank Bannister.

Since receiving his power, Bannister has befriended a few ghosts with colorful personalities that help him scam people into paying him for some unflashy ghost busting.Bannister's ghost buddies and his general Marty Mcfly-like quirkiness keep the mood light. There are a few, arguably too many, plot twists in The Frighteners but I did not think they were forced.

156,bemusingname,Being dead never looked so much fun!,8,10 March 2004,"Before the epic LOTR project Peter Jackson made a name for himself with more unusual projects with a rich vein of black humour. This film is one of those projects...Con man Micheal J Fox has a talent for being able to communicate with the dead, which is fair enough until people start dropping like flies from mysterious heart attacks and people start pointing the finger at him, life certainly doesn't get easier with the arrival of an 'unusual' FBI agent (played rather well by Jeffrey Combs) For a film concerned with death i feel it's quite a light affair, while not suitable for kiddies it has an almost comic book feel and is bursting with a great deal of energy. The special effects are showing their age now but they still do the job and handle any ghostly interactions nicely. The film builds quite nicely with various strands all coming together for the final act, one stand out moment is a fight in a grave-yard occuring on both the mortal and spiritual planes. The film tries to give an impending sense of doom as it heads towards its climax and it's a shame that the final half hour occasionally lacks momentum. It feels as if far too much story is packed into this last segment with several important plot points being crammed in quickly and this has the effect of slowing what should be an action based finale.Michael J Fox is always watchable and plays his part well while Trini Alvarado has a thankless one-dimensional role as little more than a damsel in distress. Jeffrey Combs gets the best role though as the seriously disturbed FBI agent, he is both creepy and somehow pathetic. Jeffrey Combs gives a very physical performance with his various jerks and stares and really lifts the character off the screen, he also gets all the best lines.A great little film with humour and energy, lets hope Mr Jackson makes a return to this sort of project after he's finished with his 'epic' phase",The Frighteners
157,jack_skellington_,Jackson before the Lord of the Rings,7,9 April 2005,"The Frighteners is a fun ride, but not one for the ages.The film is notable for it's imaginative and groundbreaking visual effects, interesting camera-work and some excellent performances, but suffers from a murky script and only average dialogue. The ghosts are very well done, and unlike other early CGI creations, look like they are part of the film and actually take up visual 'space'; they look 3-D, not flat and cartoonish. The cinematography is impressive and hints at Jackson's later works; look for one excellent shot near the end of the film when a main character falls through a number of floors. Sweeping camera movements also dominate, and work to a great effect. Dee Wallace-Stone is excellent as a deranged psychopath, as is Trini Alvarado and Michael J. Fox. The sets are well done, and Jackson gets the drab looks of a small town down pat. Unfortunately, the plot is confusing and a bit of a bore, and most of the lines are quite vapid (including lots of unnecessary swearing). But this is the only major problem with the film; perhaps I was looking for more twists, or the complete silliness of his earlier works.

158,rycke,most original horror film in the past ten years **SPOILERS!**,10,21 November 2004,"Okay, The Frighteners has some flaws. Why such a low/sporadic body count by Johnny Bartlett until Frank Bannister gets involved, then there are nearly half-a-dozen in two days? Why is Johnny terrorizing Patricia Bradley in the beginning (unless it was ""five years ago"")? Why does the tunnel of light take so long to appear for Frank at the climax?Once Johnny is revealed, why does he suddenly quit wearing the cape? BUT--in spite of this, I have no problem overlooking these flaws. Usually, stuff like this bothers me, but not in this case. The pacing, the acting, the F/X all come together in a magical blend of humor and horror that leaves me begging for more. Leave it to Peter Jackson to knock my socks off time after time after time.

Michael J Fox in his best role since Nick Lang (in The Hard Way) seems to have been born to play the part of Frank Bannister, thought most of laughs are brought from the supporting cast. Mainly Jeffrey Combs as the bizarre, mentally disturb agent investigating the murders.. The direction is taut and streamline, the effects creepy and the use of New Zealand as middle America is odd. But adds to the isolated feel that all horror movies should have. Instead of Spin City Fox should have done a spin-off series as Bannister.. SCARY, FUNNY, EXCELLENT... 8/10",The Frighteners

161,DrivingOverMissDaisy,Michael J. Fox duels with a Sixth Sense,9,31 October 2003,"Believe it or not LOTR freaks, director Peter Jackson was in fact an energetic horror filmmaker before stepping up to epic fantasy. His vocabulary spanning from splat-attack cartoon action to eery-feeling drama, Jackson has now finally taken the world of film with his gorehound force with those infamous LOTR flicks. Rewind a couple years before MTV knew Jackson's name, we have this Michael J. Fox vehicle that wasn't too popular with early Jackson fans because we saw a turn in direction in Jackson's style that teaters away from the over-the-top gore fests of before. First, I'll give you the rundown of the story of Peter Jackson's The Frighteners. The story is about Frank Banister (Michael J. Fox), a former architect now a paranormal psychic that can see and interact with ghosts, but he uses that to con people. It's how he makes a living. He dups people into believing that their home is being overrun by ghosts, they call him and he ""gets rid of them,"" when actually he's friends with three ghosts and they help him out. One, known as The Judge (John Astin) during the film appropriatly tells Frank ""Death ain't no way to make a living,"" showing Jackman's hints of clever dialouge writing. Trouble brews when mysterious deaths are accurring in this New Englund town, and Frank begins seeing numbers ""burned"" into the living's forheads...coincedently before they die. He finds out that The Soul Collector is deliberatly going around, giving people a number, and pulling the plugs on their hearts...only the mystery is who is this ""soul collector?"" He's aided by recently widowed Lucy (Trini Alverado) and has an....eccentric (for lack of a better word) FBI Agent by the name of Milton Dammers (Jeffery Combs...yes THE Jeffery Combs) on his tail, in belief that Frank is the one responsible for this string of killings. There's a few plot twists...some clever and exciting while some are more ""meh,"" but I don't want to give the rest of the plot away. Peter Jackson's film style is very evident here, using as much zoom/wacky -angle as he can to give his film a more quirky feel. The film's spinal cord is horror driven, but caging around it is comedy...but effective comedy. There is dialouge traded off between Frank and his buddy ghosts that are just hilarious. Cyrus (Chi McBride, from TV's boston Public) is one of the ghosts that died in the 70's....leaving him with poorly outdated disco duds with an afro to boot. Stewart (Jim Fyfe) is Cyrus's right handman, more of a nerdy white guy. The Judge, with overlooked makeup effects by Rick Baker, had died sometime in the 1800's, and his own ectoplasm is rotting away, leaving him mostly skeleton with some skin and clothes. His complaining about him being ""all dried up"" are some of the highlight humorous moments in the film. Adding to more of the quirky comedy, there are some characters that come along such as Lucy's recently deceased husband Ray (Peter Dobson) who has an obsession with gnomes on his lawn and has a yelling problem, the sheriff (Troy Evans) that is kind and warm spirited, but has this air of goofiness about him. Jeffrey Combs' character is disturbing and awkward, in the funniest way. His lips move randomly and he tweaks, twitches, and shakes. He even gets easily startled when a woman raises her voice to him. And to top it all off, R. Lee Ermy has a role, resembling his Full Metal Jacket Drill Sergent character, as a ghost keeping watch on the town graveyard and has a bone to pick with Frank. He takes what was funny about his FMJ character and amplifies it to basically a self-parody, which is what it was meant to be. Ermy is just ""balls out"" funny. The screenplay feels a bit uneven though, in some spaces, in terms of pacing. There is a particular scene in the town graveyard at night where the film feels like it's about to climax...but it doesn't, it leads to a plot twist, which is kinda neat, but seems to disrupt the feel of the rest of the movie. It's not that the twists comes out of left field, there is some backstory sprinkled throughout with one dreadfully frightened character played by Dee Wallace, but the twist just seems to take the Soul Collecter down a notch, at least to me. And while most of the dialouge reads as clever, some of the dialouge seems to be more forced. Example? Take the scene where Frank Banister is in a jail cell and Lucy comes to understand him more, and Frank starts to tell her that basically he doesn't want to hurt her. The dialouge in this scene feels, to me, underwritten. The makeup in this film is great, though Baker (Rick) actually only does the job for The Judge character. There is an entire different team working on the rest of the movie as Rick works on John Astin, and the styles don't clash but blend with each other. The Judge really looks like he's deteriorating. All other ghosts may not be as elaborate, but with the darker rims around the eyes and blown out pale faces, it doesn't make The Judge stick out like a sore thumb. The music is by the ever popular Danny Elfman, and unfortunatly I believe this may be the film that marks the downfall of his talent. Now, the music here is great, but this is the first time he seems to be repeating elements that worked great in his past work, and he decides to mesh it together. While this ""mesh"" is trite, gloomy, and works brilliantly with the tone of the film...there's no signature theme lurking within. There is an abundance of CGI work here, used for such effects as the ""tunnel of light"" and goofy things that happen to the ghosts. The ""soul collector"" is animated primarily with CGI, and it's design itself looks like early art direction drafts used later for Jackson's LOTR Ringwraiths. Of course that may not be the case, but it's hard to overlook the spooky similarities between the Soul Collector and the Ringwraiths. I'm not too bothered by the abundance of CGI in this film...until towards the end, when The Soul Collector and his partner are up in the tunnel of light, going after Frank, and the tunnel stops and turns into this hellish snake that takes the Soul Collector and his partner into the fires of hell. Neat design and concept, but it's very obviously CGI. Michael J. Fox really is at his best in this film, in my opinion. His Marty McFly character is still his best role, but I feel his acting abilities are further stretched and done well in this part. He's believable as Frank and he doesn't let the character down. Dee Wallace is squeemish here, and is convincing. Trini Alverado sounds cheesy in several scenes. When she talks to Frank, asking about her husband, she just comes off as amatuerish and she doesn't sound like a grieving wife, even if she proclaims they never had a good marraige. If your husband/spouse had died unexpectidly, even if you were getting the feeling that they may not be the right one for you, wouldn't you be a little more in dispair about it? Trini's sad, but to me she doesn't seem sad enough. Troy Evans, the sheriff, is fun as a friend of Frank, who knows that Frank may have done something, but feels that he is the good guy in the predicament. But of all performances in the movie, the most memorable would have to go to Jeffery Combs's Dammers character. The way he plays this guy is like he took his Herbert West character from Re-Animator, locked him away in solitude without any light and fed him nightmares of women shrieking at him, then let him out. He's a hoot. Every time he comes in frame, you are suppose to be distracted by him, you wonder, ""what is this nutball doing?"" For those fans of Jackson's earlier gorefests, this probably would be a disapointment for you. Splatterblood from firehoses and zombie-fighting priests are nowhere to be found here. This film is more coherently nararrated with more believable characters. Jackson was obviously trying to make more profesional pictures by this point (this direction starting with the breathtaking and even better Heavenly Creatures). This film is fun, sometimes jumpy, and cleverly told, even if it suffers from some spotty acting by one crucial character and some pacing issues. Peter Jackson's The Frighteners is a good spookfest with a bit of room for improvement. Grade: B",The Frighteners

165,missivonne,light horror comedy fun,8,19 September 2004,"Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert loathed this film when it came, but I can't see why. It's a light horror-comedy in the ""Ghostbusters"" vein.Frank Bartlett (Michael J. Fox) stars as a ghostbuster of sorts, a ""paranormal investigator"" in his own parlance. He haunts -- pardon the irresistible pun -- funerals for clients and drums up business with the help of two ghostly pals who haven't quite crossed over. You see, although Frank is something of a con man (he gets his ghost buddies to create the disturbances he then stops), he isn't as much of a con man as you first think: He can actually *see* ghosts and understands the supernatural.Frank lives in a town that was the scene of a murder-massacre that left 12 people dead years before. The so called Bartlett-Bradley murders in a now-closed hospital made international headlines. But, after years of quiet, in the last four years, dozens of perfectly healthy people have begun having heart attacks. Frank and his love interest (a doctor, Dr. Lucy Lynskey, played by Trini Alvarado) get involved in figuring out the cause. Any more information would ruin the movie. I do want to add that I was surprised that Alvarado, a classic beauty like Andie MacDowell (whom she resembles) or Grace Kelley, had such a comic touch. She outshone even Fox!The movie isn't Peter Jackson's later and momentous ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, but it's a fun and suspenseful romp full of more surprises than you'd expect in this genre. And, as even Ebert had to admit, the special effects were fantastic. There isn't a dull moment, and you find yourself really anxious for Frank and Lucy.Don't be put off by the critics.

Not since Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' series has there been a cult film like this. Mr. Fox turned in a stellar performance and it was great seeing john astin in a role that brings to mind his glory days on 'the addams family'. Jake Busey shines as the demented serial killer and adds a creative quasi-comedic yet terrifying performance. Moving from this film to the socially retarded psycho in 1997's 'Contact'. The film's special effects provided by WETA are well staged and executed with enthusiasm. I have no idea why this film didn't perform well at the box office. Audiences were not prepared for a hybrid comedy horror with actual dramatic tension and well drawn characters. I highly recommend this film.,The Frighteners

I couldn't gather from the trailer what type of movie Peter Jackson was going for. Fortunately, it turned out to be one of the best movies of the year. It is one of those films that combines everything: comedy, suspense, drama, and romance. Not too many movies are able to pull this off. Michael J. Fox was fabulous, in what would be his last real role. The supporting cast is great as well, with an outstanding performance from John Astin. The Frighteners is not a movie that got much recognition, but do not let that fool you. Every person that I know who saw it, loved it. It appears to be a typical story about ghosts, but in reality, it is about a man who, although has a special gift, has lost everything. RENT IT.",The Frighteners

171,OlivieLo,A movie that Robert Zemeckis proves that he finds Michael J Fox very correct.,10,6 July 2014,"A movie that Robert Zemeckis proves that he finds Michael J Fox very correct.without Michael J Fox playing Frank Bannister, my friends and I would not even have any interest to watch Frighteners.Now even our throne rush team call ""Frighteners"" see how much I love this movie. yes it's true. my throne rush facebook game team is called this movie. Maybe to some people who admire Johnny Depp, they think that Johnny Depp would be able to play a better frank Bannister than Fox. but to we MJF fans, MJF is better. even Johnny Depp or Tom Cruise (I am a Tom Cruise fan) can not even have what MJF influenced people on this movie. everyone would hope their idols inside this movie. me too. My idols are Tom Cruise and Michael J Fox, but since Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman divorced I throw tom Cruise away. *talk back to MJF as it's Michael's movie*Yes I would speak that, you love Johnny Depp, just like how we love MJF, of course everyone would want every movie contain their favorite actor. Mentioning/remembering the times this movie was displayed in cinemas, NOT MANY PEOPLE were in cinemas. because MJF popularity was still weak (not really influenced enough in Hong Kong) around hong Kong. only back to the future that played in 1995 in TVB or ATV in Hongkong, then no more. that time people do not watch much English films. we only watch how funny and how the story goes, we don't even notice which actors play BTTF Marty mcfly, but Marty Mcfly is very remarkable in hongkong, we don't know that he is Michael J Fox. When Frighteners comes to Hongkong, my mom Sandra Ng. (facebook URL BingNg7, I am facebook URL Olivie.lo) and I went cinema watching frighteners, we were really delighted that not many people were watching. because the screen was clear enough to watch the whole movie, unlike pulp fiction times that a lot of people sitting in cinemas covering the screen bottom part, maybe you may think bottom part does not cover a lot of things, but some subtitles (we read Chinese subtitles when watching English movies) are covered. I don't have good English that time . that was why I am happy when frighteners was so outstanding and NOT MANY PEOPLE, I repeat, NOT MANY PEOPLE in cinemas. NOT MANY PEOPLE in cinemas as if this movie is junk/crappy/rubbish. but they were stupid, this movie is very remarkable, no wonder this movie is called ""being highly-underrated"". yes it's true, seriously underrated. people were stupid that they lost an opportunity to watch such a great movie. HOW STUPID. I am not being mean but those who had not watched this movie in cinemas must now be regretting when they watch this movie's DVD HAHA",The Frighteners

173,Be_Bad_Boy,Michael J Fox works brilliants - look how many scenes he acts alone without other people together!!!,10,31 July 2012,"The basic concept of what Jackson was trying to do with The Frighteners is what originally drew me to the movie (remember, this was back in the day when Jackson himself was relatively unknown). Unlike the Ghostbusters Peter Venkman, who was more than content to dupe people into believing in supernatural, the lead character in The Frighteners fully believes in the existence of the supernatural, even using his own connections with the supernatural world to help convince people they are being haunted. He then goes in and cleans up the haunting, charging exorbitant fees for his services. That subtle difference in a character's motivations really made me interested, especially knowing the lead was being played by Michael J. Fox, one of my favorite actors.The problem for Fox's Frank Bannister comes when his own con-job comes true, a real haunting is going on by an extremely nasty ghost who's not just haunting, but killing people. Due to his own supernatural powers, Bannister can see who the evil spirit has slated for death, putting him in the awkward position of stopping the spirit and saving the doomed people, even those who have attempted to debunk Bannister's abilities.Michael J. Fox is brilliant in the leading role. Until this point, most of the characters Fox had played were really goody-two-shoes types, from Back to the Future's to ""Family Ties"". Frank Bannister is a person who is uncomfortable around people due to his supernatural connections. There is nothing overt about Fox's performance that communicates this, it's in the little things: the way he conducts himself around people to his clothes and haircut. At the same time, Bannister isn't quite at home with the ghosts that surround him. Honestly, how comfortable could it be to have a ghostly old-west Judge chasing a ghost dog who's carrying his jawbone around your house? Considering how many of the scenes involved Fox filming to nothing but air (and adding the ghosts in later), his performance is quite amazing. Giving virtual performances is often a trying experience and not everyone can pull it off, but there's no doubt in Fox's performance that the ghost world he can see exists as strongly as the physical world.Fox isn't alone in the performance department though. Jackson filled his spirit world with some spectacular actors, from Fox's ""business partners"", '70s afro-ed Chi McBride and geeky Jim Fyfe, to the more characterized performances of The Judge (John Astin), the drill sergeant guardian of the graveyard (R. Lee Ermey) and the evil spirit himself, played by Jake Busey in a role that makes him seem a little too much like his old man. Jackson's selections are a far cry from his prior independent film, mostly gained through the advantage of having Robert Zemeckis as the Executive Producer.The Frighteners marks that in-between period of Jackson's career, as he transitioned from a small-time independent horror director to the big budget filmmaker he'd become. This transition means there are some aspects of Jackson's less polished filmmaking involved. Most notably is something that hasn't gone away yet in Jackson's career: his insistence on filming in New Zealand.",The Frighteners
174,markgndlf,first big PJ film,9,5 February 2006,"this is the first time, and not the last, that director PETER JACKSON has directed a big budget feature film to be distributed world wide. I say he does a great job. Its a real bridge for PJ, following his earlier horror comedies and absolutely insane drama, PJ seems to take all the elements he has learned over the years a blends them into a horror comedy where the horror is relevant. the use of models, though i am no expert in the craft of model construction, is quite impressive, if i might say so myself. he takes everything cliché about horror comedies and turns them around, thats maybe why not many people enjoyed the film, save for PETER JACKSON fans.",The Frighteners

Sometimes genuinely frightening, and sometimes quite humorous, this is an idiosyncratic and brilliant movie from the always hyperkinetic Peter Jackson.

In the best performance I've seen him give you have Michael J Fox - tv-/filmfriend of my teen years, so some nostalgia there - as a jaded ghosthunter struggling with his past, a grim reaper type that made me wonder what Peter Jackson would make his ringwraiths like, and actually: this grim reaper scared me more. Add to this more stunning special effects, like a scene at an old hospital where images of the past and present mix effortlessly, or the pretty comical ghosts. Not to mention one helluva freak investigator. There's more to say about the characters, notions of mind and matter, but at least lets not forget Danny Elfman on the soundtrack. All wrapped up in an interesting and original package. I for one am glad to have Peter Jackson showing Hollywood what movies should be like, with plots that make sense and characters that are followed through. Not the mindless crap that floats around nowadays, jumping on bandwagons. I've been disappointed a bit too often lately. Time to watch me this 'old' one. So should you.",The Frighteners

190,tracker1312,"Awesome visual effects, way ahead of it's time",10,16 January 2006,"I just got through watching the Director's Cut of ""The Frighteners."" I have to say first off that this is one of my favorite films of all time. I don't particularly like horror films (I don't like to be scared) and so when this movie came out at the theater my sister tried to get me to see it and I refused because I thought it would scare me.Needless to say when it came out on VHS she talked me into watching it and I regretted not going with her to see it in the theater. The story is unique and well told. I read some comments on this forum and people accuse it of being a knock-off of some films such as ""Ghostbusters."" This story and the cinematography of this film have absolutely nothing in common with ""Ghostbusters."" They both have ghosts as a central theme, but the similarity (or lack thereof) stops there.I have to admit that there are some small gaps in the plot that may leave questions in your mind if you watch the original release (especially if you watch it more than once because you always catch more the second time around), but I never found it enough to be that distracting. Part of this comes from them trying to cut the film down to less than two hours. If you really must know what was intended then watch the three hour and forty-five minute making-of documentary on the Director's Cut DVD.I could go on about the story, but I'm more of a Visual Effects person and so I think that for me, that's also why I like this movie so much. At the time the effects that they used were revolutionary. Many of the effects, such as the ghost crawling under the carpet in the beginning utilized proprietary code that was written specifically for this movie. Also the compositing was awesome. There were only a couple of spots in the movie where I could tell that the lighting wasn't quite right, and that was out of well over five hundred visual effects shots. To keep this in perspective, this movie was being filmed around the same time the first ""Toy Story"" was released, so that was the level of computer generated imagery that they had to work with. I think that they had fewer errors in their work than ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" that was just released. I saw more incorrect lighting and bad animation in ""Narnia"" than in ""The Frighteners."" It just goes to show you that advanced technology does not always make a better movie.Also, the release of this movie was pushed up by four months, which caused them to rush with wrapping up production. The DVD is also well worth buying if you're at all interested in film making, visual effects or any similar field. The documentary has a ton of behind-the-scenes footage, a tour of the early WETA computer and props department, and three full compositing breakdowns that show how they put the special effects together.I wouldn't say that you should buy this movie if you haven't seen it because everyone's tastes are different, but I would definitely borrow or rent it so you can decide whether you want it or not. Before the Director's cut was released, the original release on DVD was selling on eBay for thirty dollars or more because it was out-of-print and people were desperate to find it. I wound up paying nearly twenty for a used copy. Obviously this movie has a big cult following at any rate and that makes me happy, because I think that this film has been overlooked and underrated. It is definitely on my list of best movies of all time.",The Frighteners

For the rest he or she was completely right, it is a good movie but I don't agree with it being a tensed thriller because it all seemed pretty obvious to me. The effects are nice and it also has a bit of detective in it, Michael being the burned out detective. Now that I come to think of it the stories sort of similar to Constantine, only this one has more humor, and less drama. What starts of as a mysterious movie that could go in all directions ends up as more or less the standard -get the killer- movie only this killer is already dead! So that puts a nice twist to it! What exactly the role of the twisted FBI agent was still isn't quite clear to me but that don't matter, I was planning on see it again anyway. :P",The Frighteners
