0,MartinHafer,This movie is dumb and sure makes Arkansans look awful!,3,20 January 2015,"""Mud"" has a very respectable overall IMDb score of 7.5 and most of the reviews are glowing. So, in light of all this, I had very high hopes for the film. The story is about a couple 14 year-olds (Ellis and Neckbone) who come upon a homeless guy named Mud (Matthew McConaughey) living out in the woods. Despite not knowing the man, they decide to help him by bringing him food. Later, they agree to run errands for the guy. However, they then learn that he's a wanted man--wanted for murder. So, they continue helping him and even put their lives on the line because they know deep in their hearts that he's a great guy. So, as a result of watching the film I have learned some important life truths:1. If you meet a person living in the woods, help them. 2. If they are wanted for murder, listen to your heart--not the law enforcement authorities. 3. If you are 14, the best way to a girl's heart is start punching people. 4. If you are 14, set your sights for the hot 17 year-old girl and see #3. 5. Stealing and murder are okay if your heart is in the right place. 6. If you are a kid, talk to and trust strangers. 7. If you help a stranger, the stranger will never betray you and will be there when you need them. 8. Don't trust women...they're all alike. 9. Despite this, do ANYTHING a girl wants. 10. If you are on the run, go ahead, build a big bonfire at night. The list of other insane knowledge goes on and on and on. The bottom line is just about NOTHING in this film makes any sense--at least on this planet. Additionally, the film was filled with characters that were stupid, self-destructive and difficult to like. Plus, when you watch the film, it is quite possible that Mud was indeed bad and deserved prison....yet we are supposed to root for him?! Huh?!The only positives would be the acting and....well, actually, just some of the acting.",Mud
1,Leofwine_draca,Vapid characters and their uninteresting lives,2,22 October 2015,"MUD is another overrated film that many viewers (and reviewers) seem to mistake for a stylish masterwork. In fact it's a very dull social drama with thriller undertones about a couple of kids who befriend a bizarre homeless man who lives out in the woods, often making a boat suspended in a tree his bed for the night. What the other viewers seem to miss is that it's BORING.MUD has potential, I'll give it that. Scenes of the kids exploring and enjoying a lot hot summer bring to mind the greatness of MEAN CREEK and STAND BY ME, but that's where the similarities end. Instead, this film gets bogged down in small-scale drama, a definite look-at-me style of acting, and way too much sentiment. The inclusion of a crime family and a revenge-fuelled second half doesn't really ring true and when you don't care about the characters anyway, that doesn't help.It also doesn't help that I can't stand the overrated Matthew McConaughey as an actor. He always seems to swan around with his turgid under acting and he bores me to tears whenever he's on screen. At least this film isn't as offensive as KILLER JOE, but I still hated his character. The pity is that some decent character actors are mired in support (in particular, Michael Shannon and Paul Sparks, both of BOARDWALK EMPIRE). And as for Reese Witherspoon - the less said the better!",Mud
2,SnoopyStyle,Matthew's good and the kid's amazing,8,25 August 2013,"Ellis (Tye Sheridan) lives on a houseboat in Arkansas with his parents; Mary Lee (Sarah Paulson) and Senior (Ray McKinnon). Their marriage is falling apart as they scrounge for a living. He and his best friend Neckbone, who lives with his uncle Galen (Michael Shannon), find a boat high up in a tree on an island. They meet Mud (Matthew McConaughey).This is a perfect little movie. This is probably the most complete and deepest character Matthew McConaughey has ever played. Yet it's the outstanding work of newcomer Tye Sheridan that holds the whole thing together. This is only his second movie after 'The Tree of Life' and he absolutely shines here. This movie has a great sense of place. The actors are all great. Importantly, the characters are all deep and complex. It is a truly intriguing little movie.",Mud
3,Hitchcoc,Portrayal of a Time,8,22 March 2014,"I was pretty engaged in this film, particularly in the day-to-day existence of the boys who are at the center of it. It has an element of the ""Stand by Me"" mentality. The boys are bright and real and find themselves having to make decisions on a moral code that they have made for themselves. They are, for the most part, realistic about things, but the culture they are in is so boring and so lacking in stimulation that when the intriguing figure of Mud comes along, they are ready for adventure. Unfortunately, there are simply so many things that just aren't believable. Their access to everything they need when they need it. The ease of transport. The lack of suspicion from others (I know there is some). They also have an incredible amount of mobility. Then there is the contrived ""High Noon"" conclusion that is bound to happen. It is, itself, pretty demanding of our suspension of disbelief. Still, it keeps us entertained, the acting is quite admirable, particularly the supporting characters, but I expected a little more.",Mud
4,claudio_carvalho,Sensitive Movie about Love and Friendship,8,8 April 2014,"In Arkansas, the fourteen year-old Ellis (Tye Sheridan) lives in a floating house with his mother Mary Lee (Sarah Paulson) and his father Senior (Ray McKinnon). Ellis helps his father selling fish with his best friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland). Ellis and Neckbone find a motorboat stranded on the top of a tree in an island on the Mississippi River since a flood and they plan to fix the boat for them. One day, they climb the tree and they find fresh meal inside the boat meaning that someone is living in ""their"" boat. They leave the place and meet a man named Mud (Matthew McConaughey) near their boat. Soon they learn that the passionate Mud killed a man that had beaten up his girlfriend Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) and now the father and the brother of the deceased man are hunting him down. Mud makes a deal with the romantic Ellis and Neckbone to help him to reunite with Juniper. But when Ellis meets Mud's stepfather Tom (Sam Shepard), he has a different opinion about the love of Juniper with Mud. ""Mud"" is a sensitive movie about a romantic boy that tries to help a stranger to meet his beloved girlfriend. The story of love and friendship brought recollection of ""Stand by Me"" because of the charismatic characters Ellis and Neckbone. The performances are top-notch and the cinematography depicts wonderful locations along the Mississippi River. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Amor Bandido"" (""Bandit Love"")",Mud
5,nogodnomasters,DON'T GET BIT,8,1 September 2018,"The film centers on 14 year old Ellis (Tye Sheridan) who along with his friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) befriend a fugitive who lives isolated on on island in the middle of the Mississippi near Arkansas. Eliis learns hard lessons in life as he attempts to help Mud (Matthew McConaughey) all the while his parents are getting divorced and his whole life is changing.This is an interesting film involving character. The action moves at a medium pace while building and exploring character. A film more for indie lovers than those of the action genre. Worth a view.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some adult themes.",Mud
6,kosmasp,Slow Burning Highlight,9,22 May 2014,"Let me start with the kid actors. They are incredible to say the least. A movie like this could break when it comes to casting the roles of the two young males. This didn't and you don't feel they act in this at all. Michael Shannon has to take a step back (considering his previous outing with the director ""Take Shelter"" where he was the main character) and let Matthew McC. take over.And while he did win the Oscar for another movie (Dallas Buyers Club), this is equally mesmerizing, but not a show off role. But that can be said about the movie in itself. It's not a movie that has much action or big highlights. But it does have a story and it does have something to say. About growing up, about first love (and maybe last love?), about friendship, about family and about many other things. And it doesn't feel like it is preaching. More than nicely done! If you are into those sort of movies of course",Mud
7,classicsoncall,"""You gotta know what's worth keepin' and what's worth lettin' go.""",9,26 May 2013,"This is one of the few movies I've ever been enticed to see based on a trailer other than a favorite genre film I would have been predisposed to see anyway, say a Western or a good sci-fi flick. Fortunately the advertising worked, ""Mud"" is an effective movie with emphasis on story and character development that seems lacking in a majority of pictures today. Matthew McConaughey is superb as the title character in a role that belies his once daunted status as People Magazine's hottest hunk of the year. His performance alone is worth a trip to the movies, but he's supported by an equally able cast led by Tye Sheridan in what may arguably be the principal role of a young boy named Ellis, who along with best friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), embark on an adventure in the making on a Mississippi River island that's fraught with unknown danger.Some will call this a coming of age story, and in certain respects it is. I've read several reviews comparing the picture to ""Stand by Me"", but the one that came to mind as I sat in the theater was ""Goonies"", though without the humor and camaraderie that comes with a bunch of schoolyard pals. This film's focus on the two friends, Ellis and Neck, speaks to elements of loyalty, bravery and maturity as the story unfolds. One is never quite sure what to make of McConaughey's character; at one point he's revealed to be an incorrigible outlaw on the run from authority, but his actions throughout the story builds empathy with the viewer. In a revisionist Western, this would be making a hero of the villain, but not an ordinary villain. Mud is a complex character who's taken a wrong fork in the road, and for that he's forced to face the consequences.Don't be misled by the tag line of this film, the one about two teenage boys attempting to reunite Mud with his one true love. There's romance in that idea, but Ellis's awakening to what's really going on as the story plays out parallels the dashed expectations with his parents' marriage and a budding but doomed relationship of his own. Reese Witherspoon appears here in an atypical role in which she's neither a prom queen or a society girl. She's not on screen all that much really, so her second billing behind McConaughey would have more to do with her Hollywood status than her role in the story. Nevertheless her character is integral to Mud's self realization by the end of the tale.What finally won me over to Mud's character was a simple but effective plot element whereby Neckbone agreed to help out with the stranded boat in the tree. A deal was struck for the boys' aid in getting Mud off the island in exchange for Mud's pistol. No telling what kind of trouble that could have brought about at the finale, but Mud redeemed himself when he concluded his part of the arrangement - ""The deal was for the gun, not the bullets.""",Mud
8,gavin6942,Something of an Overlooked Gem,8,24 March 2014,"Two young boys encounter a fugitive (Matthew McConaughey) and form a pact to help him evade the vigilantes that are on his trail and to reunite him with his true love (Reese Witherspoon).This could be the breakout role for Tye Sheridan. Much like Jennifer Lawrence burst on to the scene with ""Winter's Bone"" and immediately went A-list, I could see Sheridan doing this in the near future. If IMDb is accurate, he already has more projects lined up than he has behind him -- a move in the right direction.Director Jeff Nichols somehow manages to consistently make some of the best films of the year but still get overlooked. Between this and ""Take Shelter"", he should be buried in awards, but seems to get placed on the honorable mention list. Next time? (This also goes for Nichols' muse, Michael Shannon. No one denies he is stupendously amazing... why not make him the household name he needs to be?)",Mud
9,jboothmillard,Mud,7,26 May 2020,"I'd missed this film a few times on TV, I always recognised the title because I remember the leading actor that is in it, it was rated well and sounded interesting, so I looked forward to it, directed by Jeff Nichols (Loving). Basically, in DeWitt, Arkansas, two fourteen-year-old boys, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), have found a boat stuck high in a tree on a small island on the Mississippi River. They want to claim it for themselves but find that someone is living in it. They soon meet the island's inhabitant, a strange man calling himself ""Mud"" (Matthew McConaughey). He tells the boys that he needs food and promises to give them the boat if they help him. The boys return with food and ask Mud why he is hiding out; he says he is waiting for his old girlfriend, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). They later spot Juniper in a grocery store, they recognise Mud's description of her, being beautiful with bird tattoos on her hands. Meanwhile, Ellis has a crush an older high-school girl named May Pearl (Bonnie Sturdivant). Ellis learns from his father, Senior (Ray McKinnon), that he and his mother, Mary Lee (Sarah Paulson), are getting divorced. This threatens their riverboat home, they could be removed. Ellis and Neckbone rush back to Mud and ask why the police are hunting him. Mud explains that he killed a bad man who got Juniper pregnant and pushed her down a flight of stairs, causing her to lose the child. The boys make a new deal with Mud to help him in exchange for his gun. Mud sends Ellis to Tom Blankenship (Sam Shepard), an older father figure from his childhood, for help. Tom lives across the river from Ellis and but refuses to help Mud when it is mentioned that he is in trouble over Juniper again. After being rejected by Tom, Mud gives the boys a note to give to Juniper. They find her motel room where another man, Carver (Paul Sparks), brother of the man Mud killed, is abusing her. Ellis charges at the man, he is overpowered, but Juniper hurts him and forces him to leave. The boys tell Juniper about Mud, she warns them not to get involved, but they want to help them both. Neckbone and Ellis return to Mud and tell him about the man. Mud realises that the family of the man he killed are looking for him and want to kill him. King Carver (Joe Don Baker), the father of the man Mud murdered, his son and a handful of bounty hunters talk about staking out Juniper's motel and have paid off the local and state police. The boys help Mud repair the unregistered boat, stealing machine parts and an outboard motor from junkyards, as this is his only means of escape. They develop a plan to reunite Juniper with Mud, but she does not show up after agreeing a meeting, instead she is in a bar flirting with other men. Ellis and Neckbone tell Mud about it and that Juniper didn't want to come. Ellis give Juniper a note from Mud, telling her it is over between them. Although she says she understands, Juniper tells Ellis that Mud is a born liar and she is sick of running away with him. Ellis is dejected, not only by failing to help a couple in love, but he is rejected by May Pearl in front of her friends. Upon returning to the island, Ellis angrily hits Mud, calling him a liar, saying he has used the boys and turned them into thieves. Running away, Ellis falls into a pit containing water snakes and is bitten. Mud jumps in and rescues Ellis. Mud races to get the unconscious Ellis to hospital. Mud is a wanted man, recognising his photograph hospital employees call the police, meaning Carver is tipped off. Mud manages to return to the island where he and Neckbone get the repaired boat into the water. As they agreed before, Mud gives Neckbone his pistol but without bullets. Mud wants to say goodbye to Ellis, so Neckbone takes him to the houseboat where he is recovering. While Mud is in Ellis's room, the Carver son and his posse arrive and start shooting. Tom kills several attackers with his old sniper rifle from across the river. Mud saves Ellis, kills Carver, and tries to get away but is shot and falls into the river. The police arrive and find all the posse members dead. One trooper calls King to tell him that his other son is now dead. Ellis's parents separate and the houseboat is demolished; his mother moves into a new apartment in town, while his father gets a new job far away. Ellis's father tells his son to take care of his mother and departs. Ellis sees some attractive older teenage girls there and smiles. He is uncertain of Mud's fate, but still believes he was protecting Juniper. Mud is revealed to be alive and recovering on the repaired boat driven by Tom. Days later, a recovered Mud and Tom look ahead at the mouth of the Mississippi River, and further at the Gulf of Mexico. Also starring Michael Shannon as Galen, and Stuart Greer as Miller. McConaughey gives a terrific performance as the charming anti-hero fugitive, Witherspoon is likeable in her time as his girlfriend, and the young actors helping the lead character are talented. A simple story of two young lads helping a wanted man is turned into something on an adventure, similar in many ways to Stand By Me, with wonder, a love story element, crime, characters having self-discovery and youngsters ""growing up"", a most worthwhile coming-of-age drama. Very good!",Mud
10,Tweekums,A fine coming of age story,9,19 March 2014,"This coming of age drama follows two teenaged boys, Ellis and 'Neckbone' living on the river in Arkansas. One day while exploring an island Neckbone shows Ellis a boat that he has found high up in a tree; stranded after the last flood. As they investigate the boat they realise that somebody has been living in it. That somebody is a man who goes by the name of Mud. As they get to know him they learn that he was wanted for the murder of the man who hurt the woman he loves. It isn't just the police who are searching for him; the dead man's family are keen to exact their revenge too. Mud persuades the two boys to help him get the parts he needs to get the boat down and running again. This could be dangerous; not only because of the men looking for Mud but also because it is quite possible that Mud isn't exactly being honest with them either. While this is going on Ellis also learns a few lessons about love when he falls for a girl and has to contend with the break-up of his parents' marriage.I really enjoyed this film; Matthew McConaughey did a fine job as the eponymous Mud but it was young Tye Sheridan who was the real star in the role of Ellis. The story moved along slowly but that wasn't a bad thing; it gave us time to get to know the characters and even fitted in with the setting a languid place where things shouldn't be rushed. Writer/director Jeff Nichols did a great job creating believable characters; the boys acted like children of their age rather than clichéd children that often appear in films and the hero doesn't always get the girl.Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you enjoyed films like 'Stand By Me' a film I couldn't help being reminded about while watching this.",Mud
11,michaelRokeefe,Almost Mark Twain-like coming of age movie. Don't Miss!,8,30 December 2014,"Two Mississippi teens meet a drifter and are lured by his tales of adventure and woe. Ellis(Tye Sheridan)and his running buddy Neckbone(Jacob Loftland) live along the Mississippi River and earn money by selling oysters and a variety of things ""picked up"" or traded for. The boys being boys make sail to a small island where they discover a houseboat suspended in the trees. It is theirs, because they found it. That is not the only thing secretive on the island. Ellis and Neckbone meet a mysterious drifter and fugitive, who is actually trying to live in the boat. This stranger wants to be called Mud(Matthew McConaughey)and has the boys glued to every word of lost love, crimes and bounty hunters.The boys are persuaded to ""find"" what parts they can to help Mud make the boat seaworthy. Mud is planning to hook up with his long time girlfriend, Juniper(Reese Witherspoon)and sail away from serious bounty hunters. Ellis falls deep into this tale of love lost and believes himself to be in love. But his mismatched love affair is one sided and almost immediately has his heart broken. The tale of Mud's that love conquers all, is now discouraging. Ellis still continues the plan of helping Juniper and Mud reunite.I found this compelling with real fleshed out characters; and a believable story of coming of age. More and more, I'm becoming a McConaughey fan. Witherspoon puts in a lot of effort playing such a character off of her beaten path. And talk about hot! But not so much a faithful girlfriend. The two young boys were believable, but I liked Sheridan's grasp of the project. I hope MUD attracts some awards and acknowledgment.Also featured in the cast: Sam Shepard, Sarah Paulson, Joe Don Baker, Michael Shannon and Bonnie Sturdivant.",Mud

Low-Key in Style and Believable Situations Move the Film as things Unfold at a Steady and Leisurely Pace Befitting its Riverside Existence as Things just keep Rolling Along.The Inevitable Climax is both Rewarding and Exciting as it Culminates in a Confrontational Clash that is Unexpected and quite Off-Center Considering the rest of the Movie.

13,zardoz-13,An Above-Average Coming-of-Age Tale on the Mississippi River,7,24 May 2013,"Real mud sticks to your shoes, but Arkansas writer and director Jeff Nichols' cinematic ""Mud"" isn't as adhesive. A superb ensemble cast featuring Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, and Joe Don Baker breathe life into credible characters, but those characters lack charisma. Nichols brings an indie film sensibility to this stark, sometimes poignant, manhunt melodrama told from the perspective of a 14-year old kid and his younger friend in the rural South. For the most part, Nichols trafficks realism, and he doesn't sugar coat the narrative until an ending that appears more mainstream that anything that precedes it. The characters in ""Mud"" are a conflicted lot, and the conflict arises between couples with the children suffering the collateral damage. Nichols grounds this yarn in true-life authenticity. Most of everything here could literally have occurred without stretching the truth as most movies are obliged these days to satisfy the target demographic. The irony is that the hero and the heroine are never destined to cross paths, and two inquisitive teenagers do their utmost as go-betweens to ensure that these love birds meet. Nichols and lenser Adam Stone filmed this coming-of-age tale in rural Arkansas. Nothing about this manhunt romance has that obnoxious blockbuster Hollywood look. The tousle-head, tattooed McConaughey plays his usual easygoing character, but this time he is on the wrong side of justice. He is cast as a killer who only wants to reunite with his girlfriend. Reese Witherspoon is the slutty girlfriend who searches for love in all the wrong places, while Joe Don Baker plays the vengeful father of the man that McConaughey gunned down. Despite its high believability factor, ""Mud"" unfolds like a dreary thriller without a shred of humor. The real action occurs toward the end, and it is a bullet-riddled massacre aboard a riverboat. The ending is a liability, too, because it looks like just the kind of scene the studio would demand. Indeed, the ending is too good to be true. ""Mud"" is the kind of movie that sets up and then takes you down. Metaphorically, the 14-year old who champions the cause of Mud (Matthew McConaughey) emerges as a younger version of him.The best movies with this indie sensibility are designed to entice us and then shatter our illusions as Mud shatters the illusions of Tye Sheridan who plays Ellis. Ellis and his friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) cruise out in their boat to an island in the middle of the river where they find a boat stuck in a tree as the result of a flood. Imagine their surprise when the two lads discover that somebody has been living in it. Mud wins their sympathy almost immediately. He is a fugitive on the lam with the authorities setting up roadblocks to catch him. According to Mud, he is in their neck of the woods because he grew up there and he is pursuing the love of his life, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon of ""Legally Blond), but this Reese isn't the Reese you've seen in some many other films. She is basically a road whore moving from one low-life bar dive to the next. Mud shot a guy who abused her, and they've agreed to rendezvous in this backwater town. No sooner has Juniper arrived in town than a small army of shotgun wielding ruffians show up to shadow her. Ellis and Neckbone manage to find Juniper, but one of these thugs smacks Ellis around. Ellis believes in love, and he stands up for a girl several years his senior. She agrees to go out on a date with him, and he is surprised when she dumps him later. Ellis and Mud turn out to be a lot alike in the long run. Rounding out the cast is Sam Sheppard who plays a former U.S. Marine sniper who lives on the river near Ellis and his parents. Mike Shannon makes the most of a supporting role as Neckbone's uncle who has built his own deep-sea diving outfit to harvest muscles on the river bottom. Altogether, as promising as it is, ""Mud"" isn't as good as it could have been, but it is a relief to see something that lacks contrivance and boasts human frailty.",Mud
14,grantss,"Intriguing, moving coming-of-age film",8,19 May 2014,"Intriguing, moving coming-of-age film. Sort of Stand By Me meets Beasts of the Southern Wild.Interesting plot, which starts as a mystery, progresses to a love story and then action movie, and ends with some lessons on life and love, and growing up. Not perfect: has some moments which feel contrived and a few minor plot holes.Quite emotional too. The doomed romance between Mud and Juniper and the lessons Ellis learns about love and life are quite poignant. Yet, despite this there is hope. Mud's failures are lessons to Ellis, and you can already see them taking effect. Excellent performance by Matthew McConaughey in the lead role. Dallas Buyers Club will probably go down as the pinnacle of the Mcconaissance, and The Lincoln Lawyer as the start of it, but Mud deserves a mention in his progression.Tye Sheridan shows maturity beyond his years as Ellis. He is a future star in the making.Reese Witherspoon gets second billing but actually has little screen time or lines.Good support from Jacob Lofland, Sam Shepard, Ray McKinnon, Sarah Paulson and Michael Shannon.",Mud

16,evanston_dad,McConaughey's Name Is Mud,8,1 April 2014,"Lest anyone think Matthew McConaughey's Oscar-winning performance in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" was a fluke, let ""Mud"" serve as exhibit B that the man can actually act.I would never have dreamed that I would ever be defending McConaughey's acting ability, but his work in 2013 -- the two above mentioned films along with his brief but scene-stealing work in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" -- has made a believer out of me. In ""Mud,"" which also serves as his character's name, he plays a man on the run, hiding out on an island in a Mississippi backwater. Two young boys find him, and he strikes up a friendship with them, using them as fences to bring him supplies while he plots his escape. One of the boys, played winningly by Tye Sheridan, develops a romanticized image of Mud, and especially of Mud's passion for his one true love, played by Reese Witherspoon, who's holed up in a hotel waiting for a signal from Mud to join him and run away with him. The boy's infatuation with Mud and his circumstances is driven largely by the decidedly unromantic nature of his troubled home life. Mud represents a heroic figure the boy fails to see in his own father, a beleaguered man who's browbeaten by an unhappy wife (Sarah Paulson). And the love between Mud and his girl is a nice stand in for the love that has evaporated from his parents' marriage.But ""Mud,"" as the title of the movie might suggest, is about the murkiness of the adult world, its complications, and the inability of a young boy to be able to appreciate adult feelings, motivations and personalities for what they are. It's a unique take on the standard coming-of-age formula, and it makes for one heck of a good movie.The film stumbles a bit at the end, when its languorous rhythms are disrupted by some Hollywood trappings, namely an implausible shootout and an unrealistically happy ending. But the movie leading up to that is so good that the ending registers as a bump rather than a full on derailment.Grade: A",Mud

When they get there they discover a boat which just happens to be firmly planted high up in a large tree. Upon climbing the tree and looking inside the boat they notice that there is some fresh food inside and realize that somebody has taken up residence in it. They soon meet the person who goes by the name of ""Mud"" (Matthew McConaughey) who says they can have the boat if they will bring him some food. When asked why he doesn't get his own food he replies that he is waiting on someone and cannot leave the island at this time. Eventually, the two boys realize that the person he is waiting on is a young woman named ""Juniper"" (Reese Witherspoon) and the reason he cannot leave the island is because he is currently wanted for murder. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that, even though the story was interesting to a certain degree, the film moved at a rather slow pace and seemed to go on forever. It seemed quite sluggish. In any case, I rate the movie as slightly below average.",Mud
18,ferguson-6,A Helluva Thing,8,27 April 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/director Jeff Nichols' follow-up to his very strong Take Shelter is a grounded, rustic look at what it means to become a man. While that may be enough, it also works as a chase movie, a buddy movie, a family drama, and a look at small town dynamics ... all seen through the eyes of 14 year old Ellis (Tye Sheridan from The Tree of Life).Matthew McConaughey stars as Mud, a drifter who quickly captures the fascination of Ellis and his buddy Neckbone (newcomer Jacob Lofland) as their worlds collide under a boat in a tree just off the Mississippi River in rural Arkansas. Turns out Mud is a bit of a philosopher who wins Ellis over spinning life yarns that come just as Ellis' parents (Ray McKinnon from O' Brother, Where Art Thou?, and Sarah Paulson from Martha Marcy May Marlene) are hitting a rough patch and he is trying to figure out just how the female species fits into the whole big picture. Mud lays out a beautiful story of how he killed a man protecting his true love Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Now Mud is being chased by the man's family (brother Carver played by Paul Sparks, and father King played by the too-rarely seen Joe Don Baker - looking great at age 77).Michael Shannon has a few scenes as Neckbone's Uncle who makes a living by diving for mussels in the river. You might remember how terrific Shannon was in Nichols' Take Shelter, and he has become quite an interesting and dependable character actor in various projects. Even more impressive is Sam Shepard as Tom Blankenship ... the father figure for Mud, and a quiet river guy with quite a past. Shepherd's first scene with Ellis is brilliant and could generate a campaign for Best Supporting Actor if this film can reach a wide enough audience.The story is filled with numerous little realistic touches and it's so original that there is no perfect comparison ... though it does have some of the feel of Stand By Me, which is quite a compliment. It is difficult to remember another film where Beanie Weenies were such a valued prop, or where a boat in a tree became a negotiating point, or where the unhurried pace led to such tension. McConaughey deserves special mention because he has clearly broken free of his early career Him-Bo roles and can now be considered a legitimate actor. He is simply outstanding in the role of Mud. We sense the danger that follows him, but are enchanted with his connection to the boys. David Wingo's score is the perfect cap for this little gem. www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com",Mud
19,anaconda-40658,Rock.,10,19 June 2015,"Mud (2012): Dir: Jeff Nichols / Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Tye Sheridan, Jacob Lofland, Sam Shepard: This is a story of a guy grinding in the dirt for something emotionally damaging. Matthew McConaughey plays Mud and he resides on an island living in a boat in a tree. He is discovered by two teenage boys boating off the main land. They befriend and discover that Mud awaits his girlfriend. He is wanted for murder. She was involved with a guy whom got her pregnant and then beat her until she lost the baby. Mud shot the guy dead and now lays low due to the victim's brother, father and several bounty hunters on the lookout. Director Jeff Nichols does a great job at balancing the subplots. As Mud McConaughey delivers one of his best performances as someone living off whatever resources he can find. Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland are superb as the two boys. Sheridan as Ellis experiences the deceit of love as well as the brutal realities of adulthood as his parents prepare for divorce. Lofland is given the nick name Neckbone and lives with his uncle. Reese Witherspoon appears as Mud's girlfriend whose lifestyle is problematic. She loves Mud but is often involved in abusive relationships leaving Ellis and Neckbone sympathetic for Mud's dilemma. Sam Shepard has a great supporting role as Mud's father who is not pleased with some of his son's decisions but ultimately feels he must be there when needed. Well written with a rousing climax, Mud ultimately proves that despite dreams going sour there is still a way out of the muck to proceed towards a promising horizon. Score: 10 / 10",Mud
20,Wuchakk,To love or not love in Arkansas along the Mississippi,7,24 March 2018,"RELEASED IN 2012-2013 and written & directed by Jeff Nichols, ""Mud"" is a southern gothic crime drama taking place in Arkansas along the Mississippi River where two boys discover a fugitive named Mud (Matthew McConaughey) hiding out on an island and decide to help him evade the authorities & vigilantes that are on his trail in hope of reuniting him with his true love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). This is a film about authentic Southern people and the code by which they live. Urbanized types usually refer to them as ""rednecks."" While some of them may be ""white trash,"" most of them are not. They're independent of the government, hardworking and respectful citizens, not to mention rooted in Christian morality, although not necessarily Christians. The film respects the intelligence of the viewer, leaving it to him/her to read between the lines. It's similar to ""Joe,"" which was released a year later, but not as abrasively pessimistic and is overall better. In tone, it's akin to ""Undertow"" (2004) and ""Snow Angels"" (2007). If you appreciate those flicks, you'll like ""Mud."" There are a lot of gems to mine: Ellis (Tye Sheridan) mirrors Mud as an adolescent. Will he make the same mistakes that brought Mud to his current state? The movie's basically a rumination on the potential in both masculinity and femininity for good or bad, but the focus is more on the toxicity of some women, which is refreshing, as Hollywood tends to paint men as evil incarnate or thoroughly inept while women are usually sterling examples of eminent nobility (Why Sure!). The film also reveals the idealization of love and how ""love is blind."" Just because you truly love someone in a romantic sense doesn't mean s/he is good for you and that you should develop & maintain a relationship. I was never a fan of Witherspoon, but didn't dislike her either. In any case, she's quite good as the seemingly innocent-yet-toxic love interest. Bonnie Sturdivant is excellent as her teenage counterpart, May Pearl; they should've done more with her. THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hour 10 minutes and was shot in Arkansas (Crocketts Bluff, Eudora, Dumas and Stuttgart). ADDITIONAL CAST: Sam Shepard, Michael Shannon, Paul Sparks and Joe Don Baker.

21,gradyharp,'He's not dangerous.',10,8 August 2013,"Writer/director Jeff Nichols presents a film with many levels of meaning and entertainment. It is at once a thriller of sorts, a mystery, a love song that manages to touch every character in the drama, a character study of a lovesick criminal on the run and a coming age story for a 14 year old boy discovering all the permutations of love and belonging and family and needs. It is a remarkable stage for the talents of Matthew McConaughey and Tye Sheridan and will likely place them in the Oscars race.The best synopsis of the film has been summarized by Roadside Attractions and is referenced here: '14 year-old Ellis (Tye Sheridan) lives on a makeshift houseboat on the banks of a river in Arkansas with his parents, Mary Lee (Sarah Paulson) and Senior (Ray McKinnon). He sneaks out early one morning to meet his best friend, Neckbone (Jacob Lofland). Neckbone, also 14, lives with his uncle, Galen (Michael Shannon), who makes a hardscrabble living diving for oysters. The two boys set out to an island on the Mississippi River, where Neckbone has discovered an unusual sight-a boat, suspended high in the trees, a remnant of an extreme flood some time in the past. They climb the tree and into the boat only to find fresh bread and fresh footprints. Realizing that they are not the only ones who have discovered the treehouse boat, they decide to leave. When they reach the shore, they find the same footprint in their boat. And that's when they meet Mud (Matthew McConaughey). Mud is a gritty, superstitious character; his clothes are dirty, his tooth is cracked, and he needs help. He tells the boys he will give them the treehouse boat, his current hideout, in exchange for food. Neckbone is reluctant, but Ellis brings food to Mud, and they develop a tentative friendship. Ellis learns that Mud has killed a man in Texas, and police and bounty hunters are looking for him, but Mud is more concerned about reuniting with his longtime love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Ellis, who has recently developed his own crush, agrees to help Mud escape with Juniper. Ellis and Neckbone carry out bold schemes in an effort to protect Mud and relay messages to Juniper, who is holed up in a fleabag motel, under constant surveillance by Carver (Paul Sparks), a Texas bounty hunter. Carver and his gang are intent on capturing Mud, on orders from the cold-blooded King (Joe Don Baker). As the boys risk everything to reunite these seeming mythical lovers, Ellis's own ideas about love and romance are challenged by the strains in the relationships closest to him: his parents' marriage is dissolving while he himself falters in his efforts to impress May Pearl (Bonnie Sturdivant). Through it all, Ellis struggles to look for an example of love that he can believe in, learning about the unspoken rules and risks of love and the reality of heartbreak.'As important and impressive as the story is the overwhelming aspects of the film are the moments when the concept and meaning of love is shared - many times, by many people, in many ways. It is insightful and deeply moving. This is a film that proves that a fine entertainment visually can also be a great cerebral fix! Grady Harp",Mud
22,deloudelouvain,Southern river boat house people drama,8,23 May 2016,"The least we can say is that director Jeff Nichols did a very good job with Mud. Even though it's longer then two hours it's a very enjoyable drama to watch. One where you won't get bored for a second. The cast is outstanding. Matthew McConaughey is the main character because the movie is called after him, and he did an excellent job with his character, but what I will remember the most is the excellent acting from the two youngsters Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland. Their innocent characters, ready to believe anything Mud tells them, and helping him getting his love life sorted out, makes Mud a drama that you watch with full attention. The rest of the cast fits perfectly well in the story. A story well written that deserved to be watched at least once. Looking forward to watch more movies from Jeff Nichols.",Mud
23,Mr-Fusion,Boyhood idealism falls to adult realism,7,30 June 2015,"For some reason, I always perceived ""Mud"" as some kind of adventure in the Huck Finn vein (haven't read Twain since high school . . . I should fix that). An adventure, this is not, but it is a mystery, with two teens (Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland) getting mixed up with fugitive McConaughey on the river. And it is that mystery that kept me humming along (that and Sheridan, the shining star of this movie), despite its molasses pacing. But even with the odd ""women are deceitful"" message and the violent end to all of this, it's a pretty great coming-of-age tale.And there's a somehow-everything-turns-out-alright ending that leaves an impression.7/10",Mud

25,StevePulaski,Multiple different angles immensely elevate a tired story,10,27 April 2013,"Instantaneously, Mud brought me back to days past when my friend and I would explore the woods near my house. The woods were by no means deep, located closely to a golf-course and an apartment complex, but they were all that we had and we loved them. We'd be on the hunt for golf balls, and would often stumble upon such ""treasures"" as rubber tires, potpourri, cigarette butts, beer bottles, and broken glass. Upon finding them, we'd make up stories on how they got there, and often, if we had a sleepover, listen for teenagers, bums, or whoever may be out there in the middle of the night leaving such objects.Unfortunately, our closeted adventures and theories never amounted to anything but spur-of-the-moment daydreams. If only we could've had an experience like the characters in Jeff Nichols' Mud, a fantastic drama centered on growing up in the deep south. And yet, such an oversimplification may lead potential viewers to think it's a story they've seen many times before, when really, the film's multiple angles allow it to be looked at and enjoyed in several different ways. This is, simply put, one of the best, most wonderful films of the year.The story narrows in on the likes of Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), two fourteen year olds hungering for adventure, girls, and excitement in their lives. Ellis lives with his miserable father and his unsatisfied mother, while Neckbone resides with his womanizing uncle. They discover on an island located distally from their home that there is a large boat stuck in a tree, housing food and pornographic magazines showing signs that someone lives there. That man, they find, is Mud (Matthew McConaughey), a fugitive housing a checkered past and now making due with little in the middle of nowhere, attempting to reconnect with his love Juniper (Reese Witherspoon).The boys decide to help Mud reconnect with her and reside out in the middle of nowhere, until it becomes apparent that because the entire town is plastered with his pictures that he needs to get out. What unfolds is a beautiful tale of love, coming-of-age hardships, and family issues that result in a wholesome, gritty exercise that provides for numerous emotions to take fold.One questions the motive of the boys to continue to help Mud, even after discovering what horror he committed. Because Ellis's parents are enduring hellish circumstances and losing love in one another, his commitment to helping Mud find Juniper seems stronger than Neckbone's because he doesn't want to see a couple who should be together remain distant. This is one of the many lenses you can see Mud through. The film is such a visceral, multi-layered experience that each person has the ability to find something different or subtly unique that lies within the story's seemingly direct roots.Even after Nichols enthralling Take Shelter, which headlined Michael Shannon who is present in a small role here, he continues to have a growing fascination with skylines and the rural environment that his characters reside in. He seems to take a deep satisfaction in the presence of sleepy towns, beautiful, limitless skies, glowing sunlight, quickly-forming clouds, and the dustiness and wholesomeness of the south's environment. Scarcely has such a simple coming-of-age film achieved the beauty and majestic look that Mud effortlessly concocts.Although it is not a tense, pulse-racing epic, the film still plays something like the kinds of ""fugitive-on-the-loose"" pictures you'd see from the early seventies. It still has that questionable uncertainty in its premise that allows it to be worthily thought of as the kind of film where the mystifying fugitive turns out to be something a bit more than a loser, but the way Nichols presents Mud is anything but the sappy sob-story we sort of expect.And finally, Mud can be simply seen as a rural coming-of-age story, not far off from the likes of Rob Reiner's impeccable Stand By Me, which, too, centered on young kids become more unified because of a dangerous adventure. There's nothing wrong with looking at Mud simplistically, as a drama centered around early-teenagers, because even when you do that, you still get a wonderful, more-than-complete package with performances that are enriching and an adventure that's unbelievable. Matthew McConaughey, again, gives an astonishingly capable performance after coming off of the likes of the beautifully quirky Bernie, the unfairly-ostracized Magic Mike, and the haunting, yet enigmatic Killer Joe. It's safe to say that McConaughey has made enough money so that he can shy away from the pathetic romantic-comedy or dull actioneer in favor of riskier, more reclusive projects that test him as an actor. Teaming up with Jeff Nichols was certainly the right bet, as this is closest to the most perfect movie experiences I've had all year.NOTE: My video review of Mud, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdnX_uIL6tM Starring: Matthew McConaughey, Tye Sheridan, Jacob Lofland, Reese Witherspoon, Joe Don Baker, and Michael Shannon.

26,blanbrn,"A journey of coming of age combined with love, loss, and getting away.",8,26 August 2013,"I must say that ""Mud"" is an interesting picture a little drama that's combined with suspense and twist and turns. It's really a film of loss, and it combines with a journey of two boys coming of age with an anti hero getting away in the end. The story takes place in rural Arkansas and the adventures begin on the banks and islands of the Mississippi River when a young boy named Ellis gets away from his riverboat to team up with his best friend Neckbone, and upon traveling to the bank they find a strange guy named ""Mud""(McConaughey)and this con man tells the boys wonderful stories and it's gruesome and true that he killed a man in Texas. And this is why Mud is hiding out thru it all he wants to get back with his girlfriend Juniper(sweetheart and the sexy Reese Witherspoon). This film then becomes an incredible journey of life a blood hunt of survival and will and wit to live. A local man Tom Blankenship(Sam Shepard)monitors the game from the sidelines only he comes to the playing field in the end. Overall ""Mud"" is a compelling drama a journey of hope and rediscovery it's one film to watch.",Mud
27,KineticSeoul,People that fell in love before and have a heart might like this film,7,10 August 2013,"Now when I first watched this film I just didn't know what to expect. It just seemed like one of those boring books the teachers made us read during middle school and high school. Except it's in movie form. So in another words it felt a bit dry and boring. But what sold me was the message behind the movie. Which is about a boy who meets a man named Mud and the distance he is going for a girl. And thus really wants to believe in love and loyalty after his parents break-up. And tries hard to experience love even while going through struggles himself. In another words it's a coming of age film that after it was finished, felt like it left something. This movie does a good job of bringing out that white-trash aspects of it and the whole cast did a believable job. It's a no-brainer to cast Matthew McConaughey, cause he is just superb at bringing out that southern feel. Those who have fallen in love before or has a heart to believe in love. And has the patience(when it comes to films) and the maturity can probably like this film. And like the reason why the books our teachers made us read is a classic. There is a reason why this film stands out as well.7.7/10",Mud
28,Hellmant,Beautifully captures the wonders of childhood!,10,22 May 2013,"'MUD': Five Stars (Out of Five)Beautiful coming of age drama set in Arkansas, which is the home state of it's writer and director Jeff Nichols (who also helmed the 2011 dramatic thriller 'TAKE SHELTER'). In this film Nichols was inspired by the works of Mark Twain and tells the story of two teenage boys who befriend a fugitive they find hiding out on an island on the Mississippi River. They decide to help him evade the law, as well as a group of bounty hunters trying to kill him, in order to reunite him with his childhood sweetheart. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey in the title role, as the fugitive, and newcomers Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland as the young boys. It's funny that the movie's central star, Sheridan, did also appear in the 2011 Terrence Malick film 'THE TREE OF LIFE' because it's one of my favorite coming of age films, of the last few years, that I thought beautifully captured what it's like to be a kid growing up. This film, I think, might even do a better job!The film centers on two 14-year-old boys who are best friends living in Arkansas, Ellis (Sheridan) and Neckbone (Lofland). Ellis lives with his parents (Sarah Paulson and Ray McKinnon) in a houseboat on the riverbanks and Neckbone lives with his uncle (Michael Shannon, who starred in both of Nichols previous films). Ellis helps his father in his business selling fish and Neckbone helps his uncle make a living by diving for crabs. Just as Ellis is exploring his feelings with girls for the first time, and asks an older girl out (Bonnie Sturdivant), his parents begin a separation which threatens his father's livelihood. One day when Ellis and Neckbone are out on an adventure they find a fugitive going by the name of Mud (McConaughey) living in a boat, stuck in the trees from a flood years earlier, on an island on the Mississippi River. They're immediately caught up with this adventurous character as he tells them tales of a man he killed in self defense of the woman he loves (Reese Witherspoon). They soon get involved in his adventures with him, helping him elude the cops and a group of bounty hunters (who want revenge for the man he killed) while trying to reunite him with his woman.The film is highlighted by beautiful cinematography (by Adam Stone), a breathtaking score (by David Wingo), great performances, a touching and heartfelt story and masterful directing. Everything that makes a truly great film great. I enjoyed Nichol's film 'TAKE SHELTER' a lot but here he truly proves himself to be a great director. Tye Sheridan delivers a very impressive star-making performance and Matthew McConaughey is becoming one of my favorite actors; I wasn't a fan of his early on (and thought he was more just a prettyboy) but with his last several performances he's proved himself to be one of the more talented actors working in film today! The best thing about the film though is the way it beautifully captures the wonders of childhood. Nichols made the film based on his own experiences with his crushes, on several girls, and experiencing the devastation of heartbreak at a young age. He shows this very well in the film and it's something I can really relate to. It's just a great coming of age tale and probably the best film I've seen so far this year!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_1fzjYYyuk",Mud
29,thesar-2,Mud & Muddier,10,6 August 2013,"Immediately, allow me to begin with: Mud, probably a long-shot, is my current (8/6/13) selection for the Best Picture Oscar of 2013.This movie was absolutely brilliant. Deep, all-around well acted, original and a true love story. In a world that features Channing Tatum and produces someone-always-has-to-die sappy Nicholas Sparks ""love"" stories, it's refreshing to see an adult love movie with real-life people and real-life problems.Not to mention, this was one of those excellent movie experiences of mine that I went into not knowing a dang thing about, except it starred Matthew McConaughey, was called Mud and a lot of people really liked it. I absolutely love going into a movie cold; no trailer viewing, no review reading and, ABSOLUTELY, no spoilers.I really liked the first half of this movie. The performances and characters stood out, the story engrossed me and the cinematography was very nice. But, admittedly, it wasn't until the second half begun that I took to this story, this love yarn and this brilliant piece of filmmaking. Typically, I don't care for slower-moving pictures and this may seem like one, but to me, it was never once slow. There was always something going on. Whether it was the plot twists or the snappy, wonderful, non-stop and brilliant deliveries from McConaughey, I enjoyed every bit of this movie.Basically, Mud was about, well, Mud (McConaughey,) a drifter and somewhat ""islander"" and his journey to reunite with ""his soul-mate"" with the aid of two boys – Ellis (played excellently by Tye Sheridan) and his best-bud, Neckbone (Jacob Lofland.) They, the boys, have their own issues to deal with, but Ellis probably sees a lot in Mud as he does himself. And I'm sure Mud feels the same way.There's a lot more story here and I encourage you, noI implore you, to discover the rest. I certainly do NOT want to give away any of the suspense, great performances (like Reese Witherspoon's) or what these characters need to learn and how they grow. Just enjoy the movie and how things play out.Sadly, with the film's release date in May and the ancient Academy Award voter's short-term memory, this might get overlooked. God help us if this doesn't even get a nomination for Best Actor (McConaughey AND Sheridan,) Best Cinematography, Screenplay and, of course, Best Picture.I told a movie-loving friend at work all about my feeling on this movie. I also told him how I cannot wait to see this movie again. This is true. This is an excellent example of mastery in movies.",Mud
30,Robert_duder,A brilliant drama and a beautiful haunting love story,9,24 August 2013,"I honestly wasn't sure what to expect from Mud at all. I had seen one or two trailers and heard a little about it. I sort of expected it to be an art-house film full of symbolism and oddities. It wasn't! I don't think that's a bad thing or a good thing but it was a straight forward drama. It was slow paced but a beautifully shot and brilliantly bleak coming of age story with a Stand By Me feel to it. It doesn't specify the year it takes place but I think it had a distinct late 80's feel to it. It is so bleak and sad and captivating. There is so much story that you don't get to see that you have to piece together from the story that is going on in front of you. Mud is a story of unrequited love. This man has spent his entire life idolizing and loving this girl with all his heart only to be constantly disappointed and stomped on. He will go to the ends of the earth and has even found himself a fugitive while protecting her. This story is all happening amidst two young boys who are coming of age and dealing with their own family issues. You cannot turn away from this, it is sweet, heartbreaking and heart wrenching and brilliantly crafted. A beautiful but sad love story.Matthew McConaughey is Mud. A mysterious man living in the woods waiting for the love of his life to return to him. This was a bit of subtle performance for McConaughey. There was no ego or big Hollywood personality here. He is quiet and contemplative and intense. Its a different style for him but still very effective and I enjoyed it a lot. He was perfect for the role. Tye Sheridan is one to watch!! This is his only his second screen credit and he was phenomenal!! He was probably the best performance in the film. His emotions run high and he was so intense and just riveting in the role. This young man is a terrific actor and this film showcased his talent! His chemistry with McConaughey is perfect and one of the best things in the movie. His best friend and supporting character to him is played by Jacob Lofland. He also does a great job and his character is a little more feisty but he doesn't get near the screen time as Sheridan. Reese Witherspoon has a small but pivotal role as the object of Mud's unrequited love. She only has a few scenes but does them very effectively and is very good in the role. The legendary Sam Shepard adds a level of class to the cast as Mud's father figure. I would love to have seen more between him and Mud because there is obviously a ton of story there but their relationship is sweet, dark, sad but so important to the story. Ray McKinnon deserves mention to as Sheridan's father. Its a small role but I felt he really nailed his performance too. Other great small supporting roles were made by Sarah Paulson and Michael Shannon.I think I may have to make sure I pay attention to director and writer Jeff Nichols and his future projects. This is the second movie of his (Take Shelter being the first) that I thought was very nearly brilliant. Usually I discourage the idea of a writer directing his own work but clearly Nichols is the exception to this rule. His films have a distinctive style that could almost be described as depressing but it makes for a hauntingly beautiful drama. Some may find it slow but certainly the last 15 minutes makes up for that but I thought the pacing was perfect and every minute was necessary to tell a story full of depth and heart. If you're looking for a terrific drama you will find few others as good as this right now. The gritty and grey setting of Arkansas provides a gloriously smart film. 9/10",Mud
31,MOscarbradley,A major step forward for writer/director Jeff Nichols,9,27 May 2013,"Like his contemporary Derek Cianfrance, who followed his relatively small, intimate drama ""Blue Valentine"" with the epic and superior ""A Place Beyond the Pines"", so Jeff Nichols follows his small ecological horror film ""Take Shelter"" with the splendid, much larger-in-scale ""Mud"". Both ""Mud"" and ""A Place Beyond the Pines"" are original screenplays, establishing their directors as among a very bright new breed of writer/directors, though perhaps ""Mud's"" influences are more apparent. Still, this is a remarkable film in which all the elements blend together seamlessly.It's a coming-of-age movie masquerading as a thriller. Mud, the title character, (a career-best performance from Matthew McConaughey, getting better with every film), is a n'er-do-well on the run for killing the guy who beat up on his girlfriend Juniper, (an excellent, trampy Reese Witherspoon), and hiding out on an island in the Mississippi where he is discovered by two boys, Neckbone, (Jacob Lofland), and his older friend Ellis, (Tye Sheridan, first-rate). While Neckbone is more worldly-wise and keeps a discreet distance, Ellis begins to worship the sands Mud walks on and gets heavily embroiled in a plan to reunite Mud with Juniper. But it isn't just the police who are after Mud. The family of the man Mud killed, lead by father Joe Don Baker and his vicious son Paul Sparks, want Mud dead and they don't care who gets in the way.All this plays out beautifully on the back-roads that run along side the river and on the river itself. There's a touch of Mark Twain to it, certainly, but this is a steelier, less sentimental account of a rural American childhood than anything Twain might have given us. Mud himself is something of a sociopath yet he root for him and his deeply romantic yearnings to have a life with Juniper.As a writer Nichols has given us a hugely satisfying narrative and as a director he draws us deep inside it. He also elicits first-rate performances from his cast, not just from McConaughey, Sheridan and Witherspoon but also from Ray McKinnon and Sarah Paulson as Ellis' parents and from the great Sam Shepard as the neighbour who skill as a marksman comes in very handy when the going gets tough. A splendid film.",Mud
32,bowmanblue,"Enjoyable, but very slow",6,12 June 2014,"Sometimes when you describe a movie as 'slow' people may think that you didn't enjoy it. The trick with 'Mud' to get the most out of it is to be in the mood for something with no car chases or gun battles.It's about a wanted criminal, aka 'Mud,' who, while living on an island off a U.S. river, befriends a couple of boys. What follows is a tale that is primarily based on love, i.e. the expectations people have of love, versus the reality.Like I say, it's slow. It's about relationships forming (and unforming, of course!) therefore don't go expecting anything too fast-paced and action packed. However, if you're into more 'character-driven' movies, then give this one a go. People often criticise child actors for 'ruining' a movie. The young boy here gives an outstanding performance, as does Mathew McConaughey.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Mud
33,g-bodyl,"Very Absorbing, Gritty Southern Tale!",9,14 August 2014,"Mud is one of those small-town gritty dramas that perfectly compliments those blockbusters that are in theaters nowadays. It's always good to see a story that focuses more on the storytelling rather than the visual effects. Here we are focused on a father figure who looks out for these kids while searching for the one he loves. This is a perfect Mark Twain adventure as this is eerily similar to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. I liked this film because it's an absorbing drama that has a keen eye for detail and it teaches the audience about the Southern way of life.Jeff Nichol's film is about how two teens named Ellis and Neckbone stumble upon a mysterious homeless man named Mud who seems a little dangerous, but innocent enough as he explains he is meeting his love, Juniper. But when bounty hunters come to town searching for Mud, the boys begin to realize the kind of person Mud is.Matthew McConaughey is definitely on a career resurgence and that continues with this film. He is a father figure for the boys despite telling tall tales and keeping a pistol handy. The movie builds Matt's character as a sympathetic character and in a way, he is. All he is looking for is the woman he loves. Tye Sheridan has a career in front of him. First the Tree of Life, now this. We feel for his character as he is dealing with his parents breaking up and finding his first true love. Reese Witherspoon was excellent as Juniper though I felt she could have used a little more screen time. Sam Shepard was great in his supporting turn as Mud's father-like man.Overall, Mud is a thing of beauty and a movie that is defined by it's characters whom we all became attached to. This film has some influences from Terrence Malick and the way he beautifully photographs nature and also from films like Stand By Me, which is a story about growing up. Mud is one of the best films of 2013 and amongst all the blockbusters, this beautiful film stands out. I rate this film 9/10.",Mud
34,secondtake,"A simplistic, overrated, but pretty movie with two great child performances and lots of clichéd ones",5,11 August 2013,"Mud (2012)A widely praised film that didn't quite convince me. It has charms--a pair of cute and brave kids who go out on a limb for a fugitive partly because they need to escape their home life woes. And the setting, along some backwoods river in Missouri that leads past Texas to the ocean.The star, the man who calls himself Mud, is Matthew McConaughey, who is not bad in his role (and yes he takes his shirt off). But for someone who is actually a pretty evil guy on the lam, living a makeshift life with little food and no friends, he's a bit too normal. Some mud on his face doesn't disguise his very white teeth. Furthermore, the direction (and editing) is clumsy at times, and this won't bother some people at all. But for those who get viscerally absorbed you might feel the downright incorrect placement of the camera at times, or the edits from one view to another that don't make sense. A trivial example--they are walking through a forest at one point and look up and see a clear sky (no trees) with a beautiful flock of birds going by. It creates atmosphere in theory, but not logically. Likewise, a couple times they are on the beach and suddenly there is someone else there with their boat on the shore, fifty feet away, and they act surprised, like they hadn't noticed. And then there is getting the boat out of the tree--lots of edits make it something we just accept, not watch (this ain't ""Fitzcarraldo"").The good parts don't outweigh the story, either, which is a little simple--the criminal is hopelessly in love with a girl in town, and this motivates everyone (including the kids). A bit thin. The climax is bloody and unlikely, too. The side characters are cardboard (even the surrogate dad, who is totally likable). And so on and so on.If it sounds like I hated the movie, I almost did. The real strengths--these kids finding their inner strengths and rising above their rudimentary situations is cool. In a way this is ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" Lite. It tries to go rough and backwoods, but that's not enough. And yet, it has enough little interactions that you might enjoy it. Or might love it, which a lot of people have, clearly. I wish I was one of them.",Mud
35,cosmo_tiger,One of the first true Oscar contenders of the year. Hopefully this movie will show people McConaughey really is a great actor. I say B+,7,5 August 2013,"""I got a lot of folks looking for me. I shot a man."" Two young boys grab a boat and go to an island looking for a new place to play they are surprised to see a man working out there. Mud (McConaughey) and the kids become instant friends and he begins to ask them for favors. What starts off as two boys trying to get a boat evolves into a true friendship between all three. I have to admit that I am a McComaughey fan, I think he is a very good actor and doesn't get the recognition that he deserves, mainly due to his rom-com movie choices, but I have a feeling that this will change all that. He seems very comfortable in this role and it really suits him. The movie has a little Slingblade quality to it and I think that helps the movie. This is the kind of movie where you aren't really sure who is honest and it keeps you guessing the whole time waiting for someone's true colors to show and see if your intuition is right. This is a lesser know movie but I think is one of the first Oscar contenders of the year not only for McConaughey, but also for the kid who plays Ellis and a dark horse best picture candidate. This is a very good movie and I recommend it. Overall, a movie that should finally give McConaughey the recognition he deserves. I give it a B+.",Mud
36,callanvass,"An exquisite piece of filmmaking, and I loved every minute of it. It's one of my favorite films of 2013",9,4 October 2013,"Two curious young boys encounter a fugitive (Matthew McConaughey) named Mud where they live. They willingly do deeds for him, and try to reunite him with his love Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) The problem is, a bunch of bounty hunters are after Mud. It's always nice to see such a tremendous film of this nature, after all the garbage Hollywood tends to churn out these days. Mud is a genuine piece of filmmaking, which is not only thoughtful, but engrossing until the very end. It's deliberate slow pace ends up serving this film well, giving us time to soak it all in. I also loved the southern setting in this film, which made it all the more genuine, and realistic. The cinematography is a sight to behold, with many beautiful sights that never failed to amaze me. Mud is a very likable fugitive, and quite sympathetic in my opinion, and I give all the credit to McConaughey for that. He still has that charismatic swagger he always does, but he delves a lot deeper for this role. His good looks, give way to a dirty, greasy fugitive, who will do anything to survive, but is not void of morality. He cares about the young boys, even if it is for his own reasons. McConaughey pulls it off with conviction, and I felt he was tremendous. The best performance might just be Tye Sherdian as Ellis. For an actor his age, he was absolutely incredible, displaying many ranges of emotion throughout the film. This kid is going special places in my opinion, and I'll be shocked if he doesn't. Jacob Lofland is great as Neckbone (Ellis's best friend) Reese Witherspoon doesn't have a ton of screen time as you may think, but her character Juniper plays a pivotal part. Reese nails the part, and is gorgeous to boot. Sam Shepard adds great support as a longtime friend to Mud, as the grumpy assassin. Final Thoughts: Its films like this, that restore my faith in Hollywood. It's genuine, gritty, and downright absorbing. I loved this film, and I can't possibly see why anyone would dislike it. It's just a great film9/10",Mud

Beautifully narrated story comes off as a shocker towards the end, when the drama/thriller genre turns into action-thriller. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant and truly in character. But the two kids impressed me more. Supporting cast is genuine.The plot keeps the viewer hooked with focusing on the lives of the lead guy and one of his helper. The dialogs are co-related like the sequences & sub-stories. Not a single dull moment, although some scenes could have been cut short. Screenplay is fine while I am disappointed by the background score. It could've been more intense.

40,paulclaassen,Excellent all-round performances.,6,23 April 2020,"The first thing that grabbed me, was the beautiful cinematography. Then the good acting. Then the proper dialogue and precision film making. Director Jeff Nichols has a knack for telling a story without being sensationalist about it. His previous film, 'Take Shelter' pretty much followed the same pattern.The narrative is mostly from a child's perspective, and the naive nature of their perceptions. I admired their courage and determination. I must admit, though, what started out as a feel-good movie, eventually became a bit dramatic and rather grim. Nevertheless, the brilliant acting from the entire cast ensured credibility and a film that kept me glued to the screen. (Tye Sheridan in particular was very good). I kept wanting to know what was going to happen next, and how the story would unfold.There's a lot of character development and interesting twists here, as well as a few underlying messages. The final act is action-packed and suspenseful. 'Mud' is indeed a very good production.",Mud
41,tomgillespie2002,A fine film with a stellar cast,7,8 October 2013,"Similar to his excellent 2011 feature Take Shelter, writer/director Jeff Nichols delivers another exceptional slice of small-town Americana. Mud's story is small, and its characters hail from some backwood town in rural Arkansas, living on makeshift boathouses on the Mississippi River. Yet although the focus is on these small people and their ordinary existence, there seems to be something larger and grander in its execution. Take Shelter showed a man's (possible) mental deterioration as he envisioned the apocalypse. In Mud, a very grown-up tale is seen through the eyes of two 14 year old boys, and theme that runs throughout is love. Yet there's always the feeling that the fate of the eponymous Mud (Matthew McConaughey) and Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) could somehow have global consequences, and that if they are doomed then so are we all.After hearing about a boat that lies at the top of a tree as the result of a flood, two teenage boys, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), travel to an island on the Mississippi River in a speed boat. They find the boat, but they also find Mud, a rugged drifter with a gun, who asks the boys to get him food in exchange for the boat. It becomes evident that Mud is an outlaw, but the boys stay true to their word and deliver the food. Mud tells them the story of Juniper, the woman he loves, and hands them a note to deliver to her. As the boys seek her out in her motel room, they find her being abused by a man who is the brother of a man that Mud murdered. Despite the dangers, Ellis stays loyal to Mud and carries out the tasks he is asked to do.There is more than just a hint of Mark Twain to the story, but Mud is successful in combining a number of genres - Southern Gothic, coming-of- age drama, and sometimes even your standard man-on-the-run thriller. Cinematographer Adam Stone, who worked with Nichols on Take Shelter and his debut Shotgun Stories (2007), captures the Mississippi River immaculately, portraying its mythic qualities so lyrically that you may think it was capable of washing Mud up on the shore of its empty island. The world seems both peaceful and violent, two themes so contrasting that we can only be seeing this world from the viewpoint of Ellis' naive and innocent mind.The cast is stellar. McConaughey seems well on his way to redeeming himself for his years of service to terrible rom-coms with an impressive performance, harking back to his early appearance in the magnificent Lone Star (1996). Small roles for Sam Shepard and Michael Shannon round off an impressive cast, and Ray McKinnon and Sarah Paulson (both former Deadwood actors) inject raw emotion into their roles as Ellis' separating parents. But it was Tye Sheridan that stole the show for me, giving a performance way beyond his years as the honest and headstrong Ellis. The scene in which he is humiliated by the girl he thought was his girlfriend, the expression etched across Sheridan's face becomes something more profound than simple confusion. Although it dips into a slightly disappointing and generic shoot-out climax, Mud is a fine film, and one that reminds us what it is like to love, as ugly and unpredictable as it can be.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Mud

43,Dr_Coulardeau,The Mississippi may be a sacred river of peace and freedom,9,12 December 2014,"This is a film that can probably not work as well as it should with a non-American audience. The cultural roots connected to this Mississippi river and to the section at the level of Arkansas have been made famous in the 19th century by Mark Twain, so much that we have forgotten this river along with the original Missouri were and still are sacred rivers for American Indians. The film is an extremely well done and sensitive version of Huckleberry Finn. Two boys on the river are having an adventure with some kind of an escapee from civilization, wanted by the FBI or State troopers for the murder of a man and having to fight against their own parents, the police, the neighbors and a band of hit men in the form of a private posse that are after that escapee, that ""outlaw,"" out of pure vengeance.The two boys, fourteen years old as for age, are going through an initiation into real life, into adult lying and tall tale telling. They also learn the limits between right and wrong, true and false, under age and of age, immature and mature, in the rough way with a couple of kicks and punches as well as in the soft or sentimental way. Don't you fall in love, boy, because love is not that acme of life they all say it is.For us, the audience, it is more entertainment than education. We know all that and we know from the very start that Mud is not a very clean and clear man. We know the boys are right and wrong at the same time to trust him. Right for their own maturation (it is by trusting you learn what and who must not be trusted), but wrong because of the pain and sadness they may get out of it. We of course know there is no joy with some suffering somewhere around or after it. We know love is not everlasting and if we want it to last we have to change with time and change our love too. There is in the mind of everyone, every man or every woman, the illusion that love is at first sight and for life, like Tristan and Yseult or Romeo and Juliet, and we forget that it is true provided we accept this life to be shortened in a way or another. The four heroes I have just quoted die before their old age. If they had been able to live their love through many things would have had to change.The last remark I would like to add is that apart from the Mississippi river itself the vision we get of the USA is not particularly brilliant: dilapidated areas, crazy and wild aerial wiring, very poor paving and roadways, derelict buildings, all kinds of dumps and salvage yards. There is no beauty in that film, except the Mississippi river twice or thrice in the whole film, for just a short glimpse. That's what happens when you get off the highways and away from the big cities, and even so in these big cities do not go into the socially dilapidated or ghettoized areas. We could also note the fate of women in a film that is not exactly trying to depict women. Only one is important, Juniper, and the picture of her is not brilliant. Keep away and keep your hands off her, I would say. She is trouble all along and when she is not causing trouble she is the victim of trouble herself. It always ends badly anyway.But that's a good film for romantic and nostalgic people who believe, still believe should I say, in the innocence of children. More innocent than I, I die, and yet it would not be difficult to be more innocent and naïve than I, but children are not what we thought they were fifty years ago. I said ""thought"" because they were not and I seem to remember a lot about the perversions children were confronted too fifty years ago, not to speak of the war before.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Mud
44,Floated2,Gripping Intense Storytelling,8,23 March 2015,"Mud written and directed by Jeff Nichols for part-inspiring his third feature. In this Deep South fairytale, McConaughey is paired for the first time with Reese Witherspoon, who similarly relishes playing against type. But Mud doesn't belong to either of them.On a remote stretch of river deep in the heart of Arkansas' swamplands, delta dweller Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and bucktoothed best pal Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) discover a boat stuck halfway up a tree. They're not the only ones with eyes on this stranded treasure, however, as an enigmatic drifter – distinguishable by his grubby white shirt, chipped front tooth and arm-length snake tattoo – makes his presence known. The boys know better than to mix with strangers, but they allow their keen sense of adventure to override their better judgement and strike a deal: bring Mud (McConaughey) spare parts and tools to fix the boat and in return he'll give them one of only two valuable items in his possession: a six-shooter. Overall we get a sense to the overall tone and atmosphere within Mud by the film's conclusion.",Mud
45,leonblackwood,Pretty Average!,4,8 September 2013,"Review: This movie wasn't really what I was expecting. The whole thing was really based around the kids, who are running up and down getting things for McConaughey's character. The only bit of action is right at the end when there is a showdown between the gangsters and Mud, but apart from that, nothing really happens in the 2 hours. It did take me quite long to watch because I kept on falling asleep as the pace was really slow and I kept on waiting for something to happen. By the end of the movie, I was feeling pretty cheated because it got great reviews, but I couldn't really see why. All of the performances were great and the storyline was fairly decent, but it was way too long and slow. Watchable!Round-Up: I had to turn on the subtitles through some of this movie because I didn't understand what the hell they were saying, with that Deep South accent. McConaughey only seems to take rolls that are based around the Deep South nowadays, but it does suit his acting style. He did play his part well, alongside the kids who also put in realistic performances. It's not as good as I thought it would be, but it is watchable you do get caught up with the intensity of the film.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $21.5millionI recommend this movie to people who like there dramas that are set in the Deep South about a man who is hiding away from some bad criminals. 4/10",Mud
46,howard.schumann,Remarkable for its combination of reality and lyricism,9,19 May 2013,"he term ""coming of age"" is normally associated with an irreparable feeling of loss of innocence. In Jeff Nichol's Mud, however, the loss of innocence is not about surrendering to cynicism and disillusionment but about a broader understanding that the world is a mixture of light and dark, and that often circumstances are complex and do not automatically explain themselves. If Mud is a coming of age tale, it is one for both children and adults, both learning that letting go is not a sign of weakness. Set in rural Arkansas on the Mississippi River, the film does not use location as a backdrop but is defined by its surroundings, as surely as is Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn.Permeated by the steamy, oppressive atmosphere of the Delta, under the guidance of Cinematographer Adam Stone and composer David Wingo it becomes so real that you can feel the sweat on your brow. Though Mud has a suggestion of mythic poetry in the tradition of Terence Malick, it is not a Malick-type impressionist painting but a far grittier experience with violence and threats of violence grounding it in more conventional territory. In the film, 14-year-old Ellis (Ty Sheridan) and his best friend ""Neckbone"" (Jacob Lofland) are not teenagers with average big city problems. They have no computers, iphones, or tablets.Ellis lives in a ramshackle houseboat, distanced from his parents (Ray McKinnon and Sara Paulson) who talk about separation and divorce while Neckbone is being raised by his uncle Galen (Michael Shannon), an oyster diver. Later Ellis finds out that his mom, who owns the houseboat, wants to sell it and move to the city, and he rebels at the idea of being a ""townie."" As the film opens, the boys, out for adventure, discover a boat on a nearby Mississippi island. Like a vision of Noah's Ark, the boat has been moored on a tree after a flood. To their surprise, they also discover that someone is living there. He is a drifter who calls himself ""Mud"" (Matthew McConaughey) and who tells the boys that he is on the island waiting for Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), his love ever since their childhood together.There is an overtone of danger with Mud's unkempt appearance and his stories about walking around with nails on his shoes shaped like a cross ""to ward off evil spirits,"" and snakes tattooed on his wrists. Though the danger is there, Mud also has a redneck charm that the boys take to. Hungry for something or someone to believe in, they help him to stay alive by bringing him food and assist him by delivering notes to Juniper in town. Though there is a wide disparity in age, Ellis and Mud, are strangely alike. Told by his father that ""You can't trust love, if you're not careful, it'll up and run out on you,"" Ellis desperately wants to believe in it and both he and Mud need each other to keep their dreams alive.Ellis has a good heart and a sense of decency, and helps Mud because he believes that ""it is the right thing to do,"" though we find out a little later that he shot and killed a man who was abusing his girlfriend and is on the run from the police and the father of the man he killed. Ellis, unaware that he is harboring a fugitive, sees his sense of self-worth compromised by having to steal a motor from a boat to help Mud, an emotion he does not hesitate to let the older man know about in one of the film's most moving scenes. McConaughey's performance stands out for his ability to draw sympathy even though we know what he has done and what he is capable of.Supported by his old friend, Tom (Sam Shepard), said to be a former CIA hit-man, Mud makes plans to escape as the plot moves inexorably to a point of resolution but it is one that might have been better left to the imagination. Mud is remarkable for its combination of reality and lyricism and the dialogue has a feeling for natural rhythms without a sense of the conversation being ""movie talk."" Though it has its contrivances and head-scratching moments, these do not detract from the film's overall emotional resonance. The film is marked by outstanding performances by both newcomer Jacob Lofland, and Tye Sheridan, whose formidable screen presence and ability to convey emotions are real enough to ensnare even the most reluctant viewer.Mud lets us know that coming of age does not have to mean a loss of the things that make being young so precious: a view of the world as being a loving place where being friends forever is a reasonable expectation, where the idealism that progress is linear and that the world is a process of becoming, and where the dreams of being an adult encompasses being a person of strength that can give and receive love. There's a part of the river where it expands into open space ahead and where the horizon seems stretched to infinity, a space that has not yet been mapped. For Ellis and Mud, the world still remains uncharted. When they reach that place, you reach it together with them.",Mud
47,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Compelling coming-of-age drama with a timeless feel and a modern edge,9,30 January 2014,"Young boys getting involved with something way over their heads out in nature almost immediately evokes Rob Reiner's 1986 classic ""Stand by Me."" Coming-of-age stories have a certain power to them when the boys are actually younger than high school age and don't live comfortably under their parents' roof. ""Mud"" possesses that same grit and spirit.The Mississippi River imagery of ""Mud"" and the story of young boys helping a runaway also strongly evokes ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"" only with a more modern world view and a realistic sense of danger. The boys are Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), 14-year-old Arkansas boys who look and act as just that. They value their independence and like to get away from home (both have unstable family situations), plus they have become preoccupied with the opposite sex.One morning they sneak out in a motorboat and head to a small island on the river where Neckbone has discovered a boat lodged in the trees. They explore it and soon discover a man lives there. Mud (Matthew McConaughey) strikes a deal with the boys to let them have the boat in exchange for food. They bring some back and slowly develop a relationship with him, even after they discover he's a wanted man. Turns out Mud is trying to connect with his longtime girlfriend, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) so they can run away together. Ellis, inspired by their love, puts himself in a dangerous way to help Mud escape.Writer and director Jeff Nichols could well direct an Oscar-winning film in the not-too-distant future, and at the least, certainly an Oscar-nominated one. His last film, ""Take Shelter,"" was an engaging, suspenseful drama with universal themes and beautiful nature cinematography and ""Mud"" does the same, proving he's here for the long run.Most films like ""Mud"" would utilize voice-over narration, usually from the main character as an adult telling a story of his boyhood, but Nichols relies on nothing but pure visual storytelling and demonstrates a serious knack for it. We can make out for ourselves how the rift between Ellis' parents, played by Ray McKinnon and Sarah Paulson, drives him away from his riverboat home to seek more time with Mud, and how his own emotions and feelings about love, naive as they are, push him to help Mud and Juniper.Ellis is definitely the film's main character and that says everything about Sheridan's performance. This young man isn't going away anytime soon. Ellis is a lovable kid despite his occasionally reckless behavior and penchant for trusting others too much. He's strong, fearless and independent, especially for his age, which Sheridan does so well, yet the innocence (and ultimately its loss) is present in his performance.McConaughey continues his independent film tear in the title role. Mud is a pretty straightforward character, but he's not charming or mysterious or unpredictable. The script puts everything out there that you'd need to know about him, so McConaughey has to put some soul into the part, which he certainly does. Mud is a likable guy because he treats the boys like adults, like true friends, despite questions of his past transgressions.The rest of the cast is sound, though no roles especially stand out aside from Sam Shepard as Ellis' cross-river neighbor, the man who looked after Mud when he was a boy. Witherspoon, who commands a hefty salary, presumably liked the script so much that she made concessions, because Juniper isn't a particularly strong character, just a tough one.Those who love films that put a bit of a folk twist on reality will easily take a liking to ""Mud."" The Arkansas town where the film takes place is about as dingy as they come, but Nichols finds some real beauty in it and his story gives it the same mythic energy as the Southern setting does in ""Huck Finn."" The film does take some harrowing turns, but they are never so dark and violent that it shatters that folkloric bubble entirely, rather it reminds us about the many hard truths of this world.It might look like an inaccessible Southern-set drama, but ""Mud"" will engage, entertain and strike a chord with all types of people with its expert treatment of loss of innocence and coming of age.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

48,Turfseer,McConaughey's bad boy drifter with heart of gold has little semblance of truth,5,21 February 2014,"Today, 'independent' fictional dramas are not much different from those released by the big Hollywood studios. They both have trouble being believable. That's the case with director Jeff Nichols' 'Mud', starring Matthew McConaughey, who seems to have a penchant for playing southerners of late. It begins of course with the two De Witt, Arkansas boys, Ellis and his pal, Neckbone, discovering the boat up in the tree on an island in the middle of the Mississippi River. When they come upon McConaughey's character, 'Mud', a drifter (who we later find out is wanted for murder by State Troopers), it looks like this might be going in the direction of a tale about a serial killer who has a penchant for young boys (a la John Wayne Gacy). But soon, to our relief, we discover that Mud is much more benign. Actually Mud has been pining away for years for his childhood love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), who just happens now to show up in De Witt. The man Mud killed was abusing Juniper and in one incident (according to Mud), threw her down the stairs, resulting in the loss of a baby she was expecting. While Mud decided to play vigilante and take the law into his own hands, somehow that's okay because not only was the act despicable (and worthy of execution in Mud's eyes) but the victim's family were also bad people (so bad that the family patriarch is referred to by Mud, as the devil himself!). Mud in effect really is not a bad guy at all, despite committing a murder. Actually he's just a bad boy with a heart of gold. When the family of the man he killed comes after him later on, he becomes a hero of sorts, blasting them all to smithereens with an aid of one particular ally.That ally is Mud's former mentor (and father figure of sorts) Tom Blankenship (Sam Shepard), a former Marine sharpshooter, who happens to live right across from Ellis and his parents, on the river. Ellis believes Mud's crazy stories that Tom used to be a CIA agent but Tom debunks them. In fact, he correctly fills Ellis in on Mud's true history—that he's been obsessed with Juniper for years and refuses to accept the fact that she's no good and cheats on him whenever she gets the chance. Bad boy Mud finally gets to prove that he's not so bad after all when, with the help of expert shot Tom (of course), mows down the brother of the guy who abused Juniper, along with a bunch of mean looking bounty hunters, who attempt to gun him down inside Ellis' home, after Mud comes to say goodbye to the kid. The 'heart of gold' machinations continue when Ellis lashes out at Mud on the island, after he's disillusioned by both Juniper and Mud's expected reconciliation falls apart, and he himself is rejected by a slightly older high school student he develops a crush on. Ellis falls into a snake pit and is bitten by a poisonous snake. Guess who rushes the stricken Ellis to the hospital on the mainland and saves his life?There's also a sub-plot involving Ellis' parents who are divorcing, resulting in the appropriation by the State of the houseboat they're living in. At film's end, Ellis and his mother move into a regular apartment, in town. As for Mud, you guessed it. He survives bullets and near-miss snake bites and nursed back to health by kindly mentor Tom.Despite solid performances by the two child actors, 'Mud' pretty much feels as phony as a three dollar bill. Here's a portrait of a killer whose main problem is that he's a love sick puppy dog. Even Tom, the man who really knows about all of Mud's shortcomings, gives him a free pass after Mud helps him to do away with a gaggle of cartoon bad guys and then saves the film's youthful protagonist from certain death, after the kid ever so conveniently falls into a pit of poisonous snakes. Don't get me wrong. 'Mud' is thoroughly watchable but please don't believe that most of this could actually happen in real life. For those viewers who do believe in the verisimilitude of this type of narrative, I can only surmise that such aficionados, are also seriously addicted to contemporary Hollywood and Indie dramas, featuring antagonists with clear cut and ever-so unrealistic, 'hearts of gold'.",Mud

Therefore, it is natural that they are eager to assist a fugitive is spite of his past, even when second thoughts arise... Events are realistic and smoothly varying, there are several twists and unexpected moments. Characters are logical, well outlined, and splendidly performed - particularly Matthew McConaughey as Mud and Tye Sheridan as Ellis, but even minor supporting roles are performed by distinct persons. McConaughey is a long-term talented actor, but I am sure that Sheridan will become more known as well.Small minuses for Ellis - May Pearl sideline (provided no additional value to the movie) and expected ending scenes; true, the end was versatile, not a single solution.

50,kevin_robbins,This is a very underrated picture that is a fun watch and must see,9,8 September 2021,"Mud (2012) is a movie I recently rewatched on Tubi and is part of my DVD collection. The storyline follows a couple kids in a small town in the swamps of Mississippi that encounters a man named Mud living on his own on an Island. He has had a challenging life and a lot of his bad decisions are tied to a woman he is in love with. One of the kid's parents is going through a divorce so he is all on board with helping true love work. The kids may get deeper in this love story than they are prepared for. This movie is directed by Jeff Nichols (upcoming A Quiet Place 3) and stars Matthew McConaughey (Wolf of Wall Street), Tye Sheridan (Ready Player One), Sam Shepard (Black Hawk Down), Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blond), Michael Shannon (Take Shelter), Sarah Paulson (American Horror Story) and Joe Don Baker (Congo). This storyline is awesome from the settings, to the characters to the storyline. Everything about this film is unique. The environment is fascinating and the characters are well acted and written. I adored the dialogue and the circumstances presented that the characters have to be overcome. The final scene is magnificent and you can't believe what's happening and to whom. Overall this is a very underrated picture that is a fun watch and must see. I would score this a solid 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",Mud
51,dfranzen70,Precursor to Dallas Buyers Club for McConaughey,8,28 March 2014,"I saw Mud last night. Yes, I know I'm a couple years late. But what a terrific movie. Not a false note in it. It's compelling, original, and full of heart.Two boys, Ellis and Neckbone, go looking for a boat that's found its way to the top of a pine tree on an island in the Mississippi River. They find the boat, all right, but it seems that living in that very boat is a scraggly looking man (Matthew McConaughey) who introduces himself as Mud. Mud is waiting for someone, he tells the boys, his beloved girlfriend Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). The boys agree to help and to tell no one of MUD's residence on the island.But there's more to the story than meets the eye. Yes, Juniper exists, but the relationship that she and Mud have (and have had) is not all peaches and cream. And there are folks out for Mud's blood, pardon the phrasing. Still, the man is persuasive, particularly for a couple of teenagers from the less-affluent side of town. Mud gives the boys something to believe in and a real sense of self worth.The boys don't come from broken homes, though. Ellis (Tye Sheridan) has a mother and father who, unlike stereotypical movies about struggling families, are fairly well grounded. They're good parents who love their only child, even if the love in their marriage has waned somewhat. Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) lives with his Uncle Galen (Michael Shannon), who's anything but an obnoxious, sullen jerk.The chemistry between McConaughey and the two young actors is fantastic. The elder thespian doesn't dominate their scenes, he complements them. This is what you get when Matthew McConaughey drops the aw-shucks act and gets serious. But he's not in every scene, and young Sheridan proves to be more than capable of carrying a movie. Ellis tries, succeeds, fails, but always wants to do the right thing. He helps Mud out of a sense of duty; he feels that since he and Juniper love each other, they deserve to be together. It's a simple worldview, but he is only 14, after all.Director Jeff Nichols, who also made the superb Take Shelter, has a keen sense of when to show action and when to let his talented cast mesmerize their audience. This isn't a character study, but it is an study of the characters of two protagonists: the world-weary fibber Mud and the perceptive, honorable Ellis.",Mud

The boys, Tye & Jacob, live on the river and they find a boat on an island, that is stranded up in a tree-probably from some flooding. Matthew, who is also on the island, claims that the boat is his-FYI: Mud is his name-and he asks them to help him get it seaworthy again. He also tells the boys that he is waiting for Reese. Joe Don shows up looking for Matthew or Reese, whichever one he can find-he's not picky. The story is pretty good and the actors are too, but it would have been better if they would have cut a few sub-plots that were not really necessary-it's over 2 hours long. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, sexual situations and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",Mud
53,meeza,"Don't get mud at me, but this flick was overrated!",7,5 October 2013,"I hate to be a stick in the mud, but I was not enamored with the independent film ""Mud"" as most film critics were. I thought it was a legitimate piece of filmmaking, but let's just say I was not mad about ""Mud""; and sometimes I thought it was more like Mud spelled backwards. The film stars Tye Sheridan as Ellis, a Mississippi boy who along with his pal Neckbone discover a fugitive in a nearby island. That fugitive, who happens to be muddling around the island, is none other than the title character himself, Mud. Matthew McConaughey adequately does some good work here as Mud. Mud is a fugitivo because he killed a man who was messing around with his longtime sweetheart Juniper. Mud is being chased down by not only the police, but also by a gang of southern mobsters who seek vengeance on him. Ellis eventually builds a special friendship with Mud, even though he is aware of Mud's perplexing situation. Mud shows Ellis the ropes on being a survivalist and some other life & love lessons; even though Mud really knows he did not successfully pass some of those life & love lessons himself. Mud is no angel though; example: for egotistical purposes he quasi-bribes Ellis to send notes to Juniper. Neckbone, who at first despised Mud, eventually takes a liking to the Mudster. Writer-Director Jeff Nichols, who helmed the brilliant ""Take Shelter"", does effectively capture the ""coming of age"" storyline and the aura of the south in his orchestration of the picture; but somehow I felt that Nichols was missing something to keep the viewer magnetized to the picture. Maybe it was that his screenplay was a bit underdeveloped or maybe the narrative was just too slow in developing. Sheridan as Ellis and Jacob Lofland as Neckbone were admirable in their child performances, which were in reality adult-like in southern nature. As far as the supporting work: Reese Witherspoon was sadly underutilized as Juniper and the same goes for Michael Shannon as Neckbone's uncle Galen; however, I enjoyed Sam Shepard's work as the cranky southern gunslinger old-timer Tom Blankenship; and believe me, no one was going to sunk down his Blankenship river-home. As aforementioned, McConaughey's performance was genuine and authentic but I would not deep this Mud that much into Oscar-contention. There is no reason not to put your viewprints on ""Mud"", but then again there is no reason to fall madly in love with ""Mud"" either. *** Average",Mud
54,pixrox1,"In America, Big Money runs the show . . .",8,23 May 2013,". . . according to Jeff Nichols, the writer of MUD. It is very easy to see why any cast member of this movie would think any representative of local law enforcement would kowtow to their every indiscretion, and most likely let them off even WITHOUT a slap on the wrist, since that's exactly how the Arkansas cops depicted in MUD behave toward Texas money mogul King (played with an appropriate level of venality by Joe Don Baker). If a member of law enforcement (or any OTHER citizen, for that matter) ruffles King's feathers in the least little way, all he needs to say is ""Jump"" and the inadvertent offender quavers ""How high?"" (If, somehow, they're not familiar with the Top Ten Texan Moneybags, all King would have to do is to growl ""Do you know who I AM?!"" to really put the fear of God into them.) Therefore, someone who was living in this King-dominated environment as a pretend-alcoholic week in and week out could not help herself from feeling like ""This is how America works--Money rules!"", and try doing her best King imitation the first time inebriation offered a chance for real life to imitate art (in a totally improvised way, of course).

55,estebangonzalez10,"So far the best of 2013, The contemporary Mark Twain novel",10,26 July 2013,"""I just can't spend the rest of my life running away with him.""Jeff Nichols surprised everyone a few years ago with his excellent film, Take Shelter, and now he delivers another great movie with MUD. Despite being more mainstream than Take Shelter and less artistic, I enjoyed this film more because of the way the story was narrated and the characters were developed. I was blown away with this story and in my opinion it is the best film of the year and my first five star review of the year as well. The screenplay, written by Jeff Nichols, seemed to be taken straight from an unpublished Mark Twain novel. It felt like I was watching a contemporary adventure of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. MUD was fantastic, I felt like it took some of the best elements of some other films like Stand By Me and Sling Blade and improved them. Nichols knows about small southern towns and the location becomes an important character in this superb and suspenseful film. In my opinion MUD is a masterpiece and I could watch it many more times thanks to the way in which Nichols drew me into the story and got me emotionally involved with the characters. It is a very rewarding film if you remain patient and let the story slowly build into what it becomes. It is a character driven film with some powerful performances and some great visuals.Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) are two young teenagers living on the banks of the Mississippi River in Arkansas. These good friends decide to sneak out of their houses one morning to a small island where Neckbone has spotted a boat on top of a tree. Apparently the boat ended up there after a flood that took place sometime in the past and these kids recently discovered it. Wanting to claim it as their own they climb the tree and to their surprise they discover that someone has been living there. That is when they meet Mud (Matthew McConaughey) a fugitive who has been hiding out from the police and some bounty hunters after committing a crime for the love of his life, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Ellis, who has an idealistic view about love decides to help Mud convinced that their love story is pure. Shaped by Mud's story and love for Juniper, Ellis begins to have feelings of his own for a girl named May Pearl (Bonnie Sturdivant). He really feels the need for Mud and Juniper to be able to escape safely together after seeing how the marriage of his parents, Senior (Ray McKinnon) and Mary Lee (Sarah Paulson), begins to crumble at home.Matthew McConaughey is superb in this film and in my opinion gives one of the best performances of his career. He has been on quite a role lately with some very interesting roles. I hope he gets nominated for his work here. As much as I enjoyed his performance, I don't know if the movie would have worked without the strong lead performance from the two young kids, especially from Sheridan who is the lead character and through whose eyes we see everything. Sheridan blew me away and I really cared for his character. There is so much depth to his character and we see the range of emotions that he goes through. He is tough but at the same time sweet, he has strong convictions about love but at the same time these convictions are being put to a test. Sheridan nails the role and delivers this film. There are also some strong secondary performances from Sam Shepard and Michael Shannon who plays a very different role here. Shannon's character, Neckbone's uncle, has the funniest scenes and brings some lightness to the story. This is by far the best film I've seen this year. I loved the story, the characters, and the suspense. The attention to southern detail that Nichols makes only improves this film and makes it more emotionally involving than it already is.",Mud

The similarities between 'Mud' and Mark Twain's 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn' are most certainly no coincidence, and in many ways this feels like something Twain would've written had he been alive today.'Mud' has an almost glacial pace, but it keeps you engaged with its stick and carrot mystery.

58,jimbo-53-186511,A deep and moving experience,7,1 November 2013,"Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland)are 2 friends who one day decide to go on a boat trip to an island to look at a boat which has ended up stuck up a tree during freak flooding. Once on the island, they are surprised to discover they are not alone on the island when they meet Mud (McConaughey)who is a fugitive who has chosen this island to hide from bounty hunters who are on his trail. At first, the boys aren't interested in helping Mud, but when Mud offers them 'his boat' (which is the reason that the boys initially came to the island) in exchange for food Ellis offers to get him some food (Neckbone isn't as keen to help at this stage). From this point on, a friendship begins to develop between Mud and the 2 boys and they end up acting as 'go betweens' in order for Mud to communicate with his long term love Juniper (Reese Witherspoon)who is on the mainland staying in a motel. Mud uses the boys as 'go betweens' as he fears that he will be apprehended if he ventures onto the mainland.I think it's important with films like Mud to know what you are getting into before you decide to watch it. This is not a film that has car chases, explosions, or anything of that nature. Now that doesn't mean that it is a bad film, actually it's far from it. This is a very good film, it's a slow burner, it's thought provoking, it's moving. It covers love, friendship, betrayal, heartbreak. For the patient, this will be a very rewarding experience.This was a very moving film which in a nutshell sees Mud on the run for what can basically be called 'a crime of passion' - he killed one of Juniper's partners because of the way he treated her. He pushed her down the stairs when she was pregnant and consequently she lost the baby and can no longer have kids. This made Mud angry at this man and as a result he killed him. Mud had feelings for Juniper at this time (as well as now) and this clearly clouded his judgment when he decided to execute this crime. Whilst there's no condoning what he did, it doesn't make him a stone cold killer and therefore he is never set up as the 'bad guy'. This could also be described as a 'coming of age' film as well (with reference to Ellis)- he falls for a girl May Pearl (Bonnie Sturdivant) and believes after 1 kiss that they are an 'item', but later in the film she tells Ellis that they are not an item at which point Ellis says that he 'loves her' and she turns to him and says 'you're 14' and then walks away. This was not only a very touching scene, but it was also realistic (I'm sure that there are people who have been in Ellis's position) and I applaud the film makers for how this particular scene was handled. On top of this, poor Ellis has to try and deal with his parents going through divorce. Sadly, Neckbone's character and background aren't quite as well developed which was a bit of a shame.Next we move onto the acting; Matthew McConaughey can be great when given the right material and I must admit he gave a thoroughly convincing performance. Tye Sheridan as Ellis was also fantastic (considering his age) and I feel that he could have a long future ahead of him. Reese Witherspoon was OK, but she didn't really have that much to work with. All the supporting cast were OK too.I would definitely recommend watching Mud and whilst I'll admit it is slow at times, the character development is excellent which means that you care for all of the characters and you'll be prepared to invest time in what they say. The last 15-20 minutes are particularly exciting and make for a great finale. Make sure you don't miss this!",Mud

60,rooprect,"So good I hate to call it a ""coming of age"" story.",8,15 July 2019,"If you're like me, you greet the phrase ""coming of age story"" with something between a polite nod and an gaping, open mouthed yawn. While ""Mud"" falls into that category, it's easily one of the best, if not the best, in its class. This is because nothing about it is predictable; there's no sappy cliché message, and although it's mostly tame regarding violence, some parts are extremely tense, menacing and disturbing. Ultimately, yes, it's a coming of age story, but it's a slightly dark version which is aimed more at adults than kids.The plot in a sentence: Two 14-year-old boys discover a mysterious loner living on an island on the Mississippi River, and as secrets unravel they realize they've gotten into something much deeper than they had bargained for.Although our protagonist is a 14-year-old boy ""Ellis"" (excellently, and I mean EXCELLENTLY, played by Tye Sheridan), this isn't just a 14-year-old's story. In the DVD interviews, director/writer Jeff Nichols said he chose a young teen as the protagonist because he felt that our early teens are when we feel emotions the strongest. Everything is amplified, and later in life we rarely feel that surge the same. And so, through the eyes of Ellis, we see a story unfold in a grippingly powerful way.Themes touch on loyalty, responsibility & fighting for what you believe in. But the central theme is love in its many definitions. We learn that our mysterious stranger (Matthew McConoughy) is driven solely and obsessively by thought of his lost love, and in a parallel fashion, Ellis is falling in love with his first crush. In both cases, he sees love as a storybook ideal. What he gets may not be what he had imagined, and this creates a powerful, driving conflict in the story.There is action, suspense, artistry and some beautifully shot, poetic moments brought to life through the camera as well as McConoughy's fantastic performance. Even more so, the setting of rural Arkansas along the Mississippi is something you can't miss. In almost a Werner Herzog type vein (""Aguirre the Wrath of God"", ""Fitzcarraldo"") where the ominous natural setting becomes a silent character in the film, director Nichols really knew how to immerse us in an all-encompassing, dense alternate reality, set apart from the real world as if time were frozen since the days of Huck Finn. That alone is worth the price of admission. Definitely if you're a fan of Herzog you must see this film.Other directors and films I'd compare this to include Wim Wenders (""Until the End of the World"" with its vast Australian desolation), Lasse Hallström (""Safe Haven"" set in Southport, NC or even ""Chocolat"" set in a timeless French village on a river) and of course the Rob Reiner masterpiece ""Stand By Me"".

It is deceptive and with about 7 subplots, and with an astonishing performance by 16 year old Tye Sheridan almost out-acting Matthew Mac, MUD rolls along, gathering emotions and drama and suspense right up to the final 'I love you' and family bond.

It is as if they believe almost everything that comes out of this man's mouth. Eventually, they discover that the truth lies somewhere else.""Mud"" is a story with a lesson, a thriller, a mystery, and it pulls you in from the beginning because it is told in a simple way, earning plenty of affection for most of the characters because it clearly shows that everyone is flawed and makes mistakes. Only the bad guys are really bad, and those are the ones you really must avoid.Beautifully photographed, taking place in the South, but without the oppressive feeling it usually accompanies movies in that location.

64,peterp-450-298716,Beautiful characters that interact but as slow as the Mississipi,6,7 April 2014,"Mud is like the procession of Echternach, but with 5 steps going forward. So not that painfully slow. Although it's limited to 10 minutes of more movement in the end, this movie still continues to fascinate because of the engaging conversations and magnificent images of the Mississippi.The thread throughout the entire film is the trust that Ellis, a boy who's at the intersection to adulthood, has in Mud, a fugitive who apparently killed someone who ruined the life of his childhood sweetheart Juniper. Mud is hiding in a motorboat, high in the trees, which the boys discovered on a deserted island. They help Mud to collect components, even a complete engine, for the boat. And that's unfortunately the main part of the total film. The two rascals moving back and forth to the island.The trust that Ellis has in Mud, comes from the fact that he demonstrates a honest love for Juniper (limited role by Reese Witherspoon. Still an angelic appearance). Something Ellis is missing at home because of the impending divorce of his parents, resulting in the loss of the houseboat. This trust disappears when Mud is too cowardly to tell Juniper in person he's going to leave her and Ellis has to do the job by handing over a note.Another story line is the flourishing, but unrequited love from Ellis for the older Pearl May. And at the end all the bounty hunters who show up in the town to hunt down Mud.That's it in a nutshell, with a fairly action-packed and predictable ending. What fascinated me about this movie? The interaction of the characters of the two boys, the efforts of the parents of Ellis and uncle Neck Bone to provide a minimum livelihood. And the peace conveyed in this movie thanks to the frequent images of the quiet rippling Mississippi. Several times I found the dry conversations, with a total lack of emotion, between two adolescents hilarious. Subsequently it turns into a mature tone when conversing with the older people. Therefore I think it's a brilliant performance of Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland.Matthew McConaughey is a colorless figure. And two things that struck me was : a total lack of food, but cigarettes he apparently had enough. And he looks unwashed with his scruffy hair, beard and dusty appearance ... but that shirt remains dazzling white throughout the complete film ....

66,jadepietro,More Than a Muddle,7,30 January 2014,"This film is recommended.Mud is a coming-of-age story about two poor Southern boys looking for adventure and finding it on the banks of the Mississippi River. These two 14 year-old friends , Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) travel to an isolated island and meet a stranger with the unlikely nickname of Mud (Matthew McConaughey). Mud is a storyteller, a romantic, and a fugitive with a bounty on his head for murder. Both lads become intrigued with this drifter. Mud's colorful tales of lost love and his mysterious past create a strange bond with the boys and they decide to help him out. In fact, there is a lot of strange in this movie with the youngsters being more resourceful and mature as the film progresses while many of the adults seem to act illogical and rather dumb from the start. Now one can readily accept the boys' independence and free-wheeling life-style amid the ramshackle houses in their ill- gotten community, but parental supervision seems at a ridiculous minimum throughout the film before it begins to dissolve into a melodramatic ""muddle"", leading to a conventional shoot-out and pat ending. Still, the film has wonderful atmospheric mood, character-driven dialog that seems authentic, and some terrific acting by McConaughhey and especially the young actors, Sheridan and Lofland, who convey the right mix of foolhardiness and childhood idealism. There is a nice chemistry between this trio and also fine support by Sam Shepard as Mud's friend, Sarah Paulson and Ray McKinnon as Ellis' parents, Michael Shannon as Neckbone's Uncle Galen, and Reese Witherspoon as Mud's white-trash love interest, Juniper. (Yes, the names are slightly heehaw territory, aren't they?)Well-written and solidly directed by Jeff Nichols, Mud gets stuck in its own convoluted plot devices and arch stereotypes, but this independent film provides enough Southern comfort and charm to make the journey down home certainly worth a visit.

67,pc95,Best Movie of 2013 (So Far),9,4 August 2013,"I absolutely loved ""Mud"", directed by Jeff Nichols. It's been a long while since I've watched ""A Perfect World"", and it may be comparative but also quite different. Main point for ""Mud"" is the theme of Coming of Age is handled brilliantly in this movie - no sugar coating, just great storytelling. Actor Tye Sheridan and director Nichols nailed it. Scene- after-scene we have character Ellis learning through life and laying down his loyalty for what he sees and trusts. He is bewildered in love and his understanding of it in multiple contexts: his love in is his own family, love in his new friendship, and of course romantic love. Matthew McConaughey is quite at home as the title character, ""Mud"" who is a hopeless romantic with sinister underpinnings, as was Sam Shephard. You might call the movie cliché - and perhaps it is, but I see such strength and honesty in it's simplicity, it won me over. I had read a raving review, and I am happy to report it is merited.

They want to know why and also why Mud carries a gun. Inquiring minds are on the job once again. Okay, I agree with you. The name should be spelled Mudd. I got over it. Will you?Mud needs help to get the boat down to take his beloved Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) away with him. The 2-boys Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) do all they can to accomplish this - even acting as go-betweens with Juniper and Mud. Both boys do credible jobs. The cinematography is outstanding along this Mississippi River.However, the real winners in here are the dialogues among Mud, Ellis and Neckbone. These are what will hold you. You will like the easy way these three interact. It's like you are a fly on the wall so to speak and you savor everything. Maybe some of the banter reminds you of your childhood where you can never go back or maybe a Tom Sawyer/ Huckleberry Finn Story. Whatever. Matthew McConaughey makes all this very easy and believable. This could be one of his best roles. Kudos. An Oscar? Indeed. There are many sub plots in here that really don't go anywhere, but are briefly touched on as slices of life: the impending divorce of Ellis' parents; Tom Blankenship (Sam Shepard) and why no one knows anything about him as he resides on his river boat across from Ellis' family houseboat; Galen (Michael Shannon) Neckbone's uncle who dives for pearls and attempts parenting, but keeps a distance; and first love of Ellis with May Pearl (Bonnie Sturdivant). Later on Ellis is given conflicting advice from Senior (Ray Mckinnon),his father and from Mud regarding women.I missed the famous Reese Witherspoon smile. Her role didn't allow it. Bummer. And, in here she plays a more adult role from what we are used to seeing. Good job. Joe Don Baker (where has he been?) does a good job as King, who is after Mud because he believes Mud killed his son. King has Bounty Hunters at his beck and call. There will be some disturbances within this story. You could look at this as Ellis' story as he seems to be the most central character.

69,Sergeant_Tibbs,An unlikely film to tackle the theme of 'true love.' Wait for its second hour.,7,9 August 2013,"I only recently got around to seeing Take Shelter and I ended up really quite liking Jeff Nichols' simple style of filmmaking. He captures mid-East America beautifully as Mud initially feels like a grittier version of an 80s kids adventure movie. It's laid-back irresistible americana. Although Mud moves at a brisk pace, it is quite slow, holding its key details close to its chest. But that slow burn is worth the wait when the core theme of true love is revealed. That can be quite unexpected in a film like this and could change the tone entirely, but it really makes it work and the character drama becomes much more interesting. As the film crushes and shapes the perception of true love it makes the characters more tender than they initially appeared, particularly Matthew McConaughey where it brings a great sense of naivety to his performance. I'm really liking his re-emergence and I'm pinning him for a good shot at the Oscar with Dallas Buyers Club. Although it can seem like a generic film at first, it's worth watching til the end though it's not quite as compelling as Curtis' mental breakdown in Take Shelter.

72,PimpinAinttEasy,Started off well ..... but ennui is Jeff Nichol's hallmark,6,9 August 2016,"Great directors often hire great composers. There is nothing like a great musical score to enhance a film's power. Hitchcock, Scorsese, De Palma - all these great American filmmakers had great composers working for them. The musical score for Mud is the usual trite and sentimental country rubbish that you would hear in any ordinary American film. Mud is no ordinary film. The characters in Mud could be out of a novel written by Mark Twain or William Faulkner if they were alive today. Which is why I question Jeff Nichol's choice of background score. He was aiming high with this film. He needed to get the best in the business. Which makes me question his reputation as one of the best American filmmakers working today. The film started off well. Two boys embark on an adventure on a boat and run into this outlaw sort of character (Matthew McConaughey). After an initial conflict, he earns their respect and the boys decide to help him reunite with his girlfriend in exchange for the boat he lives in. It is an interesting film reflecting the attitudes and motivations of rural Americans (or rednecks - the writer V.S.Naipaul refused to use the word as a pejorative) and their lifestyle. Mud is a film of place - Jeff Nichols seems to love the American countryside and the rural landscapes. He explored this milieu in both Take Shelter and Midnight Special (his latest film).Tye Sheridan is a young actor to watch out for. He made quite an impression in Joe (2013), another film about rural America. Matthew McConaughey must be one of the best leading men in Hollywood today.Unfortunately, one of the hallmark's of Jeff Nichol's films seems to be ennui. He simply trudges along and needlessly elongates the film without adding anything to the characters or the story. I think he is a better writer than a director. I do not expect much out of Hollywood anymore. We are in the bronze as far as Hollywood is concerned. And in the bronze age, Mud is as good as it gets.(6/10)",Mud

Mud ,extensively shot in beautiful locales of Arkansas , is a crime-drama with a well written story , good performances and engrossing screenplay.A fugitive on a loose in a deserted island , MUD (played by Matthew McConaughey) is assisted by two young clad to evade the local police and help him reunite with his girlfriend , Juniper ( Reese Witherspoon).Directed by Jeff Nichols , MUD is a sit-back-on-a-lazy-afternoon drama which you would enjoy immensely as if you are reading a novel and pretty excited as what will happen as you turn to the next page. As the movie begin , you get completely engrossed and the time will flew. The script is very much engaging along with superb direction. Editing could have been better. Special mention to Cinematography for capturing the essence of nature so ecstatically. Matthew McConaughey gives a riveting performance as MUD. Tye Sheridan as Ellis surprises with a knockout performance. Watch him in the scene when he breaks down after knowing the story between MUD and Juniper. Reese Witherspoon is wasted in a small role.

74,napierslogs,"Arkansas, a boat, a tree, two boys, girls, love, snakes and Mud",8,18 May 2013,"Mud (Matthew McConaughey) is the central adult character. He lives in a boat in a tree on an island in Arkansas. And he is dirty. He probably hasn't bathed in weeks, if not years. He also muddies the truth a bit – just a bit, to reflect his version of the world. Our teenage boy protagonists hesitantly take him at his word – there's no reason for him to be any less dependable than their own parents and guardian.""Mud"" is a coming-of-age story primarily of Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and also his friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland). Ellis is pretty disillusioned for all of his fourteen years on this Earth. His parents are unhappy people, finally announcing they're getting a divorce, but Ellis doesn't see a place for himself in anybody's world. He and Neckbone like hanging out on their own, living on the river and plan to own the boat (that's in a tree on an island in Arkansas).These are all interesting characters, including the supporting ones that come in and out of Mud's life and stay in the boys' lives. The boys remind Mud of himself, and Ellis likely sees Mud as someone who is more representative of his personal dreams and desires than his father or anyone else he has met in his small town. The first half, or more, of the film relies solely on the interaction between Mud and Ellis. A plot isn't introduced until much closer to the end of the film. Even the theme of the movie isn't revealed much before the plot begins. The film has a great score to accompany the water-reflective cinematography. But even better is the atmosphere to keep up the suspense that something interesting is going to happen eventually. At any point you fear the possibility of things going disastrously wrong. You never know if or when the boys' safety is in jeopardy. A gun in the wrong person's hands could be bad news; a failed engine in the middle of a swamp could be bad news; even just a snake (of which there were plenty in the movie) could be bad news.The overall theme is that of love. The love of Mud's life is currently in town, but the entire state is trying to keep him away from her. Ellis is also in love; especially in love with the idea of being in love. And Ellis really doesn't understand anybody who isn't in love. Neckbone at least loves girls in general, so that'll do for now. The predominant symbolism in the film is snakes. Mud explains that God put them here for us to be afraid of them; we knew to be scared before we were even here. Everything that snakes represent – good and evil, rebirth, guardianship, poison, medicine, vengefulness and vindictiveness – are all in the film.There are a few returning actors from Jeff Nichols' previous feature ""Take Shelter"". At least one of which will delight indie film fans with his first appearance and it only gets better from their as his character becomes more important to the plot. Although the word ""plot"" is used loosely. After all, ""Mud"" is about Mud, Ellis, love and everything that snakes represent.",Mud
75,areatw,"Solid story and acting, but it's missing something",6,3 November 2018,"'Mud' is a very well-made and well-acted film with a decent storyline and a lot of potential, and yet it's also surprisingly dull, monotonous and unrewarding for the viewer. From a technical perspective, this film is difficult to fault: the cinematography is impressive, the acting is very good and its well-written and put together. Yet its severely lacking in terms of entertainment value and there isn't much for the average viewer to get out of it.There's clearly something missing from this film. There's nothing to make it stand out, nothing to separate it from every other drama film and nothing that leaves an impression on the viewer. Instead, it feels like just another well-made, slow-moving drama. Although the storyline really isn't, the film as a whole feels very ordinary and average. 'Mud' feels like a missed opportunity. For all its technical merits, I'll probably soon forget watching it.",Mud
76,maurice_yacowar,outlaw helps boy come of age,7,20 May 2013,"Jeff Nichols' Mud is a very traditional boys' story. The young boy who encounters a mysterious dangerous adult recalls figures as diverse as Magwitch and Long John Silver. The friendship between the two 14-year-olds who freely explore the Arkansas swamp evoke Huck and Tom. In fact the film parallels several forms of male friendship. Young Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) are two very distinct characters, with an obviously close bond. Tom Blankenship (Sam Shepard) was a surrogate father to Mud (Matthew McConaughey) but their close friendship is resurrected once Mud finally gives up on Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), his unfaithful passion. The film's central symbol is the old boat stranded high in a tree. It begins as an image of something out of its element, something left high and dry, stranded. That's how Mud feels from Juniper's betrayals (a juniper is a tree and he's stuck in the mud below, until he sails off with Blankenship) and how Ellis feels from his capricious treatment by his first ""girlfriend,"" the older May Pearl (Bonnie Sturdivant), whose name evokes both freshness and the treasures for which Galen dives to the deep oyster beds.

79,PartialMovieViewer,Great Potential Squandered,3,22 August 2013,"I really wanted to watch this flick when it first hit the theaters. It looked interesting' light-hearted and different. Well, it was different - very different. I am so glad I can control the, ""Fast Forward Button."" Good concept, too bad something was missing in execution. I usually can't stand movies having ""hidden"" or ""social"" message. Usually these agenda driven abominations are poorly executed cinematic-compost-heaps delivered with such 'in-your-face' arrogance they appeal only to the weakest of intellect. This story, thankfully, did not do that. In a nutshell, the story (my take at least) is a collage of individual struggles and turmoil, dragging through the movie's duration and culminating in a suspenseful finish. Hmmmm - now this sounds like the ideal formula for a ""Coming-of-Age"" movie - right? Wrong! I actually do think we need a good ""Coming-of-Age"" moviebut this movie missed that mark. Come on, if the idea of turning children into thieves, while harboring dangerous criminals is some kind of ""Coming-of-Age"" movie – then I will agree. Granted – many of ""Coming-of-Age"" movies portray parents as demons or perverts – while the seven or eight year olders are the only people with their acts together - sounds kind of stupid - but it is a successful recipe. ""Stand By Me"" as an example. I am very happy this movie did not do that. They actually portrayed parents as caring and flawed individuals, always had time for their children. I mean, they actually took the time to tell their kids they ""love"" them. Very good job on that account. Also, the cast was excellent and they did exactly what they were supposed to do – pick things up, put things down – walk and talk – all of which was brilliantly done. The cinematography and directing were great. And now for that big ""but."" As talented as he is Mathew McConaughey was not used correctly. If only his character had been something other than a murderer with anger issues their was potential for this movie to be a real trend-setter - a ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" if you will. OK - maybe that is a little too far out on that limb. And the shoot-'em-up at the end- huh? That was totally uncalled for. Too bad such potential was wasted – this probably could have been a movie worthy of 'Masterpiece' status. Alas, I personally can't see cheering for a self-serving escaped murderer who corrupts kids throughout an entire movie – and then the audience is supposed to cheer when he succeeds in getting away with his crime. Something here is not ringing very clearly for me. This flick squandered way too much on the wrong type of character, who's flaws needed only minor adjustments to create the consummate, ""Coming-of-Age"" Movie. In the end – I think (again, my take) this will end up being a very forgettable film - too bad.",Mud
80,Holt344,"Matthew McConaughey shines as Mud, a modern take on Mark Twain that's as beautifully told as its filmed",8,26 February 2021,"Mud is written and directed by Jeff Nichols, he's a superb storyteller, both in writing and the visual part. Every line of dialogue to the feeling of the state, everything is just perfect and feels authentic to the southern parts of USA.
Two young boys (Tye Sheridan, and Jacob Loflan) encounters a fugitive and form a pact to help him evade the vigilantes that are on his trail and to reunite him with his true love.
The premise is nothing special but it's the way it's told and how engaging and interesting it is that kept me entertained, also Jeff Nichols keeps his storytelling on point so the steady tension never breaks. The film is like a modern take on the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, it's a fresh and great take on the story.The film stars Matthew McConaughey, Sam Shepard, Reese Witherspoon, Ray McKinnon and Michael Shannon. So many well known and acclaimed actors, I know Michael Shannon have appeared in another film of Jeff Nichols so it's nice to see that they continue to work together as he's amazing. But the award worthy performance goes to Matthew McConaughey, he was the first actor that the writer/director thought off and I see why, Matthew gets everything right regarding the accent and the performance is so entertaining to watch, a great addition to his filmography.

So you end up rooting through a random pile, sticking on films you don't even remember buying. Most of the time, you end up with something very average which passes the time but won't live long in the memory. On other occasions, you completely strike out and stumble across an atrocity which you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy (i.e a movie featuring a certain crimson canine). Then there are those regrettably rare times you discover a hidden gem: One which you never would have willingly watched yourself... due to an uninspiring name, unattractive front cover, unappealing cast....Meet Mud.It concerns one of the most interesting screen characters I've seen of late: A man nicknamed Mud who, blinded by the love of his erstwhile girlfriend, does stupid things that land him in constant trouble. It's clear they're no good for each other, but she seems to enjoy leading him on, and he can't get over his infatuation for her. He may have gone too far with his most recent deed though, as Mud has killed the latest bloke who's shacked up with her... for apparently beating her black and blue. Especially as the dead guy's father has a lot of clout, with friends in the police and plenty of money to hire bounty hunters. On the run, he befriends two boys while fixing up a boat which he hopes will let him retreat up the river. The lads help pick up the parts he needs, as well as deliver messages to his girl... who's also in hiding. Along the way, they bond over the respective difficulties they've experienced in life, as well as dealing with the emotional and physical problems they're suffering in the present day.What a refreshing change to see people in a film behaving like normal, human beings. This may sound like an easy task to write, but believe me... after witnessing some of the one dimensional idiots in recent movies I've endured, I'll never again take such a simple thing for granted. These two kids ARE kids, they have flawed personalities, but also hopes for the future and their friendship is very convincing. The adults are well drawn too... no-one here is without fault, but most have an underlying goodness which speaks to their better nature (apart from the girlfriend's father and his hired goons, but in a drama like this you need someone to hate outright). Mud himself learns a lot of lessons along the way, as do his young assistants...Matthew McConaughey hasn't been this good since Full Metal Jacket. And the switcheroo from coming of age flick to the action packed climax feels natural and unforced.There's very little to complain about here, even the setting in dirty swampland and ramshackle houses is a thing of beauty. In fact, I'd go as far to declare this is probably going to be on my top 10 list of the year right now. Posterity, please prove me wrong.

84,bryank-04844,'Mud' is by far my favorite coming-of-age film of the last year or two. You'll fall in love with the characters and most of you will relate somehow to one of them.,8,23 August 2015,"Jeff Nichols has done a great job with his third film, 'Mud', bringing us a coming-of- age story of two best friends in the south who bond with a homeless fugitive on the run. With amazing performances, a great script, and solid story structure, this tiny tale of love, confidence, and second chances might just win at the box office in due time with positive word-of-mouth.The story centers around Ellis (Tye Sheridan), a 4 year old bot who lives with his unhappy parents (Sarah Paulson and Ray McKinnon) on a house boat in the deep south. His only friend is Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) a boy his age who lives in neighboring house boat with his free-spirited young uncle (Michael Shannon). The two boys tend to stick around the lake they live by rather than go into town where there is really nothing there. Ellis and Neckbone take a small boat out to fish and adventure where they come across a deserted island in the middle of the Mississippi River and find a dirty and gritty looking guy who calls himself Mud (Matthew McConaughey).Mud has taken shelter in an old run down boat that is stuck high in a tree. Quickly, Mud tells the two boys that he killed a man in an altercation over Mud's long lost love Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Despite this knowledge, the two boys decide to help Mud by bringing him food and supplies everyday. In return, Mud will let the boys have the boat once he is reunited with Juniper who is staying in a motel in town and they are on their way out of town. In order to do this, Mud tells the boys that they must get him a motor for the boat, which the boys steal for him. Meanwhile, a gang of bounty hunters have arrived in this small town who are after Mud and Juniper as the leader of this bounty hunting squad's son was killed by Mud.There are some influences of old American literature, particularly of stories that took place in the South. One is 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn', which Nichols has said heavily influenced him on this story. Another angle Nichols conveys here is that every relationship in the film has serious flaws and is strained. And our one constant is Ellis, who wants his parents to stay together and wants to help Mud, even if it means doing a criminal act, so that he can be with his lover. Nobody else seems to keep thing together.Sheridan does an amazing job as Ellis. This is his second film, his first being Terrence Malick's 'Tree of Life', where he played the youngest brother. Although Ellis doesn't talk much, his confidence, mannerisms, and eyes tell his story as he figures out important life lessons for himself. His confidence and courage attract older high-school girls and lead Ellis to stand up for himself and take on older guys in town and never backing down. All of the disappointment and anger that comes through the characters throughout the film lead up to a bloody climax that might be a tad bit cliché, but never oversteps the mark .McConaughey gives a stellar performance as an outlaw who wants a second chance and just wants to be with the one he loves, even if she is holding back. His mystique, dirtiness, and even his chipped tooth all add to part of his charm, which might garner him an acting award in the future. Witherspoon does a great job here and is a step away from her romantic commercial films, as here she plays a tramp who is beaten and tossed around through her life and still can't get it together. Shannon is barely in the film, but provides some comical moments as he tries to teach life lessons to his nephew and Ellis. There is a small cameo by Sam Shepard who has a few surprises up his sleeve and are never too sure about throughout the film.'Mud' is by far my favorite coming-of-age film of the last year or two. You'll fall in love with the characters and most of you will relate somehow to one of them. My advice is to skip out a big blockbuster movie weekend and check this tale of second chances out.

Sheridan looks like a young Tom Hardy, and Lofland competed against over 2,000 others auditioning for the role.

So, in addition to it I'll add the following: A friendship ensues from the encounter and even a bond between Ellis and Mud develops for they are both romantics, at least Mud so conveys to his young friend. We meet Tom Blankenship, father figure to Mud, played superbly by Sam Shepard, as well as Juniper, the supposedly love of Mud's life. To be honest this is the first performance I truly enjoyed from Reese Witherspoon who plays Juniper; I'll consider watching her again if she has serious dark roles.Mud is a wanted man but not such a bad guy. Those who are after him, including the law are not likable one bit; Joe Don Baker who plays King, father of the one Mud killed, delivers a terrific performance. Add the performances of Ray McKinnon and Sarah Paulson as the parents, in impending divorce mode, of Ellis as well as Michael Shannon as the uncle and father figure to Jacob Lofland's character and you have yourself a really great cast.The two main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Tye Sheridan are so believable, it's uncanny. Young Tye Sheridan has a great future ahead of him and McConaughey should make his usual detractors quiet for a bit with this terrific role, if his performance in Paperboy did not already do the job.It comes as no surprise to me that critics raved about this movie; had they not, their credibility would suffer, and better theirs than mine.

89,griffolyon12,Another Fine Performance From McConaughey,9,9 August 2013,"Set in Arkansas on the banks of the Mississippi River, Mud plays kind of like a Southern coming-of-age fable that tries to be like a modern Tom Sawyer, and for the most part director Jeff Nichols' film succeeds.In the film, Matthew McConaughey portrays a convict on the run, who hides out on an island in the middle of the Mississippi River. Here he is found by two boys exploring one day. The two boys take a liking to McConaughey's lovestruck charisma as the man simply known as Mud, who manages to recruit them to help him rebuild a broken down boat in order for him to make his escape. Of course, Mud doesn't want to leave until he can retrieve the love of his life, Juniper, portrayed by Reese Witherspoon.What I found the most enjoyable about this film was the relationship between Mud and the more prominent of the two boys, Ellis, who is played by Tye Sheridan. Mud's devotion to Juniper and his philosophies on love inspire Ellis at a malleable moment in his life when his parents are separating and he is having his first brushes with girls. While it is a story about a convict trying to escape police, it's really a story about this boy's coming-of-age and how this unlikely man transforms him into what I hope will become a good young man.McConaughey steals every scene he is in through sheer charisma, and Sheridan's quiet performance is every bit the opposite, being one of those great acting jobs where most of everything is internalized and in the eyes. While the film has some logic gaps that at times don't make much sense in a real world story such as this, not to mention the fact that I'm tired of movies representing the South as trailer parks and thick Southern drawls, at the end of the day, Mud is one fine movie.I give Mud a 9 out of 10!",Mud
90,rajdoctor,Coming of AGE story - Understanding LOVE,7,14 May 2018,"I saw a beautiful movie MUD (2012)The movie was written and directed by Jeff Nichols. He was inspired by his own heartbreak in LOVE while growing up and he trying to find out the meaning of true LOVE. The pivot of the movie was inspired from Tom Sawyer stories and the setting is on the Southern landscape of Arkansas around Mississippi river. The story is about Two boys around 14 years Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofiand) go to an island to retrieve a boat stuck on a tree, but find a guy named MUD (Mathew McConaughey) living there. They come to know that Mud is a fugitive who needs help to meet his girl-friend Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Ellis agrees to help Mud because Ellis loves a senior girl Mary Lee (Sarah Paulson). In the process, as the story unfolds Ellis suspects Mud and also Juniper on their commitment for LOVE and is disillusioned by LOVE due to Mary Lee's shallowness of understanding LOVE. A group of men are on a lookout for Mud to seek revenge and what happens to Mud, Juniper and whether Ellis understands the meaning of true LOVE forms the remainder of the story.The writing of the movie and execution is excellent. Tye Sheridon as Ellis is brilliant, Mathew and Reese as lovers (though they do not have a single shot together) are good. So are all the other cast.The movie show Arkansas and small town around Mississippi river beautifully and transports the viewers in midst of the location setting. The screenplay too keeps one guessing with its twist and turns. Many consider the movie slow, but I think it is nicely paced. Even after limited release in USA and made on a small budget (filmed in 8 weeks with a crew of 100 people) the movie did good business worldwide. The movie is successful in going into the mind and psychological frame of mind of Ellis as a 14 year old growing adolescent encountering first LOVE and his coming to age journey.

It makes for a ripping good yarn that should please a wide audience thirsty for drama with a bit of heart and some sentimentality (without ever being sappy).The cast works extremely well together under Nichols' direction with McConaughey delivering an Oscar worthy performance as a troubled man hiding out on an island in the Mississippi River who is discovered by two young teenage boys (Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland in two winning performances).You won't want much more spoiled before seeing it.

One is to help him restore an abandoned boat deposited in the trees by a flood; the other is to help him reconnect to the beautiful Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), the love of his life and the source of all his troubles. Will Mud be able to escape with Juniper on his boat? Nichols has succeeded in giving this movie an extraordinarily strong sense of place. This is not just because of the location (beautifully filmed) and drawled speech, but also because of the evocative characters that live here and the lifestyles they lead. But at the same, Daniels tells a complex and interesting story about real people, growing up and relationships.The acting is superb. You will never think the same way about McConaughey or Witherspoon again. Sheridan and Lofland are perfect. And this is a Sam Shephard I've never seen before.As much as I enjoyed this movie, I felt it was a little slow at times, and also it did not particularly move me. For some reason, this beautiful world was a little depressing. Hence the 8, rather than a 9. But I would most definitely recommend this film. After ""Take Shelter"" and now ""Mud"", Nichols is a director to keep an eye on.",Mud
94,SquigglyCrunch,An Anti-Love Story about Love,9,15 December 2016,"Mud follows two young boys who find a man on an island. He tells them about his want to find his girlfriend, and they agree to help him find her. However, the kids soon begin to learn that they're plunging themselves deeper into something much different than they initially anticipated. This is very much a movie about emotion, and while it lacks the 'umph' to bring tears, it is highly effective. The characters are well- rounded and developed, and so when they experience emotional fits the audience is able to relate to and understand them much better. They are all very flawed characters, but that's what makes them that much more human. The movie deals with a lot of themes that plenty of kids have and will go through, with the twist of Matthew McConaughey being in the mix. Despite not experiencing a lot of these things due to my lack of being raised in similar circumstances to these kids, I can tell what they're going through is realistic. And even if it isn't, everything else is good enough to make it seem real. There's always a lot going on, but not in as much a grand scale as it is mental or emotional. There's lots of emotional conflict, often driven by love. As such, the movie portrays a very interesting message that, in a way, contradicts itself. It says one thing more blatantly, but the underlying message is there, and it adds an extra layer to the film. All the performances are pretty outstanding. Matthew McConaughey is great, and so were the child actors Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland. They weren't as young as their characters in the movie, but they pulled off pretty great performances and certainly managed to convince me that they were a few years younger than they were. Overall Mud is a great movie. The acting, the characters, the emotion, even the message is all perfectly executed. For a movie of over 2 hours, it's perfectly paced, and the scenery is gorgeous. With the exception of about one small scene near the beginning, this is an amazing film. In the end I loved this movie and would definitely recommend it.",Mud
95,cinematic_aficionado,"A memorable, emotive film.",7,11 May 2013,"The world though the eyes of two young boys, who are faced with grown up issues.Two boys encounter a grown up man who lives in isolation and that encounter proves pivotal for all concerned. It is not before long that this odd stranger soon earns their trust and perhaps even provides them with a sense of stability that they so lack which causes them to take an active part in his life.Beautifully narrated, this is a story about trust, belonging and, ultimately, love. A man shuns the world, but is prepared to risk it all to reunite with the girl he so loves. These two boys were prepared to put their trust to a stranger with a dark past because he gave them a sense of excitement and belonging. Being young and naive, they believed that true love does exist and must be pursued at all costs.No matter how one tries to avoid fate, it will find you and so happened with Mud. Although the storyline raised some question marks, they are not large enough to overshadow this delightful tale that puts two youngsters at its heart and epicentre. Children believe and want to believe, trust and need to trust, will give but also expect.McConaughey gave a blazing performance but he was not the star of this film; these two boys told this story to us.",Mud
96,rubenm,"Good film, but a bit too slow",6,29 June 2013,"This is a film with many qualities. The setting is original - the banks of the Mississippi river with its houseboats and settlements. The cast is outstanding - Matthew McConaughey once again proves, after Killer Joe and The Lincoln Lawyer, that he is an excellent actor in character parts. The story is great - two 14 year old kids teaming up with a fugitive killer who's waiting for his girlfriend on a remote river island. The cinematography is flawless, with nice shots of the river life.Still, I wasn't gripped by this film. It didn't really strike a chord with me. For one thing, I think the movie was too slow. From time to time, I really wished things would move along a little brisker. The director takes a lot of time to work out the plot, and then there are also some slowly developing side stories involving the parents and the would-be girlfriend of one of the boys. At the end of the film, a climactic shoot-out seems out of place in this otherwise quiet, atmospheric film. I think I would have liked it better if there had been a bit more suspense and some faster pacing.",Mud
97,christophe92300,Empty shell,4,5 September 2013,"First, the script on which the movie relies on is very redundant: Mud is hungry, the kids bring him food, Mud needs a motor, the kids steal one, Mud need a messenger, the kids deliver his letters... and so on for almost two hours, which is inevitably tedious.Moreover, Jeff Nichols got tangled up trying to develop all the (numerous) characters and their relationships, which induces an obvious, and inevitably crippling, shallowness of the latter.Add to that rather poor dialogues, cheap psychology and symbolism (Mud/Ellis parallel, snake, shirt, ...), incoherences, and most importantly a more than questionable morale, and you end up with a mediocre movie, where only the melancholic atmosphere of Arkansas barely strike a chord.",Mud
98,TheSquiss,A wonderful journey few will take that is worth every effort.,8,5 August 2013,"Do you remember waaaaay back when Mathew McConaughey used to churn out twee rom coms and play the second-rate ladies man? When he was the star who never quite hit the spotlight fully or earned the respect of his peers, reviewers, and discerning audience? When he rolled out turkeys like Sahara, Reign of Fire and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days? Those days are long gone. Whilst McConaughey may not have the star pulling power of Messrs Pitt, Depp and Damon he is assuredly in their company with his head held high.The past couple of years have seen him surprise, astound and deservedly earn plaudits for The Lincoln Lawyer, The Paperboy, Magic Mike and Killer Joe and, with an impressive roster of films including Dallas Buyers Club, Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street and Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, he is racking up a portfolio of characters and movies bigger names can only wish for. Mud belongs very solidly amongst the best of them.Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) are two fourteen-year old lads who live on a riverbank in Arkansas; Ellis with his parents, Mary Lee (Sarah Paulson) and Senior (Ray McKinnon) and Neckbone with his uncle, Galen (Michael Shannon). Money is short and life is tough (tougher for Ellis, whose folks are barely married and drifting rapidly). On a jaunt across the water to an island, the friends find a decaying boat balanced high in the boughs of a tree, a remnant of the recent floods, and claim it as their own, only to discover it has already been claimed by hobo resident Mud (McConaughey). Mud, whose disheveled appearance lives up to his name, is on the run from bounty hunters and trying to find his way back to Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), the love of his life, and the boys decide to help Mud is another triumph from the man behind Take Shelter, writer/director Jeff Nichols, that will probably share much the same fate: those who take the time to seek it out will relish the journey and delight in the relationships forged and friendships tested, but far too few will make that effort.Though Mud is an emotional journey rather than a physical, it shares a common theme, a mutual life perhaps, with Stand By Me. Mud, the man, is little more than a boy at times and is equally confused, and at sea as the two children who befriend them. They share a mutual suspicion of each other that is matched by their intrigue and subtle dependency upon each other. Each of them has their needs and all of them need a human crutch or two, be they emotional or physical. Together they are discovering what is true and important and in their lives and coming to terms with what is false and taken away.The peripheral characters are beautifully cast and not overshadowed by 'stars' inhabiting them, though all will be familiar to regular cinema-goers. Witherspoon is perhaps the greatest star pulling power in the list but there is none of the aura that many stars carry around with them despite 'acting'. As the object of Mud's affection, Juniper is part slut, part broken friend so that we veer between wanting to shake her to smarten up and draw her into our arms and make her world better. Though she is an accomplished actress, Witherspoon hasn't climbed so fully into a character since wining an Oscar as June Carter in Walk the Line, and this is a bold statement of her ranking amongst the best actresses, not merely stars, in Hollywood.Shannon is very much the cameo player here, perhaps helping out a friend (having starred in Take Shelter for Nichols) or filling in time between bigger jobs, but it's refreshing to see him play a simple (as in uncomplicated, not dimwitted) good guy. He's the genuine aspect, the stability in Neckbone's life.Paulson (from the excellent but tragically brief Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip) and McKinnon (years of supporting roles and an Oscar winner as a short film producer) spar wonderfully as the couple who love their son in their own ways but just can't bridge the gulf that has grown between them.The boys perform effortlessly together, entirely convincingly as two friends who bicker occasionally but absolutely have each other's back. That Lofland has no previous professional experience, and Sheridan has only one job to his name, is more than a little surprising. In their own ways, both of them have hints of the young River Phoenix about them and, on the basis of Mud alone, both have the potential of the success Phoenix enjoyed in his short life.There are some films (Only God Forgives the most recent example) where one has to reach the end to decide whether it was a fine experience. Mud is not one of those films. From the outset it engages by the time the final scene fades you'll feel as though you've turned the final page on a treasured novel you gave up an entire day for, curled up in your favourite armchair.Make the effort.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Mud
99,RevRonster,I wanna meet a drifter named Mud...,8,13 August 2013,"I was sold when I saw the trailer for this one but found I enjoyed it more than I anticipated.The story is easy to get involved in and once it had its hooks in me, I was sucked in as I watch the tale of a homeless drifter with a shady past named Mud strike up a strange friendship with two boys who have their own issues to deal with. The drama is done just right and it never feels too light or too overwhelming. It's just perfect for what's unfolding on the screen.The other really strong aspect was the performances in this film. McConaughey is great (but it was strange seeing him in a shirt and not being eaten by a dragon) but the real show stealer for me was the young Tye Sheridan who played Ellis; the young boy who finds he is sharing his own unique problems that are not much different than Mud's (but different enough being that his problems are not as shady as Mud's). Sheridan really showed a talent that actors beyond his years and with more credentials are incapable of showing.My only complaint I had was that Michael Shannon was in the film but didn't have enough scenes...but that's only a complaint because I'm a big Michael Shannon fan. Other than that, the film is terrific!",Mud
100,davidgee,"From HUD to MUD - raw, edgy, outstanding",8,23 May 2013,"There are some recognisable 'borrowings' here. I found myself thinking particularly of STAND BY ME and HUD, but also of two oldish British movies, THE GO-BETWEEN and TIGER BAY. This is not to say that MUD feels stale or recycled. On the contrary, it's a refreshing new take on favourite themes with a raw, edgy quality that gets the viewer emotionally engaged in the story and the characters. Matthew McConaughey sheds much of his glamour but none of his charisma in the title role and gives what may be his best ever performance. The two kids (Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland) show the kind of promise we saw in the early films of Depp and DiCaprio and River Phoenix. Sam Shepard and Joe Don Baker are the most familiar faces in a fine supporting cast. Script and direction are crisp and well-paced; there's some outstanding cinematography. The 'two-stage' climax robs the movie of some of its grit, but there's a pervasive sense of a small (and desperately poor) community where the dull pace of daily life is suddenly shoved into a higher gear.",Mud

And it is really the acting that does really good in this and is the main part of the story and movie.There is a good story behind this film, one that Jeff Nichols really brings to the screen with writing and direction, very nicely done and a good (maybe a bit slow moving) film indeed.",Mud
102,diane-34,The real America,9,19 August 2013,"Diane and I watched this marvelous movie this afternoon at the Luna on Essex in Fremantle and both of us enjoyed it tremendously. It is an unexpected movie in that it has nothing to do with those dumb Hollywood cartoons with the life-like human figures nor does it have exploding cars doing end to end special effects. No, this film is quiet, atmospheric and more European than the mind numbing stuff of which Hollywood seems unable to divest itself.My uncle told me years ago that as a young man he spent about a year living on an uninhabited island in the Mississippi River; this would have been sometime at the end of the 19th century so I was particularly interested in seeing how this story was filmed in terms of the island flora. It was very good and very real (at least by my conventions of what an island in the middle of the river should be like.) The actors were particularly well cast and followed through their roles excellently. Diane was taken by the acting quality of the two boys, the accuracy of their dialog exchanges as well as the sympathetic handling by the actors of the unifying concept of love and its expression under the varying differences of wealth, age, and sex.This is a wonderful American movie and gives the viewer faith that it is possible to make ""small"" movies of superb quality in Hollywood.",Mud

However, the two kids, played by Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland, are the true surprise. Unfortunately for Reese Witherspoon, she wasn't given much to play with, her appearance looking more like a cameo than a full role.The bad.

105,socrates99,This is the closest any movie's come to perfection in a long time,9,10 July 2013,"To start with the negatives, I'd say there are about three instances of failure on the director's part, I'm guessing, that I will not be listing. If you don't agree with me then it would be a shame to point them out to you because otherwise this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I can't remember being as engrossed in a film as this one.The storyline with perhaps a minor exception is a thing of beauty. The idea that a fugitive is discovered by a pair of young boys works extremely well and neatly opens like some flower into the other aspects of this southern tale of unrequited love and self-delusion. The casting of Ellis and Mud, in particular, has got to be the most fortuitous pairing I've ever seen. The stars definitely had to come together to have them both available, McConaughey and Sheridan carry the bulk of the movie as effortlessly as they do the shirts on their backs.I honestly was transported to the south in the dark of the movie house and not for a minute did the spell break. Is this a perfect movie? No, it isn't, but it is truly a gem for anyone with any familiarity with the kind of lifestyle depicted.",Mud
106,rooee,Deep water,8,10 May 2013,"After the feverish Deep South nightmares of Killer Joe and The Paperboy, here comes the calm after the storm: a relatively gentle yet not less involving rite of passage drama set upon the Mississippi. One could argue that the river is the main character, acting as both the physical location and a metaphor for the film's depiction of the human character: an unpredictable creature in a constant state of change, yet inexorably surging onward toward some kind of freedom that it mightn't yet know. One day we'll stop going on about Matthew McConaughey's resurgence and simply accept him as the actor he always promised to be. (Perhaps this time will come when he's been fully Christopher Nolanised.) In Mud, he is the mythic figure of the film's title, found upon an island by young teenage buddies Ellis (Tye Sheridan, last seen in Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life, and destined to be a star) and Neckbone (endearing newcomer Jacob Lofland). Mud employs the kids to fetch him food, as well as equipment to fix a boat. It becomes clear that Mud is making some kind of getaway from the law, and that maybe he ain't the roguish hero he seems. The film craftily plays with our expectations. We, the cynical audience, assume from the beginning that Mud is up to no good. But Ellis, starting from the angelic assumption of innate goodness, simply trusts Mud. Over the course of the film our assumptions will be dragged in one direction, while Ellis's will be dragged in another. It's a rite of passage that operates in both directions: childhood into young adulthood, where love is untrustworthy, and jaded adulthood into childhood, where love exists untainted. Ellis is not a romantic as such. He doesn't dream of a way life could be - he simply believes this is how life is. ""I love you,"" he tells the senior he thinks is his girlfriend. ""You're 14,"" she sneers, as if he knows nothing of love. And yet, of course, he knows love in a way that older generations can't. For grown man Mud, Ellis embodies himself at the time his love for Juniper (a stricken Reese Witherspoon) was strongest, and their friendship gives him access to that feeling, unbruised and unbattered by time.Mud is a movie about myth-making; our tendency to make myths of each other. It's really refreshing to watch a drama set in the American South without hick stereotypes. The families aren't perfect, and they're poor, but they're striving to make the best of their situation, ultimately through the efforts of familial affection. Misery porn and exploitation are conspicuous in their absence. The one moment that doesn't entirely work for me is the final act shootout. It's well-staged and tense, but feels incongruous in the context and style of the rest of the movie. Although, perhaps this is deliberate; perhaps writer-director Jeff Nichols is suggesting that, even in this age of billionaire superheroes with a billion-dollar box office, sometimes pyrotechnics and orchestral drum crashes are unwelcome gatecrashers to the cinematic party. Sometimes you want something like Mud: a film at peace with itself, full of character and poetry and nuance, full of excellent performances, and full of a very relatable, very human kind of hope.",Mud

The crowd particularly loved local favorites director Jeff Nichols and the always shape-shifting Matthew McConaughey. (How is it possible that McConaughey hasn't even been nominated for an Oscar yet?) Mud is a charming, entrancing film that has almost lyrical quality as it unfolds along the rural backwoods of Arkansas's Mississippi River. The story revolves around the adventures of two young teenage boys who meet a mysterious drifter appropriately named Mud. Mud is hiding out an island in the Mississippi River awaiting the arrival of his beloved Juniper. The story has elements of drama, thriller, and romance. While the film is slightly too long and the story has a few unnecessary and distracting subplots, its overall eloquence and is absorbing. So like the Mississippi, the story meanders a little too much. The River setting becomes a character in the film that shapes the drama playing out along it. The two teenage actors are excellent, but the film is tour-de-force for McConaughey who is its heart and soul. Highly recommended for those who like serious drama and appreciate natural beauty.",Mud
109,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,Some suspension of disbelief may be required,8,27 June 2014,"Writer-director Jeff Nichols deserves credit for giving us three films, at least, in one.

Next there's a regional coming of age drama set in a picturesque corner of Arkansas, then a Jim Thompson–style Southern noir with a slambang climax worthy of ""Justified"" or ""Boardwalk Empire."" Extra credit for showing a part of the country and a way of life that don't turn up in films too often—we certainly understand why Ellis would rather keep living in a fishing shack on the riverbank than move to a cookie-cutter apartment house next to a strip mall (today's equivalent of Aunt Polly's house?). The cast, starting with Tye Sheridan (""Tree of Life"") and newcomer Jacob Lofland as teenage river rats, is just about perfect.

Right,in a cold and superficial level, it talks only about a kid that wants to help Mud, wonderfully interpreted by McConaughey, to escape from a island and the city with his long time lover, interpreted by Reese Whiterspoon. But obviously isn't only about that. Is a film about love. And not only about the girl-guy passionate love. Is also about the parent's love, relative's love, the son's love, friendship love, and it talks about the good and bad sides of love too. Is a film literally full of love. About the technical aspects...I loved how the film pushed you into the atmosphere. The sound was brilliant, and the cinematography is the best of 2012 by far. I almost could felt the water, the ground, the island, and even the hot weather. Such an unique film experience.The story is slow paced, and if you aren't used with films that are made to be appreciated, this isn't for you...but if you do enjoy films, like I do, you'll enjoy Mud immensely. The character development is great and we have definitely a character study, an unexpected one, given the protagonist is only 14 years old. But yes, it was excellent well made, thanks to the great performances.I already gave hints about what you can like about Mud.

111,yris2002,Very well shot and greatly acted,7,1 September 2014,"From the point of view of content, ""Mud"" is a traditional coming-of-age tale, dealing with teenagers facing those important experiences that will shape their adulthood, making the first significant decisions of their lives. In this sense, the movie is not original and does not add anything new to a long-dated cinematography about young boys growing up through tough experiences. Also the importance of nature, in this case the majestic and impressive Mississippi river, is always part of this kind of movies, where nature is always there as a necessary background to remind the primitive and irrational side of man. However, what impresses in the movie is the quality and precision of shooting, thanks to which every single character is given the chance to emerge beyond a rather flimsy plot, and the river itself becomes a true character embracing and shaping the life of each character. Of course, this great work would be useless, were it not supported by a talented cast, and here acting is one of high quality: Matthew Mcconaghey once again proves at ease in tormented, suffering and yet strong roles, and the young Tye Sheridan seems a very promising actor. On the whole, despite its excessive length and some unnecessary violence, the movie is a good piece of cinema and can appeal both young and adult viewers.",Mud

113,ghost_dog86,The Power of White Trash Love,6,7 May 2013,"Although better than ""Take Shelter"", ""Mud"" is still not as good, as deep or as entertaining as writer/director Jeff Nichols thinks that it is. Starring Matthew McConaughey in supposedly the best performance to come out of the McCona-sance, Nichols' slightly misogynistic plot tells the story of two boys who decide to explore an island on the Mississippi River, after one claims to have discovered a mysterious boat suspended in the trees. Once on the island they run into a man who goes by the name of Mud; a filthy, starving and very mysterious fugitive, who seems to be living on the boat. Mud elicits the boys help, in exchange for the aforementioned boat. Now, while that sounds like an interesting story, after a while the true themes of ""Mud"" emerge, when the film begins to play out more so as a multi-generational tale of men who fall in love with women, who prove to be their downfall. There is a ton of sub-textual ""stuff"" going on here, dealing with boats as a metaphor for a man's self worth and multiple parallels concerning father and son relationships. And though sub-textual ""stuff"" is essentially what allows for the best films, due to Nichols' script, ""Mud"" comes off as more ambiguously underdeveloped than anything. And thus, its own emotional themes concerning coming of age and father and son relationships become muddled, getting lost in the lack of an intriguing story which becomes sadly less and less powerful as it progresses. And therein lies the problem with ""Mud"". Its foundation was constructed by a writer/director who has a nasty habit of being far too cryptic of a filmmaker for his own good. That said, Nichols does display a slathering of beautifully constructed visuals and a few inspired lines of dialogue (mostly muttered by the profoundly underutilized Michael Shannon). And there are definitely bits and pieces of this movie, in conjunction with standout performances from both McConaughey and Tye Sheridan, who played the main child protagonist here (and reminded me of River Phoenix in ""Stand by Me"") that will have audiences sitting forward and taking notice. Side Note: Reese Witherspoon is also in this movie, but doesn't really do much of anything. So, she's really not worth talking about. Final Thought: If there is one positive thing I could say about Nichols as an up and coming writer/director, it would be that he does tend to bring out stellar performances from his stable of actors. And ""Mud"" is the type of film which moves forward on the backs of performances, not necessarily on plot. So, despite the predictable narrative, there is enough good here (especially in the final act) to slightly recommend this film. In fact, I think I would be hard pressed to find anybody who could outright hate ""Mud"". But I am still shocked at the hordes of critics who tout this as a ""must see"" or even award worthy.

114,nesfilmreviews,An engaging coming-of-age tale whose plot holes barely matter.,8,5 August 2013,"""Mud,"" the third feature from writer and director Jeff Nichols, is a remarkably accomplished piece of storytelling. From his promising, impressive film debut, ""Shotgun Stories,"" (2007) to the fascinating ""Take Shelter,"" (2011) both showcases for Michael Shannon, who also has a key-supporting role in this film. Nichols has taken another step forward with his latest, which draws on Mark Twain's ""Huckleberry Finn"" as a rough model for Ellis's story. The film presents an impressive narrative construction and compelling characters with dynamic performances.Two boys, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), speed out on their boat to a nearby spit of land to check out the unusual sight of a boat ensnared in a treetop, when they encounter an inhabitant. Mud (Matthew McConaughey), declares that he's waiting around for an arranged date with girlfriend Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). So he promptly enlists the help of the boys, who are in need of an adventurous break from their own humdrum lives. The boys have plenty of questions about his origins, but he doesn't reveal much. Mud is from around these parts -- but fearful, it seems -- of straying too close to the people and places of his youth.At its heart, ""Mud"" is a story of the strength of familial bonds, of relationships destroyed by our ineradicable flaws, and a coming-of-age film that defines us all. Filled with destructive and nuanced characters, ""Mud"" deals in simple heartfelt emotions, and in a genuinely moving fashion. Nichols' approach to filmmaking also provides an additional palpable emotional element to the earnest storyline. ""Mud"" doesn't end up being a perfect film, with a runtime that feels a bit long, and its ending is a little weak. That's not to say it isn't fitting, but it just doesn't feel as satisfying as the rest of the film.Always bringing out the best in his cast, Nichols solidifies his status as one of the best indie filmmakers of today. ""Mud"" delivers astounding performances while wrapping up the perfect blend of dramatic weight and fairy tale happiness. When the story gets going, and the moralities of characters' actions come into play, and there's no way to avoid being captivated by its southern hospitality.",Mud

This film could be a modern Mark Twain Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer tale.Even though there are similarities to Stand By Me, as a kid's coming of age story, it is much more bleak and a violent, with nothing but loss of innocence along the way.The entire cast, especially the father and the two teenage boys, did a fabulous job with the only downside being the tiresome repetitive scenes of being on the island and off it and on it...that dragged the film on by a half hour.I was especially amazed as Reese Witherspoon's new look...I didn't recognize her at first as the Legally Blonde, Sweet Home Alabama girl.",Mud
116,daniewhite-1,Gud,7,22 September 2021,"Different takes on old themes are welcome in my experience and 'Mud' has a few different takes on very old themes of adolescence and generational clashes.Which is shown as two young teenage boys encounter their own early romantic adult lives and the outlasting, crippling, lingering of Mud's adolescent loving.With a slow pace and long takes 'Mud' certainly doesn't flow fast but it is trying to operate at a tangent where actions are metaphors for human circumstances and characters exist as a network of relationships, some of them unconventional and emotionally complicated.The performances are mainly adequate but the abstract tone forces a very reserved approach from the cast who don't really exhibit their characters as a consequence.The film is simply too long and parts of the second and third acts could have been quickened.Technical credits are sufficient and the writing achieves most of its targets with its human characters and themes.I rate a 7/10 and I recommend to fans of indirect psychological thrillers and extensive character relationships.",Mud
117,CineCritic2517,Aggravatingly dull..,1,12 March 2014,"McConaughey plays 'Mud', a convict hiding on some island in the Mississippi river. Two local boys stumble upon his hideout and decide to aid him with food and supplies for no reason explained. Intended, I guess, as a coming of age story, the film sports some very nice visuals and top notch acting from McConaughey who surely by now has developed a nasty smoking habit in real life as well. Sadly, that's about the only positive thing one could offer discussing a film which begs the question why it was made in the first place. The movie is way too slow-paced considering the flimsy story line it tries to tackle. A story that also only builds up to something that felt out of place and utterly cliché at the same time. What little story they undertook to be screened was never convincing as to have any basis in reality either. Character development felt forced and with such an obvious script, the film amounts to little else than a cinematic sleeping pill.",Mud
118,rgblakey,What is Matthew McConaughey running from in MUD,5,8 August 2013,"At one point Matthew McConaughey was a decent box office draw, but then he started taking on the silly romantic comedies and his reign seemed to be coming to an end. Then out of nowhere he come barreling back in some smaller releases delivering awesome performances in films like Bernie and Killer Joe as well as his turn as a stripper in Magic Mike a looked to find his stride all over again. His latest film MUD once again places him in a smaller film, but does it continue this great direction in his career? MUD follows two boys who discover a mysterious man named Mud hiding on an island in Mississippi. He begins to tell them a wild tale of a man he killed, bounty hunters on his tail and the woman he loves that he plans to escape with. While not sure if he is telling the truth they agree to help him and soon the small town is besieged by a beautiful girl with bounty hunters in tow. While this film may not standout like some of his other recent films, the film still delivers a great story and once again a great performance by McConaughey. There is a tiny bit of action at the end, but this is a character film focusing on the emotional journeys and growth of these characters. While McConaughey delivers a great performance and is the focus of the main story, he is actually a supporting player with this film really more about the kids that befriend and help him and what they are dealing with in their lives and how it all changes after this encounter.This is one of those films filled with great performances and a good story, but nothing that really pushes the boundaries of filmmaking. Besides McConaughey whose performance is enough to be worth checking out this whole film, it sports a great supporting cast including Reese Witherspoon, Tye Sheridan, Jacob Lofland, Sam Shepard, Michael Shannon, and Joe Don Baker. MUD is worth checking out and is another positive stepping stone in this great new direction McConaughey is taking his career.",Mud

MUD is a well constructed movie, with a credible story and action. McConaughey is in great form but the two kids, Lofland and, especially, Sheridan, steal the show with honest and unabashed performances. Apparently, the film's central element is McConaughey on the run from a posse out to kill him but, in truth, the film looks a great deal more at human relationships, the fallacies of love in the eyes of kids coming of age, the impact of a broken marriage, and the sense of commitment from kids who have not had much of a family life.Sam Shephard is also in excellent form, Witherspoon appears only intermittently in a part that does not really do her any favors, and Michael Shannon's presence is, in my view, completely unnecessary and distracting, hence my docking a star. Well deserved 9 out of 10.",Mud
121,grnhair2001,Amazing screenplay,10,22 April 2014,"Where are all the screen writing awards for this movie? This was one hell of a script--layered, moving, smart, and well paced. Some of the tiny rolls were choice, for the half-dozen lines the actor got were wonderful and characterized perfectly the person they portrayed. (""I'm a princess!"" for instance, one of a hundred great small moments.)The acting was all marvelous and brought that all to life, but man, what a script. Probably 90% of movies I watch at home, I'm so unengaged that I start playing solitaire or dusting or doing my nails during, but I never wanted my eyes to leave the screen during this movie.At the climax of the film, which begins as emotional climax, I was entirely invested in the characters and their emotions, attending to every word, every nuance of facial expression. And then it changed, in an instant, to an action climax, and I was entirely invested in that, my heart pounding. And THEN, the ""Chekhov's gun"" went off, and I thought my head would explode. I leapt out of bed where I was watching from and--admittedly, lost to the fictive dream for a moment--literally applauded the screenwriter/director. Damn, you hid that well; I never saw it coming, but once it does happen, it's revealed as inevitable. I'm still grinning about how well that was done. Seriously, this script should be studied by screen writing students alongside Chinatown and Butch Cassidy; it's that good.What else do I love about this? So much. The three braids about romantic love in Ellis's life being woven so well together. The other loves, the friendships and parental love, so strong and moving. I love the characterization of Juniper, first from Mud's POV, where she seems like a golden angel, then the boy's distant view, then Tom's, and finally my own, when I realize she's just a garden-variety skank: totally cool journey for this viewer. I love how our own view of Mud changes, too, how he becomes in turn a delusional bum, a philosopher naif, a dangerous man, selfish, and finally selfless.I love how much the director/screenwriter loves his people, loves this region, and how I felt that affection shine through. I feel entirely the opposite of how I felt about Winter's Bone, where I sensed Californians (and perhaps shameful Midwesterners who wished they were really coastals instead) were condescending to Midwesterners, portraying them unfairly and feeling smug and superior about it. Here, the people are working poor and rural, but they're interesting and mostly decent and sometimes noble. The worst people--the rich father mourning the loss of his son in the worst possible way--even evoke sympathy. The prayer scene was shocking and quirkily funny and entirely believable. I also love that, in this day and age, you can watch a kid call his father ""sir"" and not roll your eyes in cynical disbelief or shudder in fear for the child.I love that the story is sad and hopeful at the same time.It has vaulted onto my list of top 30 favorite films ever (the 21st I've given a 10 rating to here out of perhaps 1000 films I've rated). And how often does that happen?",Mud

123,palavitsinis,A real movie,8,29 June 2015,"Well, this is definitely one of the movies that stays with you. In order of ""impression"", first of all, I was amazed by the acting of the teenagers and after that, I was impressed by Matthew McConaughey once more! This guy, movie after movie is getting better and better. The setting of Missisipi and the river houses was truly remarkable! The story that lies in the core of the movie is also inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time. It's also amazing how the kid that respects his dad but he does not admire him that much, is immediately impressed by Mud and really relates to him also having his own fling with the older girl. In the end of the movie, you are left with the sense that no justice was served (as Mud should have been shot), but you're happy that he left with his friend, dumping this ungrateful character that never truly loved him. The parallel stories that evolve are also well described and end-up in a satisfying manner. The movie does not do the easy thing that is to make the parents of the kid work it out, and this is the right thing. So you kind of get a happy ending and you don't... The most amazing scene is the one with the kid in the end that checks out the new neighbors... It's as simple as that in real life and although he went through a real drama, in the end he's just a teenager and that's how he behaves. This movie was in the right proportion about everything!",Mud
124,quinnox-1,Atmospheric drama,7,17 May 2013,"This was a fairly good drama about two young boys and the mysterious and eccentric stranger they meet on an isolated island. It is kind of formulaic though, but the acting is good, with the two boys doing an especially good job depicting life growing up in a small Southern town, with the typical ""backwoods"" culture you would expect. Nothing amazing, but a pleasant movie to watch with well done atmosphere permeating the movie throughout. I think this would be a good movie to take a family to, for example. It falls short of being a great movie but pretty good for what it is. The soundtrack was very good in setting the mood. It had a very limited release and not in many theaters so it might be easier to wait for the DVD or internet streaming option.",Mud
125,JPfanatic93,"Shattering a child's notions of love and life, or not?",7,6 October 2013,"Gritty and stern coming-of-age drama set on the banks of the mighty Mississippi in a poor, rural community where you get nothing for free, love least of all. Young boys Ellis and Neckbone (marvelous acting from newcomers Tue Sheridan and Jacob Lofland) try to make the best of a harsh life, having fun as well as their situation will allow them. Their latest find to ensure a good time: an abandoned boat swept into the treetops by a flood on a small, neglected river island. Soon someone else encroaches on this idyllic place of theirs though, a mysterious drifter named Mud (impeccable performance by Matthew McConaughey, almost making you forget the numerous lousy romcoms he has starred in in recent years by showing he can still do more demanding bits of acting). On the run from the police, Mud weaves a sympathetic tale of drama and romance which ensnares the boys into making a deal with this stranger: if they provide him with food, tools and information in his ploy to elope with his sweetheart Juniper (a battered but ever beautiful Reese Witherspoon), they can keep the boat, and, thrown in as a bonus, his gun. The boys swiftly find out Mud may be more dangerous than they at first anticipated, as his archenemy arrives in town wist a posse of bounty hunters, poised to kill their new secret associate at all costs. The audience has no illusions that Mud's stories about his life and situation are nowhere near the whole truth, if not a bunch of bald faced lies and baloney. But like the young protagonists, we cannot help but be entranced by Mud's Southern charm and seeming sincerity, especially when much of his wild tales seem to be verified as the film progresses. For Ellis, the love between Mud and Juniper is a refreshing taste of the good things in life he himself sorely lacks, as his own parents cannot get along and are moving increasingly towards a divorce which may end Ellis' life as he knows it, and not necessarily for the better. Just hitting puberty and taking his own first steps in the minefield that is love, Ellis so badly wants to believe in true love that will make people do anything to maintain it, he is blind to any hints that suggest Mud is nothing but a con man. Of course, things are indeed not as they seem, and everything points to Mud having used the boys for his own shady purposes. Despite the eventual exposure of his web of lies though, Mud gets his fair chance to redeem himself in the eyes of his former acolytes, as his nemesis and his band of brigands are moving in on him with no moral qualms of taking out anyone that has come to his aid of late, putting Ellis and Neckbone in grave danger too. A violent conclusion and an unavoidable number of deaths seems inescapable, and love seems unlikely to save the day as Ellis so firmly desired. Director Jeff Nichols (Take Shelter) doesn't go easy on his juvenile main characters and adds plenty of misery and bad luck to their already hard life, shattering their illusions and dreams for the future, but never going so far as to eliminate hope entirely. A child's notions of love and life never quite come to fruition as it had expected, he states, but good things can still come from a bad situation in the long run (which does lead to a happy ending that cannot fully avoid a bit of sentimentality). His point is made with help of a great supporting cast of excellent actors, among them the likes of Sam Shepard, Paul Sparks and Michael Shannon (the latter both Boardwalk Empire veterans). Despite the hardships their characters suffer, the swamp lands surrounding the Mississippi that Nichols introduces us to remain a place of simple beauty and hopeful dreams that no violence, betrayal or lies can hurt.",Mud

I think this movie is made for women, because the word ""love"" gets mentioned a lot.There isn't much excitement throughout the movie, except maybe near the end.Many things don't make sense. Like how could the children sneak off to an island on a boat so many times and nobody ever suspected anything?During the gun fight, how come nobody noticed or went after the sniper? And why would they ambush someone when the person is inside a building and not visible from the outside. Why not wait until the person is out in the open and nowhere to hide?It's not a bad movie, just unexciting. Is all.",Mud
127,dharmendrasingh,Helluva Film,8,5 June 2013,"With only three features Jeff Nichols has cemented his reputation as a writer-director to be reckoned with. Mud is a skillful blend of love, coming-of-age and revenge story which takes place in Arkansas, an old- fashioned part of America where the young still call their elders 'sir' and just about everyone can tie a bowline or fix a car. Building on his superb performances in Killer Joe and Magic Mike, Matthew McConaughey stars as the eponymous Mud, a mysterious fugitive marooned on a Mississippi island, where he dreams of reuniting with his beloved Juniper (an authentically trashy Reese Witherspoon). On one of their boating adventures two intrepid boys, Ellis and Neckbone (Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland), stumble upon a speedboat which is somehow stuck up a tree. They discover that it belongs to Mud, and after a nervy initial encounter the boys form a clandestine bond with him. They make a deal: the boat in return for food. We know that there must be sinister reasons for someone to be out here alone. But the boys, barely teenagers, come from unstable backgrounds and are lone children in their homes. Mud treats them like adults and endears himself to them. The boys are easily charmed and therefore have no reason to be suspicious. Nichols's film, as with his Take Shelter, develops the story gradually. The plot is revealed sparsely, incrementally, which keeps us guessing. And then follows one of the most sudden and heart-pounding endings you're likely to see. Another great American director, Sam Peckinpah, was famous for the same technique.We first suspect then learn that Mud is on the run for a cold-blooded murder. The way he justifies his action is especially chilling. Instead of condemning him, he makes us – or at least me – sympathise with him. That's the genius of McConaughey's performance – he has to be simultaneously hateful and likable.There are vestiges of his Joe Cooper from Killer Joe. He whispers dialogue through an Arkansas accent, and is no less arresting despite a dirty constitution and chipped front teeth. Nichols was overjoyed with the two boys. With good reason. Both deliver prodigious performances, particularly Tye Sheridan, who assumes the lead role for much of the film and clearly has a future in movies. He is moved by Mud's love for Juniper, and helps them to reunite to give meaning to his own precarious life. Dressed in a palette of autumnal browns and yellows, the film has an authentic quality. Nichols directs with a keen eye for detail and mood. There are frequent shots of eels and crawling insects – animal metaphors, another Peckinpah trademark.I have a small criticism. We learn that Mud's dreamy perception of his relationship with Juniper is a delusion. It is implied that he is as violent as the many men she has been with during her time with him, and that her departure from him is a recurring event. I found it difficult to believe that somebody as selfish and deceitful as Mud would be this 'committed' to anyone.",Mud
128,julian-mumford,Like an updated Tom Sawyer novel about nothing and everything,8,11 April 2014,"14 year old Ellis (Tye Sheridan) lives with his mum Mary Lee (Sarah Paulsen) and father ""Senior"" (Ray Mckinnon) by the River in Arkansas. Their ramshackle boat house providing easy access to scratch a living selling fish from the mighty Mississippi.Ellis is free to roam the bye waters in his boat with his friend ""Neckbone"" (Jacob Lofland) who lives with his uncle Galen (Michael Shannon). Galen keeps himself in beer by diving for oysters in the murky depths, when not loving the ladies to his favourite tunes or playing the guitar.This is a tough, real life day to day type of existence, well away from the American lives you normally see on the big screen. It is a change to see people that are struggling, yet largely content and portrayed as loving their kids, caring about them as best they can and not turning to violence at a moments notice.Stumbling across a boat stuck high up in the trees on a deserted island, the boys believe they have found their perfect hideout. After a while they realise they are not the first to find the boat. Notwithstanding all the possible avenues the story could take, horror or something sinister with the older man interacting with younger boys, the story takes none of the conventional routes.Meeting ""Mud"" (McConaughey) we meet a perfectly formed complex character, conversing in the usual but even more pronounced southern drawl. Armed with a pistol and a strong independent survival instinct, he starts to rely or manipulate, dependant on your viewpoint, the boys to his main aim. Retaining or retrieving the love of his life ""Juniper"" (Reece Witherspoon), his sole reason for being is to ensure her safety away from the forces of evil, that he perceives continue to follow her.To give too much away would spoil the film but fair to say, the story meanders and forks in the same way the Mississippi, ever present in the background, continues to do. The delicate friendships and loyalties that are built and called into question, are all beautifully and believably portrayed.Tye Sheridan is strong yet vulnerable, experiencing the pitfalls of young love and the upheavals of his home-life require him to trust someone, whether he makes the right choices remain to be seen. McConaughey is well cast and acquits himself well, with a thoughtful layered performance that goes well beyond the stereotypes you might expect. There is a sense of loss through the movie but it is never clear what has been left behind, the ending in particular is sensitively handled. Witherspoon does not get much screen-time but makes the most of the scenes she has, portraying a character one step up from trailer trash. However she remains a constant contradiction of smarts and foolishness wrapped within a superficially simple yet complicated persona.Matthew McConaughey has recently rescued himself from recent Rom Com hell with a string of good performances in films that actually matter, his recent collaboration with Scorsese in ""Wolf of Wall Street"" is a good example. It is good to see his career resurrection and start to get noticed again for his obvious acting ability. Director and writer Jeff Nichol has coaxed excellent performances especially from his young cast, whilst placing them in a believable world of which most audiences have no previous experience Complaints, the character played by Sam Shephard feels more like a plot convenience than reality and arguably Sheridan makes it hard for his co-star to shine when his performance is so strong and front and centre.Summary A hugely enjoyable film that perhaps defies comparisons and convention. With a story that has time to grow and confound, there are many pleasures to be had.Like an updated Tom Sawyer novel about nothing and everything, this comes highly recommended.",Mud
129,tbmforclasstsar,"a powerful coming-of-age story complete with strong writing, bold direction, and great performances from seasoned actors and new talent",10,5 May 2013,"I am always intrigued by films where the writer decides to tell a story from the perspective of a young kid. The decision is always a bold one, as you know you are creating possible complications with casting and the maturity and comprehension level of the young actors that will be playing your major roles. Even more bold is writing a story like this for a film that the writer will also be directing. This is not a writer creating an interesting story that has all the possible complications pushed off on someone else. It is a writer that knows all of this work will be on their shoulders.In Jeff Nichols new film Mud, he does just that. Nichols writes a modern day Huckleberry Finn adventure following two young boys, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), who grow a partnership with a homeless runaway named Mud (Matthew McConaughey) that they meet on an uninhabited island. What begins as an agreement to help Mud in exchange for the right to keep a boat that the three have found on the island, the boys quickly form a friendship with the man and help him without necessity of a grand reward.Mud's mission is simple. He wants to meet up with a former love interest, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), but can't risk the reunion in public. Mud has people searching for him for actions in his past, and if he is ever going to meet up with Juniper again, he will need to create a plan with her that Ellis and Neck can help him carry out. Willing to be a part of the adventure, we quickly see the innocence and romanticism of the 14 year old Ellis, who wants to help the Mud and Juniper because they love each other.Part of this romanticism is from his youth, but part of it seems to be that he wants to believe in love as his parents have recently separated and he has a love interest of his own in the form of a high school junior. With a mix of confusion about love, learning experiences about the hardships of relationships, and a coming of age story of Ellis as a man in both sexual interest and confidence and courage to stand up for himself, Mud becomes a fascinating tale of a young boy putting all his belief in the relationship of a homeless man on an island and the woman he loves that may or may not be waiting for him in the nearby town.Jeff Nichols writing and directing style is evident once again in Mud. If you have seen either of his previous works, Shotgun Stories or Take Shelter, you know Nichols keeps a slower pace in his films, allowing for characters to become more realized and giving the audience a chance to connect with them. This also allows for Nichols' actors to give strong performances, which we see once again in this new film. The dashing McConaughey is hidden under dirt, bad teeth, and greasy hair, but it is his strong commitment to the character that makes us forget that this is one of the sexier actors working in film. From minute one, I believed McConaughey's portrayal of the strange and morally complicated drifter completely, as he was able to create a realistic and intriguing character that was the backbone of the film. Having a slow pace demands a strong grouping of actors, specifically the leads. If McConaughey's performance had been anything less, the movie would have suffered greatly for it, but with the commitment and work of the often times mocked actor, Mud is consistently entertaining and never dragged for me in the two hour ten minute runtime.To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/mud/",Mud
130,themissingpatient,A Great Achievement,8,31 July 2013,"Two fourteen year old boys, Ellis and Neckbone, find a boat hanging in a tree on a small island along the Mississippi River. Once inside they realize someone is living in it. That someone is Mud, played by Matthew McConaughey, a gritty superstitious man in-hiding. Mud needs some help and makes a deal with the boys. If they help him get the boat out of the tree and working so he can sail away to freedom, he will give them his gun.The film focuses on the contrasts and subtle similarities between Ellis, played by Tye Sheridan, a young actor who shows much promise, and the mysterious character of Mud. The film is a coming-of-age story and a mysterious dramatic thriller all at once. Though Ellis is young, he is strong, brave and even somewhat heroic, making him a perfect protagonist we can admire and appreciate. Mud's intentions and sanity are questionable but he treats the boys as equals, with mutual respect. We want to trust him even though we know that he may be dangerous, yet it's a risk both us and the boys are willing to take.Mud is written and directed by Jeff Nichols and lives up to his 2011 masterpiece, Take Shelter. The adventures of the two boys is somewhat reminiscent of the 1986 classic, Stand By Me, and in the way we are introduced to Mud, there's a slight hint of the character of Abel Magwitch from Charles Dickens' Great Expectations. However this story takes a completely different path of it's own, creating an original story that achieves everything it sets out to achieve. All the performances are top-notch. Sam Shepard is as good as ever, Sarah Paulson as Ellis' mom is perfect, Ray McKinnon as Ellis' dad is quite frightening and even Reese Witherspoon surprises in a role that makes her hard to recognize.Mud is a rare film to find these days as it will please audiences, both young and old, while amazing critics with Nichols' ability to master more than one genre in a single film.",Mud

Mud is hiding there in hopes of fixing a broken down boat on the island so he can rescue an old friend and longtime crush Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Mud killed a man who was abusing Juniper. The man had a powerful family and bought out some of the police to watch the roadways so the only way Mud and Juniper can get away is sailing the boat down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. Mud enlists the help of Ellis and Neckbone to ge the parts necessary to fix the boat and also communicate with Juniper about the plan.Along this main plot, Ellis's parents are looking to separate with him mom wanting to live as a townie and not in a shack on the river bank. Ellis doens't want to. Ellis also develops a crush on a girl May Pearl and goes on a date with her.Things look up, only to come crashing down for Ellis as May Pearl doesn't return the growing feelings he has for her, his parents are separating, and the romantic plan for Mud to rescue Juniper meets with the reality that Juniper doesn't really want to be rescued, or perhaps realizes she doesn't really want to be rescued by Mud as there would be no happily ever after ending with him anyway.It's a bittersweet set of tales, including the tale of the father and brother of the man Mud killed looking for revenge, only for the brother getting killed in a gunfight at the end. The father, looking for revenge of the death of his son ends up getting both his sons killed.In the end, Ellis's parents separate and Ellis becomes a townie, but realizes it may not be so bad after spotting a cute girl. Mud realizes his chasing Juniper all this time will always remain a chase and finally decides to chase no longer. Juniper comes to terms with Mud no longer chasing her.This is a wonderful movie with no nice, happy ending answers. The acting is great by everyone, but especially by McConaughey, Lofland, and Sheridan. That said, there wasn't a role in the movie that I thought wasn't anything else but well acted. The movie is slow at times, but to me at least, never got boring. Again, things don't wrap up nicely and there is no happily ever after; it's more like a ""realistically ever after"". 8/10",Mud
132,CowherPowerForever,See That Ceiling Fan Up There? I Found It In The River.,9,24 August 2014,"The following review will contain spoilers.Mud is a simple story about two boys who meet a stranger while searching a small island, yet that stranger is perfectly nice to them. He may not be telling them the truth at all times but, he never thinks about hurting them. While this film is not for fans of fast paced films, those of us who love a nice slower moving story that grips us should be prepared for a fantastic film. This is my review of Mud.The film was written by Jeff Nichols who recently wrote Take Shelter(another great film). This story follows two younger teenagers(Ellis and Neckbone) who wonder onto a small island on the Arkansas River. The two younger teenagers wonder upon a boat that is stuck up in the trees. Once the two teenagers search around the boat for a little bit Ellis gets clues that someone has been living there. On there mad dash back to their boat and back home they run into Mud. The teenagers are alarmed at first but, Mud actually turns out to be a nice guy that asks the teenagers to help him get the boat working again. Since Mud doesn't want to leave the Island(for reasons we do not know early on) the boys decide they will help him. While I will not be going into deep story detail in this review, Nichols has written a fabulous film here. The story grips you at the heart of the film, and you really start to care about each character. This is really top of the line writing here, and Nichols deserves a lot of credit for writing a fabulous film.Jeff Nichols also directs this. The film is fairly simple without any big action scenes so Nichols gets our attention with the amazing landscape that he gets from Arkansas. There are so many perfect shots throughout the film that it really makes you feel like you are right there in Arkansas with Mud, Ellis, and Neckbone. The acting was fabulous. To the two younger actors Tye Sheridan(Ellis) and Jacob Lofland(Neckbone), to the secondary actors like Sam Sheppard(Tom) and Reese Witherspoon(Juniper), to the amazing lead performance by Matthew McConaughey(Mud) the acting is perfection. This really shows that with perfect casting and great direction and writing that any movie can be fantastic like this film. From his directing to his handling of these talents actors, Jeff Nichols also deserves huge credit for his directing of this film.David Wingo is the composer of this film, and while I can't say any of his previous work stands out to me, his score really adds some nice depth to the film. While you shouldn't expect anything bombastic from Wingo's score, the subtle approach he takes is amazing for this film. Wingo delivers a great score for this fantastic film, so he gets a big thumbs up from me in this department.In closing, Mud is just a great story and character driven film. If you cannot take a film like that, then look right past this film. Most of us are perfectly content with a slower paced film that delivers not only the amazing story but, some fantastic directing and acting. Not all films, or even most film, deserve nomination for film making but, Mud is a film that deserved every award that it ended up winning, no matter how small to some. Like I said, this is a fantastic film and please go out right away and watch this if you can. You will not regret it.9/10",Mud
133,williambendavis-933-218958,Sweet without being sappy or schmaltzy,8,14 December 2014,"Mud is a movie that relies heavily on good teen performances. Without that, it could have completely fallen apart, but thankfully the younger actors do a fantastic job and make this movie more than watchable. They felt real and even know I come from a completely different background, I saw bits of me in their characters. They curse, they like looking at dirty magazines, and they do really stupid stuff sometimes, exactly like real teenagers. Oh and of course Matthew McConaughey is great, that goes without saying. This movie also did a great job at being emotional without being overly sentimental and schmaltzy, which I really appreciate. I love it when a film can provoke an emotion out of the audience without resorting to annoying exploitation. It's an amazing movie and I recommend it.",Mud
134,kitellis-98121,An excellent coming-of-age drama.,8,12 August 2018,"An Amazon reviewer commented that this film has an essence of ""Stand By Me"" about it, and that was all it took to convince me to give it a try - without even reading any more of their review.They weren't wrong. Almost the first shot of the film features a boy who closely resembles River Phoenix in ""Stand By Me"", including the same haircut and similar white t-shirt. And the mood and flavour of the film continues to be similar throughout, with additional overtones of ""The Client"", ""The Cure"", and even elements of Stephen King's ""IT"" (the original, not the remake). Because, of course, this is just one in a long and distinguished line of coming-of-age dramas, mostly featuring boys aged between 11 and 14, mostly in bucolic rural settings, and mostly unsupervised, that can trace their origins back to Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer. It is a genre that is nearly always richly evocative, and speaks to a nostalgic place, particularly to be found in the male soul, that yearns for the freedom and adventure of ones' youth - either fondly remembered, or wishfully imagined.These specific stories, which are quintessentially American, have their cousins in every other culture around the world - wherever young boys live and play and explore the world around them in search of adventure and independence. As a Brit, my version of ""Huckleberry Finn"" was ""Swallows and Amazons"" which reflected my own culture's youthful adventures of a bygone age, and remains powerfully resonant and evocative to me even in middle age. I was lucky enough to actually have a childhood like that, so I can enjoy real memories as well as imagination.But I also grew up with the American mythology too, and when ""Stand By Me"" first hit the screens, it touched that special place in the centre of my soul that will forever be a 12 year-old boy. I'm particularly susceptible to such stories.Mud is one such story, and it is beautifully realised. The screenplay is honest, raw, and unflinching. It is also pleasingly male-centric, with not a single trace of post-feminist political correctness. Every featured female character is a representation of the various ways that women can hurt and abuse men, and every featured male character has been hurt or abused by a female in one way or another. Now, although this may not seem realistic or fair, it is purely because the film is entirely presented from a male perspective - which is both refreshing and deeply satisfying if, like me, you are a male who has grown up in a world where anyone who owns a penis is automatically fair game.Personally, I've had enough of watching ""empowered"" women ""heroically"" kicking men's asses in movies. And I've had enough of watching men always being the abuser. In this film, the women are all abusive in one way or another, but they are also depicted realistically and with more even-handedness than male characters would have been if their roles had been reversed. The dialogue is also intelligently written, and the two central characters - boys in their early teens - are written and depicted honestly and with great respect. There is no dumbing-down here.The cinematography is attractive and straightforward, perfectly capturing the beauty of the great outdoors without falling into any of the usual clichés. There are no smoke-filled woods with sun rays piercing through. There are no arty close-ups of barbed wire with out-of-focus red barns in the background. There are no shots of people silhouetted against the sunset. (At least, if there were, I wasn't distracted by them).Similarly, the music doesn't draw attention to itself, the editing is equally unobtrusive, and the director wisely keeps his actors from chewing-up any scenery. In short, it is good straightforward storytelling, rather than ""art"". And much as I enjoy ""art"", with a movie of this nature the story must come first.And finally, with regard to the cast, I can only say that they all did a great job. The supporting cast, most of whom bring a lot of Hollywood ""baggage"" with them, are sensibly kept in the background, with the exception of McConaughey who turns in a solid (and possibly quite smelly) performance.But the absolute stars of this film are the two boys, both of whom would be equally good in any of the coming-of-age movies that have ever been made. Their acting is natural, confident, nuanced, and filled with - my favourite word - verisimilitude. And the central performance from Tye Sheridan is nothing short of breath-taking. As I was watching, I was thinking ""this kid is going to be a huge star"". I had never heard of him before. But having since looked him up, I can see that he's already well on the way to my prediction, with an impressive body of work under his belt. I was reminded of both River Phoenix in ""Stand By Me"" and Brad Renfro in ""The Client"". And that is a little bit unsettling, based on how both of their young lives were tragically ended. So I hope that Tye Sheridan achieves the success that he so totally deserves, but without falling into the same traps.Overall, ""Mud"" is a strong addition to a favourite genre of mine. Not the best (hence not 10 stars) but a thoroughly well-made film.",Mud
135,newjersian,This movie is a fairy tale,5,15 October 2013,"This movie is highly overrated, and it is hard to understand how people give this move a score above 7. The plot is absolutely ridiculous. Mud relies on the help of two youths who are only able to bring him some peas. However, somehow he has a bottle of whiskey and cigarettes and batteries for electric lights and many other things. The boys are running back and forth on the boat till late night but nobody mentions that they are not at home. They steal a boat motor that one of the boys just drops on the sand, but later we see a huge engine that three grown ups would not lift. The men who are hired to watch the girl's hotel room around a clock somehow don't see the boy bringing her letters from Mud. That would be okay for a cheap school melodrama but this move pretends to be a serious film for adults. The whole plot is absolutely unbelievable. If the creators of that fairy tale wanted to show us a fantasy, there should've been a moral at the end. But this movie is empty from the beginning to the last scene. No moral, no reasoning, no conflict that we've not seen in hundreds of films before. The only good thing that comes to mind about that movie is the excellent performance by two young actors. Otherwise there was nothing to watch.",Mud

So I decided to give this a watch 30 min in I go and say where is Reese the suppose girl friend of Mud and finally when she makes her appearance i was all excited but nothing happens you see her for like less then 2 min and then she only shows up 4 other times for under 2 minutes 2 throughout the film i mean come on but that's not the only reason i was kinda cheesed thee other reasons is no character development stupid story and didn't you mother teach you not to talk to strangers how slow dull and boring this movie is I had to speed it yup to be able to make it through the entire film It was that slow and nothing really special happens at the climax i just didn't care whether he lives or dies I'm just so glad this film is over and I can watch a better one",Mud

138,eonbluedan-1,A new generation's 'Stand By Me',9,29 May 2013,"Jeff Nichols follows his fantastic 'Take Shelter' with an engaging, well-balanced story about boys becoming men, fathers and sons, lost innocence, faith in humanity, and the perils and virtues of love. This is all impressively explored via the conduit of a story about Mud, a potentially dangerous, enigmatic fugitive and his unlikely friendship with two adolescent boys, one of whom is determined to help him escape his pursuers and reunite him with his love, the other of whom is a wary sidekick in the venture.It is far easier to talk about what is wrong with the film, as that is a significantly shorter list; a couple of missteps and an underused Reese Witherspoon aside, 'Mud' boasts near perfect everything else. The cinematography captures a slice of Americana with such an admirable precision, you can almost taste the air; the music is intoxicating, its use well-judged.Matthew McConaughey turns in yet another fantastic performance as the stranger, confirming he has almost certainly shaken free of the shackles of the rom-com; this is an actor reborn, who we can now look forward to seeing in more fine roles, and be excited about more than a shirt coming off. He is perhaps outshone, however, by relative newcomer Tye Sheridan as Ellis; the observant might recognise him from the flawed but brave 'The Tree of Life'. Here, he owns a role that requires a maturity and an emotional capacity some would argue is beyond certain adult actors we could mention.The heart of the film is the story, which echoes most obviously Stephen King's coming of age drama 'Stand By Me', and gives off more than a hint of 'Whistle Down the Wind'. The pacing is slow, some might even say a little too slow, but rather than being tedious, it is more like a gentle, slow stroll through the fields on a hot summer's day. The idea is too intriguing, the plot too engaging, the scenes too well played and the characters too important to you to find it tiresome; you WANT to know what happens.The movie has enough layers, depth and detail to be considered quite poetic; such is the extent of this fact, you would not be surprised to find it was based on a great book. It wasn't. This is all from the mind of Jeff Nichols, who is fast becoming a film maker to watch out for; unconventional and clearly in love with the magic of cinema, this is a man who wants you to love the art as much as he does. This was on show in 'Take Shelter' and it is on show all the more with 'Mud'.While 'Fast and Furious 6' takes all the money, a near masterpiece is swept under the rug by many cinemas. It is sad. See this film.",Mud
139,nagsaptarshi,A movie without a soul,6,17 April 2020,"A movie made with a purpose transcends the barriers of time . Mud, however lacks such purpose. This is not at all a bad movie. In fact, the visuals are stunning, the acting is good and there are not too many dull moments. But throughout the movie you wait for something special to happen which actually never happens. The climax is dull, unimaginative and lacks soul. The characters, too are mechanical and fail to induce genuine emotions. Had the movie been made with the character of Reese Witherspoon not being shown, just sketched through dialogues, it would have been more poetic and subtle. In fact, it looks like the director has something else on mind and as the movie progressed, he lost his vision and messed up the whole plot. The acting is the kid in the role of Ellis is wonderful and it is his character only which has some earthly touches and strikes the right chords in both your heart and brain. The message of pure love is incomplete and never rouses any emotions barring a few moments when Mud talks about his girlfriend with the kids. This is recommended only if you do not have any other movie in stock and you have plenty of time in hand.",Mud

It throws some good actors at you but doesn´t show you how good they could be because they have nothing to say or do that makes you become interested in them. Creating a film around Matthew McConaughey means you see the same actor over an over again with his greasy long hair, similar positions how he faces the camera and of course he will get a scene to take his shirt off. Does all that matter? When I know nothing about a main character I ask myself why has this film been done. The two young actors were okay but not really mindblowing and neither were Sarah Paulson or Reese Witherspoon. It all ended with wild shooting (why?) and nothing left but the knowledge I could have wasted 2 hours of my life doing the dishes or ironing some shirts. Would have been much more useful.",Mud

Made the whole damn thing up.Myself and I, we really had a good laugh.It actually jives with the story for awhilebut I digress.Don't waste your time focusing on homemade red herrings. Pop the disc in with the expectation of a complete story told quietly well.Talk about a nomination snub.I'm surprised the Academy didn't glom onto Mud.Then again, it's an April release. Oscar doesn't check his radar until May.Even though it's only #11 on my 'Top Films of 2013' list, it still deserves the nod more than half the B.P. nominees.This film written and directed by Jeff Nichols scores on both 'ocative ots.'Provocative thoughts and evocative shots. Hah! What more do you need?If you want to talk well-deserved spotlights, Matthew McConaughey will be at the forefront of the dissertation.He's the award winning lead in Dallas Buyers Club. Turning in a magnificent performance, he cameos as a broker; a character who inspires DiCaprio's in The Wolf of Wall Street.He's cleaning up the small screen in HBO's True Detective alongside Woody Harrelson. The new series (just concluded last weekend) is pretty much an eight-hour movie, and an excellent one at that.Matt's also in The Butler, but I refuse to see that movie, or refer to it by its listed title. It's a shame, I would probably enjoy him as John F. Kennedy.What a 2013. Keep it up Mr. McC!The best way to describe Mud is delightful. It weaves a quietly cool narrative, with a heart- wrenching conflict at its center.There seems to be a trend in adventures by the Louisiana Bayou.This is a similar setting, but different, and you're racist for mistaking the two.Those of us who aren't bigots know the plot unfolds in a small riverside Mississippi town.Although Matt's credited for the lead, I'm pretty sure Ellis (played by Tye Sheridan) has more screen time. And the narrative seems to swivel primarily around his perspective.Never the mind.Both turn in excellent, astonishingly true performances. Neckbone, Ellis's best friend and cohort's (played by Jacob Lofland) about as hard and crass as they come in the realm of moral children.Hey guy, don't see this Dramystery with your bros if you're easily moved to tears. Okay?It's a touching romp full of beautiful imagery and a well-crafted simplistic story.I think this film's more suited to adults, despite the nature of the narrative. The transformations come thru both Ellis and Mud, and the juxtaposition of their romantic conflicts is excellent.My love for the film stems from admiration for the writing.This is an all-around fun story that everyone can connect with, no matter your age or gender. What's great is considering how far removed it is from the realm of personal familiarity. I'm not going to run into a boat caught in a tree anytime soon.The film may be mostly about growing up and broken love, but set in the Mississippi context, and with such devoted attention to physical detail, it might appear a waterlogged portrait of, ""two boys who learn things.""And it is; but it translates on screen in an enchanting fashion.There are minors who use swear words in this film. So if cursing gets you queasy, get over yourself, and go see the movie anyway.Ellis's blind devotion to Mud, whom he believes to be a good man (despite the protestations of everyone around him), is the catalyst allowing their ultimate redemption. That rapport, that silent understanding between two honest and good people; it's a distinct enigma, and the film captures it perfectly.It's the complete opposite of disheartening. It's heartening.What an ending, huh? I was sure it was going the other way.But I'm all too pleased with what we're given.Like I said before, Mud is definitely not a ghost.Ironically, the actor portraying the role couldn't be more alive (in this writer's heart, at least.)Really, I hope he retains this aversion to phantasm in his professional career.I'm just happy I don't have to write any more letters begging for Sahara 2.Don't miss Mud!",Mud

145,rtp4242,Mud: A mudder of a movie.,8,16 November 2013,"Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) are both 14 year olds who live on the river in a small Arkansas town. They find a nearly deserted island with a boat stuck in a tree. They find a man named Mud (Matthew McConaughey) living on the boat. He's down on his luck, and he says he's waiting for a woman named Juniper(Reese Witherspoon to come get him off the island. Ellis is taken by Mud and starts bringing him food from town. While in town, Ellis sees Juniper, and tells Mud about it. Mud asks Ellis and Neckbone to take a note to Juniper and help him fix up the boat. On a drive with his mother, Mary Lee, (Sarah Paulson) Ellis learns some things about Mud that don't necessarily jibe with Mud's heroic description of himself. Does Ellis deliver the note to Juniper? Do he and Neckbone help Mud fix up the boat, despite what Ellis now knows about him? Mud is simply a great movie. It's a movie about love, and how far people are willing to go for the love of another person. Like love, the movie is both complex and simple at the same time. It's part coming of age film, part Huck Finn riverboat adventure, and it really is worth a viewing. It tries to draw a parallel between Mud's love life and Ellis' burgeoning love life, but that is probably the weakest part of the movie. Here's what I really like about Mud, this is a movie populated with blue collar Southern people and not a stereotypical character in the bunch. These are hard-working honest people who love their families, and work hard to keep them together, and that kind of honesty is hard to find in Hollywood movies today. The ending is disappointing, and the overall length is a tad long, but that aside, this is an excellent film.The acting is superb. McConaughey reaffirmed my faith in his acting abilities, it's been a long time since he did Amistad, and A Time To Kill, this easily rivals his best work. It's an understated yet commanding performance, and it's a pleasure to see that he's still capable of such a performance. Reese Witherspoon also gives a strong performance in a comeback of sorts, it's been 8 years since her Oscar winning performance in Walk the Line. Sheridan and Lofland are very convincing as adolescents finding out about life the hard way. Sarah Paulson gives another strong performance as a conflicted mother, torn between her happiness and that of her family. Paulson was a standout in 12 Years A Slave. Sam Shepard throws in an excellent performance as Mud's confidante. The good performances abound in this film.I must mention the writing in this movie, because it maintains a good balance between love story, and suspenseful drama. He also directed this film, and wrote and directed the suspense thriller Take Shelter.Don't be a stick in the mud, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",Mud

I have to admit thought, the two kids acting were superb, very talented kids. the pace of the movie was also slow, like very slow that it needs some focus and patience to get into it. a good climax and ending. so to summarize, a brilliant performance from the actors, but a slowly paced unoriginal story that is not for everyone.",Mud

It is PG-13 because of language but that's the way people talk today(2012). It's still appropriate for adolescents.Neckbone resembles characters in 'Stand By Me' and Ellis looks like a Native-American out of a 1950's western. Sam Shepard, who portrays Tom, the father-like figure to Mud, must have been cosmetically aged for this film. No way he can look that old naturally. He was a dashing pilot, portraying Chuck Yeager in 'The Right Stuff' (1984). Of course, 28 years passed between the two films and I don't look too dashing anymore either.I don't have any critique of this film because it is so memorable. Generally, I have to watch a film twice before I can verbally do a synopsis to friends. Oh, the synopsis prepared by a reader is excellent. The only issue I have is that I don't think Juniper had an affair with the guy who hit on her in the bar. He just kissed her neck and that was enough for Ellis to tell Mud the details.

A huge non-actor role is the boat that some past hurricane deposited high into the trees. The boys help Mud restore the boat so he can make his escape. The plot line has major gaps in this restoration process that are eye-rollers. It also has irrelevant side plots that could have been cut w/o impacting the story.

So here goes: Huck Finn with a dash of Deliverance, Winters Bone, and Tree of Life. By the way, I hated Tree of Life, which WAS beautiful but entirely too experimental for my liking (I would have been fine with it as an exhibit at a modern art museum). But Mud is a film that is a pleasure to look at, and also has a fantastic story that weaves in poverty, youth, the loss of innocence, love, and violence.The life in a small town depiction is completely spot on. I am from a small town (West, Texas, which recently experienced the tragic explosion), and the people, locations, and attitudes are completely believable. Anyone who was a boy in a rural area will really connect with the story.The writing and directing is brilliant. It is the perfect blend of pacing, dialog, and action. The acting all around is top notch. Matthew McConaughey delivers an Oscar caliber performance; I liked this even more than his role in Frailty (which if you are looking for a great suspense / thriller, that is a must-watch). Supporting characters are completely effective and convincing. The actors playing the two boys deliver amazing performances; I suspect we will be seeing this young men for decades to come.I am hoping that this movie gets recognized as the outstanding piece of film that it is. It is gorgeous to watch, and the locations feel far, far away from a Hollywood studio.

157,suvopyne49,Masculine love at its best,10,7 January 2014,"Jeff Nichols' Mud is a modern day fairy tale. Keeping the essence of Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn, he wove a coming-of-age story so gratifying that it will leave a smile on your face when the credits roll. A wonderful piece of character study that we do not see very often. Set in the background of Mississippi banks and the city De Witt, Arkansas, we see two teenage boys(Ellis and Neckbone), adventurously, as boys of that age often do, set out for an island in the middle of Mississippi river; with the aim of taking ownership of a boat that one the two boys had previously found out. Upon arrival, they found that the boat, as they had hoped, is not completely unoccupied. A man, who called himself 'Mud', had taken shelter in that boat. With turn of events, the boys befriended Mud. As it would turn out later, Mud was a fugitive on the run. This is where the film treads in the water of 'love'. Here we see variants of love from the eyes of our protagonist, Ellis. His own, his parents' and Mud's. Driven by the force, Ellis decided to help Mud in his goal and went out of his way to do so. Ellis is probably one of the cleanest characters you'd come across in the cinematic world.Underneath the surface of love, there is a strong undercurrent of raw masculinity. A masculine trust that brews by the heat of the relationship between the boys and Mud. Maybe to reflect this, Nichols decided to have the women and girls in the film quite shallow in nature. There is a moment where Juniper, the woman of Mud's life, threw the question whether Mud would really do anything for love; and subsequently we see him risking his life twice; for Ellis. There lies the brilliance of the film and Jeff Nichols. Maybe, the particular colour of love that we wanted to see through Ellis' eyes wasn't there. But, there was love. In a different colour. Speaking of brilliance, the cast, especially the leads, produces standout performances in their own rights. Tye Sheridan and Matthew McConaughey were exceptional in their performances, together and separately. This especially stands out in the aforementioned scene. Sheridan, especially, was brilliant in the scene of confronting Mud, etching the multitude of emotions the character was going through. Jacob Lofland as Neckbone was a faithful sidekick like his character. The support cast, including the likes of Reese Witherspoon, Ray McKinnon and Michael Shannon did their parts well.This was a story to be shot beautifully and beautifully it was shot, thanks to Adam Stone. The river and life on its banks were beautiful. Similar effort was found from David Wingo in the background score department. All in all, this is a film that is ought to be seen. For the sake of masculine love it portrays. P.S. Anti-venom can be taken more than one time without it being fatal. Just saying.",Mud
158,TimMeade,Worthy of a Major Release,9,9 July 2013,"Trails for Jeff Nichols' Mud showed two boys coming across a stranger, most likely a fugitive, in an isolated riverside environment. The man's shoe heel imprints leave a trail of crosses. This left me with an uneasy feeling that the film was going to be an unacknowledged re-make of Bryan Forbes' classic 1961 movie Whistle Down the Wind in which a group of naïve young children happen across a wanted murderer (Alan Bates) in an isolated barn and mistake him for Jesus Christ.My fears were unfounded. The character, who gives his name simply as Mud, was indeed a fugitive, hiding out on a small island on the Mississippi having killed a man who had impregnated his girlfriend, then assaulted her causing the loss of the unborn child. Both the family of the dead man and bounty hunters are hunting him down intent on bringing him to arbitrary justice.Mud realises that his only option of escape is by renovating a dilapidated boat on the island on which he is holed up. He seeks help from the two boys, Ellis and Neckbone, who discover him as they explore the island in their Tom Sawyer-style existence. The boys agree to supply the tools and materials Mud requires. Ellis also acts as a go-between for Mud and his girlfriend Juniper staying, under surveillance, in a local, seedy motel.This is a marvellous, character-driven drama in which the acting is of the highest order. Matthew McConaughey, as the hunted fugitive has surely never been better. There is clearly an in-joke when his character tells the boys there are just two things he can't be without: his pistol and his shirt - McConaughey having seemingly spent most of his film career displaying a naked torso.Jeff Nichols also coaxes fine performances from the young teenage boys. Jacob Lofland is good as Neckbone. But Tye Sheridan as Ellis is given the meatier role and is quite simply superb as a confused and frightened boy who is experiencing his idyllic river lifestyle coming to an end: his parents are divorcing, their riverboat home is to be demolished and he is to move to the local town with his mother. If this isn't enough, he experiences the pain and pitfalls of first love with an older girl as he aids a wanted criminal. Your heart aches for this lad.Reece Witherspoon is convincing as Mud's 'trailer-trash' girlfriend and there is a great cameo from Sam Shepard, now remarkably in his 70th year, as the loner no one knows but who local legend believes has a murky and violent past. It is no criticism when I refer to the film as a slow-burner. The film is set in a community where the locals are naturally taciturn and where formal authority is a distant and untrusted interloper. They do things slowly there.Jeff Nichols makes the slow-moving and listless Mississippi River the very core of his drama, its languorousness clearly imprinting itself on to the people who are dominated by, and inconsequential to, its scale.Amazingly, distribution for this film has been poor. It received only a limited release in the US, and here in Australia it currently shows on only two screens: one each in Melbourne and Sydney. This is incredible. A top-notch cast with a strong story confined to the artiest of art-house obscurity. I hope that the film's merits will be recognised and it goes on to have a full release. Failing this, I suspect that in years to come, people will come across the film by accident and wonder how they ever missed it when it first came out.",Mud

160,pinkled5,Standard film festival drab,4,14 May 2013,THE GOOD: Great performances by all involved. The acting is top notch and Matthew Mconawhatever brilliantly portrays his character.THE BAD: This movie tried to build a film around one interesting character but it doesn't overcome all its other flaws. The plot is about as slow moving as a tranquilized sloth. Nothing really happens or advances the storyline much. We spend 2 hours watching these kids bring parts to Mud. The finale is the only interesting part of the plot but not worth a 2 hour wait. Mud was an interesting character but none of the other characters are developed much.CONCLUSION: Standard film festival drab that may appeal to the artsy fartsy crowd but leaves mainstream movie-goers wishing for more.,Mud

163,Nothinggrandproductions,A film of elegance and tranquility,9,30 October 2013,"Elegance. I feel that is the best word to describe Mud, Jeff Nichols' follow-up to his fantastic 2011 film, Take Shelter. Two teenager boys, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lorfland) travel up to a small island in the Mississippi River where a boat is stuck high up in a tree and they intend to keep it until they meet Mud (Matthew McConaughey), a mysterious man with a back story that is slowly developed throughout the film. A detail revealed early on is that he is wanted criminal, he murdered a man who was beating his girlfriend, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). He is stuck on the island and wants the help of the two boys to eventually reunite with Juniper. On top of that, both of the boys have sets of their own problems, more notably Ellis with his parents constantly arguing and troubles with girls. The movie is absolutely beautiful in regards to cinematography. So many shots are visual treats of nature, whether it be the water, the sun, etc. The movie is just beautiful. Especially notable is the very last shot of the film that ends the movie on a perfect note of tranquility. It is very much a simple story, but it works so well that it's simplicity only makes it a better film. Furthermore, it tells simple morals and lessons, and the characters are not overly complex but it's just so well-made that it works so fluently. If anything, it is definitely inspired by Mark Twain's novels especially with it's southern setting and young characters. The acting by the entire cast is fantastic, especially McConaughey and Sheridan, McConaughey gives a calm performance that only explodes when needed, Sheridan plays a wonderfully confused teenagers trying to figure things out for himself. In addition, the climax of this film was absolutely incredible and played out in a way that I wasn't expecting but was fantastic. Overall, Jeff Nichols has made another great film, one that will be remembered by the end of the year for me as one of the most notable films of the year, it's beautiful, simple, and just works on every level, an absolute treat.",Mud
164,johnnymurphy15,A solid and satisfying coming of age film.,8,14 August 2014,"The main theme in Jeff Nichol's latest is the adolescent idealism of youth vs the run down world of adulthood. Ellis (Tye Sheridan), a 14 year old boy is living in a world where the adult members of the community are unhappy, having failed relationships or stuck in a loveless marriage like his parents. His best friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) shares his idealism and sense of adventure, so when Ellis is told by Neckbone that he found a boat stuck in a tree most likely caused by a flood, they both go to investigate and to claim the boat as their own. They head across the Missisipi river to an island where they find the boat, but also find fresh food and footprints. Eventually, they find Mud (Matthew McConaughey). He turns out to be an armed fugitive waiting to meet up with his long term girlfriend, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) so they can escape together. Ellis and Neckbone assist him with this task by bringing him food, delivering notes and gathering supplies and boat parts. Inevitably, they encounter danger as bounty hunters are after Mud, seeking revenge for Muds murder of their relative. Mud tells Ellis and Neckbone that it was a crime of passion after this man beat up Juniper savagely. All these situations come to a climax in a satisfyingly slow pace.One of the many strengths of this film lies in the interesting characters that we care about. Mud is a criminal, but the audience get the impression that he is a nice man who is a victim of love like all the other adults in the film. Ellis sees in Mud a quest for true love, something which Ellis believes in at a time when his parents are going through a divorce. As the story progresses, Ellis finds out the hard way the harsh realities of love. The characters are well anchored by strong performances. Matthew McConaughey has recently broken out of the the romcom love interest mould and started playing more credible characters. This is the best performance I have seen him in and he plays a character with a shady past, but who the audience can sympathise with. He is a man who has had many bad things happen to him, and much of that is shown in his face. Tye Sheridan is a rising star. He experiences his own journey through assisting Mud, through his parents splitting up and selling up their river boat they live in and through his own relationship with a girl. He refuses to believe the negative views of his adult peers, especially his father who claims that you can never rely on a woman to love you.Another strength lies in the films setting. It is set in a river community in Arkansas. It seems lovingly Directed by Arkansas born Jeff Nichols. He gives the audience a child's perspective, a place where a child can have endless adventure. You never see a child sitting around watching TV, they like to take the boat out and look for things and use their imagination. I was reminded of films like 'Stand By Me' and 'Badlands' and Mark Twain creations such as Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. The story was very well told and maybe a bit too polished and nicely wrapped up. It gets away with it as it seems so unselfconscious and it does not concern itself too much with integrity. What we get is a nicely told story which gets its point across. The mythical element of Mud helps get that point across. He is a superstitious man who appears and disappears out of situations. It is from a child's perspective after all. I have not seen the previous films of Jeff Nichols, but something tells me he is becoming a Director of great importance.Check out my film review blog - www.projectionistreview.wordpress.com",Mud
165,vampiri,Great American trend kill,9,20 November 2013,"Swashbuckling Hollywood once again delivers Grade A drama.Say what you will about American Cinema, but twice during a short period of time they have given us Prisoners and , now, Mud, which both are fantastic dramas and doing so they show that Hollywood is not only about bombastic comic heroes and what not.Plot: two Young teenagers discover the harsh truth about people, Life and what adulthood might give. The two of them stumble upon a stranger on a small Island in some sort of backwater river area. They befriend him but in doing so they get entangled in his past.Although not a horror Movie, watching Mud made me Think about Stand by me and It which both are great Movies about the friendship among a Group of kids. The friendship between Ellis and Neckbone is Beautiful to Watch and the two Young actors may have great careers ahead of them although far from every Young actor continues to deliver in adulthood. The father, portrayed by Ray McKinnon, is so underrated, his performance is excellent. Likewise is that of Michael Shannon, whom I did not favor some years ago, but now, through Boardwalk Empire and Man of Steel, I see him as a multilayerd and talented actor with the ability, too, to have more serious parts. The most surprising casting, and a positive one at that, was the casting of Paul Sparks as the crook. In Boardwalk Empire he portrays the weird Mickey Doyle, and WOW his very different part here blew me away, by this I do not mean that his small part in Mud is Oscar material, but just positively surprising.Multilayerd is also the different subplots, which also are the Movie's strength. There's the friendship between the kids, the kids and the stranger, Ellis' somewhat troubled family situation, the stranger's dysfunctional relationship with his girl and his dilemma which has sprung from that relationship.One of the downsides, and perhaps the only one Worth mentioning, is that it is somewhat predictable, even down to the details. But that is outright disposable because this is a great drama.If you liked Winter's Bone you will enjoy this Movie, Mud is just as fascinating and interesting, however not quite as dark.I give it 9 out of 10 due to its thick plot, excellent casting, the creators' ability to excite and care for the characters. This is truly a must see-movie!! The Movie is very Deep and is perfect as a study Project, and it made me reminiscing my own childhood.",Mud

Matthew McConaughey has a great presence, being both an idol, a hope and a danger for these kids. The movie takes its time, slowly developing into a small story whose presentation will delight you, make you smile and make you feel.

168,richcarter1962,A Complex Movie with a Simple Theme,8,26 July 2013,"I just watched this last night it is very good movie. I'll first give you my impressions. For the first half of the movie Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn came to mind, much of that was the setting itself, the filming was excellent, I could smell the damp smell of the river just by watching. If your to young to have read Mark Twain then perhaps Stand by Me might be a more recent movie had the same feel to it. The middle of the movie reminded me of Summer of 42', this is definitely a coming of age story. By the last quarter of the movie it turns into a fast paced shoot'em up movie.For my money this was the best acting that Mathew McConneghy has done since his breakout roll in A Time to Kill. For much of the movie I wasn't sure where they were taking this character, eventually he gets to where you think he might end up, but it's an interesting route that he takes to get there. The 2 young stars were the real story here. It's the story of 2 14 year olds coming to grips with divorce, the loss of parents, the bond of true friendship and, of course, young love.All in all this is a character driven movie, the story is an old one and nothing much was new here, that's OK though. The acting was excellent and by the end you care about all the characters even with their flaws. If your like me you will come to care about these characters deeply by the end of the movie.",Mud

172,generationfilm,Director Jeff Nichols' Third Film is an Embodiment of the Classic Americana Spirit Delivered Through Heartfelt Storytelling and Pristine Cinematic Technicality,9,28 April 2013,"Engaging an audience in a truly captivating sense of wonder is a lost art form in the realm of cinema, or at least it has become so rare that we begin to forget how magical the silver screen experience can be. One of those rare filmmakers is writer and director Jeff Nichols who made great strides in inventive filmmaking with his second feature Take Shelter, a deeply unsettling and atmospheric thriller that reminded us that the potential for original storytelling can have equally creative follow through. Writer/director Jeff Nichols' latest atmospheric drama Mud continues his notable prestige for dramatic filmmaking by creating a pure slice of Americana; an evocative and poignant coming of age tale that borrows the lyricism of Tennessee Williams works and mixes them with the harmonious sensitivity of a Sam Shepard play, who is ironically enough in a supporting role in the film, creating a witty and insightful modern day Mark Twain influenced adventure. Keeping his respectful gaze on rural America, Nichols creates an intimate reflection on friendship, unrequited love, and youthful discovery with a rhythmic, sensitive approach towards life's realizations during childhood. Mud is one of those films where all of the creative outlets from the ethereal cinematography to the haunting cinematic score come together in perfect unison to highlight the depth within the story being told. The film unveils its inner soul with a purposefully meditative pace that might deter some from experiencing a thoughtful approach but that would be a drastic mistake because it's one of the more authentically creative and emotionally opulent movies to grace the theaters in a long while. In Mud we're not only witnessing the artistic stamp of a director who has found his distinct voice but also the final stages of resurrection in the acting career of Matthew McConaughey who has never been more focused or impassioned on the screen. While Mud might not be as finely woven as his sophomore effort Take Shelter there is no denying his latest drama's penchant for compelling drama enhanced by the heartfelt nature of the writing, the clarity in the visuals, and the honesty in all of the acting performances.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-xV; More reviews: Generationfilm.net",Mud

Unfortunately for McConaughey this has put me off from looking forward to anything else by him in the future.His performance was awful, the kids were annoying and certainly do nothing to convince the audience their actions are real/believable.I seriously do not understand how the heck this film is 2 hours long? It is so mind numbingly boring that to commit suicide from watching it would be totally acceptable.It's rubbish like this, which is damaging the movie industry. I am getting so sick of crap movies that I am getting more joy/entertainment from watching documentaries/TV shows.A lot of backhanders and under-the-table payments to critics and companies alike must have taken place. Due to the amount of positive reviews it has received by so many respected sources.Which totally shows that critics are worthless unless they are real people with views not driven by wealth.Though we all know its the dumb and impressionable that fall for these false reviews and thus think they should like this movie after they have watched it.So if you like this film ask yourself why? Analys your life activities/conversations then see if you are interesting? After... please stop watching/supporting bad movies and just maybe the world will stop producing rubbish and we can all dream of a future when people only need to take a single pill once, to become intelligent enough to recognise a good movie. ;) To top it off some french dude on here called it ""A Masterpiece"" that is so hilarious I nearly died from laughter.

The acting was outstanding from the entire cast. So good that Matthew's fine work was overshadowed by other performances especially of young Tye. The director evidently wanted the actors to understate their performances and it worked well.The movie captures you quickly as the actors and dialogue feel real and overall production is outstanding. It has little action and a simple plot but will keep you absorbed throughout. The ending was good but fell short of making this a great movie. It also seemed to wrap up too quickly, maybe as it was moving past two hours.By the way, this is the second movie I've watched by Nichols(Take Shelter)and he could probably make paint drying worth watching.",Mud

This is coming-of-age drama with some of crime elements. The main characters are kids and their performance was very good and convincing. The title ""Mud"" is not only the name of a fugitive, acted by Matthew McConaughey whose acting skills are great as always but also it may refer as harsh life of their families and the small island on Mississippi river where was the plot about in this movie. The atmosphere of the location is filmed very well and certainly this movie has high artistic values but main problem is a leak of plot. Characters are very good depicted but the plot could've been much better. The second half of the movie was a flat out and the end was predictable. A woman character played by Reese Witherspoon is spared and even pointless in some moments. She said just about ten sentences in whole movie or less. Shooting scenes at the end were unrealistic and even funny for this kind of a movie...

177,tomassparups,Beautiful and heartfelt,8,24 July 2013,"Jeff Nichols has proved to be one of the most promising new directors. His 2011 film ""Take Shelter"" was a powerful, thrilling despite being slow moving drama. His newest film ""Mud"" tells the story of two boys named Ellis and Neckbone, played by Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland who live in Arkansas on the Mississipi riverbank. They spend their days exploring the river on their motorboat, until Neckbone tells Ellist about a strange discovery he found on an island in the river. He takes Ellis to the island to show him what he found. The discovery is a small motorboat lodged in a tree. The boys claim the boat as theirs, but soon find out that someone happens to be living in it. In shock, they decide it's time for them to leave. Upon running out to their boat, they notice a strange man standing on the shore of the island, fishing. This is Mud, a fugitive on the run from the police, played by Matthew McConaughey. He claims that the boat was found by him in the first place and that he intends to leave Akransas with his estranged girlfriend, Juniper, played by Reese Witherspoon. Mud is being tracked by the police and desperately needs to get the boat out of the tree. He also needs a new motor and various other parts to get the boat in working order. The boys and Mud arrange a deal, if they track down the parts for the boat, Mud will reward them with his 45. caliber pistol. As they begin to help Mud, they are in grave danger as Mud's troubled past is catching up to him.""Mud"" is a fresh new twist on a coming of age story. It provides us with a heartfelt tale of friendship, without buying into sappy cliché's. This is a film that takes some time to develop it's story and the characters, but doing so it does enrich the entire viewing experience. The actors do an extraordinary job at portraying their character's, I am convinced that Tye Sheridan has an unlimited amount of potential to be an amazing actor. Nevertheless, the film is helmed by Matthew McConaughey who in the past two years has redeemed himself as a serious actor rather than a typecast for cheesy chick flick's. With his last two films, Nichols has shown that he is an impressive visual director. In the case of ""Mud"", he beautifully captured the dense Mississipi terrain as well as the vast wetlands. He also creates great supporting characters that fit in alongside our main protagonists and add a much needed sense of genuineness. All the characters are fascinating and add their own charm to the story, even if they have little screen time. These are all great actor's that are excellently play their roles which are crafted for them with the notion of keeping realism in mind. My only gripe with the film is how the third act was played out. Instead of coming to a peaceful conclusion, the film became overly melodramatic and went in guns blazing. Other than that, I have to admit that I loved this film.Reminiscent of such coming of age tale's as ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and ""Stand By Me"", ""Mud"" is one of the best films of the year so far. The acting, story and visuals provides for a well rounded and quite frankly, fantastic cinematic experience. McConaughey has proved that he is a great actor and Tye Sheridan showcases his talent in this film as well. ""Mud"" is a genuinely heartfelt story of friendship and a story of how children become mixed up in the lives of adults. A must watch!",Mud
178,ryansassy1,"Nicely shot and acted, but falters..",6,26 May 2013,"While I didn't think Mud deserved its hyper-inflated RT score (at this time) of 99%, I enjoyed this thoughtful film about friendship among some riverboat kids and a lovelorn refugee hiding out on an island in the middle of the big river.Two junior high school kids named Ellis and Neckbone decide to sneak out on an adventure of their own one morning to visit a deserted island in the middle of the river. They want to find a marooned old motorboat that got stuck up in a tree during the last big flood, and make it their own secret hideout. They discover, however, that somebody got there before them....Mud, who is on the run from the law after he killed the man who beat his girlfriend. Mud wins their trust with his sad story, and soon, the unlikely trio are plotting together to get the motorboat fixed so Mud can use it to make his escape. But as Ellis investigates around town, he realizes that he may be in too deep as danger unfolds from the other men who are looking for Mud...not to turn him in to the law, but to execute him in vengeance.Matthew M is at his best in a role like this, playing an eccentric character with a certain low-down charm. The two boys playing Ellis and Neckbone were perfect; I think they're relative newcomers to movies, in which case it's all the more impressive that they could hold their own against the charismatic Mr. M. As for the rest of the cast: completely believable, displaying some great, understated acting skills.The primary strength of Mud, however, was its cinematography. The wide expanses of riverscape set the lonely mood for the story, which, after all, is about finding human connections and holding onto love. It almost serves as a metaphor, but let's not get too introspective about this...it's just well-shot, and doesn't have to mean anything more.The pacing of Mud was its main drawback, and by that I mean, it had all the elements of a compelling, well-acted script, but it simply dragged. Some judicious editing was in order to tighten up and sort out this film, which could have been great but settled for merely good.I was also put off a bit by the weakness of the message(s): were we supposed to sympathize with everybody, or root for Mud, or his girlfriend, or Ellis? There were plenty of philosophical dilemmas barely touched on, but the film seemed to lack conviction to make any strong statements overall. There was a big climactic action scene toward the end, which resolved nothing really...the final conclusion was also unsatisfying; you get the impression that some sort of deep lesson was learned by Ellis, but exactly what that was remains unclear. The whole story had a vague, meandering quality which undercut all the strengths of acting and cinematography.So I would hesitantly recommend Mud, but without raising any expectations. There are certainly worse ways to pass 2 hours and 10 minutes.",Mud

The characters are so realistic and I found myself really rooting for Ellis and Mud. The boys who played Ellis and Neckbone did an excellent job!!! Well, so did Mathew M. but the boys' accents were very believable. I was getting a really nervous feeling at the end...I had a feeling he was still alive, but you never know, so I'm really glad that Mud survived.

All of the characters were flawed. I was familiar with the attitudes and the logic of the characters because I know people with similar dispositions. I could identify with all of the characters, but I would not want any of them as my friends. You know from the start that the main character is a murderer, yet you somehow want to believe that what he did was justified. The acting and the cinematography was stellar. This is old style story telling; a slow build up to a climax and resolution; not jumping from one climax to the next.

The way Sam saved his son Mud in the end with the staged death in the muddy waters was a paradox given their earlier confrontation in the light of day.What also seemed a paradox to me was Mud's clean white shirt contrasting his muddy surroundings?? It was the same paradox I felt when viewing that 1968 classic film ""The River Boy"" by Noel Black which won the Venice International Film Festival.""The River Boy"" also was a paradox in his white mail ordered suit that did not fit. The suit did not fit, nor did his parents or the girl of his dreamsTimes have not changed since 1968 in regards to children growing up to re capitulate deficiencies they experienced as children in their adult lives.There is nothing new about the repetition compulsion of children turned adolescents who are compelled to seek dry rivered relationships ( the boat caught up on the branches of a tree played by Reese Witherspoon) and expecting to get water.This time I know this mate will be the mother or father I never had or the mother or father who never saw or heard me.And yes this time Mud's father did see and hear him and it was in the mud!We need more of these muddy knights who wear white shirts and ill fitting clothes without armor to both generate and protect life.",Mud
182,TruthSpeaks,Wow,8,3 May 2013,"This is a movie that stays with you. It's a real movie about people, and a place--not car chases and explosions. I don't agree with the mixed reviews and complaints about the length of the movie. Matthew McConnahey is well-cast. All of the actors do a good work; Reese Witherspoon, Sam Sheppard. Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland do a great job playing the child characters. The Mississippi river is like a character in the movie, which evokes Huckleberry Finn, as others have noted. The settings are magnificent. In a sea of manufactured movies, it's nice to see something that was crafted by human beings. I would recommend this movie to those who are interested.The audience in the theater I was in seemed absorbed.",Mud

184,GrowMagicBeans,"A curious cocktail of intrigue, sentimentality and violence.",9,29 May 2013,"This movie seemed to hit a cord with me. It's a curious tale that boasts a tough skin, but really hides a sensitive underbelly.The central story revolves around the relationship between a fourteen year old boy named Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and the charismatic but ambivalent character of Mud (Matthew McConaughey). By exposing us near exclusively through Ellis' point of view, we get to experience river-life though the innocence and understandings of a young teenage boy, becoming man; and so the movie ultimately is a 'coming-of-age' story. The plot progresses as the mysteries behind Mud's hermit style exile to a small river island unravels. As Ellis comes in contact with those Mud has touched upon both positively and negatively, we get a glimpse into a colourful, eventful and sometimes shameful life. At times Mud is presented to us as nothing more than a common criminal, smarmy and manipulative; at times he seems to exude genuine comradeship and friendship; at times he seems hopelessly romantic and superstitious.Mud is in hiding, but wants to get in contact with a childhood sweetheart and enlists the help of Ellis and his friend. Ellis has a tough skin but a soft heart and is probably a little naive in his romantic view of the world. With Ellis' own world falling apart --his mother and father's marriage on the rocks and the threat of their river-boat way of life being taken away-- he comes to invest himself emotionally in Mud's predicament.For Ellis, love is still something pure, honest and uncompromising. But Ellis must find a way to reconcile his romantic notions of the world with the realities of cause and effect least he should end up isolating his heart to an island of its own making. Indeed, in many ways the challenges Ellis is now facing, mirrors what Mud has experienced in the past, and thus we come to realise that fundamentally the only difference between youth and age, is that perhaps consequences begin to get in the way.Behind Mud's uncompromising love is a rugged and course world where nothing is ever left forgotten, where actions have consequences and bitterness breeds bitterness. Though the movie dances around the firelight of unrequited dreams, this is a violent tale in its foremost and we as the audience know that a turbulent climax is inevitably approaching. Murder, beatings, obsession mar the background of Mud's life and so the foreboding question becomes whether Mud will ultimately prove a net positive or destructive influence upon a susceptible boy's life.Much in the vein of movies like 'Stand by Me' or 'A Bronx Tale', the movie Mud mixes a curious cocktail of intrigue, sentimentality and violence.It was refreshing to find an independent movie that stirred clear of pretentious narrative fragmentation and yet, on the other hand, stayed relatively clean from Hollywood cliché. In other words, this is a good old fashioned yarn, told well. It has to be said, I'm actually growing respect for Matthew McConaughey as an actor. Between this and 'Killer Joe' he is proving to have a much greater dynamic than the cheesy, greasy, two-dimensional, pin-up, chick-flick, characters he normally portrays. Actually, a point of note has to be given to all the leads. Tye Sheridan portrays Ellis as the compassionate lead we can all associate a past youth with, while Jacob Lofland as Neckbone completes the friendship duo as the always suspicious, always coy, always bartering, yet always loyal friend of Ellis. Not to mention Reese Witherspoon; for such short on screen time, she seems to haunt our thoughts as the trashy yet somehow celestial love obsession.I think Mud may well be my favourite movie of 2013!

185,meagherthomas,The film is about Adults - Not kids,8,28 May 2013,"There are themes some reviewers are missing.The film explores the behavior of adults. The adults in the film, portrayed as competent with responsibilities, are to varying degrees - manipulators - and they work to sooth or pull emotions.The character Mud, who is not responsible and is illogical, tells the truth and is emotionally clear - which means he's often accused of being a liar by the competent. The boys have the same truth streak when it comes to family and friends.At one point the boys have some bad news for Mud. The boy nicknamed ""Neck"" asks the character Ellis, the film's lead ""What you gonna tell him?"" to which Ellis replies, ""The truth"". And Ellis does, plank by plank. Women: What may limit this film's box-office is how it portrays women. Very nuanced and not particularly friendly. The film explores how the Mom, the high-school coed, and the Tramp are all willing contestants in the mud wrestle of emotional manipulations. Here, poverty is used as a cleanser. It strips away the trinkets that might interfere with insight. What is interesting is these female leads are not cast as evil or warped - they're portrayed as normal with episodes of common sense. So the film works to shed an inherent base-presumption of the softer-sex - and shows women characters just as destructive to the threads of truth/love as ham-handed males. See and enjoy a film well worth some time and thought.",Mud
186,ryklinker,"Two boys in Arkansas meet a strange man, and they soon find the parallels between them and the man known only as ""Mud"".",7,19 December 2014,"They've never quite had a role model to look up to. Ellis' father lacks the luck to keep his life stable, and the ability to comprehend it. With no parents in the picture, Neckbone lives with his bachelor uncle who beds a new woman every night, but doesn't have the respect for women that is needed to carry on a successful relationship. As a result, these two preteen boys are left to ride around town on a bike Neckbone made himself and explore the lake that Ellis lives on. On one particular day, the two boys find a boat that is stuck in a tree as a result of a flood. On further investigation, they see that someone is living in it, and they find this person not long after. He's tall, skinny, and dirtier than the ground he walks on. He grew up in the same town as Ellis and Neck, but that was a long time ago. Seeing the youthful motivation in their eyes, the man strikes a deal; if the boys bring him food, he'll give them his boat once he cuts it out of the tree. Without much thinking, Ellis shakes the man's worn and tattooed hand. With only the title ""Mud"" to know the man by, the two boys leave him and continue on their lives, and they take their little motorboat over to see Mud. As they spend more time with the homeless man, Ellis and Neck learn more about him, and they realize that his past parallels their future. Both Ellis and Mud love women that can't love them back, and they find that they're both set on a path together full of emotions.Though not necessarily commercially successful, Mud was a big hit among film festival crowds, and it gave America its first glimpse of the acting chops that Matthew McConaughey had if he doesn't take his shirt off in every scene he's in. This 2012 film showed directors that he had the abilities necessary for a serious role, and he was cast as Ron Woodruff in Dallas Buyers Club; a role for which he was awarded the Best Actor title during the 2014 Academy Awards. Contrary to his previous persona of a sultry Texan with a set of killer abs, McConaughey is a down on his luck, emotionally-captivating character in this film, and he set himself on a path of award-winning potential. In support of McConaughey are two child actors (Tyre Sheridan and Jacob Lofland), Reese Witherspoon, and Sam Shepard. Both of the preteen actors are quite good at playing their characters' range of emotions, definitely capturing the Southern atmosphere with success. Witherspoon does a great job as the battered Juniper, Mud's lost girlfriend, and Sam Shepard plays his character role very well. Aside from the acting, the other aspects are well-suited for the film. The cinematography captures the Southern landscape very well, and the score works with the on-screen action successfully. In terms of storyline and themes, I thought that this film was very rich with symbolism. For example, Mud's shirt, water snakes, and nightingales are recurring symbols for the struggles faced by the characters. Overall, I found this film to be quite good. My original motivation to watch this movie came after reading that this performance by McConaughey is what helped him land his roles in Dallas Buyers Club and Interstellar. Both my parents and I agree that it carries somewhat of the same feeling as a Stand by Me-type film. Also, I have read in other places that people liken it to a story that Mark Twain might tell, and I share this thought. Although this film is centered around two preteen boys, it is a film for the grownups. Frequent uses of cuss words (s****, d**n, etc.) and suggestive ideas take this movie to a PG-13 rating. Even if your family is tolerant of such things, I don't think that a younger person could quite understand the themes and characters that exist in this story.The pace of this film is quite slow until the last 10 minutes, which means that you sit through 2 hours of the film without much liveliness. However, I definitely recommend this film to anyone who doesn't mind a sort of independent film, and likes films that take place the South.www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",Mud
187,lauramarie-06949,Not super engaging,7,21 November 2020,"Not the most engaging movie. It sort of felt like the plot line dragged on. I also would have liked to see more of Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Paulson, as those are two very talented actors who got very little screen time.",Mud
188,robertrutledge,"Good Story, Mediocre Execution",6,4 January 2021,"Mud is a coming-of-age movie among the lines of Stand By Me. The film, which takes place on the shores of the Mississippi River in Arkansas, revolves around the growing pains of adolescent Ellis (Tye Sheridan), whose parents are going through a rough divorce. One day, Ellis and his friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) go on an adventure in their small boat to an island in the Mississipi, where they find an old, considerably bigger boat suspended by trees in the middle of a heavily wooded area. At first, the boat appears to be theirs for the taking, but they soon realize that it is inhabited by a rugged-looking homeless man who goes by the name of Mud (Matthew McConaughey), who they later discover to be a fugitive. The boys befriend Mud and help him in his attempts to repair both his relationship with his ex-girlfriend Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) as well as the suspended boat where he resides, so that he can make his escape with her.I wasn't a huge fan of this movie. It is a great story, but it moves much too slow for me and could have been executed better. There are a lot of characters, which makes it difficult to follow along at times. Many of the characters are extremely flat (most notably Witherspoon's Juniper) and could have been explored much deeper. The only character in this movie (besides Mud himself) who has an even relatively interesting backstory is the old man who lives across the river from Ellis (Tom, played by the late Sam Shepard). The acting isn't terrible, but at times I felt like this was a movie I could have made with my little brother when we were younger, due to the less-experienced child actors (who the movie revolves around).Cinematographically-speaking, this movie is interesting, but maybe not very memorable. I like the use of ""muddy"" colors (see what I did there?) to create a rustic-feeling setting. The underwater shots are artistic, while perhaps unnecessary, and provide a nice change in scenery. The panning shots of the boat suspended by trees are not as enticing as perhaps the director wanted. Some of the transitions between scenes are awkward (too many ""quick-shots""), and many of the scenes are too short to be substantial. There are also times where a character has a monologue and then just stops speaking for several seconds while the camera keeps on rolling. I understand this is done for dramatic effect, or to let the words sink in, but it makes the movie drag.Overall, Mud is not my kind of movie, not to say it is a bad movie per se. Perhaps having grown up in suburban Ohio, I cannot relate to the countless scenes in this movie where someone gets punched in the face. There's also a lot of cliché scenes that are almost laughable: the ""high school party with red cups"" scene, the ""hazy bar with pool tables and bikers"" scene, etc. I (and I imagine most men) can relate to some of the tougher situations in this movie that Ellis has to go through, especially dealing with heartbreak, but the movie doesn't even touch on his school life outside of the scenes depicting his romantic pursuit. I certainly come from a different world than him, I will admit that much. Witherspoon's depiction as the romantic interest of McConaughey's character is dull and, as much as I hate to say it, probably could have been played by anyone. The action scenes are the most exciting parts of this movie, although they are few and far between. McConaughey's performance is spot on, but nothing Academy Award worthy.
I honestly would not want to watch this movie again if asked to, although it is a good coming-of-age tale about learning what love is and what it isn't; an important and resonant theme.",Mud

Ellis is an innocent teen who has his own optimistic ideas about 'love' until he finds it fading between his parents. It's the reason why he wants to help Mud to get back together with his. In a way, Mud is a reflection of Ellis. They both feel dedicated to the person they are attracted to. And with this adventurous journey, they both shape each other's ideas without knowing so.This film is an atmospheric and memorable tale about influencing ideas about love on a child, and interesting dynamics between fathers and sons.

It smacks of sterling nepotism or a casting agent deep in the grip of alcoholism. And what can one say about the plot and character development? Nothing good. Was this a was among the genders?

So does the hype for 'Mud' live up to expectations. The short answer is yes! 'Mud' is easily one of the finest films released so far this year. The story is simple, the characters are well developed and thought out. All the actors in this film really shine. The one thing I really enjoyed about 'Mud' is how it seems like this could easily happen in my everyday life. The plot is quite simple yet focuses on being a coming of age, thriller, fugitive film. It could be best described as Stand by Me meets A History of Violence. The film is really well made and shot, my hat goes off to the director. Mud only has one fault in my opinion and that is the ending. It seemed rushed, and went all Hollywood. It also loses it's believability it holds up so well during the rest of the film. This is unfortunate because the film has a fairly long run time anyways. Some may be turned off by 'Mud' because of it's slower pacing. It always kills me to say that with today's audience. However I think that 'Mud' will be able to charm and tell audiences a great story. This is defiantly one to see, also a huge thumbs up for Matthew's performance of Mud. Some of if not his best work to date. Rating: 9/10",Mud

195,nonprofitgnome1,Great Movie In the Vein of Stand By Me,8,8 August 2013,"Mud was a movie I had seen a trailer for months back and thought it looked enjoyable but it quickly vanished off my radar. It later popped up on my Amazon suggestions and I bought it on a whim. I had pretty much no recollection of what the movie was about I just knew it looked interesting. I don't know if this lack of knowledge made the movie more enjoyable but the one thing I do know is that the movie was great.I hear a major complaint is that the movie was too long. Yes this movie was over two hours but I never once caught myself checking the clock. I felt engaged the whole time and the movie seemed to fly by. I can see how this movie may drag for some people as it's not a typical action fest shoot'em up movie. But for those who enjoy quieter movies than that should find the pacing to be excellent.The casting in this movie was pretty good as well. I absolutely loved Mcconaughey in the role of Mud. He felt believable as a guy on the run living off the land. He also had a feeling of mystery while at the same time not feeling threatening. That's what made it believable that he could have committed a crime but still be a nice enough guy with the kids. Speaking of the kids, I think the two actors did the job fine. It's tough casting kids as often times they come off as annoying and don't feel genuine. These two immediately got on my nerves but after fifteen minutes, I had warmed up to them.I think Mud felt a lot like the excellent movie Stand By Me. We got to witness very adult things through the eyes of kids. We got to see how they would act in unusual situations. We got to see their naive sensibilities as they dealt with someone who they believed to be a killer. The movie was just a fun ride from start to finish that told a great story.",Mud

The performances by both veteran actors Matthew McConaughey and Sam Shepard, as well as newcomers Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland were flawless. Michael Shannon and Reese Witherspoon also give outstanding performances in their supporting roles respectively. This ""coming of age"" film really reminded me of reading The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer when I was a kid. Similar films I've really enjoyed include The War (1994) starring Kevin Costner and The River Rat (1984) starring Tommy Lee Jones which have all featured similar backdrops on the water and/or in the woods with a setting in economically depressed areas with most rural families living below the poverty line. You want to cry and laugh with these characters. They aren't necessarily having a good time, but they're not miserable either. They care about one another without really even knowing each other and take responsibility without even having obligation.

197,loveminuszero000,Realism and multi-dimensional characters makes this a unique film,9,31 December 2013,"The only reason I am writing this review is because I was shocked by some of the bad ones. While yes, the film is long, I was engrossed the entire time so it didn't feel long to me. I see criticism for McConaughey's character because he is a ""criminal"". Ooooh, golly gee, that's so scary and repugnant. If all you saw was that he was a criminal, then you missed the entire point of the movie. One of the points of his character was that you can be a criminal and still be GOOD in other ways. That is reality and that is what's so great about this film, it reflects reality back at the audience. I know I am watching something special when I don't feel like I'm watching a movie at all. This is how this felt to me. Maybe it's because I've grown up around a similar element of society, but I saw people and experiences that were very familiar in this film. It felt like I was on a great adventure with some of my childhood friends.The writer said he was trying to capture a certain way of life because he knew it would soon be gone with all the gentrification that's happening everywhere. I absolutely commend him for that because gentrification is swallowing up everything that is real and hearty about this country. I guess looking at a shabby houseboat as a residence is hard for people who are used to open floor plans, granite counter tops, and cathedral ceilings. This is a story about real people and personal experiences that make us grow as human beings. The writing is good, the acting is excellent and the direction is perfect. The one flaw that I saw was that the writer went a little overboard with the theme of love. I thought Ellis' personal love story was a little cheesy and unnecessary. I admit, there were a few eye rolling moments. Hence the nine stars instead of ten. Other than that, this is a wonderful example of an independent movie. I hope others follow suit.",Mud
198,kriddirk,"Excellent movie about love, the US-Mississippi life and life through child eyes",9,7 September 2013,"In fact, the complete movie turns around love and what people, adults or children, do for it. Ellis and Neckbone, the 2 children of 14, who find the fugitive Mud on an island of the Mississippi river, decide to help and protect him due to their current emotional situation. Ellis is as well in love as Mud, a child's love, his parents have their problems in their marriage and all this brings him to help and protect the fugitive Mud ( Matthew McConaughey). The fact that 2 children help a fugitive could be the most difficult part of the movie to believe, but just that part has been treated very good and it seems the only way to go for knowing the emotional situation of Ellis and Neckbone. The world is seen through the lenses of 2 children and that is done perfectly !!! Tye Sheridan puts the role of Ellis on another level. This child seems to be a born actor. He is just doing perfect. Then we have McConaughey. He has been in the movie business for a long time, but it is now that he convinces us of how good he is. In the ""The Paperboy"" he is good, in this movie he is excellent. A difficult role that he assumes perfectly. The way he talks, the accent, his love ... he is a Robinson Crusoe. All the supporting roles are very good put to the screen as well. Another aspect of the movie shows us the hard life of the people living and living from the Mississippi river; the nature, how adult children act for their age due to the hard life. It is another US that we normally don't see, not the one of heroes, money or small-village life. This movie is a bit different. It is as well a thriller, but not an action driven movie.

Its only when I looked up Jeff Nichols history, it states he was born and raised in the area the film is set in, Arkansas.McConaughey is perfect for the role of 'Mud', in that you get the feel of a once wholesome southern boy, turned bad and now try's to inflict some knowledge onto the two young boys, so a relationship can be instilled for his survival.Word of advice, don't watch this movie round the gobby wife and kids, as it needs your attention for the great dialogue and unfolding story between these characters.",Mud

205,copyright908,Muddy Waters,7,15 May 2013,"MUD Matthew McConaughey plays the title character Mud who is living or at least inhabiting an otherwise uninhabited island in the middle of the Mississippi River somewhere between Arkansas and Mississippi. He is discovered by two 14 year old boys Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) who have boated out to the island to lay claim to what appears to be about a 14 ft pleasure boat, that somehow got itself caught up in the branches of a rather large tree, undoubtedly through the vicissitudes of one of the great river's frequent floods.Mud is full of both mysticism, and philosophy, a true southern Gothic. He attributes supernatural powers to his shirt and bonfires. He waxes on at length on the causes and nature of good and bad luck, the latter being the one he is currently experiencing, and he has a claim and a plan for the boat of his own. So the competing claims must be negotiated. Mud regales the boys with his tale of woe and his lost love, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). Mud believes with all his heart that he will reunite with Juniper and together they will sail or motor down the mighty Mississip to the Gulf of Mexico, where Mud believes he will attain some measure of freedom. But he needs the boys help to act as a go-between for him and Juniper, and of course to get the boat out of the tree and make it sea worthy.Ellis, the romantic, stands ready immediately, but Neckbone the practical one, desires a tangible reward. He bargains for Mud's .45 that he keeps tucked in his belt.With the introduction of the gun, the story takes an ominous turn. As it turns out, Mud has indeed used this weapon on the flesh of another human being, and has thus garnered the attention of all officialdom, complete with roadblocks and wanted posters. In addition, he has earned the ire of the dead man's family, whose patriarch (old friend, Walking Tall's Joe Don Baker) has organized a posse of miscreants and cutthroats to track Mud down, and not for the purpose of a fair trial.All that being said the story is really about Ellis, a boy whose rustic way of life along the river is threatened to be subsumed by a modern culture that has little truck for such quaint anachronisms. Yet, Ellis remains a chivalrous romantic who sees his main purpose in life as the rescue of damsels in distress. When he puts his romanticism to the test in the real world, as all us romantics afore him know, he is bound for some disappointment. Nevertheless, he endures and perseveres.Director Jeff Nichols has become a darling of the critics with his movies (Shotgun Stories & Take Shelter). His thematic approach seems to be the psychological effect on people of traditional value pitted against a society that seems to demand that they change these values on any current popular whim. He is to be admired in my view, for eschewing the typical Hollywood condescension of small town America as an insignificant voting bloc, possibly worthy of some future anthropological study, and giving his characters a distinct individuality; a sense of humor about the world and themselves; and most of all, dignity.The fact that the movie stars Mathew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon says a lot about Nichols growing reputation. This is not a big movie but it certainly attracted big stars. The casting of the two boys shows good eye and a director that knows what he wants. Other supporting players of note note, Sam Sheppard as Ellis's eccentric, grumpy old man,across the river neighbor (He likes to shoot river snakes from hisporch) and Nichols favorite Michael Shannon (who may soon make a big splash in the upcoming ""Iceman"") as Neckbone's uncle and ill prepared but sincere caretaker.Like the great river itself the movie does meander a bit.It is southern you know. The dialog accompanied by numerous meaningful looks arguably could be tightened up a bit, but big time actors require big time parts. So, there's that.There are some questions that pop up, like where does Mud get his cigarettes? He doesn't have any food, but he always has plenty of smokes. How does Ellis communicate so easily with Juniper when she is so obviously being watched? And there is some violence that didn't seem to me fitting with the tone of the movie, but these are quibbles. The film has the look and feel of a labor of love, so it's sins (if in fact they can be called sins), can easily be forgiven. But some may find the movie overly long. I however did not; it kept my interest the entire way.So we have a coming of age story, with homage to Mark Twain and a sprinkling of Southern Gothic. With character names like Mud and Neckbone you might suspect that it's not your normal coming of age movie, and it's not, thank God. Ellis clearly has hormonal urges, but unlike most Hollywood efforts of this kind, it will not lead him to banal inanity and bathroom humor, but rather to a journey of self realization that is both satisfying to the character and to the audience. It is a good story well told.",Mud

How in the hell did he get on that Island in the first place? Listen, I see a lot of reviews that give this movie 9 or more stars and frankly it's why I watched it. Not understanding the love for this movie. It's slow and the end gun fight scene was beyond ridiculous even for Hollywood standards. Lastly, why does the boat ""have"" to be up in a tree? Couldn't it just be an abandoned broken boat washed up on the Island. Guess I just don't understand the purpose for it, Yea, watch it at your own risk but get ready to be kinda bored.",Mud
207,calebcunningham41,Would have been a 10 if...,8,22 May 2014,"Mud, is an excellent film. -Has a great, almost perfect, script. (I say almost perfect because too much swearing in a film makes it bland) -Has some amazing acting. Lots of talent. -Really great music score that matches up with the film nicely. HOWEVER, unnecessary elements can sometimes bring a great movie down to a horrible one. One thing you need to know about Mud is that it is a truly believable story line. It is a very believable movie! Like, by the end, you think to yourself ""wow...that could have really happened."" But, there are some things in this movie that I disagree on. One, it is incredibly unnecessary to have young teenage boys gawking over a porn magazine. That doesn't have to be in ANY movie much less one like this; that has this good of a story. (There's also a scene where a young guy starts staring down a woman's shirt and she snaps her fingers to make him look away but he won't. Just something that doesn't need to be there.) Two, just because some disrespectful teenage guys talk about sex and girls in inappropriate ways does not mean they all do. It does not make the story more believable by adding that to it. I would have given this a 10 if...It didn't have those unnecessary elements. They DID NOT add anything to the movie. They only took away from it. This film is about love, courage, bravery, mystery, and life's warnings. It is one of the best inidie films I've ever seen. Was well worth the watch! But I would not recommend this film to everyone.",Mud
208,seansworks,"A fantastically well made, utterly forgettable film",7,14 March 2016,"There's little doubt MUD is well made. We can start with the cast. Whether it's McConaughey doing such an excellent job with oddity title character Mud that it revived his flagging career to the, as of this writing, up and coming star Tye Sheridan, to etc. etc. Well, point is everyone here gives a wonderful performance.And thanks to Nichol's writing and careful direction, and each actor's performance, we care about all these characters, or at least relate to them. And the low key, believable, and morally grey scenario these characters are put in feels interesting and keeps your attention. Which is not to say there's not a cinematic flare to the story, but simply that it's lower key than today's glut of explosion filled blockbusters. More Jaws and less Avengers is the order of the day, with no fantastical elements to speak of.And therein we get to the crux of the problem. Which is not the scenario itself, of two boys meeting the strangely charismatic, but wanted man Mud and having to decide whether to help him or not. But that this scenario, entirely unlike Jaws, plays itself out to an entirely unsatisfying, and even a bit off tone, conclusion.And I mention Jaws specifically because, like this movie, it's a fairly low key movie with a bit of cinematic flare but otherwise without any particularly fantastical elements. But to demonstrate what this movie lacks I'll go ahead and spoil Jaws, wherein we build up this challenge, this mountain that is this shark. Oh sure it's one shark, but for the characters involved it is their personal mountain, and the ending battle between them and it feels like the ultimate culmination of the movie. They came to the mountain, they saw the mountain, the mountain was conquered, and we feel a sense of satisfaction and completion once it is.By comparison, Mud almost forgets that there is a mountain. It hardly concentrates at all on Mud's situation and what it means for the kids. Instead the movie satisfies itself with building the characters in their own right and having each little side story get a huge amount of limelight. Which sounds fine until you come to the end, and the proverbial mountain comes for our characters, and you forgot it was there. And so the mountain showing up feels odd, it doesn't feel built up much. It feels, in short, like a guest you realized you invited a week ago, but have forgot to prepare for and in fact haven't even thought about all week, and so when they show up the entire visit feels rather awkward and uncomfortable.And with that awkward, and uncomfortable guest showing up, the movie ends. Flat, straight out ends. The mountain, the shark, killed. The conflict is resolved, and the characters go their separate ways. Oh we like the characters, or at least relate to them, plenty. But we don't feel any particular satisfaction in the end of the story. Because though the main thread of the story is at an end we were never that invested in it to begin with.Which is why, while I enjoyed the film 95% of the time while I was watching it, I also completely forgot it existed until its director came up in movie news with his next, Midnight Special.",Mud

Two boys stumble upon a strange man played flawlessly by Matthew McConaughey which leads them into a situation way over there heads. This is at it's heart a coming of age story but with an edge. The boys learn about life in bold and dramatic ways yet the film was never heavy handed or boring.That is because the characters are well written and both McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon seized the opportunity to bring them to life. Both actors proved their abilities and range as actors. It even for no other reason you should see Mud for the performances by all the actors including Michael Shannon, who's theater background continues to serve him on the big screen as the comic relief in this story.We can only hope they will take more parts like this so strong independent films can continue to be made and get their day in court.Review written by the Writer/Director of Cam-Girl (aka) Web-cam",Mud
213,AmandaSage,Nichols nails it again with Mud,10,14 April 2014,"Jeff Nichols has done it again. The writer/director's latest creation, Mud, is as beautifully shot and soulfully written as his last feature, Take Shelter (see the Take Shelter review from December 2011), which I absolutely loved. And although the two films' plots are quite different, their territory is familiar; with Mud, Nichols again explores ideas of perception, and how our experiences and belief systems inform our take on reality.Mud has also been found (by many a reviewer) to share turf with the works of Mark Twain—in particular, the escapes and escapades of two adventuresome young boys, Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. The movie is about 14-year-olds Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), who go exploring in their boat and come upon a fugitive living on an island on the Mississippi River.The fugitive's name is Mud (Matthew McConaughey), and that fact, along with his disheveled look (complete with snaggletooth and hand-knotted hair) and freewheeling lifestyle (he sleeps in a boat lodged in a tree), not to mention his whimsical, childlike quality, almost make you wonder at first whether the character is imagined by the two boys. Mud certainly matches them—and Ellis in particular—in his raw emotion and fierce stubbornness.You wouldn't blame Ellis if he had constructed such a character. The boy's life seems to be sinking beneath him, as he faces his parents' separation and an impending move to the city, away from his beloved home on the river.Ellis is also discovering girls. He's got his eye on an older high schooler named May Pearl (Bonnie Sturdivant). And no matter how careless she is with his heart, it seems to belong irrevocably to her. Love and romance are lifelines for Ellis, and as he gets hit by a wave of change, he clings desperately to them.So when Ellis learns that Mud's crimes were committed in the name of love for his sweetheart, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), he does everything he can to reunite the pair, even if it means butting heads (or fists and heads) with the bounty hunters who are hot on Mud's trail. Neckbone, of course, comes along for the boat ride.Mud is a special film that paints fairytale and coming of age with a slightly sinister brush. Its darker hues and fantastical tones remind me of several other great movies about children at odds with growing up: Where the Wild Things Are, Moonrise Kingdom, Winter's Bone and even Son of Rambow.The film is full of gorgeous imagery (flowing down the river; slowing long enough to linger on scrambling spiders or sun-streaked plants) and golden nuggets of truth and humour.It's also buoyed by exceptional performances. In particular, Sheridan, who debuted in Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life, Lofland, in his first movie role, and McConaughey, who uses Mud to further his habit of delivering ever-better performances.I saw the film with two good friends, LG and TG. As we were leaving the theatre, TG asked whether Take Shelter depicted women as negatively as did Mud. I was too tired to get into it at the time, but I'll say now that I don't think Mud ultimately does portray women in a poor light. Ellis' mother is revealed to be the stronger, more responsible parent. Juniper is redeemed. And although May Pearl is no gem, we see glimmers of brighter treasures to be found.In the end, Mud suggests the promise of greatness—in love, but also in adventure, discovery and friendship. Ellis is left with hope, and so are we.",Mud

216,aarondevoll,Tom and Huck Revisited,8,15 January 2019,"Mud boasts one of Matthew McConaughey's best performances as a mysterious loner who becomes friends with two young kids on a small island near the Mississippi River. Gradually, Mud and the boys develop a close bond and inspire each other to leap to the next stage in their lives.Mud was directed by Jeff Nichols who has said that he prefers to emphasize ambiance over plot, and he gives his picture an interesting low-key southern aesthetic, invoking the writings of Mark Twain. While many other modern character driven films rely on cliches and other annoying tics, Mud's characters feel real and very human. Nichols lets the film feel intimate but never with any pretense.Matthew McConaughey has worked the past several years to shed his image of laughing stock to serious artist and while he may not always pull it off, he shows pretty good range here. The film doesn't entirely avoid cliches but Nichols sensitive direction and some minor performances by Reese Witherspoon and the late Sam Shepard make this a memorable coming of age film.8.5/10.

217,jrh-511-162275,Mud...4 out of 4 Skittles,10,5 July 2013,"For some reason Writer/Director Jeff Nichols still seemed to be flying under the radar after his 2011 underrated, indie titan of a film, Take Shelter, but his latest masterpiece Mud is bound to capture the attention from anyone left in the film world who hasn't wised up and taken notice about the next great filmmaker on the rise.Mud is a powerful little film that sneaks up and knocks your socks off. Just like with Take Shelter, Mud has a way of keeping you on the edge of your seat using only the tiniest of details. Nichols' ability to build suspense through his masterful script with highly lush characters and spot-on direction is uncanny, and unparalleled by very few other directors who can work so well with a limited budget.Matthew McConaughey (Magic Mike, The Lincoln Lawyer) takes over for Michael Shannon as Nichols' lead man (although Shannon provides a wonderful little cameo here as well), and knocks it out of the park with maybe his strongest performance to date. Whether it's because he is tired of being Hollywood's go to guy for making terrible rom-com crap, or he is searching for the role that will win him an Oscar, McConaughey has put together a strong slate of film roles the past couple of years that is matched by very few other (if any) actors. No matter what the reason behind his escape from Hollywood is...with performances in films like Bernie, Killer Joe, Magic Mike, The Paperboy and now Mud...it's great to see McConaughey trying to do something different. Kudos 'Wooderson'.Major props must also go to the young actors Tye Sheridan & Jacob Lofland who provide most of the films backbone. These two boys feel completely genuine, and hold their own throughout with the all-star cast (another mark of a great director).Mud plays like a perfect escape from those looking for something different on their movie night out. If you've had your fill of unrealistic CG effects, stupid story lines and Vin Diesel attempting to act, then Mud is the film you've been searching for.For more quick spoiler free skittle reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",Mud

The reason I haven't given it a higher rating is that there are a number of these sensitive coming-of-age movies, and they are just about all very good. This is good but not outstanding.The big fault of the movie is the end. The final resolution was good, but the scenes immediately leading to it were in my opinion contrived and an easy cop-out.

Matt, thems some fine ass chops on that plate (read that line and take it how you will). I was never a fan of his work, and I doubt anyone would think in a MILLION YEARS...........that he could pull off something like that. He was gritty, he was dirty, he was disgusting, HE WAS FANTASTIC. Ladies and gentlemen of the acting world, THAT is what acting is all about. He took an image he was type-casted in and flipped it on its head! He became Mud, and I don't think anyone can take that away from him. HOWEVER.....I will not claim this to be the best picture I have ever seen, but, it was pretty damn good. It really showed how much poverty there is in America, and how separated the rich and poor can really be. It was a statement on American culture and way of life. Very well done Mr. Nichols, and that goes just as much for cinematographer Adam Stone, Wow! Its like you drained a tea bag all over the celluloid and slapped it on the screen, REAL AND DIRTY. The writing, I wasn't too crazy for it, but the scenes between Ellis and his father were very realistic and at times painful. HOWEVER...... (again) Witherspoon and the two boys (Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland) didn't knock me off my feet too much. Sure they were good, but good is difficult to handle when you have an Oscar NOMINATED (patent pending) PERFORMANCE BY SAM SHEPARD. Every scene he was in was gold, while Ellis' father, played by Ray McKinnon, was heartbreaking and not overdone in the slightest.It's nice to see a film this year that isn't big and isn't loud. It takes you to a dark place and tries to be real, without being a cardboard cut out. You believe the characters, you understand their problems, and you feel like Matthew McConaughey has earned an Oscar for eating beans.

It's rather rare to find a new title that can actually make you stop to think about a couple (maybe more than a couple) aspects of life. Mud is essentially a love story. Mud's love story as well as little 14 year-old Ellis' own. And because of that common trace the both start developing a sort of friendship. Sounding a little cliché so far? Well that's about as far as the clichés go in this movie, because (almost) every predictable moment was changed into something original. Because of that fact, alone, the movie would deserve being watched. But yes, there's more. Matthew McCounaghey's acting was very impressive, and the chemistry between him and Tye Sheridan (Ellis) worked beautifully. Mud is a rare case of movie that, through a simple premise and objective story-line, actually acquires some depth and can touch you on more than one level. A must-see.",Mud

A perfect 10- writing, story, dialogue, scenic locale, casting, acting, director, script, cast. A great combination of Mark Twain, the big river, the fishing life of the people, their hardscrabble working life, the awful houses they live in. The violence was kept to a minimum as was the language. The two child actors were superb beyond belief. They reminded me of Stand by me with River Phoenix. Every one in this movie seemed real and as natural as life itself. The performance by Mathew M. (can't spell the last name) in the lead earns him an automatic Oscar nomination.

225,ianfarkas9,"despite being unabashedly sappy and running too long, Mud pulls it together with likable characters and strong performances",7,22 January 2013,"Mud, Jeff Nichols follow up to the criminally under-seen Take Shelter, is a strange mix between a coming of age story and and escaped con thriller. Set in a Arkansas town that's about as redneck-y as redneck gets, Mud focuses on a couple of boys in their early teens, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland). The duo comes across a boat lodged in a tree thats occupied by a bum named Mud (Matthew McConaughey). Mud seems amiable to the boys, trading food for a guarantee that the boat will be theirs once he goes on his merry way to reacquaint himself with the love of his life, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). However, once it becomes clear that Mud is being hunted by the police and a pack of bounty hunters due to a past crime, the boys strike a deal with their homeless friend: they'll get the tree-stranded boat up and running in exchange for the pistol Mud used to commit the crime he is being pursued for.First and foremost, lets make something explicitly clear: Mud is just about as cheesy as you get. The movie never misses a chance to take emotional cheap shots at the audience, and many of the plot lines (one regarding marital troubles between Ellis's folks in particular) feel ripped straight out of Lifetime movies. However, for each overwrought groaner that misses the mark, there is a genuine moment of tenderness between characters that hits the emotional bullseye. There are plenty of moments when Nichols should have pulled back, should have avoided the schmaltz, but they don't ruin the scenes that get the relationships between characters right on. Especially effective are the scenes between Ellis and Mud, with Ellis's admiration of gruff and mysterious Mud never being overdone. The same cannot be said for the relationship between Ellis and his feuding parents, which more often then not amps the drama up to 11 when what it needed more than anything was restraint. Mud also overstays its welcome due to an excessively leisurely pace that includes one too many subplots. Mud has plenty of fat to be cut, from the standard teen infatuation story of a young boy dropping the ""L"" word after a single date to a subplot revolving around a scuba diver (played by the always awesome but tragically unnecessary Micheal Shannon) which only pays off in the oddest and least fulfilling way. Had 20ish minutes been cut, I can't help but feel it would have made for a more effective final act, but as it stands the numerous bland asides from the main story drag the film down, especially in the final act. Despite these flaws, Mud succeeds where it really counts. The relationship between the two boys, and their interactions with Mud, are a pleasure to watch. This is largely due to the easygoing chemistry between the actors, making the strange idea of a 14 year old befriending a middle aged hobo somewhat more believable. The acting in general is great all around, McConaughey stealing the show with his detached Mud. The only week link is Witherspoon as Mud's fickle love, who seems to be sleepwalking through scenes that needed a more emotional push.As a final note, the last half hour or so of the movie goes a little crazy. Following the lamest forced-emotion scene in the film (something that was telegraphed excessively earlier in the film), the film completely switches genres for its climactic scene. Without going into detail, the ending was more than a little jarring and felt out of place in a slow drama.",Mud

First of all, the act of those two teenager actors was pleasant and admirable, almost without noticeable weaknesses. Unlike the majority of movies, in this movie the darkness and twilight of the night and early morning were beautifully drawn into the picture. Also, Mud's teeth were rotten, and I think in most films despite of the situation that goes on for the actor, his teeth are always brushed and insanely white. About the whole movie I could say it comes from a regular or a simple story with no mystery; Although,there is a hidden excitement in it. I think in some points it makes you sympathize with the actor, such as one part of the film that Ellis 'unconsciously' and 'unwantedly' turns into a thief. One particular scene is very interesting, and that's the scene where Ellis is bit by snakes and Neckbone asks Mud that ""Are you bit?"" and Mud answers ""No"" but with very tangible doubt. I think it has an amphibology at that moment, one concept could be he wonders that after those lies the kid is still worried about him and has an empathy for him; The second one might be he is bit for the second time in his lifetime and he don't wanna tell them. At last, another thing that was interesting for me was father of the sail. According to the Mud, he is the devil himself, but his outward is very normal just like another ordinary business man.",Mud

230,jaydeetee-19255,A coming-of-age story set in the Louisiana backwaters.,8,23 July 2016,"A teenage boy, who lives with his struggling parents on an old houseboat on a river in Louisiana, and his best friend discover an old boat resting in a tree on a nearby island. The boys, looking for adventure, decide to take owner-ship of the wrecked boat, only to find that a stranger, a man named Mud has other ideas about that boat. Mud (played by Matthew McConaughry) tells the two boys about his early life there in the same Louisiana locale, and about his love for the pretty girl he fell in love with in his youth. He then asks them to help in restoring the boat so that he can re-unite with his first love. The boys are at first apprehensive, but one of them, love struck with a girl a couple years older than himself, decides to help and his friend relents and goes along with the plan. They soon discover that Mud is a man on the run, but they still continue to assist him in his quest. This is a little coming-of-age tale with enough warmth and suspense to make a viewing well worthwhile. The cast is excellent, and the sense-of-place is near perfect.",Mud
231,burtofprey-1,One Big Cliché,1,28 September 2013,"From the start ""Mud"" drowns in its own misery and misantropia. The director probably thought: ""the more realism, the better movie"". Well, that's a mistake. I know redneck America exists, and people do live in trailers. But the way ""Mud"" portrays these people feels very forced and unnatural. The character's vulgarity and lack of style is so obvious and in your face. No surprises. The bitter truth. In other words: One Big Cliché. McConaughey's accents makes your ears bleed. Witherspoon's outfit and expression is dreadful. What's the point of presenting these beautiful actors this ugly? That is so unfair towards the real people who can't pay their medical bills. Besides, why not hire real unhollywoodian actors with real dental problems and original accents? Could it be in that way the movie wouldn't sell? Hello! An amateur actor in Arkansas wants to have a chance too! The word 'exploitation' comes to mind, this time in a very twisted context.The only good part of this movie is the photography. It was awesome and could produce many a good painting.",Mud
232,kateskye,"A Dark, Hopeful, and Beautiful Coming-of-Age Story",8,17 May 2013,"This is a film with so much personality. It has a great, mythical quality and contains tonal references to Huckleberry Finn, Noir and Westerns. The main characters deal with love, heartbreak, faith in others, the arbitrary nature of justice and continuing hope for a better future. I also enjoyed it because the story takes place in an area of America with which I'm really unfamiliar - Arkansas.The movie starts strong, lags a little in the middle, but then finishes wonderfully. Just about everyone is well cast, from the leads to the bad guys to the minor characters; although I was not entirely thrilled with Reese Witherspoon's performance. However, I especially loved the two boys - Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland - who were at the story's heart.All in all, I highly recommend seeing this one.",Mud
233,baymist,More like Dreck than Mud,1,10 January 2014,"I watched this movie based upon the favorable reviews and relatively high 7.5 rating. My question is who the hell are these people who provide these reviews and ratings. This quasi ""coming of age"" movie starts off well enough but ultimately becomes just plain ridiculous. We get to see Matthew McConaughey playing his too common stereotypical(supposedly endearing cool crude good ole boy)role - which perhaps for his groupies warrants a good rating. What could have become the most interesting part of the movie - the family relationships of the main character's parents, is glossed over and clichéd. The movie goes from good to bad to worse as it progresses into a wholly unrealistic fairy tale. Can anyone explain how the two boys in a tiny motorboat transported a 30 foot boat trailer to the island? How was it that Mud had no food, yet had an endless supply of cigarettes. How was it possible that the motel was under constant surveillance, yet none of them questioned the multiple visits by the boy to Mud's girlfriend's room - none the less follow him to the the bar where she is hanging. Was it not astonishing that 4 gunmen can't hit anyone with shotguns closeup; however, the guy across the river shoots all of them? Finally, most satisfying is that at the end, even though the boy had to move to an apartment complex with mom, his seeing a pretty girl across the parking lot makes everything okay. Dreck!",Mud
234,rv78,The best movie so far for 2013,10,2 May 2013,"I went into ""Mud"" with no idea of what it was about. I immediately had flashbacks to ""Stand By Me"". That said, I think ""Mud"" is a better movie. I thought the acting was exceptional, the photography both real and lush, the lighting well done, and the story was fresh, real, and terrific. The direction MUST have been terrific also, as the result is a near-perfect film that everyone can and should enjoy. The 2 young actors (playing the characters of Ellis and Neckbone) were amazing -- especially Tye Sheridan playing the lead character, Ellis. Sam Shepherd was great as Ellis' ""assassin"" neighbor (and longtime friend of Mud), the actor who played Ellis' dad was TERRIFIC and stole every scene he was in. Reese Witherspoon was only on film for perhaps 10 minutes but she was perfect as Mud's white-trash girlfriend. And this was Matthew McConaughey's best job EVER. (Until now only his role in The Lincoln Lawyer was good to my mind, and I was tired of his constant good-old-pretty-boy act in everything else!) I hope it was not made too early to get consideration for the Academy Awards next year. Although it's a lowish-budget independent film, ""Mud"" is sure to become a classic! I saw it the other night with my wife... and I plan to see it again soon with my teenage son.",Mud
235,mikeholliday51,Very Good Flick,8,24 July 2013,"I have to admit that Matthew McConaughey is a good actor, I have seen him in other films and he does a good job of being a character actor, one who is not always the same in each movie. He is intense and does an excellent portrayal of his character. The two boys are excellent, portraying their roles to a T. The storyline is quite good. The theme, if you pay attention, is love breaking apart and breaking hearts as seen and felt through Ellis. His character is the quicker of the two boys, that is not to say his best friend doesn't shine as well. This is a wonderful (hence I say?) coming of age type movie but it is also a good one to display Matthew, his acting, and the two young boys. Reese of course (yes, we know who you are) is fine as the love of Mud's life. Enough said, enjoy!",Mud

Prior to that- we have a beach, a boat, two young boys (one coming of age) the bad guys, a love interest and a blurred story of ""why Mud cannot be trusted"". Boring! This could have easily been a USA Special Presentation rather than an $10 movie. I read a review prior that stated this was Matthew McConaughey's best performance. HOW?

240,maya-822,Outstanding,9,9 May 2013,"Anyone who ever dreamed of America dreamed it for two kinds of spaces : the city – high and sprawling, violent and full of energy – and the nature – the desert, the bayou, the swamps, the ""wilderness"", a word that has no equivalent in French. We dream of America because we dream of the images that created it. There are always images, shaped by other images, and we keep on dreaming of them. The filmmakers know that. Watching Mulholland Drive is watching Gilda and Sunset Boulevard, etc. Watching Mud is watching other images of the South. And the South has always been inhabited by resourceful children, forced to manage on their own to face the adults' violence. And nature has always been for them a way out and a consolation. Watching Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) is like watching Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, Idgie in Fried Green Tomatoes, Mick in the Heart is a Lonely Hunter ""This thing I want I know not what"", Mick says. Ellis watches the adults, he sees his parents fight, he sees women lie to men, men lie to women. They seem lost. He would like to help them, to belong there, and yet at the same time he is disappointed in them, he is angry. This thing he wants and doesn't want. Mud, and everything that shaped it, is about a passage, a difficult growth from the child's freedom to the adult's responsibilities, it's about the impossibility to understand the world as it is. To understand, you always need a guide, or at least a model. But the adult is weak and needs help. In Mud, as in two other great movies, Winter's Bone and Beasts of the Southern Wild (let's remember that Arkansas is in the middle, between Missouri and Louisiana), roles are reversed. The child takes care of the adult, and loses some of his illusions on the way. And yet, despite violence and death, love remains, love between men and women, between parents and their children, between men and nature. Beauty is still out there, in front of which one cannot but wonder. Mud ends in a final shot of the river, which is a character in itself, both dangerous and protective. I love America for all these images, all these stories, all these shots, all these characters. I love the myths America created, and Mud adds another piece to this mythology.Read my blog for other reviews: http://filmcritiks.wordpress.com/",Mud

242,gra_ham_man5,"An uneasy, yet beautifully engaging coming-of-age tale of love and friendship.",9,1 September 2013,"Mud, Jeff Nichols' third time in the Director's chair, is easily one of the best pictures of the year. It's not just a mesmerizing and believable coming-of-age story, but another notch in Matthew McConaughey's belt towards his revival as an astonishingly talented actor. Don't miss this one!McConaughey plays Mud, a man on the run from the law, yet we don't know why. He is found living in a boat in a tree (of all things) by young, backwoods boys Ellis and Neckbone (played exquisitely by newcomers Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland). While this is McConaughey's show, Sheridan steals every scene. His innocence and youth are portrayed perfectly as he carries us through the difficulties of growing up, love, trust and understanding. It's powerful stuff, especially in the last half of the film. This kid is someone to keep an eye on!A haunting soundtrack and visceral cinematography adds to the uneasy mood you feel throughout the films 130 minute runtime. Yet, it never feels long. The engaging plot, excellent performances and unexpected surprises keeps the film rolling along at a steady pace.Nichols really has shown he knows how to make a great film, especially after Take Shelter (which is also highly recommended), and now this. Mud is an excellent film in a year full of dramatic disappointments. It's smart, genuine and gritty all at once, never catering to the audience's expectations or typical stereotypes. Love is, and can be, a harsh reality but, no matter the trials we go through to experience such a pleasure, it's undoubtedly worth it.9/10 Snake Bites",Mud
243,matija-lozancic,Disappointing,6,16 February 2015,"Pleasantly surprised by good rating and solid reviews, i decided to give it a go. With Matthew Mccounaghey and Reese Witherspoon, i didn't expect to be disappointed. However, i was.The pacing of this movie is rather slow. The whole movie is hanging on between relaxed atmosphere and drama. What i saw is the great potential, but it failed to deliver. Only things i enjoyed were landscape and Mccounaghey's performance.What really bugged me is the script and the acting. Only developed characters were Mud and the kids. However, the chemistry between them is rather unreal. It could have been much better. It just doesn't feel like it's there. I paused the movie three times and went back forcing myself to watch it.The story starts intriguingly, Mud is hiding on a deserted island and waiting to get in contact with his love, Juniper. And the kids come into story to save the day. As the movie progresses, it loses the grip. It's just slow paced and doesn't deliver the drama. Only time i felt some action was when Mud saved Ellis and the ending scene. I don't want to spoil it, but the love story disappointed me also.Very disappointing performances of Reese Witherspoon, Sam Shepard and the others destroyed the movie. Also, Joe Don Baker's character was so much underused, he was introduced as a devil and then went on to have max 2 minutes of screen time. And seriously, what's with the don Vito Corleone impression? Cut it off, Baker. But maybe it wasn't them, it was just the script. Especially disappointing was the climax. We are left with some unresolved questions. What happened to Juniper? What did the kids learn from all of this? I respect the movie for trying to teach some basic values about love and how women can destroy men, but the delivery was just to shallow. It just didn't bring any drama. Wasn't it for Mccounagheys great performance (as always), i wouldn't have finished the movie. If you are relaxed and bored, give it a try. But don't expect much. 6/10",Mud

His performance to start seriously blew me away. What a character he created, what a strange man. Here we have Nichols again going back to this old-fashioned American realism to tell a story in the mid-west. Told fantastically. What a coming of age tale. How odd it was but at the same time how refreshing. Nichols is, without a doubt, one, if not the, most talented up-and- coming young directors working today. So original, so well-directed, Jesus.

A special mention to the Cinematography & Music (Adam stone & David wingo respectively) both of them have lifted the movie on their shoulders to create a master piece.

250,smellthebreeze,Solid Movie With Just a Few Flaws,7,23 June 2013,I enjoyed this movie overall and feel it was well filmed.Ray McKinnon and Sam Shepard stole the show in terms of acting. Amazing job done by the both of them. I wasn't impressed with Matthew McConaughey's acting. He is a very average actor and I feel the movie could have had a different vibe without him in the role. Both young actors (characters of Ellie and Neckbone) did a great job.It is interesting how the movie is set in modern times (2011 was seen on a calendar) yet you don't see people using cell phones or computers or the internet. It's almost as if the film could have been done 30 years prior based on how it was filmed and the mood/tone of it.I didn't fully understand the point of the character Galen and felt he could have been cut from the script and it wouldn't have made a huge difference. He was entertaining but irrelevant to the movie.In the end (this is the spoiler) we are basically watching two murderers get away with murder. Of course they have our sympathies but...well...you know.,Mud

Started off slowly, and I often wondered how the auteur is going to justify the bonding between the boys and the fugitive but he pulls it off impressively in the end. Over the length of the movie, you do get the subtle message that the boys are in awe of Mud and are themselves growing in confidence as they help him out more. I think this was difficult to show on screen and the Nichols pulls it of with aplomb. Mud on the other hand realizes the futility of it all and leaves for a safer abode not without a few hiccups though. One does start caring for each of the central characters in the end although i do wonder why was the other kid in the movie. There was barely room for him to grow and his character seemed to be overshadowed throughout the length of the movie. All in all, a fantastic, heart warming film that makes you smile right at the very end.",Mud
252,BloodyNovocaine,Mud Is Beautiful!!!!,8,5 August 2013,"Mud is Beautiful. That is the review of Mud in a nutshell. There are lot of 'coming of age', genre movie coming out lately. Only a few manages to create a long lasting memory in your mind, and Mud is definitely one among the few.Jeff Nichols is a filmmaker, who manages to extract the best possible performance from his lead actors. His previous movie, 'Take Shelter', for instance was really good. Michael Shannon delivered a performance worthy of an Oscar nod, and yet he was ignored. Nichols does the same in Mud. McConaughey delivers a career best performance as 'Mud' in Mud. He is natural in this. You could just watch and get blown away by seeing this dude act or rather live as the character. He was supported strongly by the 2 kids and Sam Shepard. Everybody is an awe of 'Tye Sheridan', the kid who acted as 'Ellis', he did a remarkable job, due to which the performance of the other kid, Jacob Lofland, got overshadowed. Lofland too delivers a solid supporting performance as 'Neckbone'. The coming of age theme is shown beautifully, not giving away much about the plot.Mud is beautifully shot and innocently written. The background score goes well with the theme of the movie. I would really really be disappointed if MCConaughey doesn't get a nod for this. 8 on 10.",Mud
253,leopoldoisrael,Good effort but does not deliver,5,10 April 2014,The story for this film had a lot of potential to me but as the story develops I lost interest due to the flaws of the plot. Things in the movie that aren't believable...starting of that with the help of only two kids a boat can be brought down from trees. How the two kids are able to obtain everything needed to do this and then haul it to the island where Matthew's character is hiding. At the Beginning of the movie they made seem as it took a long time to get to the place where the boat is mounted up in the trees. Also when one of the main characters punches an older kid for touching a girls behind does nothing and just takes the punch as he is surrounded by his older friends as well. I know that this is a movie and such things should be taken lightly at times but not when flaws in the story are this obvious or at least somehow explained by making sense. 5 stars because it had me waiting wanting to know what was going to happen with the characters and a well acted movie.,Mud

This film brings mundanity to a whole new level! If you're the kind of person who likes to sit in a cinema and pull your hair and your nails out in order to ease the aching boredom of what is happening on the screen then this is the film for you. Why not make it a double-bill with The Way Way Back and use the opportunity to contemplate the pros of suicide? The basic idea here is that a couple of kids find a criminal in the woods and decide to help him out by stealing food for him and parts to fix up an abandoned boat. In this day and age of child abuse, child kidnapping and all other sorts of horrors these kids should be running for the hills rather than becoming buddies with an escaped convict! However, putting that aside as perhaps somewhat irrelevant as this is a film and is therefore allowed a certain amount of licence, the problem is that the plot is basically just that: kids get stuff for a convict hiding out in the woods! Great stuff! The sequel will be the kids spending their summer cleaning out a neighbour's swimming pool! It really is that basic and that boring. I think the director realised this but sadly only when it was too late and he had filmed 90% of the film. Clearly he woke up three quarters of the way through, realised he'd invented a cure for insomnia and then decided to just put in a massive shootout to wake the audience up so that they'd be able to clear the cinema at the end.",Mud

These boys are left to their own devices and develop a romantic notion of the fugitive Mud and the woman he ""loves."" They get caught up in the ugliest of social economic realities in their efforts to unite Mud and his dream woman. This is no fairytale, however. There is nothing redeeming about these characters or their lives even with acts of perceived selflessness. It is just sad and depressing. The acting is good, but I would never recommend it based on the plot and pacing. Oh, and playing ""Help me Rhonda"" at the end TOTALLY does not fit the mood or style of the movie.

Outdoor scenery-gives typical impression of the misissippi region. The end-In this case the end does not seem to be from a true story. However, a movie is only based on a true story if phrase like ""this movie is based on true facts"" is placed in its introduction or final declaration.

The title character is played by Matthew McConaughey, this time as a very scruffy fugitive with a checkered past. The film's heart and soul really belongs to 14 year old Ellis, played by Tye Sheridan. He and his friend Neckbone live the river life in rural Arkansas. Ellis's dad fishes for a living while Neck's uncle scavenges the river for things to sell.Mud is running from the law as well as vengeful bounty hunters. Ellis's parents are on the verge of divorce, although both love there son very much. Ellis is dutiful, adventurous, and brave, as he tangles with people older and bigger than himself on more than one occasion. Both boys befriend Mud, although they sometimes question whether it's the right thing to do or not.This film is so well written, with every character in it important and interesting. Every scene is terrific. Reese Witherspoon and Sam Shepard ( whose own past is a mystery that reveals itself in a huge way at the end ) provide excellent characters as well.I really look forward to seeing where the young actor Tye Sheridan goes from here in his career.

Jeff Nichols is definitely talented, while I am not familiar with his previous work, this movie has me looking forward to them.Now the story of Mud, is not out of the ordinary but in Nichol's hand the script is elevated to a whole new level. His character building is simply stellar. Matthew McConaughey gives his career's best performance while Tye Sheridan is also impressive. Jacob Loftland is a little weak when compared to the others.The cinematography is awe inspiring and the way Mississippi river is exceptionally captured. There are certain elements of the script which will leave a smile on your face especially the scene in which Mud (McConaughey) is ready to part away with his gun but not his shirt because he feels the shirt will protect him.

Everyone seems to be running from something.Mud, who is in trouble for killing his girlfriends "" troubler/ molester "" , is being chased and hunted down by the police and the victims family. Mud runs off to an island on the banks of Mississippi and finds a Boat on a tree and apparently two young explorers also find the same. They help Mud rebuild it so he can get off the island and go far from there as possible with his love Juniper.While Juniper still doesn't trust him, he leaves her for good, and decides to leave the place alone once and for all. While saying the final good bye he gets attacked by the bounty hunters at gets shot. The last scene depicts him on a boat with his uncle ( who according to Mud was an Assassin) are off to the sea with a new life.The filmography is beautiful with a country-side setting. The shots of the great Mississippi river is also charming. I still don't get it why Matthew was not nominated for Oscars for this.",Mud
267,AimadBeddouza,Now that's a drama movie,8,16 August 2013,"Mud, from director and writer « Jeff Nichols «, i don't know anything about him, and this is his first movie i watch, i am not gonna say directly if he's a good promising director or disappointing one, but i will let my review answer this question.So after i discovered about this movie in a trailer on YouTube, i became more interesting , then i read the synopsis and the positive critics about it then i became more even interesting, because nowadays it's hard to find a good drama movie genre. So i decided to watch it, and at that point and knowing that this is a drama more than a thriller, i knew it will be long and boring, this is the only thing that was preventing me from watching it, but i watched it and of course it was long and a bit boring, but for real this is one true drama movie. The thriller part didn't start until the end. Now let's jump to the performance, and i will concentrate on Mud (Matthew McConaughey) and Ellis (Tye Sheridan), actually i was amazed by these two characters, i loved their performance than any one else in the movie. Matthew McConaughey did a very well job playing a psycho, fugitive. And Tye Sheridan kills it, playing a lost mind boy who just want to help and looking for an adventure, who his parent are on the edge to get divorce. I mean if anyone loved this movie definitely will be amazed by these two characters. In the end i will say that i was satisfying with this movie and i recommend it to anyone looking for a drama and kind of a mysterious movie. I give this one 7.5/10",Mud

Good general plot structure and decent characters, but displays an inappropriate and kind of confusing relationship between the main character (Ellis, 14) and the local highschool girls. Movie was a little slow during certain parts and could have hit more emotional points for the audience concerning divorce and the meaning of love to the main character, Ellis. Decent ending but I would have liked to see a more bonding moment between the characters, Mud and Ellis. Maybe if the movie had displayed Ellis' parents already split up and he rarely saw his dad so he would seek a male figure (Mud) to help him through his tough understanding of love. That probably would have added more emotional parts to the movie to keep it at a decent pace. Pretty decent movie if you can watch it all the way through.",Mud

276,VicBooth,Looking for adulthood in all the wrong places,7,26 November 2013,"At first, the film seem follows the classic precocious-small-town coming-of-age-drama, where a boy is pitted against the anxiety created by needing to change and move forward. To those ends, our protagonist has a petulant best friend, parents with a troubled marriage, pursues an older girl and forms an inappropriate friendship with and adult named Mud(McConaughey) with a seemingly shady past, who he strongly admires for his independence and untamed masculinity. Pretty boiler plate, so far.Where Mud really finds distinction is in the way these almost cliché coming-of-age elements play out. Where one would typically find triumph or a valuable lesson learned from love lost, one finds that even with love, every human being is unavoidably selfish and fallible. Where one would find compromise and hard-earned self-respect, one instead finds that process of life can't be negotiated with. And when it normally turns out that hero worship leads to actualization or disillusionment, you're shown that such a polarity is ridiculous. The acting is almost effortlessly authentic and raw. McConaughey and Tye Sheridan are charming in their disregard for charm. Although Sheridan's involvement automatically draws comparisons with Tree of Life, which shares many themes with Mud and it's obviously visually influenced by Mallick and his strong focus on nature. Mud is a film for those who enjoy their tropes warped in front of them, taking something that's become a little trite and giving it the realism treatment, while still retaining a fairy tale quality.",Mud
277,jameslincoln2,A good coming of age story of friendship and love.,7,3 September 2013,"MUD was a perfect film for a relaxed Sunday evening on the sofa, when you don't want an over the top action packed blockbuster. Not that I'm against said blockbusters, I just think there need to be more films with depth and feeling such as this one. It has a great rich story full of brilliant characters and also looks beautiful, it make living on the river look quite idyllic. Starring Matthew McConaughey MUD is a tale of two boys who one day while visiting a nearby island on the river where they live, come across a boat stranded in a tree (from a storm of some kind at some time).  The boat however is currently inhabited by a man named MUD.  The boys strike up a deal with MUD for the boat if they will help him out by contacting his one true love Juniper (Reese Witherspoon). The boys (mainly Ellis –played by Tye Sherridan) soon strike up a friendship with MUD.  Ellis is a very grown up boy with strong values, especially when it comes to love,  this is not helped by his parents diminishing marriage.  Ellis is more than happy to help MUD find Juniper as MUD assures him they love each other. Ellis also has a side line story which sees him pursuing an older girl, which proves successful at first after he punches a senior to defend her honour, Ellis seems to have no problem punching anyone for such a small fella throughout the film.  The boys soon find out that MUD is wanted by both the police and bounty hunters but this does little to discourage them.  Instead they get deeper and deeper involved in Mud's business and carry out ever increasing favours for him. MUD is quite a moody film with lots of tension mainly coming from MUD himself, we are never sure if we should trust MUD or if at any point under that calm cool exterior that McConaughey often has he'll snap. But as it progresses the film becomes rather touching and has lots of hart.  The overall themes (in my opinion) of friendship and love are well placed throughout the film in different characters story's,  pretty much all these stories lead back to Ellis who I think is the star of the film.  The acting between McConaughey and Sherridan is very believable and makes the film what it is.",Mud
278,bytruth,"On the surface, Mud's plot may seem simple, but its symbolism runs deep, and tells a story that won't stop lingering in my mind.",8,18 April 2014,"Caught between childhood and teenage years, two best friends, Ellis and Neckbone, are having to navigate through the murky waters of life that has surprises at every bend. When they arrive their childhood play area - a boat that has gotten stuck in the trees during a storm - they discover an adult is now inhabiting it. Just at a time when they are beginning to recognize their own pre-adult urgings awakening inside them, they discover who is living in their tree house of sort and make friends with him. He becomes a mentor to them just when the murky waters have become too muddy to see clearly, and he tells them how his own life has been shipwrecked because of a love affair that began when he was about their age.The man named Mud had fallen in love with a girl named Juniper when he was a kid and never recovered from the experience. Just as her name implies, she is a bittersweet, prickly creature whose fragrance has gotten into his nostrils and he thinks he can't live without her. On the other hand, she is fickle with love, not appreciating what he has to offer, and only accepting it when it's according to her whims. This mirrors the relationship that Ellis finds himself in with his ""girlfriend,"" May Pearl.Neckbone, on the other hand, has never had anyone love him except for an uncle whose relationships with women are on his terms and usually consist of one night, or to be more exact, one afternoon, stands. On the other hand, his uncle knows how to find the pearls others don't see, and he has found one in the boy he calls Neckbone.Ellis can't help comparing his father's relationship with his mother to his new friend, who will do anything to defend the honor of this woman, even if it means going to jail for the rest of his life, and his father is falling short in his estimation. On one hand, his father is telling him how bad women can be and on the other hand, he has this friend telling him that they are worth everything. This conflicts Ellis, and he finds himself in his own set of conflicts as he defends the girl in his life.Mud's stories are larger than life, and one wonders what is real and what is not. Juniper calls him a liar, but is he really? By the conclusion, one begins to see that Mud's actions are not as murky as they at first seem. In the end, will the river of life lead them to larger horizons where they can grow from their experiences?",Mud

280,FullerPope,"A little safe and sappy, but too competent to ignore...",8,5 May 2013,"Jeff Nichols's ""Mud"" is a very good film. At points, it even achieves something that could be called greatness. It's also nice to have a relatively fresh face on the scene as a writer/director coming up with films of this level of competence. The acting is uniformly solid, especially the child performances, which really steal the show. The story may not be the most clever thing, but boy is it cleverly written. And the film is shot beautifully. Nichols seems equally capable as a visual and literary thinker.My only problem would be what I felt like was inside of the movie, waiting to be released: a punk rock spirit, revealed to us early on with the boy's Fugazi shirt. This movie felt like it was drenched in a pool of soap opera sappiness. It begs the question: how Oprah's book club can we make Cormac McCarthy? It just felt a little ""safe,"" tonally, for a movie with an otherwise seedy premise and edgy set of characters. Can't believe this was rated PG-13. It doesn't bother me at all, it's just noteworthy.

People we know saw it and loved it! which leaves my wife and me with one question....... WHAT THE HELL WERE ALL THESE PEOPLE WATCHING!!??!!To start Matthew McConaughey plays himself.....as usual. Messy hair, Unshaved, grungy and dirty. Yet his white shirt stays impeccably clean throughout the entire flick! His acting was standard for him. We didn't find it exceptionally good or bad. Reese Witherspoon has a very minor role actually, and her scenes are mostly in one motel room. Again, nothing exceptional to report here. The 2 child actors however give superb performances. The story was long, boring, drawn out and horrifically dull. The movie was 2 hours and 10 minutes that really could have been edited to about 1 1/2 hours and not lost anything in the process. Dialogue scenes were drawn out for too long a time creating dull scenes that make your mind wander off. There are a ton of things that are left unanswered......like why the hell Matthew calls himself MUD? There is nothing in this movie that kept my attention and I found myself fighting off falling asleep during the middle.

286,fgould,"Slow, but great story!",8,24 August 2013,"The cast/crew did a great job and the story was very interesting. Although I don't like today's movies that take forever to get to the storyline because of all the artistic b-roll footage and way too long dead air time between lines, I was able to make it to the end.In the beginning, we meet Mud on a deserted island waiting for his girlfriend through two young boys, who are maybe 10 or 11 years old. These two boys venture out to the island because of a rumored old boat stuck up in a tree caused by flooding. The boys go into the boat and find fresh food and shoe prints. So, they know someone is there.When they head back to the boat to depart, Ellis sees the same shoe print around the boat. Regardless of the time, he takes off and follows the footprints going down the shore away from the boat. Then they end.After they turn around, Mud is standing next to the boat fishing, miraculously appearing from nowhere. This is a repeating plot device that makes him appear magical or miraculous. This is where we learn some of his relationship with his girlfriend, Juniper.At this point, the story is about two primary arcs, one on the island and one in Juniper's hotel room. The boys have become the middlemen between the lovers and they visit the island on a regular basis. After Mud reveals why he's running from the law, he also informs the boys that there's a ""mafia"" boss's son that he killed.This was an appealing plot line where Ellis has to decide right versus the wrong things to do. His faith in Mud is strong and at the same time his pugnacious behavior grows stronger. Mud makes a deal with them if they help him get away by rebuilding the boat, Neckbone gets a gun and Ellis gets his mojo. Ellis gets the short end of the deal because he's doing it for love and romantic ideals.This is where I get somewhat confused with the age. The two young men did an outstanding performance. They go through some very difficult actions, like trick bike riding, fist fights, and walking for miles.But what confused me was the age that they portray being interested enough in women to start a fight with a senior schoolmate seemed a stretch. Instead of realizing he's too young for his one truelove, he punches out yet another of the girl's suitors, again his senior. His testosterone must be in over-drive. I can only imagine what he's doing when he's alone.Why this story is so appealing is the setup with an underdog hero who romantically tries to rescue his lover but she has repeatedly deserted him for other men. This last one he killed because her husband beat her so badly she can't have children and he saved her life from the thug by killing him.This is where things get a little messy for the director. We've learned the thugs are watching Juniper so through her they can find and kill Mud; however, Ellis goes to Juniper's hotel room three times and they never catch or follow Ellis, even though they're sitting in the parking lot watching her room. Ellis visits Juniper twice to deliver messages from Mud and returns answers.The other plot line that has trouble is that these two small boys are hauling heavy equipment that two men would have trouble moving. Like the time they steal a 70HP outboard motor from a salvage yard under a small lift in the chain link fence or pulling an old 23-foot boat trailer with the motorbike and then float it behind a small boat. All they needed were some slightly older actors, at least with more muscles, and maybe a car or pickup truck.Regardless, it is a fun story to watch these guys find the parts to fix the boat and save the day, and their escapades along the way. I will say the ending has a tinge of deus ex machina but it's totally setup from the beginning and you're happy it's there when you need it.It's the ""Huckleberry Finn"" on the river coming of age story with corrupt government, misinformation, and firepower. The hero has nowhere to go and his dream is crushed again but he has the fortitude to move into the unknown future.The last issues I have to mention or my evaluation would be incomplete. 1. During a phone conversation between Juniper and Ellis, her hair changes positions while talking on the phone. It was obviously the splicing of two different takes but it's obvious as you watch it in one cut where the phone is over the hair and the other cut it's under the hair. It goes back and forth each cut four times. 2. In rural communities, there are a lot of sheet metals. Instead, these boys end up providing Mud with corrugated galvanized sheets of metal to repair the flat sides of the boat. Besides looking like someone used a circular saw to make a square opening in the boat, for who knows why, Mud used hot tar to fill the gaps in the corrugated sheet metal against the flat boat siding. 3. The boat motor does not work so they have to repair it. Well, there's a small problem with the way they repaired it: Out of the water, on the trailer, and with a battery we never saw. You must have a water supply going into the casing to cool the engine. Mud has a heart in that everyone helps guide Ellis down the right path and not the wrong path. However, it's yet another movie I'd like to edit out 30 minutes to get through the plot quicker.",Mud
287,dannypparker-823-870586,Hidden Gem,10,16 August 2014,"I watched this movie on Netflix a couple nights ago, and was very impressed. I had heard great reviews of this film and ever since watching season 1 of True Detective I've become a huge fan of this ""new"" Matthew McConaughey we've recently been introduced too. He isn't just some muscular guy who always ends up with his shirt off anymore. I think ever since The Lincoln Lawyer came out, Matthew McConaughey has become an excellent actor. He is indeed excellent in Mud. This movie is just so well done. There isn't really much wrong with it at all. The only thing I think that would've made the movie better is if the bad guys were explained, or developed, a little bit more. Personally, I wanted to know a bit more about them and their back story. All we knew was that they were after Mud to get revenge (I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say more than that), but then again, that's essentially all we needed to know. Knowing more about them would've been interesting, but it wouldn't really have affected the plot. So like I said, there really isn't much wrong with this movie at all. All the acting held up, it had an interesting plot, the protagonists were developed very well, and it had a great score by David Wingo. I was very impressed with the young Tye Sheridan's acting in this as well. Bottom line, this movie is a hidden gem and was completely overlooked by The Academy for what reason, I don't know.

Eventually, I was quite impressed by this flick. The first thing I really enjoyed was the pitch-perfect depiction of teenage first love they gave here. Indeed, pretty much like this young boy, I was 14 years old when I had my first 'girlfriend', she was a friend of my sister and she was 18 years old. So, I pretty knew exactly why the guy was feeling and coming through and it was pretty much flawless in my opinion. Sure, you can argue that it was just a detail but that's why this movie was so good, it's because so many details were done right. Indeed, the way the boys were interacting each other, pretty much everything done by Matthew McConaughey who has managed to become one of the most exciting actors during the last 4 years erasing decades of underwhelming work, how Jeff Nichols managed to give this time and place a real genuine feeling, all those details worked so well for me.

296,heartful_lady,"the music didn't help the film, imo",3,2 September 2013,"cinematography is nice. some fine acting by McConaughey. interesting relationships between the various characters - boys, parents and Mud. but even with all this the story was quite thin and uninteresting for me. and the background music didn't help much either. i'm surprised about the number of people who gave the film a high rating. i prefer movies inspired by a true story like the last one i watched, 42. that film was a winner for me, but this one less so. i guess i'm missing something. it may have helped to read reviews of those who liked the film before watching it. then i could have had a sense of what attracted others to the story while viewing it",Mud
297,boonhogenbeck,Movie themes good to me:,9,22 August 2013,"Superstitious Jim and naive Huck hiding out on Jackson Island; Jay Gatsby's delusional, beautiful, and tragic love for a flawed Daisy both come to mind in this touching, fascinating film. The kind of criminal catalyzed comning of age theme of Dickens' Great Expectations comes also to mind. The tough young protagonists of Winter's Bone, just north, and Mud are equallyconceived and performed. Idealism versus realism never fail to provide American literature with a great dialectic, and this film is no exception. The pace and character development require the patience of a literate viewer. The theme of the too frequent disconnect between ideal love and real love is developed proportionally in the troubled marriage, Ellis' disillusionment in his first romantic experience, and in the relationship of Mud and Juniper. Excellent work at all levels. This film moves, like the impossible boat--from absurdly stuck in the sticks to the open waters of the Mississippi and beyond.",Mud
298,mmdetloff,A most Awesome Crew!,10,19 April 2013,"This was an amazing group of people to work with, from Sarah, to Jeff, to Mike. Camilla and the kids with a most amazing Dad, Matt, were a thing a thing of beauty to see. Sam Shepard, who we know from films past, and now have his namesake in the form of an Australian Shepard, is always stunning and at the top of his game. This was very thoughtfully written with rich, bold characters. The placements of the ""boat in the tree"" where well thought and over the top. It was true Arkansas based and many local and distant characters became one and hence ""Mud"" was created. This is a must see film. Jeff's passion and love for all that he creates is evident and clear to see. If you only watch one movie this spring, make it this one. I can easily guarantee that you will fall in love with the characters, who are just as amazing in person!",Mud
299,Jeremyjoshw,Hits the spot,9,3 January 2014,"This film is a must-see.The casting is wonderful, and although McConaughey's and Witherspoon's performances are as one would expect, it was the two boys who were ultimately captivating, the relatively unknown Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland. These boys are authentic as ordinary, tough southern kids living a river-rat life on the Mississippi. Somehow wiser than their years, intense and plucky, they - and especially Sheridan - are the leads supported by McConaughey and Witherspoon; not the other way around.The direction and pacing of this movie is inspired, not slow but providing the viewer time to be in the moment without being labored about it.The sound-scape has crackle, the soundtrack has mood and depth, and the image quenches the thirst of the viewer. A wonderful work.The plot is simple enough (described by others already), but it is the characterization and film values that are what so ably tell this story. A movie that is a pleasure to watch and one that will be remembered.",Mud
300,stevoreilly,The surprising emotional impact.,8,21 August 2013,"Excellent. Simple as, Mud is one of those few films that will stick with you. Every character has a trait that most people will relate to whether it is Mud's (McConaughey) hope in Juniper (Witherspoon) that she will leave with him even though she has strayed so many times, his trust in God and that lucky shirt of his to keep him safe and protected from whatever is out there. Ellis' ( Sheridan) trusting and naive nature that even though Mud has killed he will do what he can to help because he truly believes he's good. This will strike a personal chord with any viewers and prove that no matter how it seems there's always a sense of morality in a person. I was shocked to see that Tye Sheridan could deliver such an excellent performance at such a young age and hopefully his ability to capture audience's attention will continue to do so in years to come.",Mud

Reese Has never played a part like this , that I can think of Anyhow , all and all good stuff period, story Is believable, one thing I noticed , Matt would make a great remake Of ""Cool Hand Luke"" even tho I really don't like remakes!

They didn't behave like water moccasins and looked nothing like them. It was obvious when they threw the brick in the water that the wriggling black things were not snakes. Then when you got a good look at them one could see that they had no ""neck"" -- no differentiation between the head and body. In addition, had they been poisonous snakes the fang marks would have been closer together, or the snake would have had to be as big as a python. Surely, with all the digital manipulation in cinema today, the director could have figured out how to have some semblance of a realistic water moccasin since it was a crucial part of the story.",Mud

A great depiction of reactions that follow choices in a variety of circumstances. The two young boys starring in the film perform remarkably well. The cast is well put together. One of the best things about a movie like this is that it can be watched and enjoyed by an expansive audience ranging from grandpa, nephew or best friend. While it does seem to be particularly favorable to its male viewers, it is something females/ girlfriends would find entertaining additionally. After it comes out on DVD, save yourself the $3 rental fee and purchase the disk. Oscar worthy.",Mud

Well done!! Go see it folks. Nice to see a movie with no special effects.All the actors were very effective and the two teenagers were exceptional and funny! This movie has everything in it. Comedy, fear, suspense, mystery, drama, action, love, pain, truth and realism all wrapped up into a well played out story. It never once was boring and the way McConaghey's character was committed to his girl is something we've all felt at least one time in our lives. What he would do for her despite the circumstances is very compelling. Witherspoon also did an excellent job of playing her character and yes we've all known or have known of characters like this in our lives! You can't help but feel for McConaghey and Witherspoon's situation. It was also entertaining to see how the two boys carried out their plans to help out in the way that only teenagers can get away with. OK well that's all I have to write about this movie without giving away all of it's charm. Again go see it, you'll be glad you did.",Mud
306,hdbooth,"Touching, accurate portrayal of Mississippi River life",10,15 June 2013,"I grew up in Memphis and spent many weekends boating on the Mississippi River. It brought back memories to see the island with river birches, mudflats, and cottonmouths (although I don't think they're usually that black). We spent time on the Tennessee River too, visiting a friend's boathouse (not a houseboat) and a cabin. I felt a lot of sympathy for Ellis at being sad about moving away.This movie, unlike most Southern movies, got everything right. The accents, the personalities, the dialogue. I thought the teenage boys did an amazing job. I just taught a camp with some boys who looked and talked just like Neckbone. I loved how they communicated with expressions and few words. Their friendship was touching.The director captured something subtle in Mud's interactions with Ellis. Although Juniper and Mud himself said he lied, it seems to me he pretty much told the truth. Ellis had a lot of heart. The movie made you care deeply about these people. And it took you to a different place where things seem, somehow, more real. This was a wonderful movie.",Mud
307,gmullaley8-727-221085,Disappointing,4,2 July 2013,"All that fine talent was squandered in a movie that went on way too long. Writers and directors must be running out of ideas, at least good ones. This movie was more like a ""mystery stew"" than some more recognizable and palatable fare. But any high school kid worth his or her salt could see that this was nothing more than a half-hearted attempt to try and make a modern, and more gritty, version of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Also thrown in for good measure was a pinch of Romeo and Juliet, and a dollop of Sam Peckinpah. Jacob Lofland and Tye Sheridan WERE Huckelberry Finn and Tom Sawyer. Those two young men were the only bright spots in the whole movie and deserve credit for saving what was left of this unsavory soup. What we got in the end wasn't fit for human consumption.",Mud
308,fletcher_mark,This year's Great American Movie?,8,12 July 2013,"A serious contender for this year's Great American Film, Jeff Nicholls' lyrical, poetic third feature evokes a timeless quality all-too-rare in today's cinematic landscape.Nicholls has quietly positioned himself among the most visionary and essential directors at work today with his striking 2007 debut Shotgun Stories and his belated follow-up, the disturbing and astonishing Take Shelter (2011).In both Shotgun Stories and Take Shelter, their leading characters (played each time by the mesmeric Michael Shannon) are driven by an almost insane conviction. That same dogmatic approach is adopted by Mud (Matthew McConaughey), the charismatic fugitive living out on a small island in the Mississippi River who befriends inquisitive teenagers Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland). Mud has risked his freedom by returning to the area in which he grew up to be reunited with his true love Juniper (Reese Witherspoon), but a group of killers arrive in town looking to avenge a past crime by Mud.Nicholls has been quick to acknowledge the debt the film owes to Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in the overtly Finn/Tom Sawyer relationship between Ellis, who lives on a river boat with his squabbling parents (played by the excellent Ray McKinnon and Sarah Paulson) and Neckbone.The 14-year-old Ellis is an idealist who's obsessed with reuniting Mud and Juniper because he believes in the power of love. As young teenagers, the concept of true love can be all-encompassing and Ellis acts with such doggedness in order to counterbalance the failing relationship of his parents. Likewise, he gets a tough lesson in the ways of love courtesy of an older girl he falls for.Mud brings to mind Terence Malick in its penchant for the Magic Hour (and its fascination with nature) and Nicholls with long-time director of photography Adam Stone captures a string of breathtaking shots. The relationship with Malick doesn't end there; Mud's producer Sarah Green worked on The Tree of Life, while Sheridan was given his debut in that film.He only has a limited filmography, but Sheridan is already showing himself as a young actor with a lot of promise. It's a demanding role and he brings a lot of maturity to it. All he wants is for people to be happy and for things to be in order, so you can feel his pain when he realises life is much harder to get a handle on.Maintaining his remarkable career renaissance (aka, his McConaisance), McConaughey is a revelation in the title role. Once the butt of many a joke for his languid, cheque-grabbing performances in duds like Failure to Launch, McConaughey of late has returned to the high watermark he achieved in the likes of Dazed and Confused and Lone Star. Lovelorn, scared, but determined also, his Mud is not so very different from Ellis.The excellent supporting cast includes Shannon as Neckbone's placid Uncle Galen (as far removed from Take Shelter's Curtis LaForche as you can get) and the impeccable Sam Shepard as Tom, who may or may not be a former CIA agent living off the grid in the Mississippi swamps.Just as Malick managed to capture the coming of age adventure of adolescence in The Tree of Life, so too does Nicholls here. When we see a boat stuck up a tree (Mud's temporary home), we marvel instead of questioning the unlikelihood of what we're watching; such is the power of Nicholls' persuasive vision.The slightly fumbled ending doesn't detract from what is a work of true poetry from Nicholls. Much like last year's Beasts of the Southern Wild, Mud is a real one-off that will stay with you for a long time after.",Mud
309,jwelsh27,Refreshing,9,8 August 2013,"I enjoyed this movie for many reasons. First I felt like this movie had a much different vibe than any movie I've seen in a while - No cheap tricks or over the top dialogue, and the story was unique.Something else that struck me is that I wanted to see the movie immediately based on the trailer but I don't recall anything interesting or memorable about it, but that does not apply to the movie itself. This movie will stick with me for a while because the characters felt so real - they are wounded and real.I also love the way the movie handles the topic of loyalty and other deep human emotions.Lastly, with almost every movie I see there are loose ends or things that didn't seem to belong in the movie and I can things of a single case in Mud. Really well done with solid acting.",Mud
310,Linkin_Park_im,Must Watch Movie,9,14 August 2013,"I had not heard or read anything about it.It is one of the best movies I have seen ever. A perfect 10 writing, story,scenic locale,casting, acting, director, script, cast. A great combination of Mark Twain, the big river, the fishing life of the people, their hardscrabble working life, the awful houses they live in. The violence was kept to a minimum as was the language. The two child actors were superb beyond belief.Every one in this movie seemed real and as natural as life itself. The performance by Mathew M in the lead earns him an automatic Oscar nomination. The depth, understanding and empathy he brought was awesome to behold.",Mud

The directing is refreshing and unique. What more is there to say? This is a movie that does not grace the silver screen often enough. It is what a movie should be, a work of art as opposed to a product. Do not be swayed by negative reviews, it moves at a perfect pace and does not waste a scene. It ends in the way it should, and yet is still open for discussion, but perhaps not in the spoon-fed way the modern moviegoer would expect. This is a movie that is not about what it is about, that doesn't want to make you predict what will happen next because you are too enthralled with what is happening in the moment. Expect Mud to waltz along the red carpet at the Oscars in March, and it shall do so deservedly. One of the 10 best films of the past 15 years and I say that earnestly. If you haven't had the chance to watch, put it at the top of your list.",Mud

313,hontanxpierre,Jeff Nichols is great!,9,4 January 2015,"2 boys live in the middle of a swamp nearby the Mississippi river. Life is harsh. One day they meet a strange dirty stranger on a island they like to visit sometimes: he likes to be called Mud... Jeff Nichols is great. If you can remember his first 2 films (Shotgun Stories and Take Shelter) he is digging an impressive furrow on the US cinema. The pictures of the swamps looks profound and cumbersome and the description of the southern family of one of the boys sounds touchingly real. Using appropriate music and a specific low rhythm to reinforce the emotion he is one the current most promising director in the world of cinema. And his film ""Mud"" is one of the brilliant example of his talent... Don't miss it!",Mud
314,MovieGuru68,A Thrilling Coming-of-Age,8,15 November 2014,"Unlike most coming-of-age films, 'Mud' is filled with thrilling moments where lives are at stake and death is imminent; these intertwining genres are what make 'Mud' such a spectacularly unique film. The character development found within 'Mud' is perhaps the most unique and powerful element of the film, making it truly a wonder to watch. Overall, 'Mud' is a great movie about Mud's impact on Ellis' coming-of-age that I highly recommend.Obviously, the performances are what really shine through in 'Mud' as they play an extremely large role in the character development. They are undeniably gripping, from the top billing actors of Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon to the younger stars of Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland, and even to Sam Shepard, who's role was comparably smaller but brought to life no less believably. Each of these actors and many more had a way of drawing me into the story, making me truly care about each and every one of their futures.The cinematography in 'Mud' is remarkably eye-catching as well. The unique setting was really showcased properly and brought to life through the vivid cinematography, making it one of my favorite elements of the film.After all is filmed and edited, Jeff Nichols' directorial vision shines through this film in a near indescribable fashion. He finds a way of making everything come together as one coherent film, blowing me away right from the start.",Mud
315,tkearl15,Loved this movie!,9,28 December 2014,"I bought this DVD for my husband for Christmas and we watched it last night. It kept our attention the whole time; you didn't know what was going to happen next. The two boys (Ellis & Neckbone) did an awesome job, as well as Matthew M., Reece W. & all the others. All of the characters were perfectly chosen. I do wish there would have been more detail in the end of the moving in showing how Mud was rescued, where Ellis' dad moved to & where did Juniper go at the end. I was also a little confused at the time era of the movie. The people that lived on the river made it seem nostalgic, but then at the end, the apartments that Ellis and his mother moved to was very modern. Overall, we enjoyed the movie very much!",Mud

317,Bangerang09,A great American film. 10/10,10,7 January 2016,"Very rarely does a film come along that enthralls from start to finish quite like ""Mud"". Director Jeff Nichols masterfully constructs a Tom Sawyer-like adventure story set on the Mississippi River with beautiful imagery and fascinating characters. Ty Sheridan is especially good as Ellis, the young protagonist of the film, while Matthew McConaughey continues his career renaissance as the title character. The film begins as a mystery-thriller and develops into a poignant coming-of- age story about family and relationships as seen through the eyes of a young teenager. It's pretty long and may be a little slow for the casual observer, but film lovers everywhere won't be able to look away. After the wonderfully compelling ""Take Shelter"" in 2011 and now with this offering, Nichols has solidified his status as one of the brightest up-and-coming directors in the industry. His films are personal, gorgeously photographed and each one has an incredible sense of place. ""Mud"" is his best so far and it is absolutely a great American film.",Mud
