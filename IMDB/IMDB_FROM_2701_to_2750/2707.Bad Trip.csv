0,nogodnomasters,That's just a staple gun,3,1 May 2020,"Two guys travel to NYC in a car owned by one's sister. She breaks out of jail and wants her car.Not as good as Bad Grandpa. I had a hard time believing the people didn't know this was a set up with camera shots from multiple angles. Supposedly all these cameras were pre hidden etc. but they looked professional with pan and zoom and great sound. Redneck bar scene made me chuckle, but most of the film just seemed like it was made for stupid people.Guide: F-word. Male nudity. No sex.",Bad Trip
1,kosmasp,Jackass(es) but with a story,6,16 April 2021,"Usually I do not read anything about things I'm about to watch. In this case it was an interview on a late night show that gave away the USP of this one. They made a movie that was based around many people not knowing what was happening ... like Jackass and hidden camera mixed together. Now for some this is probably genius ... for others just plain ... annoying and lacking of any quality.You can guess who knows what's up and who is not into the gag ... if you can call it gag. I personally am on the fence. I liked a few moments, but am not a fan of the whole concept overall ... even if they did quite a good job overall. The ending then almost destroys it all .. before it almost makes it a masterpiece! The ""White Girl"" thing feels ... just wrong. But the added ""Party up"" by DMX? Whoooo .... it almost made me lose my mind! Rip DMX of course - but a great way to close out a movie - any movie! And during the credits you'll also be able to see the people involved and how they reacted finding out that it was all a movie ... you may be looking over your shoulder every day from now on ... ;)",Bad Trip
2,Edvis-1997,8,8,30 March 2021,"Wow, that was really good movie. I can't understand why it's so underrated tho. It deserves at least to have 7/10. Acting was on point, it reminded me of Borat, Bad Grandpa and Jackass movies. I can't remember when last time I laughed so many times. Those awkwards moments made this film even better. For me, it's the best comedy of 2020, hands down.",Bad Trip
3,The-Sarkologist,Pretty Shocking,7,2 May 2021,"This is basically one of those shock movies, and it is a lot like Borat, except that it is less political, and a lot more extreme. I was going to suggest that the shock parts were worse, but Borat can be pretty shocking at times as well. I was also going to suggest that this film has a story as well, but so does Borat, so I guess the films are quite similar. However, as I suggested, Borat is designed to open our eyes to what the real United States looks like, whereas Bad Trip is really just designed for a few laughs, more so with the people that are in the film as opposed to the audience.Yeah, when I take about shock value, we have scenes where the protagonist accidentally puts his hand in a blender, and of course blood spews out everywhere. There is also the scene where he decides to go and get a selfie with a gorilla, and I won't say anything more about that, but the thing is that the people that are in the scene don't realise that this is all fake, so in a way the humour is more the reactions of the people in the scene than anything else.The story, for want of a better word, has the protagonist meet a high school sweetheart (well not quite because I suspect the attraction was all one way) and then goes on a road trip from Florida to New York to meet up with her. As with pretty much every road trip film, they had adventures along the way. The other thing is that the car that they take doesn't belong to them, but rather to the sister of the other protagonist, and his sister has just escaped from gaol and is basically on the warpath. This certainly does lead to quite some interesting scenes.I have to admit that the pranks that they played were pretty good, and pretty elaborate as well. Some of them I actually wonder how they got away with, such as driving a police car, that has obviously been stolen, down the freeway with the door missing (I suspect that it isn't a real police car). There are others, but this is certainly not a film for the easily offended. Still, it's actually pretty good, and as I mentioned, the pranks that they play are quite ingenious. Personally, I'm not saying anymore because - shock value.",Bad Trip
4,Thanos_Alfie,Funny pranks...,5,26 October 2021,"""Bad Trip"" is a Comedy movie in which we watch one friend helping the other to go to New York City in order to tell a woman that she is the love of his life. Along their way they get into some crazy stories and many real pranks follow.I have to admit that I laughed a lot with this movie since it was full of hilarious pranks and some great audience reactions. The direction which was made by Kitao Sakurai was good and the hidden cameras presented a nice result with plenty of funny moments. The interpretations of both Eric André who played as Chris Carey and Lil Rel Howery who played as Bud Malone we re very good and their combination was simply amazing. Another interpretation that have to be mentioned was Tiffany Haddish's who played as Trina Malone and she did an excellent job. All in all, I have to say that ""Bad Trip"" is a nice, funny movie and I recommend you to watch because I am sure that you will laugh a lot.",Bad Trip
5,cruise01,Eric Andre going all out trying to get the worst reactions with a live crowd.,6,30 March 2021,3 out of 5 stars.Bad Trip is a comedy buddy film about Eric Andre and Lil Rey going on a road trip. Stealing a car that belongs to Tiffany Haddish who escaped prison and is after the two guys.What worked?The film does have a fair share of laughs and dirty humor. Eric Andre trying to be the next Sasha Baron Cohen. From many scenarios of Eric having his clothes sucked off from a powerful car vaccuum. Or busting out into a musical at a shopping mall. Or just making a fool of themselves with dumb humor.The cast was entertaining.What i did not like ? Some of the humor gets boring and old really fast. Especially the potty humor which has been overused with Johnny Knoxvilles Jackass or Bad Grandpa.And the films pacing gets boring in the third act which the humor is few in between.,Bad Trip
6,eddie_baggins,A mix of Jackass and Borat makes for a laugh-filled ride,6,31 March 2021,"Make no mistake, Bad Trip is not highbrow cinematic entertainment.What it is, is a film very much at home at what it is and what type of experience it wants to provide and in that sense, Eric Andre's first big feature length experiment works some wonders to become a film that you can't help but laugh along with.Famed for his work on cult TV show The Eric Andre Show and significant amount of pranks that fall into its repertoire, Andre and his off-sider Lil Rel Howery mix a dosage of real life set-ups around a very generic road trip buddy comedy/romance as they and game star Tiffany Haddish create a series of situations that are far from PC but never the less highly hysterical should you care to throw your inhibitions out the window.As Andre's no-hoper Chris and Howery as his best/only friend Bud set off to New York to find the girl of Chris's dreams, all the while being pursued by Haddish's criminal sister of Bud, they and director Kitao Sakurai are able to throw a number of extremely awkward scenarios in front of the pair that often involves the participation of unsuspecting everyday citizens.From run ins with zoo animals, mall singalongs, smoothie shop mishaps and even daring prison escapes, Bad Trip is filled with some fairly inventive set-ups that allow its comically gifted cast members time to shine as they play off the situations that evolve around them to deliver some real nuggets of gold.Not since the heyday of Jackass has comedy of this kind worked so well on the big screen, no doubt helped by the fact Jackass head honcho Jeff Tremaine was on board here as producer and on-set guide, and while the comedy is most certainly not for everyone and audience members should know if this is there style by now, for those that want this form of comedic entertainment, Bad Trip is a trip they'll want to be taking.It's a testament to the set-ups and how well they strike a good balance that there are able to overcome the extremely weak story that ties it all together, can Andre and his cronies work harder next time at managing to create a better strand at their antics core, they'll likely create a genuine masterpiece of pranks and crazily designed set-ups.Final Say -For acquired tastes no doubt, fans of Andre will be pleased to know the feature space has done nothing to dampen his wild spirit with Bad Trip a crazy 80 minutes of solid material, proving to be more entertaining than most straight up narrative comedies released at present.3 blenders out of 5.",Bad Trip
7,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Bad Trip,3,30 March 2021,3/10 - this unbelievable Borat knockoff is frustrating (can we give Tiffany Haddish a role that isn't so stereotypical and tired?!) and remarkably unfunny (especially given the cast involved),Bad Trip
8,kwenchow,"A bit dumb at the beginning, but surprisingly hilarious and touching all the way! Should watch it!",6,16 September 2020,"This film start with a man ""Chris"" undress by the vacuum cleaner, and a woman ""Trina"" steal her brother ""Bud"" money while he is working scene! As turnout, this film is about a series of hilarious event occur on the trip of Chris and Bud to New York, while chasing by Trina! Entire film full of quite laughable scene! Make the film quite watchable! Laughable scene! Such as, Chris dreaming he dating with Maria, Maria beating the man hitting on her! Chris dreaming he marry with Maria, the priest kissing Chris! A gorilla raping Chris at the zoo! The gorilla spray it's semen at Chris! Chris and Bud's private part stick together, Chris separate their private part with a chopstick at the Chinese restaurant! Chris and Bud having car accident, while Chris rush to see Maria! Maria's gallery guard surprisingly letting Chris inside the gallery, after Chris silly persuasion! Chris want to start a new life with Maria, but Maria refuse to accept! Trina ram into Maria's gallery and beating Chris! Bud thought Trina want to fight with him, but she praise him instead! Chris telling Maria he finally found his soulmate, Maria madly shouted him get out! Chris apologize to Bud on the bus, also quite touching to watch! At the end, Chris and Bud disguise as women, Trina disguise as a man at the dance gala! Still have a series of bloopers scene along with the end credit! That's it!

9,dar0417,Another Jackass Film,5,10 June 2020,Some over the top moments where you will laugh out loud but with the Jackass style and having a story it just did not flow right.,Bad Trip
10,drystyx,Professional can be annoying,5,26 May 2021,"This ""candid camera"" meets ""modernism"" comedy is actually professionally done. The dialog is state of the art, so to speak, the actors exceptionally good, but ""professional"" is ""annoying"" when it is too meticulous.This works on an annoying level. This does sound like the way real people speak, and therein is the problem. Real people can be too annoying if dialog is totally ""off the cuff"" style.I have a friend who really enjoys this, but I think she is in the minority.I do respect the makers of this movie, because they are very professional. But everything is too much ""by the book"" in terms of modern reverence to on the street dialog. Most people hear ""on the street dialog"" way too much. It's like the movies during the seventies when car chases replaced horse posse chases. Most people see too many cars to be entertained by car chases, unless they live far away from roads and cars. It bores most people.That said, I do compliment the actors who gave it their all. A person in a gorilla suit was incredible. Wear a gorilla suit and find out yourself. You can't see in one, you can't breath in one, and you burn to death in one. How this person did stunts so well in that costume deserves applause. The other actors were also exceptional. I feel this was a waste of their talents. And I hate to belittle the script, because it was written the way we're taught to write today, professional and true to street dialog, but that was just too annoying. Sorry. This puts the movie somewhere in the middle for me.",Bad Trip
11,masonsaul,Great hidden camera comedy,8,17 April 2021,"Bad Trip is a great hidden camera comedy that's consistently funny with plenty of good sketches and has one of the better plots for its genre, even if it's not as good as the best hidden camera comedies. Eric André, Lil Rel Howery and Tiffany Haddish are all perfect. Kitao Sakurai's direction is fantastic and it's extremely well filmed. It's also really well paced, with no sketch dragging or going on for too long. The soundtrack is really good.",Bad Trip

13,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Humor for the intellectually challenged,2,28 March 2021,"Some of it was genuinely funny. But most of it was stupid. I suppose this movie will appeal to certain people who like Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) comedies. Perhaps the only genuine thing about this movie are SOME of the reaction shots, the rest are fake and forced.This video is more appropriate for Youtube than a for-pay streaming platform.",Bad Trip
14,Movi3DO,Funny Trip,8,24 April 2021,"One of the funniest movies I have watched this year. The unique aspect was that the crew acted the plot in public, so the non-actor people around had no idea they were being filmed, and their reactions were the essence of the comedy.I don't watch Eric Andre a lot, but I knew he definitely could pull these pranks off and get the reactions from people. He and Lil Rel Howery were very hilarious. Tiffany Haddish was also fun as a gangster sister, but her scenes weren't as funny as Andre's scenes.The pranks became crazier as the movie progressed, and I loved the creativity of these pranks. Many of them were unexpected.As for problems, the general plot was pretty meh, and the movie somehow felt long despite its short runtime.Overall, I was able to laugh my ass off multiple times, so I dig this 100%. 8/10.",Bad Trip

18,ronakkotian,One of the better hidden camera prank films I've seen,7,14 May 2021,"I find Eric André to be a very funny guy so I was eagerly waiting for Bad Trip and I have to say this is one of the better hidden camera prank films.Bad Trip is about two friends, Chris and Bud, who take a road trip from Florida to New York City so Chris can declare his love for his high school crush, Maria. However, the two are also being pursued by Bud's sister Trina for stealing her car.I was excited for this film but a part of me was a bit anxious as to how it would play out. Hidden camera prank films are not easy to pull off but Bad Trip was well made. What I really liked about this film was how it didn't waste time to get from one prank to another. The film took as many opportunities as possible to set up elaborate pranks along the way and that's what kept the fun going. The pranks themselves were very funny with some being very shocking. The gross-out humour worked well and all the actors did a great job of making each prank convincing. Eric André is a great performer and does a fantastic job. I was worried about Tiffany Haddish but she was one of the best parts of her film. She played her role extremely well and it was funny to see people's reactions to her character. Lil Rel Howery doesn't have as much to do compared to André and Haddish but was good nonetheless.What Bad Trip also does well is the way it interweaves the pranks into the story. The pranks weren't just there for the laughs as they also contributed to moving the story along and making use of all the locations. Not only were the pranks fun but the film was also a great study into seeing how the public would respond to the situations these three actors put themselves in.Bad Trip was a good time. It's certainly not at the level of something like Borat which is far more comedic, intelligent and unpredictable but it's definitely one of the better hidden camera prank films I've seen.",Bad Trip
19,sweidman-28016,Hilarious,7,15 April 2021,"""We got four whole days we can kick back, relax, and breathe in Americans.""This mix of a scripted buddy comedy road movie and a real hidden camera prank show follows the outrageous misadventures of two buds stuck in a rut who embark on a cross-country road trip to NYC. The storyline sets up shocking real pranks. I knew absolutely nothing about Bad Trip so within the first few minutes I was surprised to find out what the movie actually entailed. For a moment I thought this would basically be a prolonged episode of Impractical Jokers, which they actually did a movie for last year. For what it's worth, Bad Trip delivered in what it wanted to accomplish. This is a really funny movie. The storyline is very cliche for a reason, but it makes most of it. Once the one musical number comes in, it's evident this isn't taking itself seriously. Obviously, the most interesting parts came from pranks. They really went all out. Ranging from stupid humor to as raunchy as they come. Honestly I don't know how they got away with a few. Fun tip: read about the process of these after watching because there are some good stories here. What amazes me (and this has nothing to do with the movie) is how people actually believed some of these. Common sense was lacking in some individuals. But that only added to the fun.The actors did a good job with being discrete while shooting. I would consider them to be fairly well known actors/comedians so good for them being able to blend in as well as they did. In particular, Tiffany Haddish has a bigger transformation and it makes more sense for her not to be recognized as easily. Anyway, they're hilarious. I had a few issues when it came to the main story. I can't criticize it too much for being stupid. However, they're are a couple spots that really had no thought put in. The ending felt more like an easy way out than anything. And the pacing didn't always work. When you're working with moments that are supposed to be larger than normal and you return to the smaller stuff, it doesn't always feel like it was a smooth as it could be. Again, it's hard to do with what they had planned. Overall I did have an enjoyable time watching Bad Trip. It did what it needed to and it got me to laugh numerous times. I'd caution those who aren't keen to extremely raunchy comedy, but for those who like it this should be something you'd like.",Bad Trip
20,donaldricco,much funnier than expected!,7,23 May 2021,"Pretty dang funny - much funnier than I thought it would be! Between the gorilla, the Chinese finger trap, and the white chicks thread, I was laughing pretty regularly! And even though she wasn't in it much, Tiffany Haddish was her usual hilarious self!

22,mdm-11,"Endless series of absurd ""hidden camera"" gags",3,19 May 2021,"Another take on the loser-boy in love with a winner-girl story line makes no effort at credibility, but instead tries to overwhelm with visual gags that are all of the grotesque and outrageous type. For a feature length movie, this formula wears thin fast.For fans of the most basic ""college humor"" genre, the so-called-story starts off with the obligatory slap-stick belly laugh (car wash worker gets his uniform swallowed up by a vacuum hose). That may be an indicator of what to expect from here on, but somehow the creators of this never-ending Candid Camera marathon insist on building this pile of insane situations faster and higher than the human eye (or mind) could imagine. At what point does this become a Classic Warner Brothers cartoon?The character of the insane jail-bird sister stands out, but still this ain't no ""Ferris Bueller"". Do yourself a favor and skip this one!",Bad Trip
23,youngcollind,Silly reality comedy gets the yuks in,8,6 May 2021,"Eric Andre's mainstream crossover moment is a comedy success. Much like the once adored Tom Green, Andre is an irreverent fringe comedian who's show focuses on over the top anti-comedy, which can be a tricky thing to adapt to the silver screen. Where Green once failed with Freddy Got Fingered, which somehow managed to be both watered down and uncomfortably gross simultaneously, Andre manages to find the winning ingredient: Borat style hidden camera pranks that make the reactions the joke. Left on their own, the humour would be too low brow to hold any weight (ei: he's getting plowed by a gorilla, eye roll) but the reactions really sell it (ei: she thinks he's getting plowed by a gorilla, haha). Eric Andre is having his moment as a comedy king, and we should all enjoy it before the joke gets stale.",Bad Trip

33,stefstars,Better Than Nomadland,6,7 April 2021,"Why am I comparing it to Nomadland ? Because it's basically the same format, except this film succeeds at it because it didn't have to be pretentious. I love Eric André, so naturally when I saw a new project of his on Netflix, I just had to watch. The pranks are hilarious and the reactions they got out of the innocent bystanders was perfect. The story was a little weak, it's a guy who's had this long lasting crush on a girl since high school, he learns she lives in New York and takes her giving him her business card as an invitation. This sets up the road trip where a bunch of shenanigans ensue. It reminded me a lot of the comedy films from the
late 90s and early 00's, a lot like what the group from Jacka$$ would get up to. Tiffany Haddish was great, she was hilarious as the thug sister trying to track Eric and his friend down. The friend, played by Lil Rey Howery, was pretty funny too - provided the dry humor to Eric and Tiffany's insanity. This is a success story of mixing actors with real people, just working with the ridiculousness of that rather than trying to create some hipster wet dream like Nomadland tried to do. It's not an Oscar sweeping production but it certainly is fantastic for what it is, a comedy. I'd give it more stars if the story was a bit stronger, but the story seemed to get in the way of the funny moments; story came off as an afterthought throughout the film. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it. It's funny and it's entertaining. I highly recommend it, this is miles better than Nomadland, trust me.",Bad Trip
34,Harry_Gleeson,Really enjoyed it,7,28 March 2021,"Overall, Bad Trip was an enjoyable and unique comedy. Very similar to the Jackass and Borat films, which are films I like. The prank, hidden camera comedies are different and this is really fun. It's a blast. The chemistry between Eric Andre and Lil Rey Howrey is great to watch and Tiffany Haddish's role was fine too. Yes the film has it's flaws is nowhere near perfect, but it's not going for that. It's a fun watch which I'd certainly recommend.Quote - 'Thank you for being a friend' - BudRating - 3/5.",Bad Trip

Some of the pranks are gutwrenchingly hilarious, while others drift a bit more.

54,JoelAlexanderr,Grossly unfunny and immature throughout,3,30 March 2021,"BAD TRIP is a blend of Borat and Impractical Jokers that succeeds at almost nothing that makes both of those projects so wonderful. Almost every single gag involved sex, poop or some other immature topic, and by the end of the film I felt like I was watching something made for middle school boys who think that pulling on girls' bra straps is the peak of comedy.Eric Andre isn't hilarious enough on his own to carry the plot of this movie, so he relies on these ludicrous and pre-planned pranks that do all the work for him. However, the movie is at its funniest when the pranks are simple and revolve around human interaction rather than some insane manufactured problem. This is what Impractical Jokers and Borat understand -- the humanity of each situation is what makes them hilarious, not the ridiculous scenarios involving nudity or violence. One scene involving a gorilla is one of the most aggressively unfunny sequences I've seen since the last Adam Sandler movie, which is saying quite a lot.I do think the movie had its moments of hilarity, most of which involved Tiffany Haddish during the first half. One scene involving Andre and Haddish near-missing each other in a bar while looking for each other was particularly funny because both actors realized that the people reacting to the situation was the funny part. Unfortunately, the good parts are drowned out by gags that fall flat on their face, which makes this comedy a tough one to sit through. C-",Bad Trip

Thankfully this movie absolutely delivers, it's hilarious and fast paced. Eric and Lil Rel are great together, especially Eric Andre, this man is a legend.

There wasn't one moment that felt dull. This movie is absolutely hilarious which is what you want from a comedy.The Bad- Not every joke landed, not every prank landed but it is very hard for that to happen these days with comedy.Overall Thoughts- Bad Trip is absolutely hilarious and accomplishes everything it aims for. Overall I'm going to give 'Bad Trip' a 8/10 and I had a lot more fun with this than I thought I would initially.",Bad Trip

Eric Andre is so much funnier than this film. Every single plot beat is recycled. A few funny moments but so unimaginative and unoriginal from such an imaginative and original comedian. Very disappointed. Borat, Bruno, bad grandpa, that awful between two ferns movie that nobody saw, all the exact same plot. Road trip buddy movie searching for that obscure object of desire.

66,ian-dodkins,Ground breaking but can't be repeated,8,24 July 2021,"So, this is unlike anything you have seen before. If you know Candid Camera, where the public reaction is filmed when weird of funny events happen, this is the basis of the scenes in this film. The reason I gave it an 8 is that it is tied together in a simple but compelling story that is funny and clever. Acting is top notch, particularly given they are acting with an unpredictable public. I expect this took alot of work to do well and the same scene with many different groups of people. This should win an Oscar for originality, for making it into a film, but unfortunately if it was repeated in another film it would get very tired.The gorilla scene is priceless. Yep, humour a little coarse in places (not for young kids) but some beautiful scenes too (friendship scene on bus). Very American, but the three leads here are just fabulous in what they've done.Fun, clever, light hearted humour with basic story.",Bad Trip
67,tylerkom,One of the best movies of its genre,7,1 April 2021,"Bad trip knows exactly what it is and does its job at a very high level. It keeps itself very light, with all pranks met up meticulously well. It never overstayed its welcome and leans heavily into the shock comedy that got Eric Andre famous in the first place.The best part of the film is what it does not do. It doesn't take itself very seriously, and it does not take away from the pranks by going down an odd and unneeded plotline (see: Borat).Some pranks are better than others and some points seemed a bit strained for ideas, however it's a very good film as a whole.Truly one of the best in the loosely-tied-together-prank genre.",Bad Trip

Maybe Adam Sandler is more your speed(jk). Seriously, that would be like me voluntarily watching a Sex and the City movie and then giving it a bad rating because its about spoiled entitled women dating and chatting. Not my type of movie.IMO funnier than Bad Grampa, which is probably the closest equivalent. Not only that, unlike Borat (which I love) it actually makes the non actors look like genuinely good and caring people. So even with all the gross out humor, it has heart.And obviously if you love the show, you'll love this. It's a little less bonkers because it follows a plot, but hilarious nonetheless.",Bad Trip

And the whole setup is just blind, stupid entertainment. Everybody knows the whole thing is stupid and vulgar, but it's about going along with stupidity and absurdity of all this. We can laugh hard knowing that the whole thing is stupid fun. It's not about the best joke line or the best prank, it's the whole setup!Any valid criticism would be how they managed to pull off without getting recognised. Even one person recognising and raising their voice can kill the whole shot.Also comparison with Bruno, Borat is not reasonable as they had social messages at underplay with a specific topic. Here it's just about entertainment only, nothing to reveal about the people or society.I am believing the whole thing is real. Hidden camera shoots + pre shot scenes of the actors.The actors have all done a great job.

It was refreshing to see real, genuine expressions from common people, which is rarely seen nowadays in mainstream movies. Stylistically the film was refreshing for the first 20 minutes, then it's steam kind of ran out, what the rest of the film would be was very predictable. It was fun for the first 20 minutes or so, but after that it became a drag, for those who have watched 'Harold and Kumar' it would feel even worse, because they have already seen the almost same thing before. Anyway, there is no complaint about the acting, and the pranks were executed deftly, but apart from that there is nothing much to talk about this film.",Bad Trip
129,Pel_tier,"Staged, not funny",1,3 May 2021,"Come on people, don't be fooled into thinking this was improv. Like it wasn't obvious that the gorilla was not real. Regardless, it's just not very funny. The friend that recommended it to me said it was a unique concept that's never been done. I reminded him of Borat and he said this was funnier. He's no longer my friend.",Bad Trip

131,poweroftheshoyru,It's not Borat,8,28 March 2021,"I see a lot of people calling this Eric Andre's version of Borat, but while Bad Trip and Borat share a similar plot and prank elements, the similarities end there.Sacha Baron Cohen is a brilliant character actor, while Eric Andre is well, not so brilliant. He probably knows this, which is why the main characters of Bad Trip are the ""unwitting cast members"". (Tiffany Haddish does get a shoutout for brilliant acting though)While Borat unfortunately showed a lot of the negative side of people, Bad Trip's intention was clear: to show the humanity in everyone and for everyone to have a good time. And in my opinion, that's one of the reasons why this movie, if you can call it that, is plenty entertaining and great.And no, Bad Trip is nothing like the Eric Andre show either. The Adult Swim series has a clear brand of nihilistic/absurdist humour, but Bad Trip has an actual plot (albeit a terrible one), and is mostly about seeing the reactions of the unwitting public. You also get to see behind the scenes footage during the credits which is always a pleasure.Definitely worth a watch. Giving this 1 star makes zero sense to me.",Bad Trip

136,axlerod88,Sacha Baron Cohen would approve of this,7,20 April 2020,"If you are a big fan of Borat then the endless, gross, staged pranks will really appeal to those that appreciate that type of humor. This movie is in the same vein as Borat, a buddy road trip movie. Our protagonist sees his childhood crush one day while at work but his own stupidity gets in the way. He laments his missed chance & when the opportunity for them to reconnect again presents itself, no matter the obstacle, he finds a way to make this happen with his best friend in tow.Just like Borat, all the main characters in the movie play it straight while hoisting the gags on an unsuspecting public & I was quite impressed with how far they really pushed the envelope while staying in character. The story line is a tried & true one but because all the jokes were so over the top & outrageous that I couldn't help but laugh all the way to the end. If you like your jokes crude. fast & vulgar then this won't disappoint.",Bad Trip

139,accerules,It made me laugh!,7,2 April 2021,"Is Bad Trip a good movie? Not really. Did I laugh, yes on mutiple occasions! Basically this movie is a series of sketches, similar to Borat and Bad Grandpa. If you liked these movies, chances are you'll enjoy Bad Trip! Most sketches are absurd and gross, ( e.g. The gorilla sketch, the ""finger""..trap sketch, the drunk sketch) but I have to be honest, I find that amusing.It's perfectly fine movie for a Friday evening, when you are tired from your week and had a few beers!Other than that, you might not enjoy it!",Bad Trip

Then it starts to build a story, there are some pretty funny moments early on like the musical number after Eric gets advice and I thought that was brilliant.However, in the middle, it really did slow down on the jokes. The story got a little lost and like I said, the pacing changed heavily.I stopped watching at the zoo scene, I know the joke of repetition and that is classic Eric Andre, but I found it to be overly vulgar without a punchline, it just never stopped. After slow story progression and then this scene just going on too long, I had to stop watching.I think it was decently made for Eric's first special, but overall disappointing due to it's pace and lack of solid gags around the mid-way point.",Bad Trip

Tiffany Haddish was fantastic!
There were a few scenes and a few lines that could've been toned down. (The zoo scene immediately springs to mind.). I'm not prudish but the line between funny and sophomoric vulgarity was crossed on a few occasions in my opinion ... but not nearly enough for me to not recommend Bad Trip.
The manner in which some regular people reacted to some of the situations was rather heartwarming.

It's great for a late night, it will prime your pump for the unstoppable intensity that is Eric Andre. Start your evening with some out with some psychedelics first for maximum effect, it may be annoying otherwise. To sum it up, Bad Trip is for teenage minds on drugs, or forty year olds on drugs. Mostly the drugs man, then it's a lot funnier. It is short on plot and long on physical comedy, and that plays to it's strengths.

214,abrvjet,Great fun,9,28 March 2021,"This is really great fun. I enjoyed this and one of the best things I can say about this is how fantastic some of the 'participants' are. There are scenes where the stereotypical American should have come out but they don't. The 'real' people here, in the main, refreshingly show us more about America than most TV put together and I really enjoyed seeing this. The BMW guy at the beginning giving a naked man his jacket, the guy cleaning the graffiti, the nurse at the bar, the guy breaking up the fight, the bouncer at the art gallery, the army guy - brilliant every one of them!",Bad Trip
215,szarifahmamud,New idea of comedy movie,10,13 May 2020,It very fresh and new idea of movie. my family non stop laughing for this movie. i hope more kind of this movie created. the real reaction is super awesome. it like scrolling prank on instagram.,Bad Trip
216,Nils03,Pretty childish,7,17 September 2020,"It's mostly nudity + drugs = funny, some good skits but overall not as good as the eric andre show.",Bad Trip
217,rcpprddl,Pushing the boundaries of hidden camera,10,19 April 2021,"Every prank in this movie was done completely with hidden camera technology. It was so advanced, it was hard to believe at times. However, half the people on this website know nothing about the advancement of cameras and I can guarantee they have never even been on a film set and know what a camera looks like. This movie takes the pranks and absurdity to the next level, it was hilarious. Anyone who does not understand all the hard work that goes into making these pranks are giving the movie bad reviews and its a disservice to people in the industry.",Bad Trip
218,jrnorris-88124,This movie is insane,10,15 November 2020,The amount of orchestration and creativity that was put into this movie is literally insane. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time!,Bad Trip
219,adammelefors,Hilarious!,10,28 March 2021,I didn't know what was coming at all. I usually never laugh when I see a movie by my self. But this cracked me up.,Bad Trip

221,keithjchatman-41669,borat style hidden camera feature,10,27 March 2021,This is a very funny prank movie. It is hard to believe that the comedians were not recognized at all during the filming.,Bad Trip
222,prestonwlandis,"Brilliant, Andre is a master of comedy",10,27 April 2021,"The acting is the great, the pranks are hilarious. We need more from Eric Andre!!!!",Bad Trip
223,workingmum,Blah,2,28 March 2021,"Feels like their trying to do the new job of Bam and Jackass or impractical jokers but sadly you can predict what's guna happen but I guess for kids or teens now days this is guna be their ""OMG"" but how did these people not recognise Tiffany or Michela??!!",Bad Trip
224,fbcarsoncashcash,Finally another great hidden camera movie,10,27 March 2021,After the boring and mostly unfunny Borat 2 I almost lost hope in the hidden camera type shock movies. This movie brought me back. It is so funny and has a solid enough story to keep the movie flowing. It's also cool how the movie pranks people but not in a way of insulting them or mocking them and shows how nice and good people can be. It's not going to be a movie for everyone but if you are a fan of Jackass and shock comedy you will love this move its my favorite movie so far this year so definitely check it out.,Bad Trip
225,xaidehnfrost,Wow Vertly Awesome Movie!!,10,29 March 2021,Wow!! Very Awesome Movie Tiffany Haddish is Really Really Funny Wow I Love the Movie !! All of the Cast You all are so Awesome Thank You for a Great Movie!,Bad Trip
226,pocketdragon-31189,Absolutely bonkers,8,29 March 2021,"Some of the pranks had me really laughing, proper belly laughs.The story, as expected is a bit naff but the comedy more than made up for it. It has an element of Bad Grandpa/Jackass.The looks on the faces of some of the members of the public was priceless and the ending, whilst the credits were running was amusing to. These guys are insane!!!Well worth a watch if the TV is naff as I'm certain you will laugh.",Bad Trip
227,keerchow,Over-cooked humor like a burned steak,1,1 April 2021,"They defined American comedy as a crazy sh** show. But crazy doesn't mean humorous or comedy! Such unfortunate event for strangers who were at the scene, because it was bloody, violent and disturbing. Over-worked humor like a burned steak, it was a steak but bad chef ruined it and even a good sauce can't save it.",Bad Trip
228,watchdogslover,funny as hell!,9,2 April 2021,This was an amazing piece of work! The story was packed with hilarious and crazy content. Eric Andre/Chris had a dream to confess his love to his high school crush with his best friend Bud/Lil Rel Howery. There was some stuff in there that was some nasty humor and sexual moments but as the movie ended there was some behind the scenes that showed it was not real but an amazing comedy with good hidden camera pranks that took a lot of hard work! Buds sister Trina/Tiffany Haddish played a good sister who pushed Bud around and was a bully but Bud showed strength at the end by sticking up for him self. Chris and Bud made a good team being friends on a long trip to NYC to meet his crush Maria and had a crazy experience getting there. I would not recommend people under 18 to watch this but amazing job with this movie one of my favorite movies i have seen in a long time!,Bad Trip
229,coxlegend,It's a Movie .Need to be properly drunk to enjoy,3,3 April 2021,The movie is watchable but I think I would need to be severely drunk to appreciate the humor. Quality of stream was really poor on Netflix.,Bad Trip

231,dominicruiz,Tiffany haddish want excellent!,6,4 June 2021,"I had a few issues with most of the movie, but the one thing that i reaaaally enjoyed was tiffany haddishs performance! All of the scenes shes in were all of the best scenes in the movie! I really hope she widens her range, i can definitely see her doing a great job in a serious movie like adam sandler in punch drunk love or marlon wayans in requiem for a dream.",Bad Trip

234,madalimba,If I could give 0 stars I would!,1,3 April 2021,This was the worse movie I've seen in many years! I did not laughed at anything. It has the lowest level of quality in jokes and humor. Really! This is humor for brain that is lacking exercise since ever ...,Bad Trip
235,kunal0072005,Super fun & Must watch.,10,18 April 2020,"No point in the movie where you feel like you are getting bored. All the time movie is entertaining & make you laugh a lot.

237,toby_01007,Come for the laughs stay for the audience reaction,8,30 March 2021,"This is not my type of comedy. But I find myself laughing hilariously. But that's not why I love this movie. I love the fact that the audience itself participated in the movie without knowing it, and quite frankly the audience is really what makes it work. The reaction of the audience is often gold. And I'm some ways it's surprising (perfect comedy from unsuspecting bystanders who think this is a real life situation) and in other ways you get the reaction you thought you'd get (the reaction in the barbershop). Sometimes the genuine and caring reaction from people you least expect it from is a heart warmer in the day and age we live in. Not that it's original in this way, but it's original (could be wrong about this) in the way it executes this in a movie format, where a decent amount of the ""public"" aren't in on the joke, and and quite frankly that's what makes it work.One thing Is for sure: this won't be for everyone. But I very hesitantly have it a try, and I'm so glad I did.You should too!",Bad Trip

240,itaycohen36,Absolutely hilarious!!,8,17 February 2021,Didn't laugh so hard in a long time. Eric did an amazing job with this movie. Really liked the combination of the story line with the pranks.,Bad Trip
241,niawest,My stomach hurts,10,1 May 2021,"First of all, BRILLIANT to use unknowing extras to move the plot along. There were parts where I was laughing so hard my stomach hurt. My kind of silliness all day long! The cringe factor is 10!!!!",Bad Trip
242,konstantinj-70975,Shows so much beauty and compassion in a crazy world,10,28 August 2021,"Wow, I am really moved by all the great people they show in that movie.

Very touching and just shows, how great America really is.Please more like that!!!",Bad Trip
243,dwoods6,Best Comedy in Years,10,4 June 2021,"I did not know what to expect going into this but I liked the leads, so I gave it a chance. I just about died laughing and also liked the underlying story that went along with the pranks.",Bad Trip

245,sambeezee-84152,Not all that convincing but some fun bits,5,31 March 2021,"Tried and didn't really succeed to nail down the Borat fly on the wall style prank movie. Some fun bits but others were just too false like the gorilla scene. Ruined it for me that, and the high on drugs scene.",Bad Trip
246,agrisguta,It's NOT a movie! It's an extended youtube prank compilation (and nobody does them since like 2015...),2,13 June 2020,"On the paper this movie (and it's really hard to call it a movie) seems like a fun idea- there's an identical story to ""Dumb and Dumber"" (even scene wise) + Sacha Baron Cohen type of humor with live reactions and Eric Andre himself, whose show I have loved since day one.
BUT.
In reality ""Bad Trip"" was surprisingly underwhelming.
The plot, acting and character development WAS extremely bad (and yes, even for a comedy where you don't need much that). They so badly wanted to copy ""Dumb and Dumber"" that it was cringy to watch how they fall short every single scene. Only funny parts was a couple of people live reactions, but it really wasn't worth my time.
The most saddened I am by a fact that they where so LAZY, that often they didn't even come up with new prank ideas, but just took what worked for ""Eric Andre Show"". In reality IT'S NOTHING LIKE ""ERIC ANDRE SHOW"". ""EAShow"" was magical because it was so weird and surreal. ""Bad Trip"" is like heavily watered down version, with not much creativity to offer.
Overall, I would not advise you to waste your time watching this movie. You should better just check out some of the prank scenes of the movie, but please, don't mind the story, it's just there to make it a movie format, nothing else.",Bad Trip
247,jonesizzle,"Jackass meets Borat, Eric Andre style",7,4 April 2021,"First of all, it must be stressed that the point of this movie is not to be a great film or tell a compelling narrative. The only goal here is to find a somewhat coherent vehicle for the widest range of insane hidden camera pranks across a variety of environments. It doesnt have the extremity of a Jackass movie, or the deeper culturally commentary of a Borat film. What Bad Trip does, and almost perfectly, is to give you some fun, interesting characters who can be the perfect vehicle for what Eric Andre does best: create scenarios so insane and surreal that pretty much anybody can sign the release form. None of this movie, however gratuitous or traumatizing it cann feel, ever crosses into the mean-spirited or problematic. Andre perfectly navigates a number of nightmarish situations with his signature aplomb, and I absolutely loved it. I was laughing until my belly hurt during the dinner scene.But even beyond the humour, the true strength of this movie is the people. Andre is in distressing or painful situations throighout: after all, it is the story of a convict hunting down the two men who stole her car as they take a defiant road trip. But whether it's the registered nurse who checks on him when he has fallen from a roof, the street cleaner who refuses to snitch on Tiffany Haddish, the woman with a megaphone trying to save Andre's life, or the true hero, the man who defuses the mid-movie breakup fight between our two main characters, there are a dozen or more people who are confronted with an insane situation in their every day life and show their compassion, heart and kindness.There is no thesis to this movie. It's a few crazy people running around freaking out normal people with hidden cameras. It's not necessarily special. It's not a typical achievement of film making that you think of. It's something of its own, and it absolutely rocks.",Bad Trip
248,tashinecarter,Very creative movie,10,19 April 2020,"I honestly wasn't expecting this movie to be as great as ot was. From beginning to end you will non stop laughing, no dull moments, a MUST WATCH MOVIE",Bad Trip
