0,TheLittleSongbird,"Rises high at first, then quickly falls down and crashes with a thud",5,14 June 2019,"'High Rise' had a lot of promise. An amazing and unique concept, same goes for the source material which is a gripping read and stands out conceptually. Ben Wheatley seemed the right director, as he does have a great style. It had a cast that one really should not go wrong by, the actors all immensely talented. The trailer looked great visually and indicated an intriguing film. Will admit that there were doubts though, as the book is yet another book that is difficult to adapt.Doubts that sadly proved to be correct on the most part, the reasons have been said frequently here and there is not an awful lot more to add. There are books around that should really have been left alone due to being unadaptable. 'High Rise' is one of them. Other book to film adaptations seen recently that fit under this distinction are 'House of the Spirits' (which would have been much better as a mini-series), 'Naked Lunch', 'Cosmopolis' and 'Crash', just to say that despite singling out three David Cronenberg films he is a director generally held in high regard by me. Coming back to talking about 'High Rise' as a film, it is a case of style over substance and is a difficult to rate film and a case of the trailer being much better than the film. Didn't love it, didn't hate it, am very conflicted really.It starts off so promisingly. The first half hour, or first act, is very intriguing and easy to follow, drawing one right in. Throughout, 'High Rise' looks fantastic. Actually thought it was one of the best-looking films of the year, the production design alone left me in awe and the cinematography perfectly captures the dystopian nightmarish nature of the story. Clint Mansell's score is both haunting and rousing, adding a lot to what is going on and even enhancing it without over-bearing. Wheatley's direction is very uneven, but he does excel in the visual style which is very imaginative.The cast are also remarkably great, it is amazing that they did so much with material that they are well above of. Luke Evans especially brings a lot of intensity, charisma and poignancy to the one character the film tries to develop and the one character the viewer feels anything for. Tom Hiddleston carries 'High Rise' with a lot of charm and commands the screen with ease. Jeremy Irons has fun with his role, while also being menacing and providing his distinctive gravitas. Elizabeth Moss is also a standout. The rest of the cast are underused but still make the most of what they have, nobody's bad here.Such a shame though that 'High Rise' goes downhill rapidly too early in a rather sudden and very violent change of tone and the rest of the film becomes very disjointed. It became increasingly dull with no real momentum, and the middle act especially felt over-stretched and padded. Giving the sense of the film being far too long (by about an hour, the middle half hour could easily have been cut out) and the lack of momentum showing an indication of the story overall being too thin structurally. It is not just dull, it becomes confusing and over-complicated to the point of incoherence. While Wheatley excels on the style aspect of 'High Rise', the substance is messy and too detached, that is what was meant by his direction being uneven. Sad because on paper he seemed the right director.Felt nothing for the characters, other than Evans' Wilder they are sketchy caricatures kept too much at a distance emotionally. Emotionally, 'High Rise' left me cold, felt very little tension or emotion because there was so much frustration at the lack of momentum in the middle act and the chaotic over-complicated confusion that reached breaking point by the rather abrupt and head-scratching ending. Other frustrations are the vapid and self-indulgent script and a quite interesting moral on paper being executed heavy-handedly.Overall, very hard to rate and the polarisation in the reviews is understandable. Started off so well and with a lot of great things (especially the visuals and cast) but the rest of the film badly underwhelmed. 5/10",High-Rise
1,Leofwine_draca,"Good setup, all falls apart after that",4,31 January 2017,"It seems that British director Ben Wheatley is making a habit of disappointing his viewers lately, me in particular. My favourite film of his is still his first movie, DOWN TERRACE, although I quite enjoyed KILL LIST. Everything else has been poor, particularly the arty nonsense of A FIELD IN ENGLAND and the crude humour of SIGHTSEERS. Next we have HIGH RISE, an adaptation of the J.G. Ballard novel, and Wheatley's biggest budget production to date.It starts off well. Wheatley has clearly developed as a director and has a good visual style. The first half of the film, the set up, is very interesting in its depiction of a dystopian future, a microcosm of society inside a single tower block. The supporting cast is interesting, with Jeremy Irons as the architect and James Purefoy criminally underutilised as a rich businessman. A shame about the overrated pretty boy Tom Hiddleston; immaculately dressed and spoken, the guy has zero charisma and is a hollow man in the centre of the film.What a pity, then, that the opening shock scenes are the best in the movie. When chaos eventually erupts, everything goes to hell. It all becomes samey and repetitive; chaos is very hard to shoot right, and Wheatley just isn't up to the job. You have to keep a single narrative strand for the viewer to watch through the madness, as Paul Greengrass did so well during the massacre scene in BLOODY Sunday and the riot scene in JASON BOURNE. Wheatley doesn't cut it. The main problem, though, is with Amy Jump, who just doesn't know how to create sympathetic characters and whose juvenile attempts at writing keep scuppering Wheatley's attempts to make movies. It's about time he got rid of her and gave himself a chance to shine.",High-Rise
2,SnoopyStyle,interesting concept,6,1 October 2016,"It's around the 70's London. Dr. Robert Laing (Tom Hiddleston) moves into a modern brutal-concrete high-rise designed by architect Anthony Royal (Jeremy Irons). He is nude sunbathing when Charlotte (Sienna Miller) from a balcony above invites him to her party. At that party, he befriends couple Helen (Elisabeth Moss) and Richard Wilder (Luke Evans) who live with the other poorer families on the lower levels. Later, Royal's wife Ann (Keeley Hawes) invites him to a party but it's an 18th century aristocratic costume party. There are little problems with the building and distrust among the different levels of the complex. The concept is interesting. There is something distancing about keeping this in the past. It doesn't connect the audience to the present and isn't as compelling. It's a rant against the class system without going into race or many of the other modern divisions. It follows a few too many characters which scatters the intensity. It's still an interesting high-concept movie but it doesn't really captivate me.",High-Rise
3,Prismark10,Paradise Towers,5,16 June 2016,"JG Ballard's dystopian science fiction novels have long been regarded as being unfilmable. Ironically it was Steven Spielberg who first made a film of one of his books, the autobiographical Empire of the Sun which was also more conventional.In High Rise the building clad in some kind of neo 1970s decor is really the star as it represents the social strata. A society in decay. The film opens where there has been a total nihilistic breakdown amongst the occupants where we see a man roasting a dog's leg before we jump back three months earlier.Dr Robert Laing (Tom Hiddleston) is a middle class doctor, almost an every-man who is at ease both going up and down the social classes in the tower block. He is helped by Charlotte Melville (Sienna Miller) a sexy neighbour who helps Laing get to the upper floors where tastes are more refined. Better parties, music, swimming pool and restaurants for example.Richard Wilder (Luke Evans whose get up reminds me a lot of actor Stanley Baker) is a truculent documentary maker who lives near the ground floor with his wife and children amongst the rest of the block's poorer tenants. Wilder is aware and resentful of the inequality that exists in building. He has to put up with electricity outages, lifts not working properly, inferior restaurants, shops, parties. Wilder wants to expose the building's architect Anthony Royal (Jeremy Irons) who lives on the top floor and he also happens to be Laing's occasional squash partner.As we head towards hedonism, one-upmanship, sex fuelled violence the narrative structure of the film breaks down. The descent into madness is too rapid as Laing suddenly starts to paint his room and himself. The film becomes disjointed although we see some of the upper floor residents who wish to Balkanise the lower floors and re-organise the place more to their benefit.It is as the novel was just too big and intricate to just chew off and director Ben Wheatley did not have the budget and resources to do it justice.The film ends with the words of Mrs Margaret Thatcher former Prime Minister of Britain who did so much to ramp up the divisions between rich and poor in the 1980s.",High-Rise
4,nogodnomasters,We are all on the same level,8,10 December 2017,"May contain plot spoilers, although the film is not plot driven.This is a film heavy in the metaphor and symbolism thing. It lacks plot continuity and events that don't make sense in the civilized world as pointed out by its own characters. The film is about a High-Rise where people are screened to buy condos based on the need of the architect, a man who lives in the luxurious penthouse garden he made for his wife. The lower class live on the bottom. They all pay the same for resources but the resources are allocated to those in the upper levels, a statement about the allocation of the world's resources. Note the supermarket fruit is arranged from pure to moldy on the shelves.Dr. Laing (Tom Hiddleston) is ""self contained and detached"" from the class or level struggle. Richard Wilder (Luke Evans) is a documentary film maker who is leading an anarchist rebellion against Royal (Jeremy Irons).The setting of the picture is circa late 60's (note the Che poster) although people in higher levels look modern and sleek. People are heavy smokers. The film is filled with telling statements and symbols... ""Another prison documentary"" The architect is living in the index finger tip of his creation. ""The future already taken place."" This film is for Indy lovers who question capitalistic values.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity",High-Rise
5,kosmasp,Hitting home ... again and again ... and again,5,25 December 2016,"And again! And maybe a couple of times more just for good measure. And it's almost a shame because I can see why someone wrote that it has great small pieces that don't fit into a whole piece. Because the message about our society and how it works (the rich oppressing the poor being the overall message, but the movie has more than that, be it in subtext or otherwise), is really a good one. And one people are generally interested in too.But the message is so clear, that it becomes almost a bore to watch from a certain point on. It's like if someone repeatedly keeps poking you, although you are already listening to them. And although they keep repeating what they say and you already have gotten their point. I think some may even call it annoying. Still the actors are great and if this was shorter it would have been a lot better. Visually stunning, the scope is also amazing. For some this may be enough, for others obviously not so much",High-Rise
6,jboothmillard,High-Rise,4,19 August 2021,"I had missed this film on television a good number of times in the last couple of years, I had heard mixed opinions about it, but a good cast list made it too appealing to miss, directed by Ben Wheatley (Kill List, Sightseers, Free Fire). Basically, set in 1975, it in an unnerving tale taking place in a forty-story high-rise tower block on the outskirts of London, built by esteemed architect Anthony Royal (Jeremy Irons). Wealthy residents live on the top floors, and poor residents live below. The building includes a pool, gym, supermarket, and even a primary school, and besides work the occupants have little reason to leave the building, they are increasingly isolated from the outside world. Dr. Robert Laing (Tom Hiddleston) has moved onto the 25th floor after the death of his sister. He begins a relationship with single mother Charlotte Melville (Sienna Miller), becoming a fatherly figure to her son, Toby (Louis Suc). He also befriends documentary filmmaker Richard Wilder (Luke Evans) and his pregnant wife Helen (Elisabeth Moss), who live in a low-level apartment with their children. Laing teaches physiology, and in one class examining a severed head, student Munrow (Augustus Prew) faints and is given a precautionary brain scan. The next day, Laing is taken to the 40th-story penthouse to meet Royal and is invited to a party thrown by Royal's snobby wife, Ann (Keeley Hawes). It turns out to be an 18th-century costume party, Laing is humiliated being in an everyday suit. After being ridiculed by guests, Laing is told to see Royal, and becomes trapped in an elevator during a power outage. Power outages are becoming common, along with water being shut off and garbage chutes becoming blocked, to the annoyance of lower-floor residents. Royal tells Laing these are simply growing pains of a new building. Laing is angered by Munrow humiliating him at the party and leads him to believe that he has a brain tumour, when his scans came back clean. Another power outage leads to many people partying throughout the high-rise, and a drunk Munrow commits suicide by jumping from the 39th floor. Suspicious that no police arrive to investigate, Wilder becomes intent on exposing the injustices within the high-rise. Slowly life in the building descends into chaos, as violence becomes commonplace, the supermarket food supplies dwindle, and class warfare erupts between floors. It is implied that Royal has bribed authorities to ignore the disorder. Guilty over Munrow's death, Laing becomes mentally disturbed, eventually barricading himself in his apartment in the chaotic atmosphere and has sex with Helen. Following a fight with upper-floor residents, Wilder blames Royal for the chaos and intends to kill him. Acquiring a gun from the Royals' former housekeeper, Wilder learns that Charlotte is Royal's aide and Toby is Royal's illegitimate child. Wilder breaks into Charlotte's apartment, and tortures and rapes her for information on Royal. Television newsreader Cosgrove (Peter Ferdinando) was the only upper-floor resident still leaving for work, he is captured and killed by a gang of lower-floor residents. Some upper-floor residents accuse Wilder of being a dangerous agitator, so he conducts a psychiatric examination. He refuses their suggestions to give Wilder a lobotomy, stating he is ""possibly the sanest man in the building"". Royal saves Laing after residents try to throw him off the tower, they talk about the failure and arguable success of the high-rise, and the possibility of ""new developments"" that would give residents the opportunity to escape to a new life. The women at the top plan to establish new management of the building, and Helen gives birth to her overdue baby. Wilder makes his way to the penthouse, shooting Royal dead after a scuffle, and is killed by Royal's women. The high-rise is ravaged, and violence only dissolves after many are residents dead and apartments are in ruin. Laing appears to have gone insane, speaking about himself and to others in the third person and talking to the building. He lies down with Charlotte, reflecting that what has happened will eventually reach the second tower of the development, while Toby listens to Margaret Thatcher on the radio talking about state capitalism and no political freedom. Also starring James Purefoy as Pangbourne, Sienna Guillory as Jane, Reece Shearsmith as Steele, Dan Renton Skinner as Simmons, Tony Way as Robert the Caretaker, Bill Paterson as Mercer, Neil Maskell as P. C White and Eileen Davies as Mrs Hillman. Hiddleston is alright as the well-spoken bachelor, Miller and Irons are reasonable support, and many of the other recognisable faces are fine. The battle of the rich on the top floors and the poor on the lower levels is fair enough, but is all gets increasingly messy and disjointed, I lost track of what was going on, and only the moments of violence and the cast kept me watching, there is an unending dark atmosphere throughout, it just put me off, I doubt I would watch this again, a weird dystopian satirical drama. Okay!",High-Rise
7,Tweekums,A dystopia within a single tower block,8,30 March 2017,"Dr Robert Laing moves into the twenty fifth storey of a concrete tower block and soon learns that there is a distinct hierarchy; those at the top rule the roost while those lower down are at the bottom of the pile. He is between the two groups. Early on there is some tension but that only escalates when the power fails. Their society rapidly collapses; tenants fight over the few remaining items in the building's supermarket and the two groups soon brutally turn against each other. Laing is in the middle but somehow seems to avoid most of the danger.This is a rather dark dystopian drama. Unlike most such films it isn't set in the future but in the mid '70s, the time the book it is based on was written. It nicely captures that era while not feeling dated. Tom Hiddleston does a fine job as Laing and Jeremy Irons impresses as the building's architect, who lives in the penthouse and imagines that he has built a vertical Utopia where problems are just a case of 'settling in'. Also notable are Sienna Miller, who plays the woman in the apartment above Laing's; Luke Evans as the bolshie Wilder and Peter Ferdinando, who plays the brutish Cosgrove. Once things start to go wrong there is a near constant sense of danger and there are moments of fairly shocking violence, some of a sexual nature. As is often the case when societies reach an end there is also a decadence among those at the top. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the genre; just expect some distinctly uncomfortable moments.",High-Rise
8,Theo Robertson,This High Rise Is Very Flat,4,25 December 2016,"Apologies for writing yet another review where I reference DOCTOR WHO in a review that doesn't feature my all time favourite show but I was looking forward to HIGH RISE for two reasons 1) It was directed by Ben Wheatley after contributing the first two stories of the Capaldi era 2) The source novel by JG Ballard was the inspiration to the 1987 DW story Paradise Towers one of the genuine contenders for Worst DOCTOR WHO story ever Actually the trailers looked quite good with some striking cinematography which considering the story is fairly localised and static shows some imgination amongst the retrograde futurism look of the movie Oh dear what went wrong ? To be fair at least you don't have to search too far to read the subtext . The people at the top have a great time ruling over the oppressed masses at the bottom . Marxism for muppets , I hear you and in case you didn't there will be a forthcoming scene every few minutes pointing this out ""Hey Comrade Theo , surely we have moved on from such class struggle simplicity and corporate capitalism is now the enemy of the proletariat ?"" Oh you mean how people whore themselves and stab their brothers and sisters in the back to ingratiate themselves with the company ? None of the production team have given this much thought . In fact they've given no thought to anything happening on screen .Whole chunks of the film feels as if it's been left on the cutting room floor and much of the plot turns and motivations make very little sense . If you've watched the trailer and seen Luke Evans character shout ""Isn't it odd a man can fall from the thirty ninth floor and not one police car turns up"" and wonder what the explanation is then you'll be none the wiser after seeing the movie . The reason no police cars turn up is because you're watching a film - not a fairly decent one either - where realism is totally ignored and things happen because something needs to happen . Ask yourself this: why do characters sit around waiting for the end when in all probability all they would have to do is get the deposit for a flat somewhere else ? Maybe the film is making a point about social Darwinism or maybe it's just a very underdeveloped ill thought through film ? I know which one I'm putting my capitalist money on",High-Rise
9,LeonLouisRicci,Over-Indulgent but Artistically Impressive Wallow in Dehumanization,7,11 September 2016,"From the Scathing and Satirical Social Commentary Novel (1975) by J.G. Ballard, this is rather close to the Source Material, for Better or Worse. Some Say that the Novel is Unfilmable.Enter British Cutting Edge and Artsy Director Ben Wheatley. Drawing from Ballard's Literary Prose and the Cinema of Lynch, Kubrick, and Cronenberg, Wheatley is on Hallowed Ground. The Homages range from Subtle to Overt.Breakdown and Chaos are here in Abundance and In Your Face to a Fault. The Second Half Wallows with Unnerving Images and Over the Top Displays of Filth, both of the Mind and Place. The Artistic Design is Striking. Excessive to the Point of Disgusting Heavy-Handedness the Film makes its Points by Pulverizing the Audience into Submission. The Confusing Elements Pile Up like the Trash and the Bodies and the Message is Drowned in Decadence for Art's Sake and Loses some of the Powerful Prognostications of its Subject.Not for Everyone, this Potential Cult Film is a Sight to Behold. What it Lacks in Coherence it makes up for with Outrageous Optics. The Cast all seem to be Invested in this Vision and the Movie is Impressive more for its Displays than Insights. The Building is a Figurative and Symbolic Metaphor for the Caste System that Surrounds and Entraps with its Ugly Dehumanizing Persuasion and this Film does the Same.",High-Rise
10,grantss,Had some potential but quickly becomes nonsensical and stupid,3,8 December 2017,"London, 1970s. Dr Robert Laing moves into a new high-rise apartment building. It is soon apparent that there is a class-divide between the wealthier upper-floors inhabitants and the middle-class lower- floors tenants. Over time this escalates into full-blown war...Had some potential as an examination of class divides and their consequences, also as a dark drama. The opening scene was intriguing, but it soon becomes apparent that the only reason to continue watching is to see how we end up there. Hardly anything from the period in between makes sense, and just gets more and more random as time goes by. Yes, the idea was to ramp up the level of anarchy, but some degree of continuity was still called for. Becomes pretty stupid after a while.The whole us vs them thing is also laid on so thick and unobjectively that engagement is non-existent. Good cast - Jeremy Irons, Sienna Miller, Elizabeth Moss, Tom Hiddleston , James Purefoy, Luke Evans - do their best but are massively hamstrung by a very weak script and one-dimensional direction.",High-Rise
11,ferguson-6,We must throw a better party,5,12 May 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. When a novel has been deemed ""unfilmable"" for forty years, perhaps the designation should be honored, rather than accepted as a challenge. That said, there is probably a cult-like movie lurking somewhere in and around director Ben Wheatley's (Kill List, 2011) personal spin on the 1975 novel from J.G. Ballard (who also penned ""Crash"" and ""Empire of the Sun"").Amy Jump adapted the screenplay from Ballard's novel, and in the blink of an eye, the tone shifts from a microcosm of a decaying society and class warfare to all-out anarchy and hedonism. What's fascinating is that the talented cast nearly rescues the film from the misguided script. Tom Hiddleston stars as Dr. Laing, a physiologist who moves into the futuristic (for the 1970's) monolith, seemingly naïve to the wicked ways of this insular community. Sienna Miller plays Charlotte, a fellow middle-class resident, who not only crushes on Laing, but also seems to know where the skeletons are buried. On the Terrace level, the always entertaining Jeremy Irons plays Royal, the building's architect and overseer  a kind of great and powerful Oz. An unrecognizable Luke Evans (out of his usual pretty boy mode) is stellar as the aptly named Wilder, a documentary filmmaker who adds a dose of skepticism towards the building - in contrast to Laing's innocent approach.Beginning at the macabre ending, the film then flashes back to ""3 months earlier"" as Laing first moves into the building. This device is the only semblance of time provided throughout. We witness how quickly Laing takes to the sport of social climbing, buddying up to Royal, and joining in with the communal decadence.Power outages, orgies, class warfare and enough cigarettes to qualify as a non-smoking PSA, the film seems intent on ensuring viewers remain disoriented as to the reasons for mass chaos. The building itself could be considered a character, and certainly the use of mirrors and a kaleidoscope makes a statement  even while we hear multiple versions of Abba's ""SOS"". Black comedies typically make the best cult movies, and though this one is filled with aberrant and deviant behavior, it's somehow not quite twisted enough  or at least not properly twisted for viewer fun. Beyond that, it comes across as an expression of filmmaker anger rather than the commentary on British infrastructure that Ballard intended.",High-Rise
12,zetes,A lot of fun,8,22 August 2016,"I've been kind of ignoring British director Ben Wheatley after hating Kill List, which I didn't even finish. Watching this one, I'm pretty sure I need to go back. This very consciously hearkens back to Roman Polanski's Apartment Trilogy (Repulsion, Rosemary's Baby and The Tenant) and other films in that weird horror sub-genre (like David Cronenberg's Shivers). High-Rise isn't strictly a horror film, but, well, it's pretty close. Tom Hiddleston is the new tenant in a beautiful new high-rise apartment building in the 1970s (judged from the fashion; I don't think it's ever stated). He befriends the building's designer (Jeremy Irons) and several other tenants. He also makes some enemies. Some of the stricter rules imposed by Irons start to annoy some of the tenants (whose home floor determines their class status), and soon there is political upheaval. Soon after that, the building's whole society begins to collapse. I'm not 100% sure exactly what Wheatley is trying to say here - I do feel like I could use a re-watch. However, it's very amusing, very funny, and very beautiful to look at. Sometimes destruction and chaos can be quite beautiful. One of my favorites so far this year.",High-Rise
13,christopher-underwood,silly but good fun,7,25 March 2016,"There is something about the experience of seeing a Ben Wheatley film that makes it difficult to write about. For me, anyway, as I see after hesitating before setting pen to paper (not really!) on this, I find I never wrote up two previous films, Kill List and Sightseers, both of which I remember liking. Here we have a film based upon a 1975 J G Ballard book and although I haven't read it appears to be a cautionary tale set in a high rise block where the very environment drives people a little crazy. I can remember back in the 70s actually thinking that this could be the case, there being wide spread belief that the rich would have neat little Georgian style houses and the poor would have to be plopped on top of each other and the two kept well apart. Strangely high rise is all the rage for the well off once more so we shall see how things turn out. This film is essentially silly but good fun. Never a dull moment but nothing too cerebral. I was reminded of the Italian gialli thrillers, all bright colours, crazy decor and constant sex and violence and revelled in many of the mad scenes. I was not so happy to think I should be taking any of this seriously, however, and was rather dismayed at the Thatcher quote that sits uncomfortably before the final credits.",High-Rise
14,ksf-2,upper floors versus the lower floors,6,4 May 2021,"I don't know how i missed this one when it came out. Some big names in here.. and their character names match their place in society... Jeremy Irons is Anthony Royal, and he lives at the top of the high rise. And owns the building. Moss and Evans are ""the Wilders"", and they are indeed wild. So they live on the lower floors. The ""assistants who get things done"" are Simmons and Cosgrove, names sometimes associated with butlers. So Laing (Tom Hiddleston) moves into a middle, upper floor. He's a doctor, so clearly he has the money for the upper floors. At first, he makes friends with both the upper and lower floors, but clearly you have to pick sides to survive. And when the lights go out, things get pretty rough. It's a bit futuristic and trippy, which probably turned some people off. You have to let it just soak in, without questioning too much. Some gross scenes, so not for the queamish. Kind of a study in what happens to people when the services and daily routines are interrupted for an extended time.",High-Rise
15,lasttimeisaw,"sometimes, one must jilt high fidelity to achieve some extraordinary, but HIGH-RISE obviously is not the case here",6,25 February 2017,"It took exactly 40 years to actualize the screen transposition of J.G. Ballard's dystopian novel HIGH-RISE, which is published in 1975. UK maverick Ben Wheatley takes on the project, his fifth feature, with verve and brio on the face of that the story itself is more often than not, deemed unfilmable. An ideological fable corralling a mishmash of characters inside an august tower block, with its occupants easily compartment-ed into a social and ritual hierarchy commensurate with the altitude of their stories. On its top 40th floor, resides the architect of the building Anthony Royal (Irons) and his wife Ann (Hawes), approached only through an exclusive elevator and surrounded by a luxuriant rooftop garden, occasionally Ann will throw a lavish 18-century French costume party out of caprice, which our protagonist, Dr. Robert Laing (Hiddleston) is invited but his suited formality is bitingly derided by the hostess and company. Laine is a new tenant who occupies a room in the 25th floor, which denotes his status as a bridge between the upper and lower floors, indeed, he befriends an idle documentary maker Richard Wilder (Evans) and his preggy wife Helen (Moss, sports a British accent) who lives below and catches the attention of Charlotte (Miller), a voluptuous single-mother who lives just above him, before they take a roll in the hay, also he is the one who is invited by Mr. Royal himself to glance the view of the top, whereas for Wilder and his ilk, they don't even have a clue about what the architect looks like. Told from flashback, within three months, everything would descend into sheer anarchy, that's what unrelievedly en-trains in a fictive dystopian world, due to class stratification and its trimmings: uneven allocation of resources, miscarried privilege, ennui and debauchery. In a starkly impressive visual tack, Wheatley unleashes his faculties to maximally depict the ongoing strife, encounters and their ramifications with slickness (a music video feel of poshness, especially topped off by Portishead's cover of ABBA's S.O.S.) and confidence (slo-motions, pulsating tableaux and revealing compositions galore). But on a lesser note, the narrative never truly gels which renders the vociferous actions bluntly improbable and incoherent. It is just a matter of time for viewers to lose one's investment in its heterogeneous characters, carrying off their tussles, assassinations, dry-humpings and petulant decisions to a hyper-stylized genre pastiche which we have already seen, for example in Boon Jooh-ho's SNOWPIERCER (2013), with much more gusto and thrill. A can-do ensemble cast shouldn't be accountable for the film's own textual disarray as most of them are hobbled by the flimsy material at their disposal: Hiddleston is exploited as a jolly-good specimen, inhabits himself to Laine's suit fetish, gratuitous nudity and simulated romp with the same commitment; Sienna Miller, as gallant as she is, is given the short hand of a misogynous male- gaze, at one point she is mentioned by the tightness of her genitals, always a fair game to blame along other petticoat cohorts; but it is Luke Evans, upstages everyone else in his greasy wig and blood-tainted slap, gets off on Richard's insurrectionary vibe and having a field day. When the coda finally reveals the story takes place in Thatcher's era, its ripple effects can be wholeheartedly related to today's political weather, since it is always the same-old transgression stemming from the capitalistic structure, but tackling with an influential but un-cinematic fiction, one needs a much more tectonic re-imagination and re-structuring of its source material before indulging it with all the glitters, sometimes, one must jilt high fidelity to achieve some extraordinary, but HIGH-RISE obviously is not the case here.",High-Rise
16,Red-Barracuda,Highly stylised and bold adaption of a seminal novel,7,25 March 2016,"High-Rise is the latest film adaption of a J.G. Ballard novel. The previously most prominent one was David Cronenberg's controversial Crash (1996). Similar to that one, High-Rise is a pretty faithful adaption of the material. Having read both of those books, I felt that High-Rise was definitely the superior of the two. It was a perfect example of the peculiar kind of sci-fi Ballard is known for, i.e. it's nihilistic, critical of society and the set-up is very familiar but with some slight changes, which gives off the feeling that the events are set five minutes in the future. This film adaption is a little different to this in that the stylistic decision has been made that the world in which events take place would resemble the one envisaged by Ballard back in 1975 when he wrote the novel, i.e. it's a view of the future mid-70's style in all its beige and concrete glory. The upshot of this is that the look is of the retro-future variety and this may be the single best thing about the film overall. The photography and set-design are both excellent, while the various montages and dream-like segments are all very well executed. To top this off is a very well chosen soundtrack, which often has a sound which fits the sterile surroundings very well, as well as two very different and interesting versions of the ABBA song S.O.S., a song which also came out the same year this novel was released.The story in a nutshell has a doctor move into a modern high-rise building which has been fitted with all mod cons, meaning that life can be lived within its confines without the need to leave the building. The skyscraper has an in-built social order, where the higher your apartment is, the higher you are in the caste system. This leads to resentment from the people in the lower floors who feel they are getting a bad deal out of the system. This leads to a violent class war, where the residents are reduced to savagery in an alarmingly short space of time.The high-rise itself serves as a microcosm of human capitalist society as a whole. The events and character actions that occur are of course highly exaggerated and severe, even if they do touch upon definite truths. But this is a very blackly satirical story and so realism is not a priority here. To this end the events are often wilfully surreal and absurd. This approach does mean, however, that this is not always a fully engaging experience, with many vignettes going off at tangents and the abundant humour sometimes meaning it is hard to take things altogether seriously some of the time. It's a quite fragmented film overall, with a not entirely linear story-line and the full-on nature of the visual presentation – while extremely good – can sometimes overcome the content. Still, I found a lot to like in this one and admired the boldness of approach. Director Ben Wheatley has to be given appropriate credit for bringing this to the screen in such an uncompromising manner, he is certainly putting together one of the most interesting bodies of work in cinema right now. Ultimately, High-Rise is certainly a film that will understandably be very divisive, but I thought, on the whole, it was a very good adaption of an excellent subversive novel.",High-Rise
17,Hellmant,The movie is definitely strange.,8,18 May 2016,"'HIGH-RISE': Four Stars (Out of Five)A British thriller flick, from director Ben Wheatley (who also helmed the popular 2011 British thriller film 'KILL LIST'). The movie was scripted by Amy Jump (Wheatley's wife, and usual writing partner), and it was based on the 1975 novel, of the same name, by J.G. Ballard. The story is about a high-rise tower, that's cutoff from the rest of society, which falls into anarchic chaos, when social conflicts continue to escalate between the residents. The film stars Tom Hiddleston, Jeremy Irons, Sienna Miller, Luke Evans and Elisabeth Moss. I found it to be bizarre and oddly fascinating.Hiddleston plays Dr. Robert Laing; a physiologist that takes a job at a new London tower block, which he also moves into. The high-rise is divided into different social classes; with the rich living in higher floors, and poorer residents living in lower ones. The building has everything occupants need (like a supermarket, gym and swimming pool), so residents hardly ever have to leave. Social conflicts arise when the tower's power begins to fail, and the poor suffer the blunt of it. Disagreements become violent, as the high- rise turns to total chaos and anarchy. The movie is definitely strange, and sometimes hard to follow (for me at least), but I liked it even more because of this. Hiddleston is great in the lead, and Wheatley's direction is very fitting to the material. The story is a great examination of the power struggles between 'the haves and the have-nots'. It's also an interesting look at mental illness, as almost everyone in the movie seems to go completely crazy (very quickly). It's very amusing, quirky, and darkly humorous too. I'd definitely say it's a well made little indie thriller.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFKDfA8QZiM",High-Rise

And like most Malick films, I know way less after seeing this movie than before.Admittedly, the first third, the cinematography and somewhat decent music save this experiment from throwing itself off the top floor. Unfortunately, it's those final two thirds that make you wanna jump yourself.My guess is that this is a social commentary on the social classes living together in a medium-sized ""high-rise.""

It also lived in some alternative dimension or future reality that they never established. Fine. It wanted to be crafty and look down upon the normal viewing public. They did succeed in that, but they didn't succeed in making a coherent story or message. Just because I, myself, can throw sh|t into a fan, that doesn't make it art.

20,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Over-whelmingly strange depiction of JG Ballard's novel,4,6 December 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Dr Laing (Tom Hiddleston) moves into a High Rise apartment building in the 1970s, and is immediately drawn to the neurotic Charlotte (Sienna Miller), who he gets involved with behind the back of her husband Wilder (Luke Evans.) Eventually, Laing comes to the attention of Royal (Jeremy Irons), the resident bigwig who runs everything. It all builds to an explosive ending where no one will come out untouched.Set in a 1970s Britain, before Thatcher came and applied her transformative policies, High Rise appears to be using her coming reign as a metaphor for its narrative, with various residents living in the up end tower block at different floors depending on their wealth and social stature. It would seem to have worked better as a novel, though, because Ben Wheatley's big screen adaptation hasn't translated well to the screen, and has produced a production that is just a baffling mess.It's clearly aiming at some kind of profound social commentary, but for the most part Kill List's Wheatley simply can't convey it all in a worthy way. As well as those listed above, an even larger all star cast gets wasted, in the shape of James Purefoy, Keeley Hawes and Reece Shearsmith. There's a bright and beautiful sense of pulsating style, and a neat soundtrack, but mostly it's just too long and fails to convey anything. **",High-Rise

Here, the flick just ends up feeling aimless, unable to conflate its anarchic themes with its newfound anarchic film-form and narrative structure - as admirable as it is that it attempted to do so, to tell the story through the very fabric of its film-making. It's just a bit boring, to be honest, and it gets progressively more so as it goes along, ultimately making for a pretty disappointing picture that isn't really entertaining despite the fact that it features some interesting visuals, several more-than-decent performances, a few ambitious themes and that it is told with a fairly solid style. 5/10",High-Rise
23,bowmanblue,"High concept, low returns",5,11 July 2017,"Ever since Tom Hiddleston became an evil Norse god he can do no wrong in many people's eyes (that's a nod to 'Thor' in case you have no idea what I mean by that). In any case, besides – allegedly – dating Taylor Swift for about five minutes, he's pretty popular right about now. Therefore, a high concept arty piece, brimming with social commentary and with him taking centre stage must be worth a watch, right? Sorry Tom.Now, I like to think that I'm no stranger to the slightly more 'abstract' films. I don't just want to see endless car chases or Transformers movies. I loved 'A Clockwork Orange' and David Lynch's work. However, I just couldn't really get into this. It's based on a book of the same name that's apparently had a script associated with it that's been kicking around various productions companies for years. Now, it's only just been made, despite everything about it screaming that it's set in the seventies.As the title suggests, it's all based in and around a high rise block of flats. The opening scene shows that some sort of catastrophe has befallen the building and those left are living almost in feral conditions. Then we're flung a little further back in time and the film begins proper with us seeing the events which lead up to this social decay.And, Tom Hiddleston shows that he's not just a meanie with a horned helmet, he can also hold his own as a leading man. He does carry the film as the well-to-do tenant of one of the apartments. He's slightly aloof and disdainful of much of what goes on around him – almost carrying himself a little like Patrick Bateman from 'American Psycho,' but never without sinking into quite such a chainsaw-wielding maniac. However, just because he's not trying to feed stray cats to cash machines, doesn't mean there isn't a healthy (or rather Unhealthy!) helping of s3x and violence. In fact that's really all the film is.It's clear that the film has something to say about society and the way we lived. But it seems to get stuck in a bit of a senseless loop where gratuitous violence is all that's on offer. And, once you've seen one stylised fist fight (or worse!) then you probably don't want to see one in the very next scene as well. Perhaps if this film had been released in the seventies when such sights were a novelty in cinema and would therefore generate enough 'shock' with the public to make it stand out then it might have got a greater following. However, despite the decadent setting and the stylish way it's all filmed, there's not really an awful lot here to see. Yes, fans of Tom himself should enjoy it more than most, but it still feels like an empty Clockwork Orange clone that's been lost in time all these years and has missed its window where it would have been popular.I really wanted to like this and stuck with it hoping that it would finally change pace and pick itself up. However, it just repeats the same cycle over and over again and whatever message it thought it was trying to say gets lost along the way. Probably would have worked better as an art house piece that ran for between 20-30 minutes. It looks nice, but feels hollow. Wait is that what it's trying to say about life?",High-Rise
24,inkblot11,"Fascinating and funny, it nevertheless descends into wanton sexuality and ultra-violence; only for the over 18 and open-minded crowd",7,8 November 2018,"Based on 70's JG Ballard's amazing book, the film begins with disturbing images of a blood-soaked Laing (Tom Hiddleston), a ransacked apartment and a dead canine. Soon, it goes back to the ""bright and shiny"" 100 floor modern high-rise which Laing has chosen for his new residence. It is near his job as a medical-teaching physician. Indeed, the High-Rise is breathtaking in its beauty and amenities. Meant to be a community within its brick and mortar confines, the building has a school, a grocery store and a fitness floor, including a pool midway up the structure. Its creator, Royal (Jeremy Irons) occupies the fabulous penthouse with his wife, rooftop gardens, a bevy of servants, and spacious rooms. Ah, but ""inequality"" has been built into the community. The upper third floors belong to the rich and famous; they have a private elevator and the best parking spots in the huge lot. The middle floors are inhabited with folks like Laing, not extremely wealthy, but respectable middle-class professionals. As one can guess, the lower third of the residence is occupied by the strictly lower-to-middle folks, mostly families with lots of children. In this part resides tv journalist Wilder (Luke Evans) and his very pregnant wife (Elizabeth Moss) and two other children. Curiously, when Laing moves in, he has a pile of boxes, which he doesn't begin unpacking, and a photo of his sister which he tacks on the wall. One day, on his balcony, Laing is almost hit with a falling cocktail from Charlotte (Sienna Miller) who resides one floor above, with her ultra-bright son. Admiring the beautiful lady and her wild-and-wanton persona, Laing eagerly accepts her invitation to a party on the upper floors. Almost before one can see it, the building and its residents begin to break down. The elevators for the lower residents stop working, which means a lot of stair walking for some. Then, the garbage starts to pile up in the shoots and no one takes care of it. Similarly, the store starts having more empty shelves and the pool crowd gets into fights about who can swim and when. Wilder tries to work up emotion for a ""war"" with the snooty on the top floors. Cars get broken in the lot and, horribly, a jeweler commits suicide, landing on an expensive sports car. No one cares to find out why. Laing, once button-down and immaculate in his appearance, starts to dishevel as he sometimes believes Wilder's approach is the best. Soon, all chaos breaks loose, with wild sex parties and violence among the residents. Is this Lord of the Flies High-Rise? Yes. This fascinating and darkly humorous film is really not for most. Its graphic violence and sex, while not truly plentiful until the last third of the film, is repulsive. Yet, how would WE ACT IN SIMILAR circumstances is the main question and its answer is horribly true to the nasty heart of humanity. Hiddleston is great and all the other actors sharp as well. Scenery, costumes from the seventies, and the energetic, wanton direction are fine, too. Above all, Ballard was a witness to the ""decay"" of mankind when he was held, as a child, in a Japanese prison camp, so he knows what evil man is capable of inflicting on fellow man.

25,Reno-Rangan,A dystopian-thriller-drama in a retro effect.,6,14 September 2016,"A new British dystopian-drama sets in a single 40 storey building revolving around the people who resides there. It was based on the novel of the same name which has a great cast and a decently made film. But it is kind of a 50-50 to me, mostly I enjoyed with a little disappointment in some parts. First of all I did not know anything about the film, so surprised with its development, especially when it reached its midway I realised the theme. The setting was great, and well performed by all, particularly the Tom Hiddleton which is very rare to see him in a lead role.It was the story of a doctor who moved to his new residency in a high-rise tower and tries to blend in with the others. But as the world is falling apart by the collapse of the society and civilisation, his tower block as well affected very seriously of all kinds of supplies where he confronts various threats from its people. The remaining story concentrates where it is going to end and how with some high and low moments.Occasionally, the narration takes us outside the building, but it does not stay there long enough. At present there are many dystopian films are made, especially for teens, so this is really good and gives the 70s and 80s kind of effect, despite technologically it resembles the current world. Not many people who watched it liked it, so did I. It was not that bad, but the story was not appealing to the 2016 audience, where so many hi-tech films hitting the screen in dystopian theme. From that perspective, it is good we have here a different kind, but not enough. It would have become one of the classic cult if it was made in the 80s or should have been updated thoroughly for making it today.6/10",High-Rise
26,tomgillespie2002,Quickly descends into incoherent anarchy,4,21 August 2016,"J.G. Ballard's 1975 novel High-Rise in one in a long line of so- called 'unfilmable' works of literature, with British producer Jeremy Thomas having tried to get a project off the ground since the 70's with Nicholas Roeg originally attached to direct. The book's darkly humorous tale of social economics and bloody violence was deemed unfit for the big screen, that is until director Ben Wheatley stepped in to take the reign with his most ambitious film yet. I've enjoyed all of Wheatley's films, especially Kill List (2011), but the sense of claustrophobia and unease that was so prevalent in his earlier works goes missing in High-Rise, which quickly descends into incoherent anarchy.The handsome and lonely Dr. Robert Laing (Tom Hiddleston) moves into a forty-story high-rise in the outskirts of London. Created by architect Anthony Royal (Jeremy Irons), the building is an innovative experiment in ultra-modern living. Complete with its own supermarket, spa, swimming pool and school, there's even little reason to go outside other than to earn money to support the lavish lifestyle. Living in the middle of the building, Laing quickly starts a relationship with single mother Charlotte (Sienna Miller), and makes friends with unhinged documentary film-maker Richard Wilder (Luke Evans) and his heavily-pregnant wife Helen (Elisabeth Moss). Soon enough, niceties are put aside as tensions mount between the different personalities and classes, and the corridors and elevators become blood-baths as the residents tear each other apart.Firstly, High-Rise looks utterly splendid, with the 1970's setting providing a ghastly and grimy backdrop for the chaos that ensues and cinematographer Laurie Rose framing many of his shots with a steely perfection, matching the cold neatness of the film's passive yet curious protagonist. The performances are all top-notch too, with Hiddleston doing no damage whatsoever to the tiresome rumours of him replacing Daniel Craig as the next James Bond, and Evans bristles with anger and unpredictability. The film works very well for the first forty minutes or so, establishing the hierarchy within the high-rise and introducing a repulsive gallery of greasy-haired weirdos (Reece Shearsmith and Tony Way) and pampered toffs (James Purefoy and Keeley Hawes).While at first Laing plays the role of the audience drinking in this madness, he almost becomes a supporting player from the middle-act, as Wheatley quickly loses focus and lets the chaos reign. There are too many characters squabbling over God-knows-what, and Wheatley struggles with translating the source material to establish a clear theme or message amidst all the barbarity on show. It shares much in common with 2013's Snowpiercer, and while Joon-ho Bong's actioner was heavily flawed, it managed to land it satirical punches far more convincingly. High-Rise seems too over-eager to bask in the violence, and gets so caught up in it that it forgets that it's also got a story to tell and characters deserving of more screen-time. I can certainly appreciate the ambition, but perhaps Wheatley wasn't ready to tell a story of such complexity.",High-Rise
27,eddie_baggins,Sadly High Rise never reaches any great heights,4,8 August 2016,"Ever since I first laid witness to British filmmaker Ben Wheatley's incredibly effective horror/thriller hybrid Kill List I marked him down as a talent that I would watch intently as he headed forward onto what would hopefully be a career that would match his undoubted potential as a unique and uncompromising filmmaker.Since Kill List's release on the unsuspecting public in 2011, Wheatley has been in talks with HBO regarding a mysterious project and delivered us the entertaining if not overly memorable oddity A Field in England and a film I found utterly disappointing Sightseers and now with what's his highest profile film to date High Rise, which unfortunately to a fan such as myself suggests Wheatley needs to get himself back on track ASAP should he indeed look to match his potential with products worthy of it.Working with wife and film making partner Amy Jump in adapting author J.G Ballard's well regarded novel of the same name, High Rise sees Wheatley lose track of himself in a cautionary tale of class and politics in an apartment complex that's not too far removed from Lucifer's very own Holiday Inn and while Wheatley's trademark dark humor and penchant for wince inducing violence remains in small doses here, not even a respectable and capable cast can save High Rise from its implosive nature.It's frustrating to say the very least that not only does Wheatley squander Ballard's vision in a misguided narrative, but squanders a cast led by Tom Hiddleston as increasingly unhinged doctor and new complex resident Dr. Laing and not even seasoned performers like John Hurt, Sienna Miller or the usually ace Luke Evans can do anything to heighten High Rise's chances of succeeding and the film as a whole feels uneasy with what it is to become, with a mismanaged flow and hazy character motivations joining together in creating a narrative that will leave many a viewer perplexed as to what in fact they have just witnessed.Perhaps a candidate for a cult like following in the forthcoming years, High Rise is a major disappointment to a Wheatley fan like myself who called the event as one of my years most anticipated and while there are glimmers of a great film within High Rise the film a whole marks a very disappointing point in Wheatley's still hopefully bright future as a filmmaker and a venture that seems to be on an endless stairway to nowhere in particular.2 paint tins out of 5",High-Rise
28,leonblackwood,A bit too strange for me! 3/10,3,25 September 2016,"Review: What the hell was this film about? I know that there was a class war going on in the building but apart from that, the movie didn't have any structure or meaning. Its based around the mid 70's in the East End of London, were Dr. Robert Laing (Tom Hiddleston), lives in a tower block were they have crazy parties, and all of the residents create a world of there own. After a while, the high rise takes on a spirit of it's own, and the upbeat, happy go lucky residents, switch to the darkside, once the electricity and water are switched off. From there, it's literally every man for himself, and everyone is fighting to survive while Robert is staying grounded and doesn't get caught up in the propaganda. The director certainly had a huge task when he took on this project, and I personally think that he made a right mess of it. I had to keep on rewinding the film because I didn't know what the hell was going on half of the time. Robert kept on having sex with different people, and then it just turned out to be one big orgy, whilst the building was falling apart, and Wilder (Luke Evans) is trying to film the destruction of the high rise. Jeremy Irons (Royal) was great as the creator of the building, who lived in a posh apartment at the top of the high rise but he soon loses the plot once everything gets out of hand. Personally, I didn't understand why people didn't just leave the building! They obviously had access to the outside world, because Robert was a successful surgeon who went to work everyday, so why did the residents stay in the high-rise! Anyway, I found the whole movie extremely far fetched and way over the top, especially in the sexual department, and the script was a right mess but in some ways, it's watchable because you really don't know what's going to happen from one scene to the next. Strange!Round-Up: Although this movie made a lose at the box office, it certainly made noise in the movie world, mainly for its outrageous scenes and unique concept. The movie was directed by Ben Wheatley, who also brought you Down Terrace, Kill List, Sightseers, A Field in England and 2 episodes of Doctor Who in 2014. He done well by getting Tom Hiddleston and Jeremy Irons on board with this film and he certainly pushed Luke Evans character to the limit but I really didn't get the moral of the story. I was hoping for a reason why these people went completely bonkers after a while but I think it's left to the audience to make up there own mind, if they can be bothered.

Yes, it's an original watch and inventively clever, but actually, especially through it's trashy moments, it becomes all too much. Through all it's madness, there is a underlying paper thin/thriller type of plot. An original indeed, but really, a movie with nowhere to go, so for it's near two hours, we have to endure crazier and crazier moments, some that had me on the verge of just turning off, as just finding it reaching the depths of stupidity, like say in Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. But the film is magnetizing, and addictively a re watch with Hiddleston, the perfect lead. There's really something about this dude. He's a doctor, or so we believe, who we find at the start, living in the trashy depths of this swank British high rise apartment, where you have to earn living status, where we meet a vast selection of oddballs, that inhabit the building, divided into classes of people, from the upper class, ostensibly pompous assholes to the sickly poor. The whole complex is run by an aging, limping, Jeremy Irons. There are moments that will shock, ala: animal cruelty, which I totally abhorred and some moments that'll amuse, but this is one of those films that has to be seen once, while it won't cater to everyone's taste. Sienna Miller was very good as the sexy, seductive room mate, living upstairs from Hiddleston, while Luke Evans really stole the show, captivating, as a loser type/wannabe documentary filmmaker. The young over pregnant girl was cute and sweet. The young kid of high intellect, Mr Peabody and Sherman type with the frames, was the real movie stealer though. Yeah, the film does make it's points, about how there should be equality, but look beyond that, it's just madness, but somewhat addictive. Based on a novel by J.D Ballard who wrote the novel for Cronenberg's '97 cult hit, Crash, I must say I was disappointed for him to write something like this, as the story doesn't have same spark or nous, and wasn't electric, like that unforgotten hit, 20 years back.",High-Rise

32,parry_na,Spoilers follow ...,8,4 May 2016,"The depiction of human society collapsing into chaos is just as relevant and prescient today, over 40 years after the original JG Ballard novel was written in 1975. Tom Hiddleston (who also narrates the audio-book version) plays Robert Laing, first seen eating the remains of an Alsatian dog, as in the book.Skipping back to three months earlier, when the complex was barely finished, and Laing is 'welcomed' into the 'High-Rise' by his fellow inhabitants, it is clear for the most part, that his manners, respect and politeness are no match for the abrasive confidence of many of his neighbours, determined to get him to 'join in,' and yet seem unwilling to accept him into their clique.When the building slides into disrepair, and the luxurious amenities become an ever-growing series of unsightly, inoperable facilities, it seems the residents' descent into pack mentality had started well before the decay of their world; if anything, the swimming pool, lifts and corridors are simply sliding into a fitting accompaniment to the residents' wilful degradation. The building is simply accepting the squalor of its occupants.The recreation of the 1970s is a conservative one, which is probably deliberate; it is doubtful how seriously we could take a story featuring the garish winged collars, flares and safari suits modelled at the time – instead we get more of a suggestion of the fashions from that era. The endlessly pregnant Helen (Elisabeth Moss), very much an innocent compared to the others, happily chain-smokes, without comment from anyone, another sign of the times.Anthony Royle (the tower-block's hierarchy?), the architect, floats around the wreckage of his dream like Dr. Moreau, surrounded by the barely human animals he has created. Jeremy Irons is every bit as good as you could imagine him to be. Typically of Ben Wheatley-directed films, the cast are universally good, and full of familiar faces, if not names. Dan Renton Skinner (better known as comic character Angelos Epithemiou) is unrecognisable as brutal Simmons, a character you long to see beaten up – which he is, by Richard Wilder (Luke Evans) who is even more Neanderthal than he. Reece Shearsmith is Nathan Steele, Sienna Miller plays Charlotte Melville, James Purefoy excels as Pangbourne, and Hiddleston is excellent as the central Laing. His character, like that of Helen, only partially succumbs to the toxic new world around them; fitting then, that they appear to form a relationship that may have a future, although nothing and no-one is exclusive.A film ostensibly about unpleasant people succumbing to their baser instinct is not necessarily a story that justifies two hours, and yet any cuts made to this would rob the film of its potency. The humans presented are us, our society, without the veneer of respectability, policing or media. The lack of interference by the outside world is cursory, which is the only unrealistic aspect of this tale: the authorities simply don't want to know.Nothing is fixed; life continues. So as civilisation settles into a discarded biryani of filth, what could be nicer than to sit back, eat the rest of the dog, and listen to a speech from Margaret Thatcher whilst waiting 'for failure to reach the second tower in the Development.'

His wife (dressed as Beau Peep) keeps a black sheep and a horse in the garden, both of which meet the same fate as the Alsatian when supplies run low.Is it an allegory of the state of British Society in the 1970s?

34,s3276169,Interesting but falls short of the mark.......,7,24 May 2016,"What to say about High Rise? In many ways its reminiscent of Snowpiercer (2013). Its a microcosm of larger society on a scale that allows us to see ourselves. Our political, social and cultural edifices, which inevitably, at some point fail and then in one form or other, recreate themselves. Unlike Snowpiercer, which capably contains and manages the transition from structured, class based society, to one of social break down and transition, High Rise, simply looses the plot. The result is this film becomes a chaotic experience, that disorientates the viewer and never really directs them ably enough, to really appreciate quite what is going on. Its a shame too, as there is a lot to like about this film. Its engaging, capturing a 70's atmosphere of technological optimism and for the first half of the film, at least, really shows us the absurdity of the modern world, we as human beings, have constructed for ourselves. The casting is excellent with lead actor, Tom Hiddleston, handing in yet another polished performance. The supporting cast are top notch too, comprised of capable, mostly UK actors, such as Jeremy Irons. Its unfortunate that the second half of this film was not handled with more care. Had it been this film could well have been an instant classic. As its stands, its just interesting. Seven out of ten from me.",High-Rise
35,TheOneThatYouWanted,Looks pretty but fails.,5,1 February 2017,"Such a shame. This film is based on an old novel with a cult following. So yeah, the concept and story behind the film are completely solid and literally there for the taking. Plus the budget for the film looks like they took a ""sky is the limit"" approach. The acting talent involved are top-tier performers who look like they gave there all.. but I think the director must have bitten more than he could chew because what should have been epic was turned into a forgettable mess. The movie is about a futuristic mega-apartment complex with all the bells and whistles, ultimately leading people into insanity thanks to class warfare, trends and etc. The major malfunction with the film is that the insanity isn't sellable because all the tenants can escape into the outside world anytime they want. The book, from what Wikipedia tells me, slowly introduces the insanity. The movie pushes the fast forward button, at the cost of the film itself. At least I have a reason to read the novel, if not just to wash away the memories of this film... which is ironically forgettable so scratch that idea! Moving on.",High-Rise

It is adapted from the anti-utopian novel of the 1970s, but it has not been improved according to the present situation, which leads to the fact that its imaginary plot is totally divorced from reality and makes people unable to understand the root cause of its occurrence and the ugliness of its imagery. As a result, the film has become a plausible farce. Plus the chaotic scenery, skipping clips and the so-called camera language make the modern audience drowsy.",High-Rise
37,Sergeant_Tibbs,Ben Wheatley's visionary potential blossoms with High-Rise.,8,21 October 2015,"After director Ben Wheatley showed what he could do on a minimal budget with A Field In England, Sightseers and Kill List, it's a relief to find that not only has he not compromised his style but he's completely blossomed. Trading the inherent conditions of fields for the pristine and organised production design a bucketload more of money and studio time it grants him, we have a director completely in their element, not only proving their potential but showing room for more growth. Granted, with Wheatley's version of his vision it's unlikely he'll break into the mainstream, but the in-built cult audience will go a long way. Along with its satiric Gilliam-esque atmosphere, High-Rise is incredibly British, but despite my lamentations of what a recent conventional British film tends to be, this is the type of film we deserve. The source material was written in 40 years ago by J. G. Ballard, and adapted here by Wheatley's wife Amy Jump, this film makes no updates to its period, contrasting the retro mid-70s vibe with their modernistic ideas for the time. The concept of a microcosm of society to demonstrate social unrest between classes is a well-worn idea – High-Rise may find a very close cousin in last year's Snowpiercer – but this is one of the more direct and slickly executed interpretations of the theme, only treading on the brink of science-fiction. It does run the risk of being far too on-the-nose, contrived and repetitious, but Wheatley's spark for surprises never leaves his grasp, justifying it with the heightened tone. It's blood-soaked, alcohol-fueled and nicotine- injected mayhem that doesn't hold back. With an array of characters, some compelling and some not, it still gets you invested in them and their impending doom in spite of how much they gleefully indulge in their primal survival instincts. Of course, the building is also a character here. We rarely step outside its view besides occasional glances at Tom Hiddleston's Dr. Robert Laing's commute and office. When we do see outside, the desolate horizon makes the building feel like a haven. The tower block is ideally a self-sustaining society. It has its own shopping market, its own gym and own swimming pool for instance, ostensibly open to anyone, but a privilege that can be taken away without warning. It's a new building, settling into its foundations, but it's seen as a way of life for many, working and living within its walls. While the doors are always open despite the eventual chaos, it's clear that the characters are systematically trapped in the tower block and wholly dependent on it. Not only trapped inside, but to their individual floors, as their stifled economic situations won't allow them to ascend. As the lower class lives in near the bottom and higher class lives near the top, a poor distribution of power cutting the bottom half off is a catalyst to upset the peace. However, given the contrasts between their two lifestyles – both of which we're given a peek through with Hiddleston's neutral audience surrogate – this clash is treated as an inevitability waiting to happen. The narrative is loose as it follows its vast ensemble, but the primary conflict emerges between the brute Richard Wilder, played by Luke Evans, a volatile spokesman for the lower class determined to expose the violence through a documentary, and the creator of the building, Royal, played by Jeremy Irons. While Hiddleston's Laing finds balance in the middle – despite taking some desperate means – his skills and seeming peace are seen as the solution to many, most importantly to those on the sinister higher levels. While Wheatley had to deal with what he had use for his previous films, a near limitless pool of resources colours High-Rise with slick cinematography and production design. It's a surreal atmosphere, quite Burton-esque without taking it to those various extremes, with its idyllic arrangements but still with undercurrents of dread. It's a boxed in world without sunlight and while everything is laid out for the characters, there's a sadness in that trap, even in the early blissed out stages of the film. The tight editing is complemented by Clint Mansell's captivating swirling score, though it does tend to get lost in its own montages. We often get disconnected from the characters and there's one dramatic leap in the narrative told through clips that may have been better sought through a finer focus. It's adamant to show us everything rather than hint. The film also relies on a lot more special effects than expected, and while they're not exactly perfect, they fit the old-school mood. Tom Hiddleston gives one of his best performances I've seen so far. He's not stealing scenes like Loki, but instead showing this relatable hollowness with his half-hearted conformity. He's well measured in how much to express, most often breaking down in isolation, but is mostly an introspective slate. However, the real scene-stealer in High-Rise is Luke Evans, an abusive misogynistic character you love to hate at first but his determination for a more respectable quest slowly grows on you. He's got the most developed and complex contradictions of the ensemble – a fighter and an artist, and a violator and a lover. His force is similar to Robert Carlyle in Trainspotting. Sienna Miller and Elisabeth Moss are tender highlights of the supporting cast while Jeremy Irons brings his reliable theatrics when necessary. Some may feel battered over the head by High-Rise, many will find it enthralling and profound. While it's thematically hardly new, the incisive execution is the ideal package and an example for the best of contemporary British cinema. 8/10Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)",High-Rise
38,tomsview,High society,4,13 May 2017,"As I watched ""High-Rise"" I couldn't help wondering how they got the money for it. That must have been some pitch.I found the film buried deep in Foxtel Australia's Masterpiece Channel, but I'm beginning to think 'Masterpiece' is a destination for films that are impossible to categorise.A brief synopsis doesn't really prepare one for this film.A stressed-out doctor (Tom Hiddleston) buys an apartment in a supposedly state-of-the art, high-rise complex. He becomes embroiled in a warped ""Animal Farm"" existence with a class structure more or less dependent on what level of the tower block one lives on. Anarchy, and then chaos ensues as everyone parties maniacally while the facilities of the building begin to fall apart.Sound intriguing? Then you probably haven't seen the movie.It's like a mad cross between the films of Terry Gilliam and Peter Greenaway. There were sound pillars on which to construct ""High-Rise"" including likable actors: Tom Hiddleston with charm to spare as the doctor, and Jeremy Irons exuding gravitas as the architect who designed the building. Gorgeous Sienna Miller is also in it, but she is hard to recognise under dark hair, dirt and dried blood - I could never love a movie that treated her like that.The film has a classy score by Clint Mansell and brilliant special effects, but did J.G. Ballard's prose actually seem all that filmable? Brecht claimed that, ""Art is not a mirror to hold up to society, but a hammer with which to shape it"". All the hammer does in ""High-Rise"" is beat your brains out.And the smoking. I haven't seen that much cigarette smoking by actors this side of the millennium - it is truly breathtaking in more ways than one.""High-Rise"" not only failed to expand my cinematic horizons, but it also committed the cardinal sin for a film - it's tedious. At two hours, it takes a long time to make any point at all.",High-Rise
39,Screen_Blitz,Tom Hiddleston gracefully stands out above the overall misguided mess,5,20 September 2016,"Tom Hiddleston is an easily respectable actor, especially when considering the charisma h delivers as the Marvel villain Loki in 'Thor' and the massive box office hit 'The Avengers'. Placing this fine actor in the center role in this dystopian thriller based on J.G Ballard's novel could had the potential of being a solid source of entertainment, if only director Ben Wheatley's efforts paid off. Sadly, this chaotic two-hour dystopian extraganza never quite lands. Though it is not say this film doesn't have its grace from some fantastic performances by an immersive cast and moments of admiration, Wheatley's efforts in adapting J.G Ballard's cult novel result in a film that more often than not feels misguided in its attempts to present a message about the collapse of society. When the end credits arrive, much of this feels like a missed opportunity. Set in 1970s, this film stars Tom Hiddleston as Laing, a handsome architect who finds a new home in London in tall, forty- story tower block full of where residents bath in endless luxury including sex, drinks, parties; and seclude themselves from the outside world beyond their work hours. Settling in he forms an unexpected relationship with single mother Charlotte (played by Sienna Miller) and makes friends with a pregnant women named Helen (played by Elizabeth Moss), her tough-as-nails husband Wilder (played by Luke Evans) along with the tower owner Royal (played by Jeremy Irons). When the wealthy and lower class collide however, tensions begin to erupt to the point of extreme hostility that leads the residents of the tower into a mass anarchy.The film starts somewhat promising as we are introduced to the lead character in the aftermath of the chaos that ensues, then the film flashes back three months before the whole dreadful incident. This is when we are introduced to a wide plethora of characters that the story luckily takes some time to develop, and the beautifully constructed tower filmed with sweet cinematography by Laurie Rose; while indulging into a near endless orgy of sex and nudity. From there on, the plot slowly dissolves into a sluggish incoherent mess with everyone engaging into a violent, gory sequence of all-out warfare that ends in casualties. The biggest problems is not only fails to take the time to explain why all the chaos happen, but the plot feels like it's trying to formulate a message of how collision of the high class and the low class can result in a certain collapse in society. The message may sound strange in some sorts, but the bigger dilemma here is that it ends up lost in a sea of ambiguous storytelling that the film never really knows what it is trying to say. While the scenes featuring the violent chaos between the residents offer some great moments of emotional tension and gravitas, they rarely escalate into anything effective. Easily the most polished aspect the film offers is the ingenious performance by Tom Hiddleston who brings a fair sense of charm and humanity in his role, a character who isn't too hard to like or sympathize with. Along his side are Sienna Miller, Luke Evans, and Jeremy Irons who bring their fair shares of dark humor and spectacle in their roles, but nothing that rises above Hiddleston in the bargain. High Rise is a messy dystopian thriller that never quite rises above the leve of average, nor does it offer anything remarkable beyond a solid performance by Tom Hiddleston. Sure, there are some thrills and a solid trade of darkly funny material to be handed, but Ben Wheatley's directorial efforts on bringing this adaptation of J.G Ballard's source material to life don't quite pay off.",High-Rise
40,pyrocitor,S.O.S. - yuppie style,6,8 October 2015,"Before Fonzi notoriously 'jumped the shark', the go-to, classical-standards-be-damned punchline for subversive '70s comedy was, apparently, 'kill the dog'. National Lampoon magazine drew some coveted notoriety from a magazine cover flaunting the gleeful threat of moral violation. And then there's J.G. Ballard's High-Rise, here cinematically adapted by A Field in England oddball Ben Wheatley, which not only has its cake, but eats it too. If cake were a dog. Um.About as confusing, misguided, and distasteful a metaphor as you can imagine? Probably – but it fits Wheatley's film especially well, then. High-Rise's incisive satire about social performativity, conformity, and the social class discrepancies left to descend from hyperbolic madness into bloody chaos still plays well, with a snide undercurrent critiquing the retro- trendiness of hipster culture, even if the obnoxiously yuppie culture of high-rise inhabitants likely felt a bit more topical when the novel was written 40 years ago. The first half of Wheatley's film is sharper and more cutting, but the second act descends into mess, violent mayhem, and inevitable cannibalism too quickly for it to not feel somewhat aimless and unmotivated. Sure, there are key structuring moments – a series of extensive power outrages, where shoddy apartment construction is mistaken for exploitation of the bourgeoisie – here represented as the inhabitants of the 'lower floors' – some yuppie parties of escalating ferocity, and one of the most gruesome pool parties in cinematic history, but, for the most part, the descent into chaos is coded as ambiguously 'just because'. This Lord of the Flies approach is, conceptually, viciously funny, but Wheatley's direction, playing it all as surrealist art cinema, results in a sluggish, plodding pace, leaving audiences fidgety, so that even the apocalyptic chaos of the latter half is unnecessarily snoozy. Why do the inhabitants not simply leave the high-rise, instead of sliding into rape, murder, and feudal mess, living off bonfires and purloined supermarket goods? Aye, there's the satirical rub, but it wears thin with insufficient clever lines substantiating the inhabitants' self- imposed stagnation (surely there's some sort of ""hard to get a flat in London, innit?"" gag to be made?). By the time we conclude with a Thatcher voice-over, so forced it actually drew groans from our audience, there's an indisputable feeling of things being taken too far, the metaphor trod to death, and the point moot. This is not to say all is lost. Some moments of artful insanity work better than others – a string quartet cover of ABBA's S.O.S. accompanying a prissy Elizabethan-era costume party is particularly gleefully inspired (Clint Mansell's musical score is eerily apropos throughout), while an initially triumphant chant of ""Swimming pool! Swimming pool! Swimming pool!"" becomes a memorably gruesome dirge retroactively. Wheatley has a keen eye for beautifully weird imagery, refracting hundreds of sombre Tom Hiddlestons in a bismuth crystalline elevator, while the stark, chic modernism of the high rise complex shot in atmospheric long shot over a seemingly endless parking lot transforms into an increasingly apocalyptic monolith as the film progresses. Still – its an odd feeling to be in the midst dog-and-people- eat-dog anarchic revolt and lament the loss of more focused, buttoned-up snark of the film's early days. If nothing else, the film's cast all excel, unearthing treasure troves of character and charisma amidst the somewhat bland archetypes the script leaves them with. Tom Hiddleston, in a rare but welcome starring role, is unquestionably the show's strongest asset. He's frequently shirtless and dances, so the film comes with a built-in Tumblr audience from the get-go, but it's worth checking out for his nuanced and subtle performance as well, hiding the right reservoirs of pain and madness under a veneer of immaculate calm about to crack. Luke Evans is also spectacular, in full-on voracious, nearly feral scene-stealing mode as a wannabe documentarian turned anarchic piledriver behind the revolution. Sienna Miller and Elisabeth Moss each impress as apartment residents negotiating different strands of the social infrastructure as the mad parties descend into pure madness, while Jeremy Irons is a great comedic foil as the building's architect, fussily oblivious as the pretentious world he has constructed crumbles around him.Wheatley's film has often been compared to Fawlty Towers as directed by David Lynch (while also owing a lot to Jean-Luc Godard's similarly nihilistic social class satire Weekend), but there was far more method to Cleese's madness than is on display here. In terms of dystopic class allegories about societal revolt and occasional cannibalism, 2013's Snowpiercer flips the entire tale horizontally onto a train, and does a better job to boot. As it stands, High-Rise is, like its residents, fun and classy at first, but it's important to get out while the going is good before it all goes to hell - in more than one way. -6.5/10",High-Rise

As the title suggests, the movie is set in a high rise building, the less wealthy on the lower floors, the elite at the top, i.e allegorical to modern society. The acting is great and the visuals are superb, but the message the Director (Ben Wheatley) has to convey is rather blurred until the very end, and all we have for the most part are debauched parties.

43,brchthethird,"Visually stylish, but frequently dull",6,10 May 2016,"Maybe I went in with my expectations too high (mostly because of Tom Hiddleston), but after only really enjoying one of four films by Ben Wheatley so far, I'm beginning to think that maybe he isn't for me. That's not to say that HIGH-RISE isn't well-crafted, because it is. I just found it hard to really engage with it on a deeper level than the audiovisual components, and some of the performances. What really killed it for me, although there were a number of great moments to be had, was the slack pacing. It also didn't help that there wasn't any likable characters to get behind other than Tom Hiddleston, who wasn't used as much I would have liked. The premise is rather simple: a large group of well-to-do people who live in a skyscraper descend into anarchy when power and water run short. Basically, the thesis is that, given a lack of necessary resources, society will revert to their more primitive instincts, and this takes the form of class warfare. Pretty accurate, if a little overdone by this point. J.G. Ballard's work has been successfully adapted before (although some might argue that point) with David Cronenberg's CRASH, but here the material didn't quite feel fresh, as social satires about class struggle have been done many times over. Keeping the film set in a retro-futuristic 1970's was a nice touch that worked, given the universality of the themes, but it seemed more like a stylistic choice than one organic to the story being told. The strongest elements the film were the production design, score, and the cinematography. All of these worked in tandem to give the effect of being slick and polished, with a detached ""cool"" factor that I liked. There was even one sequence which could have been its own music video. Ultimately, though, I found my mind frequently drifting, waiting to be jolted out of my boredom, but that never really happened to my satisfaction. HIGH-RISE isn't a bad movie, per se, but I will say that it wasn't for me.",High-Rise
44,joebloggscity,Tom Hiddleston in Kafa-esque nightmare....,6,30 May 2016,"This isn't one film to take at face value. Very subversive, the film begins with our familiar face of Tom Hiddleston covered in blood in some apartment flat! We then rewind to 3 months back to explain what has happened. Based in some 1970s high-rise block (very 2000AD style), this building was designed as a utopia with the wealthiest settling in the top flats. Instead it turns in a dystopia, as the residents are stuck in some narcissistic and parochial void.Civil & class war is breaking out and nothing is clear cut. Tom Hiddleston's character though is dressed and fitted as if he is from 20-30 years later, so it's too obvious a way for us to relate to him. Anyhow, he has to survive in this world, but gets sucked in.This film reminded me of some 'horror' videos from the 1990's, wasn't uncommon in those days (films like 'Society' etc), and it was an interesting change. We have a very surreal look here in this film, and it's clichéd in style & outlook for the 1970's (which reflects the vanity of the residents).Despite the originality, it didn't work for me. It's probably 30mins too long and that saps the interest out of it as they stretched the film. Too often you can't follow what is going on. You never empathise with anyone in this film as they try to live in their own vacuous worlds.It's an interesting film but it definitely will only appeal to a minority, as I guess it was always going to looking at the premise.

I was open to it and when I didn't get it immediately, I waited for things to clear up. By the time that the 3/4 mark though I knew it was time to throw in the towel. If some people find this entertaining, good for them but I found this movie to be uneventful and pretentious.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After a quick flash forward to the future (I'm not going to talk about that, it would give too much away) we are introduced to Dr. Thomas Laing (Tom Hiddleston). He's moving into the new high-rise apartment on the 26th floor. He's looking for a change and these ultra-modern buildings designed by Royal (Jeremy Irons) should be what he's looking for. He's a physiologist, he fits into the approximate middle class in the building. He makes friends with some of his neighbours including: Charlotte (Sienna Miller), Wilder (Luke Evans) and his wife Helen (Elizabeth Moss). He even hooks up with Charlotte. There is a strict hierarchy between the floors, you're only supposed to associate with people so far above or below you. He's invited up to meet Royal who he gets along with despite their income gap and some of the elitist things that Royal likes to say. Weird things start to happen though, the power starts to blink and tension grows between the tenants. It gets so bad that the situation becomes a powder-keg and when there's a suicide from an influential tenant, the situation escalates into a full blown dystopian state.I always start with the stuff I enjoyed when it comes to movies that I didn't like. High-Rise looks pretty good for the most part. The production design, the costuming and how they choose to shoot the environment is impressive. There's one scene near the end where they show you what it would look like through a kid's kaleidoscope that's pretty cool visually. I also liked some of the acting, I think Luke Evans stole the show. I'm used to him being very stoic but he really dives into this and he's pretty creepy. I'm also more impressed every time I see Sienna Miller. She was great in Live By Night and she's pretty decent here.I'm really not criticizing the source material, I just don't believe it translates to film. This movie desperately needed a narrator and some exposition to explain what was going on. There was almost no context and because the movie isn't based on a strong story, it's hard to determine what's going on. There's also not a lot of plot progression either and the movie is pretty ambiguous about the time that has elapsed which clouds things even more. I don't mind when the movie doesn't treat the audience like kids and relies on you to fill in the gaps but it was like the movie wanted to give me a test on a subject I had little to no experience with.If the movie wasn't going to go heavy on the plot, I wish it could have given me some characters I wanted to root for. We get so little information about Laing and he's so cold and emotionless, you can't get attached to him. Charlotte and Helen have very little personality and Royal and the other rich characters are just jerks. I actually liked Wilder best until he went completely off the rails.This wasn't the worst movie I've seen lately but it's pretty close. I didn't go into this movie wanting to hate it, I knew it would be on the artsy side but I could still appreciate it if it were good. It wasn't though and I can't recommend this to anyone besides fans of Ballar's work.",High-Rise
49,rubenm,Too incoherent to convey a clear message,4,10 July 2016,"Is High-Rise an anti-capitalist manifesto, meant to show the evil of inequality? Is it an attack on the British class society? Is it meant to show how modern architecture alienates people from each other? Or is it just a succession of weird scenes, giving the director the opportunity to show off? There's something to say for all of the above, but I'm inclined towards the last. The film really is too incoherent to convey a clear message or idea. The metaphor of a huge high-rise building to symbolize society at large is interesting, but could have been better expressed. As it is now, the metaphor gets mostly lost in an avalanche of weird, decadent or shocking scenes. As a viewer, you keep waiting for the story to become clear, but it never really happens.This is even more annoying because the film is much too long, and already from the start it's clear how it ends because the whole story is one large flash back. The result is zero suspense and maximum weariness.",High-Rise

and the carnage in the bottom floors, I don't quite understand. I guess it de-volved. It is vaguely reminiscent of ""Brazil"" - in social structure,unfortunately while it starts off with promise- Tom & Jeremy- it goes nowhere slowly. I wanted to see the end, to see where they landed. I didn't understand the electricity shortage- is it the building- or everywhere- the lack of food, you don't have to leave to shop -big box store floor15- and why was everyone killing each other? in rubble. is the whole city, country like this? the blood and mayhem goes to the top floor.

51,edgeofreality,Sadly incoherent but memorable,7,3 March 2020,"Aside from Jeremy Irons, who manages to be sympathetic even here, this film paints a lurid picture of unsympathetic people in a cruel, hierarchical society that gradually implodes. When you read Ballard's book the narrator's voice is what holds you and takes you through the nightmarish plot. The narrator's downward spiral seems natural and is almost imperceptible until it's too late. The film does not capture this sort of cohesion in narration. It probably would have worked better if it did not start at the chaotic end and flashback, and if the editing was not so fast and showy, but if it moved at a more measured pace, slowly creating a real 'stable' world which it could then tear apart. As it is, the people and society in this film are unpleasant from the word go, and if anything, become a bit more likable when they openly lose all inhibition and turn nasty. Again, only Jeremy Irons emerges as sympathetic or even interesting. For all that, I still enjoyed the nastiness at times - the sheer energy with which it relentlessly attacks the viewer, the look of the production design, bits of music - or muzak - effectively used, and the way the film reveals a certain brittle btchiness underneath our polite society - though it was unclear to me if, like the book, it is set in the 70s, or some post-modern mishmash of periods.",High-Rise
52,CineMuseFilms,a bleakly dark dystopian tale with a heavy handed political message,7,21 August 2016,"If you see High Rise (2015) and are not familiar with dystopian film you may be in for a shock. Utopia is all things good whereas dystopia is more about human transgression and social nihilism. As a cinematic device it explores the limits of normality by depicting the extremes of abnormality through breakdowns in social, political and moral systems. It is often linked with science fiction, fantasy or absurdist comedy and invites questioning of the taken-for-granted realities around us. This is exactly how High Rise works.Based on the novel by JG Ballard, the film is set in a 1970s high-rise tower designed by an eminent architect called Royal (Jeremy Irons). The floors are rigidly hierarchical like the train carriages in the film Snowpiercer (2013) with rich people having the best facilities and poor people enduring the worst. The film's protagonist is the newly-arrived Dr Robert Laing (Tom Huddleston) who has fled London city for self-contained high-rise living to avoid other people. He qualifies for the 25th level of the 40 floor building and his middle class status means he is sneered at from above and despised from below. His romantic interests cut across class boundaries and resident bully boys unleash havoc. The building's water and power supply problems hit the lower-floors and when food runs out residents eat dog food and pets become victims. Class tensions flare into chaos with suicide, bashings, killings, drugs and public fornication in this insular world surrounded by desolate concrete car parks. Like in Lord of the Flies, without civilisation there is barbarism and without the apparatus of law and order the haves must defend their privileges from the have-nots. In the film's closing minutes Margaret Thatcher's voice proclaims that only capitalism can provide true political freedom.Remaining faithful to a book imposes creative constraints but in this case less may have been more. Many scenes are so frenzied that it is impossible to make sense of who is doing what to whom. The bleakly dark filming palette adds to the disorientation with frequent flashbacks and scene merges leaving the viewer unsure of the boundaries between reality, dreams, hallucinations and fantasy. If that is the director's intention, then it works well. The two main characters play strong roles, with Huddleston providing a nuanced fusion of intellect, curiosity and madness, while the legendary Jeremy Irons needs only to play himself in depicting the rattled brilliance of an upper-class landlord. Disturbingly provocative rather than enjoyable, it is an interesting film with a heavy- handed message.",High-Rise

56,dr_clarke_2,Visually enticing - if occasionally nauseating - and hugely entertaining,7,16 February 2021,"It took film producer Jeremy Thomas over four decades to bring J. G. Ballard's novel High-Rise to the big screen; having wanted to adapt it since the 1970s, he finally managed it in 2015, with up-and-coming British auteur director Ben Wheatley at the helm, fresh from directing his fourth feature, the folk-horror cult favourite A Field in England. And for the most part, it was worth the wait.
Based on a screenplay written by Wheatley's wife Amy Jump, High-Rise opens - like Ballard's novel - with Dr Robert Laing eating the leg of a dog in the broken down, corpse-littered high rise building that he lives in, before the narrative flashes back three months to reveal how things got to that point. Jump's screenplay adheres quite closely to the caustically witty novel, with socioeconomic themes carried over; thus, the rich live on the top floors of the tower block and the less well off at the bottom. The different levels of the social strata soon start to chaff and architect Anthony Royal's carefully planned and self-contained utopia rapidly starts to turn into a vision of hell. As society begins to break down, so too does the building, which is beset by power cuts and lift breakdowns. Symbolically, the fruit in the building's supermarket starts to rot and as the shelves starts to empty, brutal fights erupt over tins of paint. Like the novel, the film appears to be set in the seventies, as evidenced by the cars, costumes and copious cigarette smoking; cheekily, Wheatley brings to a close with an extract from a speech by Margaret Thatcher from 1976, retrospectively tying together Ballard's dystopian vision with Thatcher's Britain.
By the time he made High-Rise, Wheatley had already demonstrated his ability to blend stomach-churning horror and razor-sharp satire in Kill List and Sightseers as well as the aforementioned A Field in England, and he does it again here with brilliantly revolting results, from Laing skinning a human head as part of a pathology lesson at the start, to the mutilated corpses that litter the building by the end. But this isn't just an exercise in gore: having made an asset of location filming in the English countryside for several of his previous films, here Wheatley creates a nightmarish scenario against a backdrop of superbly well designed angular studio sets that he manages to make simultaneously claustrophobic and starkly spacious. Cinematographer Laurie Rose produces some gorgeous, dreamlike camera work, exploiting the quirks of the sets (especially the mirrored walls the lift) to striking effect and Wheatley's tendency for surreal touches is evident in sequences such as Munrow's slow-motion leap to his death. Chaotic montages reflect the disintegration of both society within the tower and Laing's sanity; memorably, Wilder's death is filmed both in slow motion and through a kaleidoscope. Clint Mansell (formerly of Pop Will Eat Itself) composes the elegant, often haunting score, which suits Wheatley's vision perfectly.
With (presumably) a bigger budget to play with than on his previous films, Wheatley also assembles an A-list cast, lead by Tom Hiddleston who gives a convincing performance as Laing, a perpetual outsider who is socially awkward and doesn't fit in easily in any level of the building. He's joined by a charismatic and often astonishing Luke Evans as Wilder (possibly, Laing opines, the sanest man in the building), Sienna Miller as the seductive Charlotte, the great Jeremy Irons as the arrogant old Royal, and Keeley Hawes as Royal's parasitic yet abused wife. Even the minor parts are filled with talented actors, including British comic actors Reece Shearsmith and Dan Skinner as creepy orthodontist Steele and the taciturn, bullying Skinner. Elizabeth Moss of A Handmaid's Tale fame plays Wilder's meek, heavily pregnant wife Helen.
If there's a flaw here, it is that by the final third of the film, the plot is running out of steam, especially as the audience knows how the story will end, but it remains compellingly repulsive. Wheatley had already demonstrated his abilities with his previous films, but High-Rise showed that with more money to play with he could achieve even great things; it isn't perfect, but it is visually enticing - if occasionally nauseating - and hugely entertaining.",High-Rise
57,Rendanlovell,Aimless but stylish enough to work,7,7 May 2016,"Like 'Enders Game', 'High Rise' was once considered one book that would never be translated to film. It was deemed unfilmable for many other reasons than 'Enders Game' was but, I just brought this up to reinforce my point that film these days is really breaking new boundaries. That aside, lets talk about 'High Rise'. This film has a very Stanley Kubrick vibe to it. Much of the story is very reminiscent of 'A Clockwork Orange' and even the costume and production design bore a stark resemblance to that film. Being a big Kubrick fan, this caught me a bit off guard but it also really had me amped to see where this film would go. And it goes a lot of places. This is it's greatest strength and greatest weakness. Near the beginning of the film it's hard not to get bored. The story seems to meander around quite a little bit not really wanting to commit to a story or character to drive the film. And in the end, it still wasn't driven by either one.It was driven more by its message. A message that is, understandably, politically pointed. It has a lot to say about human nature and government. But it's sometimes hard to tell what it's actually trying to say. There are times where it pushes it's message in your face and other times where it's very muddled as to what it's saying.Needless to say, the story is not great. Despite the flaws and the unsatisfying feeling I had coming out of this, it grew on me over the past few days. I found myself randomly thinking about specific scenes either to try and decipher them or too (oddly enough) relive them. The more I thought about it the more I realized that it was the little things this film did that put me over the edge about its ultimate quality.It's a very well directed, stylish film. While it certainly proves that Wheatley is a style over substance kind of director at least he knows what good style is. Like I said earlier, the production design and costumes are awesome. Much like Kubricks films these small details give us a lot of information without the film having to explain everything. The way the hair styling and costumes were suggest that this takes place a few decades ago.But the production design establishes a futuristic feel. This subtly in style helps us pick up on many things like passage of time, time period, and the social commentary the film is hinting at. All this is complemented by great direction and superb cinematography. Every shot is so incredibly unique that the composition of the frame is enough to carry us through the most brutally dull moments.While there are a few the film is mostly well paced. This has a lot to do with its characters and performances. Each main character is consistently well written and easy to understand. And each actor that portrays them did a fantastic job. Tom Hiddleston, Luke Evans, and Jeremy Irons are the back bone of this film. Watching these great actors bounce off each other made for a riveting watch.Although I had a couple other issues with this film like, passage of time and some poor execution in crucial moments, this is overall a solid movie. It puts its actors in the for front and gives them interesting material to work with. This all makes for a highly entertaining, stylish dip into madness.",High-Rise

59,ghost_dog86,"""High-Rise"" review",3,12 June 2016,"Maybe after watching ""Snowpiercer"" and the Terry Gilliam canon, director Ben Wheatley decided to make a movie about people in a confined location, broken down into class systems, until all hell breaks loose (adapted from a novel by J.G. Ballard).Synopsis: In a future where dogs are consumed and drowned, a bunch of people live in a high-rise and act peculiar. There are meant to be five buildings with a grand lake in the middle, acting as a palm of sorts (and the buildings are the fingers). This particular high-rise is the first one to be completed and seems to be all encompassing; there is a supermarket on the 15th floor, an entire floor dedicated to playing squash on, etc; with the wealthy living on the upper floors and the working-class on the lower. A doctor (played by Tom Hiddleston) moves in, but seems like a fish out of water within the upper class. It doesn't help that everyone seems to know his business before he opens his mouth and that he begins to be put into very awkward Gilliam-esque social situations, time and time again.With the best cinematography I've seen in any film all year, at many times ""High-Rise"" displays storytelling that can only be described as ""incoherent""; except for every establishing shot, which shows Wheatley's eye for spatial recognition (you are always aware of how high in up in the building you are at all times). But if you're looking for a coherent storyline, then look elsewhere. And if you make it to the second hour, you will only become more frustrated and more visually put-off by the nonsensical plot developments.Final Thought: ""High-Rise"" seems to have a point about class systems being evil, but I don't know what it is saying that hasn't been said before, with much less ""abstract meaning within the meaningless"" sequences. Thus, the overall issue comes down to the fact that without a doubt 90% of audiences either won't grasp onto the odd little eccentricities that moves this story forward or won't care enough to do so; basically giving up on this beautiful looking train-wreck, eventually.",High-Rise

61,digdog-785-717538,Not my kind of film,6,9 May 2016,"I will shadow Nina on this one, as i feel her review hits the nail on the head. High Rise is, accurately described, a series of vignettes which never come together.So, High Rise is the *extremely surreal* story of a man who moves into a high rise apartment; once there, he finds that the other tenants have unusual behaviours, i.e. they seem to be involved into some kind of mind games with the rest of the tenants.What starts like a series of picturesque encounters, soon starts to dominate the life of the lead and the other characters, who lose touch with the outside, normal world, and find themselves entangled by the ""rules"" of the building, finally descending into chaos and madness.There, that is the theme of High Rise; a series of more and more surreal, disturbing scenes, where the search of existentialism eventually gives all the wrong answers. I'm not totally extraneous to this kind of filmmaking, but i find High Rise to be somewhat inconclusive .. rather than hiding a profound message, or even not-so-profound, as Delicatessen did, it just tries to confuse the viewer, goes its own roundabout way, and never seems to take responsibility for our enjoyment - which possibly is the idea behind the film in the first place. But, are we supposed to praise it, because of this?I would not recommend High Rise.Sure, it's got William Hurt, and it's rather well done, but i have a feeling most people would find it really never goes anywhere. It's about as appealing as the ramblings of a drunk man, claiming to be about to reveal the truths of the universe, but actually never saying anything that makes sense.But, don't let my criticism decide for you - it's not the worst film i've seen.My vote: a lukewarm 6/10.",High-Rise

65,abouhelier-r,High-Rise,6,10 April 2016,"Life for the residents of a tower begins to run out of control.High-Rise is the adaptation of J.G. Ballard's 1975 novel, directed by Ben Wheatley and starring Tom Hiddleston as Dr. Robert Laing. I didn't really know what to expect from this movie, as I did not read the book, so I came at it from a fresh perspective. This film is a quasi-period piece, which is not completely irrelevant to a Britain in which buy-to-let apartment block exist. It is a blank, affectless world with a certain type of sci-fi and satirical Englishness. This tale is quite a bizarre, sleek, seedy and mad spectacle. If Jeremy Iron's roles in Dead Ringer and M.Butterfly provide a roundabout link to Cronenberg, so does a med-school scene where the skin of a cadaver's head is peeled away in a kind of metaphor for society's thin surface. That and his wife parading around like some postmodern Marie Antoinette, on a horse. In fact, the core cast is brilliant. Tom Hiddleston is terrifically nonchalant, giving a great performance as the lead character: dry and self-possessed. A charming and charismatic performance with a hint of internal sadness. Plus, Miller makes bright work of Charlotte. Mark Tildesley's lavish production design ranges from mouldering fruit bowls to posh parties decadent enough to cause a French Revolution. Decadence, despair and violence are all around, in a kind of ongoing erotic catastrophe. The screenwriters played out this scenario as a retro-futuristic sci-fi allegory - Ballard was writing the near-future in the mid-70s: Wheatley and Jump smartly stick with a period they know well. I loved the film's refusal of ""normal"" storytelling, bold visual style with these gorgeous shots and vibrant colours. Combined with the editing, shots have a dream- like surreal quality, a colourful beginning contrasted by the end with a dark shadow feeling. The soundtrack was great, there is two scenes especially where there's this string quartet playing an ABBA song and later on it gets remix, it was probably one of my favourite scenes - as well as this very interesting naked scene on the balcony that might also be of some interest to some of you. Finally, for some High-Rise could be frustrating and the specific references to Margaret Thatcher era doesn't quite work as a whole.Overall, High-Rise has a vibe of ""you want to look away but you really can't"". This film is an excellent allegory for society, it lingers in the mind with some strong visuals, good soundtrack and more than decent acting.",High-Rise
66,mrpicky,If you smart enough,7,15 August 2016,"High-Rise is a very graphic and honest dissection of post modern society. It is full of countless metaphors and carefully noted truths about it. Our lives are full of pointless running around driven by nothing but evanescent desires. And any attempt in bringing some order actually only makes things worse. The idea behind the horror we witnessed in High-rise sounds like that: all attempts of structuring the society fail and end in blood but this will teach future generations as autopsy does for medical science. I, personally, disagree with Ballard,as I do not see any progress at all, but, anyway, he did a very good job showing where we are. With amazing thoroughness he presents most of existing ""social clubs"", classes, human animal nature, our sins, the different drive everyone has in his life, the hate toward each other as interest inevitably collide. All that in a small story. Amazing work. Not attentive audience that seeks entertainment, not a mind challenge- was, obviously, disappointed. Plot mistakenly can look like it laсks structure, but it has a good one if you understand what a perfect metaphor it is for modern society. It may be a perfect book-club novel as it is an ""Eldorado"" of a conversation topics. My personal beef with it only unnecessary and unrepresentative tumbling into orgy several times.

67,danielharden,What goes up must come down,5,21 March 2016,"High Rise is a film about the social class system and hierarchy within a tower block and how it all comes crumpling down. This could well be a microcosm of today's society or that of the 70's to which it was written. But that's just my interpretation.Ben Wheatley's Direction of the film was good. Together with the Director of photography Laurie Rose, the two create some rather intriguing and surreal images with meaning embedded such as; when Laing doesn't get the memo about the Victorian era dress code for a party (connoting an inability to escape the ways of the past), and a display of fruit at varying stages of decay (representative of the tower block) etc etc.Although the film is visually intriguing, the same cannot be said for the films plot and it's progression. This film is a thriller that will have you firmly in your seat, not balancing on it's edge. The films script was rather uninteresting, as your mind may easily wonder from the events taking place. I have heard that this is an adaptation that stays true to the source material, so this may be more of a critique of the book to which the film is based of, rather than Amy Jump's screenplay adaptation.Overall, the film is visually beautiful with its slo mo suicide scene and it's 70's sideburns and whatnot.

Eventually I literally had no clue what was going on, other than all characters began down a partying path to degradation and ruin.That basically sums up this piece of crud. The actors were excellent and well known who obviously felt that by taking a pay check on this one that they were in some form or other contributing to film art. I am sure that the hipster art crowd in Hollywood are singing the praises of this movie to their friends saying that it is the most 'avante-grade' work since David Lynch's Inland Empire (another art movie that makes little to no sense as it applies to the art-scene).Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate a director wanting to make some art film that is different and unique, but I have to draw the line when it gets this discombobulated. I know for a fact that most people will agree with my opinion on this flick. If it was something that had a clear and understandable plot, while maintaining a fresh, at times shocking and sobering fringe art feel....something like A Clockwork Orange, well that one worked for me just fine and it was 'arty'.I gave this movie a 3 only because the actors were quite good at portraying their characters (as wacky as they were). The plot I could barely follow, but somehow managed. The music was the only true winner in this film, as it was well done along with audio and some catchy singing and beats.

The pieces and ideas were in plain sight, it just doesn't do a very good job of selling itself other than to be a very hipsterish artsy set piece. It doesn't help that as stated all the people are just awful without exception so you don't even care. Luke Evans is pretty great but Tom hiddleston plays a bland unlikeable wet towel and you have to watch him be yawn worthy for 2 hours. I'm not sure its his fault. I think they were trying too hard not to offend the source material. Watching society breakdown was better done in Children of Men, watching posh upperclass act crazy was done better in American psycho.",High-Rise
74,Hawkensian,"High-Rise's allegory of class divide gets lost in a dull montage of blood, sweat and blue paint",5,17 April 2016,"Ben Wheatley is one of the most exciting British directors working today. His two best films are Kill List, a deeply disturbing horror/thriller about a tormented contract killer, and Sightseers, a black comedy about a troubled couple on their parochial, psychopathic honeymoon.Key to these films' success are strong characters with interesting dynamics. Kill List begins almost like a domestic kitchen-sink drama centred on the failing relationship between Jay (Neil Maskell) and Shel (MyAnna Burning), but it subsequently evolves, or rather devolves, into something dark, dank and horrible in a most unpredictable manner. Sightseers may be most commonly remembered for its scenes of outlandish violence, such as when Chris (Steve Oram) deliberately runs over a litterer in a fit of righteous anger. However, underneath the comic outbursts of gore is the poignant relationship between Chris and Tina (Alice Lowe), an oddball pair with a past of loneliness and insecurity.Having proved himself as a director of visceral horror and emotional substance, Ben Wheatley is the natural choice to direct J.G. Ballard's High-Rise, a Goldingesque tale of violent class war exploding within a brutalist tower block. The fragility of civilisation, and the primitive savagery that lurks beneath it, is a darkly fascinating subject that has made for excellent films and books, such as Threads, a devastating vision of post- apocalyptic Britain, and William Golding's Lord of the Flies, which needs no introduction.High-Rise does not brush shoulders with such works, for its allegory of class divide gets lost in a dull montage of blood, sweat and blue paint. Oh, and dancing air hostesses, for reasons that are, to put it politely, enigmatic.The focal characters – Robert Laing (Tom Hiddleston), a measured, middle class doctor; Charlotte Melville (Sienna Miller), a sultry woman who serves as Laing's gateway in to upper floors' high culture; Richard Wilder (Luke Evans), a pugnaciously aspirational documentary maker; and Anthony Royal (Jeremy Irons), the patrician architect who designed the building – are introduced well enough, but ultimately do not receive sufficient development.As the lead and perhaps most relatable character, we are in the body of Laing when he traverses the tower's social scene, which he admits to 'not being very good at'. Some may find him steely, but Laing has an affable reserve and high emotional intelligence. He isn't particularly interested in the petty one-upmanship that comes with climbing the social ladder, but he manages to deftly negotiate it anyway through his insouciant reserve that maintains peoples' interest and disarms any potential enemies. Hiddleston, one of Britain's hottest exports, is well cast here, he delivers the best performance of the film.However, after a competent introduction to society in the high rise, Laing and the others get lost in an incoherent narrative that favours aesthetics and absurdity over credible character interplay. It begins three months ahead of the main events, showing a blood spattered Laing roasting a dog's leg over a fire surrounded by dirt and detritus. After the introductory period of around thirty minutes, the film then charts what led to this repellent spectacle with a disjointed series of set pieces that give little sense of progression.Electrical problems are plaguing the building and resentment is brewing between the upper and lower floors, but the descent into nihilism just happens. Dogs are being drowned, Laing's painting his apartment (and himself) like a total madman and the whole building becomes a rubbish-strewn nightmare – but there's no tension, no crescendo, no credibility and, curiously, no one who considers leaving! The worsening relations should have been more gradual and given much greater depth and meaning by the characters, their dialogue and their relationships. Instead, the main character covers himself in paint to communicate his increasingly aberrant state of mind, which appears to be an obvious metaphor for tribal decorations.High-Rise fails as a film about primal savagery and particularly as a film about class. In Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine, I cringed as Jasmine and her husband Hal, arrogant members of New York high society, barely contained their raging superiority complexes as they awkwardly condescended to Ginger (Jasmine's sister) and Augie, a decidedly blue collar couple who wonder at Hal and Jasmine's luxurious home. No such realist interplay is to be found in High-Rise, because its characters are thinly drawn and it isn't rooted in reality, which is very much to its detriment.Towards the film's end, there are moments in which Royal and his minions discuss the politics and future of the tower, with Royal remarking that the lower floors should be 'Balkanised', meaning that they should be fragmented and pitted against each other in a manner reminiscent of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. I liked the use of that phrase, there should have been a lot more of this in the script, more overt political manoeuvring rather than surrealist claptrap and brutalist 70s chic.Alas, Wheatley's High-Rise is more concerned with aesthetics and the 1970s, which means there's more in the way of shag-pile carpets, dodgy hair and the colour brown than developed characters, coherent narrative structure and sociopolitical substance.58%www.hawkensian.com",High-Rise
75,tmpsvita,A brilliant and interesting movie similar to Snowpiercer for some aspects,7,5 April 2018,"If in ""Snowpiercer"" it was a train here it is a building, a skyscraper to be precise, which represents, both metaphorically and explicitly, a society that is structured on several levels going to create a certain social hierarchy similar to the one in which we live every day but represented in a clearer way.
In ""Snowpiercer"", a film I loved and which has several points in common with this, this had been made more sad, grim and resigned; here in ""High-Rise"" instead it was represented in a completely different way: extreme, absurd but credible in its grotesque and exasperated context.
This gives the film a unique personality and a certainly special and complex atmosphere.
Unfortunately, its initial security in what it says and shows is lost in some points and especially in the final part, in which the screenplay becomes more confusing and slightly less convincing.
But in general the film is a brilliant, even if not completely original, experience that reflects how a poorly managed management, even just a small group of people that constitutes a society, can not work, even more so if the social strata are so close together and net at the same time.
Beautiful cinematography that colors the film with tones and nuances perfectly suited to the type of film that is, excellent scenery.
Experimental and over the top lines that in all ways seeks, and partly successfully, to distinguish itself from all the commercial products to which we are usually accustomed.
Excellent interpretations, especially that of Luke Evans and Tom Hiddleston, pity however for a characterization of the characters a bit 'hasty.",High-Rise
76,phiggins,The impossibility of adaptation,4,30 March 2016,"When asked by Terry Gilliam how he would go about adapting 'Watchmen' for the cinema, Alan Moore replied, 'I wouldn't'. Wise man. The point being that great (or even just interesting) books are meant to be books. Not films, not operas, not concept albums or paintings or sculptures. Books. Moore wrote 'Watchmen' as a graphic novel. J.G. Ballard wrote 'High-Rise' as a work of prose fiction. If either of them had wanted to write a film screenplay they would (and could) have done so. But they didn't. Ballard's work has never had much luck on the cinema screen: 'Crash' was, well, a car-crash (and not a very sexy one) while 'Empire of the Sun' was, you know, OK. Not exactly essential. Bit like the book, really. Ben Wheatley, a director I admire a great deal, should have heeded the warnings: stay away from Ballard - his best work is un-adaptable. No good could possibly come of trying to turn 'High-Rise' into a film. But, hey, when he was done, perhaps someone could come along and turn it back into a book. Why not? Wheatley's second mistake (the first one was to get involved in this sorry exercise at all) was to cast his film with an array of sitcom gurners like Reese Shearsmith (a perfectly good actor when under control) and the bloke who says 'Twat' in 'House of Fools.' Also on board are at least two other Wheatley regulars - that fat bloke who died horribly in 'Sightseers' and the brilliant star of 'Kill List' (which remains Wheatley's finest movie). Non-sitcom stars (Miller, Purefoy, Irons, Hawes, Hiddleston and others) have been encouraged to over-act. Only Hawes and Hiddleston disobey. Their performances are actually bearable. No-one else escapes with much dignity intact. But the movie as a whole does nobody any favours. The dialogue is atrocious, either cut-and-pasted from Ballard (what works on the page does not work when being spoken out loud) or invented purely for our listening pleasure. The repetitive and hypnotic nature of the events of the book become, in the film, merely repetitive. The music is good. The final insult, however, comes with an unsubtle crow-barring-in of a reference to Margaret Thatcher, which is so out of place and insultingly stupid it managed the impossible: it made me actually feel sorry for her - what on earth had she done to deserve getting embroiled in this mess? My advice? Avoid 'High-Rise'. If only the film-makers had done the same.",High-Rise
77,antoniokowatsch,Incoherence incarnate,4,5 March 2017,"This might just be the most incoherent movie I've ever seen. Nothing makes any sense. Things just happen but there's no real anticipation or causality behind it. At first I thought that maybe I just didn't get it but when I re-watched the movie with some friends they seemed equally confused.The entire movie can basically be summarized in 3 words: parties, fornication, and violence. All the characters do in this movie is throwing parties and sleeping around with one another. It should come to no surprise that things gradually escalate to the point of a total SNAFU.The entire premise of the movie makes absolutely no sense once you realize that none of the raping and bloodshed would have taken place if someone just picked up a phone and called the police. But apparently none of the protagonists were intelligent enough to conceive this idea. And don't forget that the tenants could've left at any time if they so desired. But apparently the possibility of getting raped and killed off is not reason enough to leave the building (sarcasm).

Just as I said about ""Last Exit To Brooklyn"", you'll have a hard time getting this into movie length and an even harder time getting an audience who hasn't read the book to follow along.Looks like that happened. A very tough book to make into a movie (as was ""Crash"", whose basic contention had to be forgotten..) but very close to the tenor of the book. I liked it. I also liked ""Crash"". I liked the books better. But both were valiant attempts to put some pretty-far-out concepts on screen, obviously not to the liking of the public judging by the ""reviews"" here.

Or rather post-party scenes. Characters sitting around in piles of rubbish, smoking and drinking. Time seems to be passing, days come and go - but nothing is developing. Everyone still seems to be sitting around after the same party. It's impossible to draw any meaning from it.It's also unclear and confusing as to why none of the characters seek help from the outside world. It's almost like it doesn't exist. Yet we see the protagonist several times going to work outside of the apartments. We also see a policeman come to visit. So the outside world does in fact exist, but for unexplained reasons the characters are unable to leave. It's unsatisfying.",High-Rise

85,CinePendejo,We get it! They have sex and kill each other! What else you got?,6,30 April 2016,"I'll be honest, I got a little hesitant after hearing about a new adaptation of an old dystopian classic. In an age where people, me especially, get infuriated or exhausted for every HUNGER GAMES knock-off gets released, it is a shame where even movies with the pitch ""based on the classic novel"" gets more derivative today than in their peak. Seriously, do you realize how successful THE GIVER and ENDERS GAME would've been before THE HUNGER GAMES? Sad as it may seem, it comes as no surprise; after all, there is so much angles you can cover in these movies that has not been recycled elsewhere.Which is why I am almost glad that director Ben Wheatley manages to show a near unique approach for HIGH-RISE, a movie based on the classic JG Ballard novel. It takes a familiar premise (what if in SNOWPIERCER, they used a giant apartment tower instead of a train to separate the middle, poor, and wealthy class) and brings exploitation level edge to the movie; an elegant, GREAT GATSBY-style commentary on the class system at first, but then transcends to edgy and haphazard mayhem in the film's final stretch. And while I admire this experiment as much as Wheatley's directing skills to go with it, the movie, however, turns up into a huge mess. Despite what it accomplishes (acting, directing, music, novel style) HIGH-RISE ultimately comes off as a stumbling and weirdly unsettling. But first, our premise. In the near future, classes of society are now inhabiting a giant apartment complex led by an architect played by Jeremy Irons. Despite a divide between the working class, the poor, and the wealthy, the building provides all of society's amenities like gyms, supermarkets, parties, and state- of-the-art life systems. Tom Hiddleston plays a middle-grade doctor who moves in to the High Rise and is lovely greeted by the other wealthy individuals, played by Luke Evans and Sienna Miller. But once a power-outage hits the tower, all the lower class bursts out and cause mayhem all throughout the place, while the upper class engulf into the madness themselves.Right off the bat, this is a very different intention when it comes to the genre. Instead of issuing a warning of economic crisis via exaggeration in a dystopian society, HIGH-RISE pretty much just commentates on it, that the whole class system benefits from one another and any sort of major issue would cause massive outbreak. It's an accessible perspective, but the execution is all over the place once the first act flies by. The characters never transcend beyond tedious metaphors, the plot clearly trudges through its thin second half, and the supposed edgy depictions of immorality looks silly and drawn- out. Hell, despite Hiddleston's charismatic performance, there is ultimately no point or clear thematic meaning to his character outside of the film constantly making reference to his sister's tragic death. Luke Evans character comes close to being almost interesting, as a former documentary filmmaker who decides to film the deterioration of the tower. Speaking of which, the movie clearly doesn't explore much of its concept as much as it thinks it is. How are the poor people dealing with the life on the lower floors of the building? Does it comment about how we treat about minorities? Are women in this building anything more other than sex toys and/or vile tools for male masculinity? These barely get any attention, as the film too often keeps the perspective on the middle to high floors and explores their emotional delirium rather repetitively. Yes, they party too roughly and almost kill themselves. Yes, they have sex almost constantly. Yes, the women are treated so vilely that we should feel bad for them despite their thinly etched characters. Is that really all you can show? Most of this would've at least look intriguing instead of either getting stale or never transcend beyond the dull standard portrayal of rape, murder and drugs. I get that Ben Wheatley tries to bring an uneasiness to his films to explore emotional psyche, but it seems too random and without much point. I mean c'mon, I have yet to find someone who actually classifies ""A FIELD IN ENGLAND"" something other than ""random BS"". The worst part about this movie is how much saving graces this movie has to almost recommend for. The acting is top-notch, the cinematography is great, the classic music is elegant and lovely, and the message, however sloppy and played-out at this point, gives more to think about. But once digging below the surface, I would not be surprised if anyone would be put off (or even just get confused) by its tedium. See it and judge for yourself. Rating: 6/10 (OKAY)",High-Rise
86,ConsistentlyFalconer,Claustrophobic insanity,8,10 May 2016,"If you're looking for a faithful adaptation of the book - plotwise - you'll be disappointed.

90,bartonj2410,Utterly bonkers yet devilishly funny,9,17 October 2015,"My first taste of this year's BFI London Film Festival was Ben Wheatley's High-Rise, a film based on the 1975 novel of the same name by J.G. Ballard. High-Rise is one of the more bizarre films you could wish to see but its perfect blend of out-there characters and devilish humour make it one of the most mesmerising films of the last few years.In 1975 London, Dr Robert Laing (Tom Hiddleston) is a young doctor seduced by the lifestyle in a high-rise, created by Anthony Royal (Jeremy Irons) as an isolated community cut off from the rest of society.Laing meets many of the high-rise's residents and soon realises that normality isn't something easy to find on any of the floors. One of the residents, Richard Wilder (Luke Evans), who works as a documentary filmmaker, takes it upon himself to expose the class injustices that come as a way of life in the high-rise, causing a dangerous social situation to arise and social groups breaking up into violent tribes.Believe it or not, High-Rise is the first Ben Wheatley film I have seen however, if this is anything to go by, I will need to check out the rest of his filmography right away. Wheatley has that rare quality as a filmmaker to make a film feel unique within its genre, with High- Rise being quite unlike many thrillers I've ever seen.The film is brilliantly written by Amy Jump, a long time collaborator with Wheatley, with the twisted characters clashing throughout with the equally twisted screenplay devilishly weaving its way from floor to floor. The social commentary that both the book and film delves into regarding the developments in technology warping the human psyche is such an interesting aspect of the story and one that resonates very loud and clear in today's world.The performances in High-Rise play a massive part in making it such an engrossing watch. Each and every one of the actors delves right into the psyche of their respective character and look like they're having an absolute blast taking them on such a downward spiral. Tom Hiddleston just oozes class and yet again delivers a fine performance, though for me, the most impressive performance comes from Luke Evans as the mentally tortured Wilder. The film is also shot incredibly well, with Mark Tildesley's production design being brought to life through some wonderful cinematography from another long time collaborator with Wheatley, Laurie Rose. Clint Mansell's menacing score really does bring that sense of impending chaos to the fore and accompanies the film's visuals very effectively.Of course, with any film as bonkers as High-Rise, comes the chance that audiences may feel alienated from the plot and characters however, if you are willing to switch your mind to escape mode, High-Rise may prove as captivating to you as it was to me.",High-Rise
91,samthejudgeamos,I thought I had drunk too much and had missed something important that gave clarity to the plot,3,6 August 2021,"But no, it truly didn't really have a coherent story. I'm not sure why everyone stayed in the building and only Tom hiddleston left to go to work, it seemed perfectly habitable outside.I watched it because of the raft of good uk actors but what a waste of time and I have to now cross Hiddleston and Keely Hawes off my list of ""safe to watch, they never do anything awful""",High-Rise
92,TheBarleyGuy,A strange one to be sure.,6,15 May 2016,"Having been a huge fan of director Ben Wheatley's past works Kill List and Sightseers, and having been baffled by A Field in England, I approached High-Rise with a mix of excitement and apprehension. There's no denying that this lived up to both of those expectations, and at the end of it I almost feel like I need to watch it again. Not because I missed something, but because I don't really know how to process how I feel about it.My intention was initially to review this for my horror website but I don't you can peg High-Rise as a horror. IMDb calls it a drama, and I guess that's closer, but it seems to toe the line between thriller, comedy, and drama. This tight-rope act gives the film a precarious and disorienting feel, that I'm positive were deliberate choices.High-Rise reminds me, on some level, of the David Cronenberg film Rabid. Less (no) body horror, but the breakdown of a building full of people leading to anarchy, death, and chaos did strike me as familiar.Hemming and hawing aside, the question remains: How was the movie?Pretty good actually; the base story is simplistic, but the presentation does tread into the bizarre more than once. What really holds the film together are the performances. The cast is incredibly strong, and there is a whole lot of screen presence in one place. Leading the cast is Tom Hiddleston (Crimson Peak), who doesn't seem to know how not to be electric on screen. Alongside him star Jeremy Irons (Batman V. Superman), Sienna Miller (Foxcatcher), Luke Evans (Furious 7), and Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men) with enough actors who will make you go ""Oh hey, it's that guy!"" to make for a fun scavenger hunt.There is a familiar level of brutality present in this movie, though significantly less than Kill List, so if you have seen his past films, you will have at least some idea of what you're getting yourself into. The focus does seem to be more focused on the characters in the building over the violence, or even the plot.One of the most interesting things, to me anyways, about this movie is how out-of-time it feels. I've read a few places that it is based in the 1970s, which makes sense as that is when the source novel was written in the 70s, but the movie doesn't feel explicitly based in any period. The casual clothing seems to be based in the 70s, but beyond that it seems to be nearly dystopian. At least in the high rise.If you're looking for something a bit strange with some great performances, this is absolutely the one to check out. Wheatley is an interesting filmmaker with a great track record, that along should give you some comfort. Check it out.",High-Rise

101,anthony-727,A failure on every floor,2,24 June 2017,"The question intriguing me after watching High Rise wasn't whether it had sufficiently excoriated the class system, as the writer and director seem to have hoped it would, but whether they had understood Ballard's remarkable book at all. Clumsily, almost as an afterthought, the film closes (and it's not a spoiler to say this) with a cheap political shot against 'capitalism'. How very 'Spitting Image'. But Ballard was better and smarter than that. The societal collapse he was describing was just as much a feature of socialist, fascist or communist societies. His Swiftian vision of mankind wasn't restricted to the fashionable political fetishes of the day but to man himself. An even greater irony is that the failure of the High Rise project stems from the fact that it was a planned project at all - which hardly bangs the drum for the sort of social re-engineering, statism and enforced egalitarianism the film makers seem to be suggesting would be preferable. Indeed, the supermarket stocked with nothing but unbranded products called to mind the Soviet Union rather more than Walmart, and it is strange that the director didn't realise this.It's hard to ignore the heavy-handed sixth form political wallpaper but even if one can, the film is still a weak average. Tom Hiddleston is as detached and android like as Ballard's Laing has to be, though one wonders if he has anything else to him as this does appear to be his stock in trade performance, but the rest of the cast hams and camps it up adequately. The orgies, however, get as tiring and passionless for the viewer as they must have been for the participants, and even the choreographed violence lacks any of the dangerously seductive grace of Kubrick's Clockwork Orange - they are simply unpleasant but not even shocking.It is hard to make a film suggesting a dystopian future by setting it in a past which, clearly, those who made it were too young to have experienced. On balance, I wish they had left it someone else.",High-Rise
102,nando1301-1,Pretentious rubbish,1,10 April 2016,"A nice idea gone awfully wrong. The first 20 minutes are actually quite good: the art design is worthy of all the prizes you could award it, and the director builds a growing tension that keeps you interested, although you already know, from the first five minutes, that the likely outcome is that everything will fall apart, since ""the building"" is clearly a metaphor for ""modern"" society. However, even predictable plots can be interesting, and initially this seems to be the case.Then, the film loses its grip and very quickly becomes an endless repetition of chaos. By the 30min mark the director has made his point: society sucks and if things continue as they are, we will all descend into primitive behaviour and act like barbarians. Nothing wrong with that message per se, but the film gets stuck on it like a broken record and treats the audience to an endless stream of pointless violence, mindless sex orgies, rapes, more violence, looting, social chaos, still more violence. It's like beating a dead horse and then continuing to beat it until you are beating the skeleton of a dead horse (and you continue beating it).It seems that the writer and director were so in love with the core message that they could not quite get around to developing it and finishing it properly.I saw this at a cinema in London; some people left half-way into it (most seats were empty anyway). I managed to sit through the whole thing, hoping that the movie would redeem itself towards the end; it only got worse. This might be at the top of my ""worst films of all time"" list.The acting is not bad, the cast is good, and the art design is still deserving awards; but the overall result is just appalling. It would have made a great short film, if they stopped it at 30 minutes. The way it was released, at 119 minutes, it is 90 minutes too long.",High-Rise

The script is shoddy and the edit, at times, incomprehensible. I found the choices of which characters to loose and which were created out of nowhere (or drastically changed) to be based purely on someones idea of what would be ""cool"" and did nothing to move along the underlying discomfort of the story itself. Female characters are marginalized or changed into catty go-go girls, and the male characters are all brutish before their allotted time. The result is an incomprehensible jumble. Where the novel flows like a putrid river, the film stumbles and shambles about completely missing the (granted) complex social commentary on class structure that J. G. Ballard went to such pains to construct. It IS beautifully shot. Decors are exquisite and the acting is marvelous at times. So, coupons le poire en deux - 5 stars.",High-Rise

The outcome is a  frustrating severance from a plot that is at its strongest during the  few scenes in which it invests wholly into the dark aspects of the  remote Armageddon. The usual suspect of needlessly excessive comedy is  partially to blame, but not more so than a superfluous use of montages,  which seem more concerned with putting 'High Rise' into art-house  discussions than engaging us into subject matter we yearn to invest  into from a more fathomable perspective.",High-Rise

The poor reviews of the film would probably be just as confused by the book, a classic Ballard which takes an ordinary situation (although relatively new when he wrote it in the early 1970s), a self-contained skyscraper, and allows it to degenerate into a modern jungle. Those who know Ballard well and admire him as I do might be apprehensive about any film version of his work, but so far the three I've seen are spot-on, the perverse hilarity of ""Crash"", Spielberg's maudlin but effective ""Empire of the Sun"", and now this. The decision to set the story back in an alternative, dystopian '70s is a good one, because it is hard to imagine this story set in our future...even though the brilliant thing about the book (less the film) is the way Ballard made this strange descent into primitive madness seem not merely interesting, but inevitable.",High-Rise
111,horitaj,Why none of the characters left the building boggles me,6,5 September 2016,"""High-Rise"" is directed by Ben Wheatley and adapted from the 1975 novel of the same name which was written by J.G. Ballard. The film follows the character of Dr. Robert Laing, a physiologist who just recently moved into the 25th floor of the first of five high-rise apartments. Laing is soon introduced to Anthony Royal, the architect who lives on the very top floor, and Richard Wilder, a brute man who's a television documentarian who lives on the second floor with his pregnant wife and children. When the tension between the lower floors and the upper floors start rise conflict starts occurring. Soon war parties are being formed and eventually each floor is left to fend for themselves. The performances and the cinematography for the film definitely stand out the most. Wheatley takes his dark turn which he does in every single one of his films and overall works for the purpose of the film. The film has a blend of dark humor with graphic violence and chaos to definitely keep you entertained.The film starts to fall apart after the first act. With such a strong opening the film just loses its momentum and becomes violently senseless. The transition from normal to chaos was definitely being built up, but to what purpose? When the quote on quote s*** hits the fan the movie loses its structure and becomes pointless. The film literally becomes senseless violence.The motives the characters have during the chaos is unexplainable and the decisions and actions they make are appalling. Soon things just don't make sense at all and you're completely lost and just watching sexually violent actions unfold.This could have all been solved with a purpose to the story, a plot, and structure. From my previous viewing of Wheatley's ""Kill List"" (2011) and now ""High-Rise"", I couldn't help but feel that the two films lacked structure. Both films take turns and don't have a real purpose to them and just bounce around a lot. If ""High-Rise"" was more well structured I think Wheatley would've had a much more successful film than the one he has right now.The film has a very sloppy narrative, one second you're at a party with Tom Hiddleston then the next moment you're watching Jeremy Irons strangle a dog to death. (FYI there's a lot of abuse towards animals in the film) The second and third acts feel like 5 minute vignettes that Wheatley shot to puzzle together, and I do think it was intentional if he did it that way. Now I do understand why things happened the way they did in the film I just wish it was more specific with how and why it happened because it took me quite a while to figure it out. Overall ""High-Rise"" kept me entertained even during the senseless violence and the lack of structure the film had. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a fan of Ben Wheatley's films or if you like J.G. Ballard's work. I haven't read the book but that's on the top of my bucket list.",High-Rise

But should also note that I believe having less familiarity with the material made for a far greater experience.In some ways, this film has me still thinking about what took place over the 119 min runtime. So much happens, yet in such a subtle way. I can say with high certainty that one viewing does not do this film justice, and encourage a second (or even third)!A physiologist named Laing has recently moved into a high-rise and begins to discover the buildings politics regarding social status. The general idea being that the higher floor a person resides on, the higher social status they have achieved.Many have claimed this was confusing and difficult to interpret. But I must stress the extensive amount of symbolism which can be attained throughout.I think it best to only offer this brief setup for the film, and encourage readers not to pass up this unique experience.

115,jen-lynx,A cunning and brilliant interpretation of Ballard's shocking 1970s novel,9,30 April 2016,"Whoever managed to give Ben Wheatley a budget and an all star cast did the cinematic world a huge favor. I have spent many months preparing for this film. I read the book first, then watched three Ben Wheatley films to familiarize myself with the director, read and watched countless interviews and articles, and then topped it off by watching the film Ben Wheatley recommended to Tom Hiddleston as a foundation upon which to build his character, ""The Conformist"". ""High-Rise"" was a bit much to take in on my first viewing, but my second round really sealed my appreciation. The story takes place in a futuristic high-rise apartment building where everything is provided... schools, shops, pools, and pedestrian spaces. There is something for everyone in the high-rise. It depicts the perhaps inevitable societal breakdown of a culture trapped in a confined space. Thanks to the unique vision of Ben Wheatley, the set of High-Rise is actually a throwback to the 1970s done in what might be considered future for then. Jump's script sums it up with Laing's voice over saying ""Sometimes he found it hard to believe they weren't living in a future that hadn't already taken place"". This is the kind of movie that really fuels my obsession with cinema. It is surreal, unique, passionate, intellectual, and makes the viewer work for the reward. The acting is beyond reproach, Laurie Rose's cinematography is brilliant, the soundtrack is excellent, and this has to be Amy Jump's best script yet. This movie will be the cult film of tomorrow. I streamed the film because I was too impatient to wait for the theatrical release in May, but I will certainly go see it on a proper screen and will buy the blu for my collection, if for no other reason than to see the film with subtitles.",High-Rise
116,codexniagra,I won't damn it.,8,3 August 2021,"Wheatley doesn't like to sign-post what's going on in his films. He can, if you look at something like Sightseers or Free Fire, both of which are entertaining, but I think with this and A Field In England and maybe some other works of his, they're self-consciously ""art"", so he won't lead the viewer by the hand through it. It makes them much harder to watch but I think it's a good thing, it keeps your mind engaged, not just a passive viewing experience. It's enriching, like a good book.Complaints that the metaphor is ""lost"" seem redundant, who needs another metaphor for class inequality? You can just re-watch Snowpiercer or something if all you care about is a rehashing of the same ideas. There's plenty of trashy fiction that does it. Or re-read the book, if you want the original. At least this tries to do something new with the material.Maybe there are too many people who watched some Marvel movies, saw that Tom Hiddleston was in this and came here expecting more of the same.",High-Rise

118,RaoulGonzo,"Stylish and darkly humorous, at times ugly and unsettling!",8,25 March 2016,"High-Rise is director Ben Wheatley's 5th full length feature (Down Terrace, Kill List, Sightseers, A Field in England) his biggest budget and his most ambitious. An adaptation of J.G. Ballards novel of the same name, although I haven't read the book I do hear that it's a pretty faithful telling. The film is full of stunning imagery and crammed with dreamlike (and at times nightmarish) moments. It seems to be one big metaphor on social status and class systems.Neurologist Dr. Laing (Tom Hiddleston) moves into a futuristic looking tower block in the 1970's. Only to see the new society crumble into age old violence.The main character of the film is the High-Rise itself, the whole movie set/shot within its walls barring the brief commute to Laing's office. The Architect (Jeremy Irons) goal was for a seemingly self sustaining society with everything needed to survive and thrive having its own supermarket and gym etc. It's also mentioned at one point that one of the tenants hasn't left the building in years. Although still dealing with ""teething"" problems with regular power outages and chute blockages (A catalyst for the violence that arise between the levels). The question can be asked as to why the inhabitants don't just leave the complex once the chaos starts? As the doors are always open but it's clear these people seem to be wholly dependent on it. Trapped on their levels of society and unable to move any further up.The performances are great all round with nice turn-outs from Seinna Miller and Elisabeth Moss but for me Luke Evans as the (in the end) savage Richard Wilder steals the show a seemingly natural leader for the lower levels who becomes devoted to exposing the violence and mayhem that's descending within the buildings walls, and the creator himself Jeremy Irons is fantastic as usual giving a slightly ethereal feel to the proceedings. Tom Hiddleston is our centerpiece and our eye amongst the chaos being able to shift between classes. Excellent in the role (and between this and the BBC drama John Le Carre's The Night Manager) it's clear to see why he has become the icon/sex symbol he is.The main strength of the film is not the at times over convoluted plot or the loose narrative but the visual flair and bravura showmanship that Ben Wheatley and his crew deliver. Some of the Slow-Motion shots are breathtaking (Similar to the technique he showed in the minute budget for A Field In England) I feel he has only enhanced his reputation where some directors who have made good films with low budgets fail given the much larger scale to work with. The editing is tight and add to that Clint Mansell's brilliant score which elevates what is happening on screen building tension and atmosphere where there should be none. There is also a great cover of Abba's SOS which works ever so well.High-Rise is certainly not without its flaws the plot is all over the place at times to which certainly in the last third the plot kind of becomes irrelevant a next to non-existent narrative making it hard to follow. All that in turn makes it suffer with a lack of empathy with many of the characters and once the mayhem and unpleasantness is in full swing the violence can feel monotonous, making the third act tension free and meaningless. The performances and the arresting cinematography keeps your eyes peeled even if your attention to the plot is wavering.Darkly humorous and at time ugly and unsettling certainly flawed but undoubtedly entertaining/repulsive. A bold picture that's definitely not for everyone but for me it's exciting to see what Ben Wheatley and co come up with next.",High-Rise

The film looks incredible. The cast are stellar. The film is a mixed bag though - very mixed. A reviewer on IMDb stated the film gets a message across and then continues to flog the dead horse, even when the skeleton is all that remains - and that is somewhat true. The film is certainly too long and I as yet have not read Ballards book but intend to ASAP.The message is unclear to me - a power struggle? Corruption at the top tearing society apart? The film almost obsessively shows extreme hedonism, drink, drugs, sex, orgies all gradually getting bigger and dirtier as the building rots and the ideal of living in one place that can fulfill your needs spirals badly, quickly into violence and degradation.... living at the top or the bottom of the High Rise matters not it would seem - you will still be a drunken hedonistic lunatic grasping for something better at any cost.The film certainly leaves you with no hope for society to live as one if a class system remains -- is the film trying to have a go at capitalism and social structure? Is it attacking the Thatcher years? I shall watch this again at some point soon, but not before I read the book.Ben Wheatley continues to impress me and if he is making some cinematic scenes as art for arts sake then go for it - he makes some incredible scenes that assault the senses.Oh and again the cast are bloody marvelous.",High-Rise

Much of the filmresembled a TV movie, and it really misfired in the delivery of the philosophical elements, because it tried so hard to be ironically comedic, and was drenched in its own pretexts.

No; the film isn't gonna be everyone's cup of tea but it's by no means boring and keeps you entertained almost to the end credits.

These people went out for a work, they could simply move anywhere else if they didn't like this skyscraper. They could went out anytime they wanted, nobody kept them there by force, they could call police at least, but instead they decided to stay there with unworking electricity and lots of other problems. It's just unlogic thing! 2) Why i must believe that the character who was Neither fish nor flesh (except a few moments) somehow got all the power in the end of the story (or women just choose him to comfort them, why?) 3) some characters talked about this building as if it was a living being, well, if it was really supposed that skyscraper is the main character of this movie then it should be shown somehow.

133,l-r-patrick,horrendous,1,19 October 2017,"Absolutely terrible! Worst film I have watched this year. I like Ben Wheatley, I really liked Kill List and Sightseers was fun too, but this takes the biscuit, quite shocking to be honest at how bad it is. The cast are good, but the story is a bunch of mumbo jumbo, Tom Hiddleston had a dream sequence early on, which was quite funny as the whole film seemed like a weird bizarre dream sequence that did not really make sense. The film was trying to be clever, but it was not, it just amazes me what the BFI puts money into and proves to me that its not what the story is about, but more about who you are and who you've got attached to your project, there's an irony about the social ladder here. There was no diversity, even the dog was white, I think it was set in the seventies, so there would have been minorities in the UK then, unless that was meant to be another supposed clever part about the story, hah, hah. As I was watching it, I became more amazed as it went along, I could not believe what I was watching and neither could my friends, was a couple of funny lines ""You made him"", but not much else was entertaining to say the least all made for approximately $20million!",High-Rise

Here, I guess you could say these were Hiddleston fans who wanted a bit more of him with his top off... but to be honest, I think they were just bored. I was. I should have walked too. As another reviewer here has written, JG Ballard can't be adapted for the screen. He's about right. That's the main problem - the script is a mess, both pretentious and trite, also very pleased with itself. Performances are uneven, and nothing much happens - for example, there is talk of a lobotomy, but that's about it. It's cobblers. Never has anarchic behaviour seemed to tedious and naff. Well worth avoiding, despite a couple of promising moments - the costume party, for example, and the thug who says 'You won't be needing that' - both of which director Wheatley fails to capitalise on.

136,cb2369,Solid,8,18 May 2016,"High Rise isn't just a movie about insane people; it also seems to be a movie created by insane people. This is the kind of feeling you get when you watch the first montage in the film, which comes at about the 30 minute mark and sits in place of the actual drama of the story, leaving you with a movie that's less about the destruction of the High Rise and more about the immediate aftermath of the destruction of the High Rise. It's an incredibly strange narrative choice, though I imagine it was made by Ballard and not Wheatley/Jump, the husband/wife director/writer collaborators, and I imagine it's the exact reason, along with the rest of the strange narrative and visual directions this film takes, why so many people have been giving it bad reviews. The movie is incredibly loose by design. Someone else on here used the term, ""a series of vignettes,"" and that's quite accurate. It feels like you're watching a series of vignettes, as the whole film slowly achieves perfect nightmare status, ending with a Brian De Palma- esque kaleidoscope shot. What I'm trying to say is, this isn't your typical dystopian film, but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. I actually quite enjoyed it. I spent most of the time smiling with brief intermissions for the really horrifying stuff. It's just an original, fun, movie that you wouldn't be able to find anywhere else.

137,laufeyson-64475,"Disturbing, Insane, Mind-Bending, Real and a Guilty Pleasure!",10,28 April 2016,"This movie is not for everyone. I'm sure it is also not intended to be. I'm certain that you have to be a realist to understand the message in the movie (not even a pessimist!), as it shows human psychology very well - that somehow everyone keeps a beast within oneself. Some manage to tame it, some unleash it with appalling consequences. The movie is based on the dystopian eponymous novel by J.G. Ballard. I don't think that it's a fiction which shows the far future. I can already sense the human mania today. Greed, jealousy, racism, yearning for attention and fame...and many other quirky notions are highly present, not because of high-rise buildings, as it was something new in the 70s, but because of the social media in general. I've witnessed many moments, where someone totally went bonkers because his WLAN got disconnected. Does this sound familiar to anyone?First of all, a huge thumbs up to Laurie Rose for the sublime cinematography. I think the most prominent reason why this movie gets so much attention is because of his craftsmanship. The second aspect definitely is the awesome cast. When you have Jeremy Irons, Tom Hiddleston, James Purefoy, and Keeley Hawes, then you can be sure that even if the movie is not good, they will still own the scenes they are in! For me, the script is shaggy, as it has plot holes, such as the intentions of all the people and their obsessions are unclear and why they can't leave the high-rise, why no police comes for investigations, etc..etc. The 2nd half is too long, the editing is odd, some scenes could have been longer, some must've been shorter. The ending is abrupt without any clear conclusion, nor does the last track suit the ending. The movie could've definitely been better with a more profound focus on the characters and the editing of the movie.Luke Evans surprised me a lot in his vicious supporting role (as Richard Wilder), as he shines a lot through it and I really think that instead of romantic and passive lead roles, he should do more powerful villain roles or comedies. He can really act, which I couldn't see in his mediocre big-budget movies. I'm also quite happy having watched Tom Hiddleston in a unique performance after a truly awfully directed and scripted movie Crimson Peak (where he is still excellent alongside Jessica Chastain). I also think that although Hiddleston's role here is a slightly passive one, it is not that composed and sedate as his Adam in Jim Jarmusch's Only Lovers Left Alive (which movie I also loved). If I hadn't known him as Loki from the Thor franchise films, I would've definitely looked his name up and watched all his movies after watching him in High-Rise, because he exhibits a neurotic side of himself with his intense acting as Dr.Laing, who is unconcerned, immoral, yet panicked, and amiable. Although Tom shows a very different side of himself in this movie, I can sense his real self in the character of Laing. Giving the impression of a calm and sane man, he ends up being the most insane. If you want to watch this movie, you should be warned that it is not animal-friendly with lots of violence concerning humans and animals. It doesn't actually deserve a 10/10, what I've given it, but I really love mindfuck movies (psychological thrillers/horrors), and I enjoyed the performances in it a lot. It didn't give me the feeling of an indie film, or rather of a low-budget film, as it is rich and colourful in many aspects. That's why I want to see more stuff like that and want people to support such films ;) Well done, Ben Wheatley!",High-Rise

There is a huge gross out factor, and caution if you are an animal lover.However, despite some huge weaknesses, the film is visually interesting and at times lovely. The film compares different classes (always of interest to the English) as they degenerate into chaos due to some unknown factor which lives them without power or food for a few days.Of course, I could watch everything Tom Hiddleston does. Sienna Miller was slightly wasted. Supporting actors such as Jeremy Irons and James Purefoy are underused. A stand out performance from Luke Moss and Elisabeth Moss as the true blue collar couple.

Basically its about a high rise apartment block which degenerates in a Lord of the Flies fashion. The point of the film is pretty much the idea that isolation from others develops a further need for isolation, and less positive social interaction. As things progress to become darker and darker, the high rise becomes the whole world for these people and the desire to control, or conquer, their environment is all consuming. Bear in mind that the book was written in a time where this type of living wasn't the norm, and it was a fearful look at how, at the time, this kind of living could affect people.

145,adrin-65078,What a carry-on.,2,17 July 2016,"J G Ballard's works are a grounded writing project of observation and analysis that is guided by metaphysical speculation. In Ballard's work it is his characters state of mind and speculative psychology that interpret structures and events generated by the built environment. The Ballard characters understand life as a rhizome of interconnected abstract forces that shape and mould their destinies. His work is a virtual dissection of modernism probing through the skin of contemporary life in order to expose a collective para-sympathetic nervous system as it responds and adapts to the provocations of the new order; a thought experiment that tests the careers of physical bodies and their prosthetic extensions into cars airplanes hermetically sealed structures and media. The novels record new connections and paradigms of psychic possibilities in response to the changing order of existence. For Ballard it is not so much that the traditional drives governing human behaviour have changed. Rather that they are warped and distorted and cannibalised by the new parabolic connections and geometries of modern living. In the actual novel High Rise, Wilder speculates whilst he and one of the continuity girls from the studio are making love. He imagines that if they were interrupted, that on resumption of their enjoyment she would pick up perfectly from the place where they had left off, recalling every one of their gestures thrusts caresses and kisses that had proceeded the interruption. Or in Love and Napalm USA the character equates the bend of a elevated highway with the inner curve of Jackie Kennedy's thigh, linking them in a future of blood caked deaths. Ballard doesn't do characters so much as types or occupations. In effect all his characters are introjected self imaginings of states of consciousness moulded by an outer function: the cost accountant, the orthodontist, the airline pilot.None of this is easy starting point for film.Film doesn't do metaphysics easily. Goddard and Tarkovsky have in different ways produced wondrous movies with a metaphysical core, as have Hitchcock and Mackendrick. But these film makers all knew what they were about, understood the types of statements they were making. In the hands of Ben Wheatley and his script writer Amy Jump, High Rise turns to metaphysical dust. Unable to transpose these projected abstractions onto the screen, Wheatley is left with a setting, a couple of familiar ideas, situations and characters. The resultant mix comes out situation and character dominated which lumps High Rise into a sort of sub-genre Ealing Comedy, driven by familiar British class oppositions intermixed with a dystopian Lord of the Flies play out. High Rise's recreation of the high rise structure is the one element of the film that works visually to define the concrete mausoleum envisaged by Ballard. But the problem is what is happening inside this wonderfully conceived digital edifice? Orgies?This unknowing of what it is that is happening inside the tower dogs High Rise. It is a potpourri of different inputs that are mixed together in increasing desperation. We have a couple of ideas, the symbolic acting out of class conflict in the maw of the tower, the idea of atavistic reversion, but the expression of these ideas is mediated through the expressive device of the British eccentric, the character actor expert at delivering the cameo role. Eccentricity replaces metaphysics as the film's conceptual resource. Besides the setting of the tower, there are significant subsettings within its carapace: individual apartments, corridors, lifts, the stairwell. Wheatley uses these subsettings for events, and the main type of event in High Rise is the orgy. The orgy is the dominant feature of the film, taking up a lot of its footage. Perhaps Wheatley felt orgies were metaphors for the idea of degeneration, perhaps he felt the audience would be titillated gazing at the sexual posturings of actors body doubles and extras. The duration of the orgy scenes points to directorial anxiety rather than directorial confidence, as the orgies in themselves only incoherently fill out the screen with the explicit rather than the implicit.Ben Wheatley's High Rise seems to me to be the very worst sort of filmmaking. Buy a property and exploit it by filling it out with stuff you hope the audience will buy. If it's a British film you don't need to worry much about the reviewers, most of them, as part of the UK film industry, will fall in line. It's a Film making industrial culture encouraged by a financing system dominated by TV companies and private finance companies. It is interesting to note that in the film credits it is the money that comes first. Once it was the stars and actors, once it was the tech people, now the first front credits of most films are dominated by the production companies who have put up the finance. It seems to mean that any potential director has to meet multifarious and perhaps conflicting demands from all the 'interested' parties, before they can even begin to want to understand their material. adrin neatrour",High-Rise

148,soerenbruns,"In High-Rise ""Sos"" translates to ""Style over Substance""",4,18 August 2016,"""Style over substance"" is an almost universal critique towards any movie that relies on visuals without delivering an intriguing plot or complex characters even though I tend to think that in some cases this critique is due to an unwillingness to engage with a cryptic message films as for example ""Tree of Life"" convey.The problem with Ben Wheatley's new film ""High-Rise"" however is that while presenting beautiful scenes and detailed set-pieces, it makes overtly clear that there is a highly critical message to take away from it. But this message is drowned in a muddled mess of flashing visuals, incoherent storytelling and unrelatable characters.We follow a young doctor Robert Laing (a solid performance by Tom Hiddleston) moving into his new apartment in a tower building that contains a micro-society of its own whose most important marker is a clear division between the people at the (literal and figurative) top and those at the bottom (even though they are far from being working class). Instead of delivering a complex depiction of this social environment, the film relies on its visuals to stress the differences between the groups (the rich being characterised by fancy parties reminiscent of an aristocratic scenery) for half an hour before the building itself and in the course of events society as a whole collapses.A sort of class war breaks out but its exact trigger remains a secret. The rest of the film is basically a montage of various portrayals of society's descent into savagery. As all of this is exclusively highlighted by visual cues, the reproach ""style over substance"", as worn-out and over-used it may be, proves to be true. The film fails as a profound analysis of inherent flaws in our western, modern society. I have to admit that I haven't read the book ""High-Rise"" is based on, therefore I can't tell if the original story works better as either a critique or satire or both. But the film suffers from the ongoing contradiction of presenting itself as ultra-relevant and clever, while not delivering anything to back up this claim.I am deeply disappointed that even though ""High-Rise"" is all about presentation, its sequences are put together so randomly that what could have been a really powerful audiovisual interplay just passes by as everything else. Of course I am talking about the sequence accompanied by Portishead's haunting version of ""SOS"". Surely, the moment loses some of its power just due to the fact that I already new it was coming when I first heard the uplifting string quartet rendition of the song. I am afraid, this is true for most people, as nowadays everything is exploited for marketing whether it is an effective OST or the unexpected appearance of a beloved character (I am looking at you Darth Vader in the ""Rogue One"" trailer). Nevertheless, the use of these two versions could have created a great arc. But, while the song does not fail to impress, the sequence it is supposed to contextualise does not stand out in any way.If you have this admittedly good idea and manage to get a band like Portishead on board you have to come up with something striking. This is not the case, as it is just a generic, self-indulgent sequence as all the others, just in slow-motion. It serves as another example for how the film constantly self-consciously points to its alleged depth and relevance while ultimately failing to cover up its randomness.A lot of potential - a good cast, great music and in theory a compelling story - is being completely squandered.",High-Rise

Why the sound of seagulls outside when it wasn't apparent the tower was anywhere near water? Why was it set in the 70's? The preview and reviews gave the indication it was in the future.

156,cesiraurzi,"Masterfully shot, but needed a better script to convey Ballard's vision",7,27 December 2017,"JG Ballard's book High Rise is a dystopian masterpiece. It is a small book, less than 200 pages, in which words are used sparingly, and yet manages to paint vivid pictures in your head. It starts with Laing eating a dog, as if that was the natural conclusion of all the events that preceded it, and then takes you on that journey during which all human of all decency is replaced by tribal, basic survival instincts.
Ben Wheatley's film is well acted and atmospheric. It is also wonderfully photographed and choreographed, but it ultimately fails to convince the audience about the inevitability of its ending. The pace is wrong. The audience is not shown the importance of the supermarket or the car incidents, and the tenants' behaviour spirals out of control too quickly to be believable. Everything happens in the first 45 minutes, so the remaining hour becomes dull and boring.
The book was a dark portrayal of human nature. It convinces us that we are only a few bad incidents away from cold blooded murders and incest. The film is perhaps too faithful to the book to convey the same meaning. 
To me, it feels as though Wheatley respected the source material so much he failed to change it where necessary to accommodate a different medium. It's similar to what Linklater did with a scanner darkly (which I loved, but not as much as the book... of course), for which he seemed to take full scenes from the book without providing a meaningful synthesis. 
As someone who read the book and appreciated all the details, I still enjoyed watching the movie, and I am sure I will watch it again, but with a different mindset, considering it as a piece of art.

There are apparently 3 social classes living in the building, the highest class occupying the most top floors. We are quickly introduced to what is going to happen in the future and then brought back to the moment when the main character Laing (Tom Hiddleston) is moving into the building to start his new life.There is not much I can even write about regarding the story. The building seems to be some kind of a metaphor for a class society and what happens when we lose the structure of our environment and spin into a chaotic way of living. This theme has been explored in various other movies before and even though this is an adaption from a novel, the story falls extremely flat. The story structure is non existent and the cut of the movie is more than odd. We are taken into situations with no motivation or the red thread that keeps us following the story. Multiple side characters emerge, but in the end, all the characters, even Laing, are as multi-dimensional as a piece of a paper. In the end we are still left wondering what was actually happening and why. The acting is extremely shallow, letting me think that this must have been either A. director's poor call, B. the script did not give actors much to build on, C. director is just bad at directing. However, there are some shining moments from Luke Evans playing Wilder, but even his character is just another one sided caricature.On the plus side - production design and art department made extremely good job.

It's loose nightmare narrative reminds me of ""Mother!"" but in comparison, High-Rise is grounded in reality while still evoking the same extreme emotional response.Maybe the cascading disasters of 2020 make the accelerating nightmare of devolving capitalism in this film, less absurd that the reception it received in 2015.This film left me with an overwhelming sense of despair and motivation to reflect on my morals, views, relationships, spending habits, work & lifestyle.

Carefully cut dialog and scenes to try to tell a story that in actuality didn't exist.Maybe the book is better because it could pace itself, but the decline of the tower happens so quickly and irrationally it is impossible to wrap your head around it. They should have shown some restraint and not revealed the decline in the beginning and then travel backwards to explain it.The music is at odds with the scenes. Trying one moment to be light in a serious sequence and then serious in a ridiculous scene (kids going to the pool).The boy didn't even provide an alternate viewpoint. His perspective was strangely warped and adult.I think there may have been potential in this movie, but as it stands, it was garbage and should be avoided.",High-Rise

No. No, it is not. Me neither. I'm rating the film a 2 instead of 1 because as someone else noted, the art director is skilled if not completely deranged.Watch Brazil instead of this flick for a genuinely outstanding viewing experience.P.

162,hottentot7,An almost complete failure,4,28 April 2016,"Ben Wheatly has adapted JG Ballard's 70's novel High Rise into a superficial but nice looking movie. Where in Ballard's novel the decent into chaos is gradual and we are essentially witnessing the events from the perspective of the main character, Wheatley after a decent first 20 minutes cranks the madness up to 11 and doesn't let up. Montage after montage, he eventually manages to make orgies look boring.In the novel there are insights into the paranoia and social unease of modern life in a high rise building. While the story slowly gets more surreal, the novel was still grounded in a recognizable psychology, with characters who we can understand and somehow empathize with. In the movie there is almost a complete absence of psychology and character motivation which leaves everyone as a caricature. The biggest problem is that there is no reason given for the eventual descent into chaos. Everything proceeds from a logic that is mostly left off-screen.",High-Rise
163,allisonarf,Snowpiercer meets Lord of the Flies,5,1 May 2016,"This film is basically the Chris Evans science fiction film Snowpiercer meets William Golding's novel Lord of the Flies. Instead of a train as in the Chris Evans' film, we have a high rise building as the setting of an uprising of the lower class against the upper class. Everyone in the building undergoes a disturbing decline into a feral, violent state much like the boys did in Golding's book. But Golding made the decline of the boys into an animal, tribal state much more convincing than director Ben Wheatley and his screenwriter wife Amy Jump do here. We see the electric being cut off and the garbage shoots not working and then a very rapid sliding of all the inhabitants--including the main character, Dr. Laing--into complete insanity. They engage in orgies of sex and violence, raping and killing each other and even killing and eating pets. Not a single character is likable. All of them are despicable human beings. The film never explains why no one leaves or calls the police. Laing is even shown going to work and never tells anyone what is happening in his building. It makes no sense whatsoever. I would recommend the film only for the strong performances from Tom Hiddleston, Jeremy Irons as Royal, and Luke Evans as Wilder. Also, some of the violent visuals are actually quite striking, like a boy watching a man being murdered through a kaleidoscope.",High-Rise

The screenplay is a mess and it makes you wonder if the director / screenplay writer failed to grasp the underlying point of the book. This should be about how a building / society can drive people's behaviour, and how quickly it can unravel. I like Tom Hiddleston, but he's horribly miscast. Far too sophisticated / polished for Dr Laing. Gutted, I appreciate Ballard is hard to adapt to the screen, but this was a disappointment. Not even sure why?

I had to Google the plot to understand what i saw.Why did the building descend into chaos? People from the top and bottom didn't like each other? Why didn't they just move out?

BUT it's actually portraying a story that's happening to us all right now in real life (in the UK), just in the guise of an arty movie. I don't know if it was the writers intent, or he just accidentally hit the nail on the head, but this is (metaphorically) about how the UK (Tom H.) is sucked into the EU (Jeremy I.)and is coerced to join, whilst perverting its own morals (i.e. surrendering its sovereignty) in the process to enter a bigger and much more secretive private club (EU). Obviously in the end the UK (sorry Tom H.) is left in a sh1t state having to fend for himself.If you're not into the above conspiracy boll?x, then watch it to appreciate the pure art that happens when you put skilled actors in the hands of a maverick team of director/writer/producer.

175,zupapazupap,"Style, performances, cinematography, and observations.",8,17 July 2016,"There is some intense hatred for High-Rise, which I think comes from people expecting something very different to what they found. So I'm going to try and tell you what to expect without any spoilers.A lot of people will find this movie hard to relate to because it has anti-heroes and is driven by concept rather than character - its pacing is guided more by the ideas it wishes you to consider than the emotions it wants you to experience. Another swathe of viewers will be put off because it offends their politics, and sociology and politics are at the core of this movie. Ballard made some observations about human nature, the which Jump and Wheatley relate to the politics of their own generation. The majority of High-Rise's observations are pessimistic to say the least; those overly sensitive to the observations' bleakness, or who can't relate to their context may not find much here.But if you can immerse yourself into the film's style, enjoy the outstanding performances and cinematography, and enjoy decrypting J.G.Ballard's metaphors through Ben Wheatley and Amy Jump's lens, there is a lot here for you.My only gripes are 1) that it didn't show at any cinemas within a reasonable distance from me, and 2) having Abba stuck in my head (although vastly reinvented versions appear in the movie, it is the original song which burrows into my ear like a parasitic worm).",High-Rise
176,hozana,High-Rise (2015) *** MILD SPOILER BELOW ***,9,16 May 2016,"A friend invited me to see this, and I hadn't heard of it (I don't think it's getting a very wide release in the US) so I came on IMDb to look it up. The reviews, as you may have noticed, are not very promising. Some reviewers say that people walked out at their theater, they say the latter two-thirds of the film are just a bunch of meaningless violence, and the most common complaint is that the plot doesn't make sense; reviewers ask over and over 'why don't the characters just leave the building?' Based on these reviews, I figured I was in for two hours of tedious splatterporn and psychological implausibility. I knew we wouldn't walk out, since my friend has willingly watched 'The Room' (2003) multiple times, and I have only walked out of a movie once in my life ('Man Of Steel' (2013), when my date got motion-sickness), so I just resigned myself to a bad time and thought 'Well, it has Tom Hiddleston, and they do say the art direction is top-notch, and it's a matinée, what the hell'.For once pessimism paid off, and I had that rarest of movie-going experiences - the Pleasant Surprise. And not a pleasant surprise like 'that wasn't AS awful as it could have been', but a pleasant surprise like 'I am SO glad I ignored the reviews!' There was no splatterporn, and I'm prepared to argue that there was no psychological implausibility - for a very specific reason.If you come into this movie expecting a thriller or a disaster flick, then you're going to feel like you went to see a reboot of 'The Towering Inferno' where the special effects team forgot to add the fire. There's no wrong way to watch a movie, but judging by some other reviews, that would be an unsatisfying way to watch this one. But because I had read all of those other reviews, I knew I was looking for an allegory, and it wasn't hard to spot. Please sub in the words ""a capitalist society"" wherever you see ""the high-rise"" in the paragraphs below: People buy in to ""the high-rise"". They desperately want to move up in ""the high-rise"" and they attempt to do so in many degrading ways. Those at the top of ""the high-rise"" shamelessly use those who are lower down, even if they personally like them. Even people on equal levels in ""the high-rise"" come to view each other primarily and inappropriately as things. To men, women become commodities, while to women (in a scene where you can practically hear Tom Hiddleston's heart stop), men become ""amenities"".But to say that ""the high-rise"" brings out the worst in its inhabitants is an oversimplification. Even at the height of the mayhem, they retain their principles; the expression of these just gets nuttier and nuttier. I'll give an example and I apologize if it's a ***MILD SPOILER***: Laing (Hiddleston) is at one point ordered by the upper echelon to lobotomize an ""insurgent"". Just as if he weren't living in a maelstrom of lunatics, and one of them himself, Laing says that he must first perform a psychiatric evaluation to see if a lobotomy is warranted. He performs the evaluation, I guess you could say, and reports back that he will not do the lobotomy because the patient is ""possibly the sanest man in this building"" (never mind that he's talking about a violent madman covered in blood). The rich man's flunkies seize Laing and drag him towards the edge of the roof. He struggles for his life, but he does NOT say 'oh wait, I changed my mind' as he easily could have. He seems fearful but determined. Other scenes suggest the same thing; that in ""the high-rise"" the milk of human kindness isn't missing, only curdled.For me, the movie presents a pretty accurate portrayal of life in a capita-- excuse me, ""the high-rise"" -- as I've experienced it. Crime rates are redonkulous; even good people lose their bearings completely; the wealthy have all the power and not one clue what to do with it; the lower classes are ""Balkanized"" and turn against each other in almost random factions, men against women, children against parents, employees against customers, pet-owners against the hungry, all ignoring the common enemy. Taking the movie as a metaphor, the question isn't 'why don't they leave the building?', but 'why don't WE leave the building?' Just as unanswerable, but a little more thoughtworthy. If the characters' behavior is psychologically implausible, what is ours? Why don't we all just Jane-Goodall the heck out of here?This movie has a ton going for it: fantastic art direction, yes; good performances by good actors across the board, with special mention for Tom Hiddleston and Elisabeth Moss; a wry sense of humor that got a snort out of me with every scene; an excellent score; suggestive and surprising writing. It gave me interesting things to look at, interesting things to think about, and stronger feelings than I normally have on a Sunday. And, at the risk of treating him like an amenity, I'll say that Tom Hiddleston never hurts to look at, and naked Tom Hiddleston is even less painful. Final thoughts - it's not 'The Towering Inferno', but if you can get past that hurdle you might really enjoy it. I did. 9/10",High-Rise

178,rodgallardo,Interesting but terrible,7,17 May 2016,"The movie is about a bunch of people living inside a skyscraper for residents planned with all sort of commodities, and the higher the level the higher the social status. To make long story short somehow this experiment done by the owner starts to fail and everything goes to hell little by little without the audience knowing exactly why. To begin with and leaving the personal judgment aside the movie is very rich on metaphors and symbolism towards western political and social systems. I didn't read the book, which may be good because I can only criticize the movie by itself, and I can say, in a way its a movie that George Orwell could have directed and been proud of. So yes, the movie is very interesting, unfortunately after 30 minutes or so you realize that there is nothing unfolding really, there is no backbone to the story and its just a series of random events taking place inside a building, where the whole story is taking place. Maybe we could say the the main character is Laing (Tom H), however he is not in the driver seat of the move nor anyone but the whole community of residents and at the end the car crashes.The movie frustrated me, it was difficult to digest and at times I felt stoned (without really being). Some of the cinematography is beautiful in a way Stanley Kubrick would be proud of. The humor is the blackest, however is very indirect, the acting is good enough but the timing is what makes everything so bad. Its too long and at times annoying.

The first rule of an engaging film, or the very indication of a film we care to watch, is our relationship with the characters (be they physical or metaphysical, human or not), and apart from the drab acting and none-impact action sequences, is the all-encompassing 'meh' one feels when watching this film.

This film really was a narrative mess.The first 30 minutes had the making of an interesting film. Tom Hiddleston as always put in a great performance as did the other actors but even that couldn't rescue the mess that was the narrative. We rarely walk away from films but at the 80 minute mark we just decided not to waste any more of our life on it.

Filmmaking is hard as it is.High Rise, to me, feels like a slightly pretentious art film made by a few friends straight out of film school. The story as far as I could tell is set in 1970's England and is based on a class system akin to Blade Runner where the super rich live at the top of the building and the poor at the lower levels. Cue whatever drama comes out of that.Technically, everything in this movie felt very staged and mechanical. As if the overriding goal was not to let the story unfold organically, but to shoe horn that ""One Perfect Shot"" in every scene.It's quite frustrating when you try to give a filmmaker the benefit of your doubt. But in truth, I've never been able to watch a Ben Wheatley movie all the way through. His movies feel a little too niche for my own cinema going tastes in terms of narrative structure and execution. There's definitely some strong underlying message that's being played out. Trouble is, it seems that only he and the very few can decipher and enjoy whatever he's trying to say.

I went in with high expectations, which gave way to boredom and the anticipation of the end of the showing.The actors absolutely fulfilled all expectations. The performances are all highly nuanced and look natural, rather than put on. Hiddleston goes above and beyond to give one of the arguably best performances of his career. The mise-en-scene of each scene is meticulously crafted and beautifully shot. So what, exactly, tipped high expectations into boredom?For one, the film never does come together, never gives off the feeling of a cohesive whole, but rather of a series of vignettes. Each vignette is, of course, beautifully shot, but the disconnect they cause makes it impossible to empathize with any of the characters.Additionally, suspension of disbelief is near impossible. Why do the characters make the choices they do? What drives them to this madness?

It starts with introducing the main character and the environment, however it doesn't go into depth beyond the introduction. It misses the opportunity to tell potentially good stories. It doesn't even tell why they have built those high buildings in the first place.

192,timkjohansen,Starts strong then ultimately loses it's way,5,23 May 2016,"It's probably worth mentioning that High-rise is the kind of movie that was never going to be easy to make. J.G Ballard's novel is a dystopian future written in 1975 that considers the psychological effect of technological, social and environmental developments on mankind.That said the movie starts strong, if you've read the novel you'll notice the film captures the feel of the apartment block from the very beginning. The external mass of concrete, the interior of the apartments and the supermarket were all exactly as they are described in the book. The original futuristic feel of a book written in 1975 was surprisingly intact and represented well through out the film as were the characters. The protagonist Robert Laing was well cast and well played by Tom Hiddleston, Richard Wilder was absolutely perfect being played by Luke Evans and the rest of the supporting cast seemed about right although Richard Wilder's relationship with wife pregnant Helen wasn't well established and if you haven't read the book you might not even realize they were supposed to be husband and wife in the film. Ironically where the film goes wrong is around the point where things begin to go wrong in the apartment complex. The character development seems to end and these scenes are glossed over lacking the sense of development and significance that they had in the novel. At this point the film seems to lose its way as it skims over some of the deeper plots of the novel in an effort to fit everything in. It lacks the sense that it's building towards anything and I found I lost interest while watching it as a result.The ending of the novel has also been completely cut from the film and it makes subplots of both Richard Wilder and the women's group feel like they go nowhere and makes the film's overall plot seem to fizzle out completely.",High-Rise

I need to tell you: There's nothing to get from it!The movie could have lasted 30 min instead and the whole idea would have been passed. It's a torment! F*** boring and depressing.The only thing that is worthy here is the actors, great cast for sure! Don't waste your life! For the first time, I've got mad at a director/production.

194,georgesakerman,Ben Wheatley's highly stylised thriller is bolstered by towering performances.,9,30 July 2016,"Ben Wheatley's fifth feature film - and his first adaptation - is an unnerving, unsettling, hyper-stylised explosion of depravity, decadence and danger. Juggling multiple genres, (thriller/black comedy/political satire/horror) Wheatley and (screenwriter) Amy Jump's take on J. G. Ballard's 'unfilmable' book maintains it's madcap tone perfectly throughout. Tom Hiddleston shines as the invisible Dr. Laing - as his 'normal' character is thrust into the deep end, like the audiences' ingress into the action. The visuals are as equally striking as the performances, juxtaposing Jeremy Iron, Sienna Miller and James Purefoy's supporting roles perfectly with lurid '70s images. The praise should really be presented to Wheatley. His camera swerves in and out of the dark corridors in the eponymous tower block with frustratingly intimate ease. The severe, feral behaviour is shown through the lens smartly and thrillingly whilst the slow corruption of evil slowly corrodes the in-mates of the high- rise.",High-Rise
195,gilcostello,High Heaven,10,19 July 2017,"High-Rise will eventually be recognized as the first definitive cinematic exploration of where we actually reside in our postmodern world. Radical Autonomy, the ethos of postmodernism, is now the norm of culture. All forms of actual community have been destroyed, especially the cornerstone of all expansive forms of social community, the nuclear family (Yorgo Lathimos' masterpiece, Lobster, focuses exclusively on this element, yet his hero is, unlike Dr. Laing, totally oblivious, but is finding his way haphazardly). And in High-Rise, pregnant Helen is the last woman/person standing in defending this cornerstone, this Alamo of hers in the belly of the Beast (the Building as metaphor for the culture we are now imprisoned in).Helen stands valiantly alone in her battle, a Don Quixote absent the fantastical egotism, staring realistically and directly into the pit of uncompromising alienation all around her, but she will find an ally in the Great Liberator, Dr. Laing, the beating heart of the film, a real glimpse at hope, not sentimental rubbish, revealing the basic failing of postmodernism beneath its clutter of hedonistic excess: a world programmed solely for each individual to get his/her needs met, setting everyone off and against each other in selfish paroxysms.The visionary architect of the film is appropriately named Royal— that's Ayn-Randian Royalty, the fully actualized visionary architect who will, as the greatest autonomous artist in history, restore what is grand, as King and God—towering above all other artists in a ruling progressive ""professional class"" determined to kill the past to create the future. His determination is to restore the essence of what the Western World sacrificed to gain radical autonomy: true, not pretend, community. That's the heart of the great existential joke of the film, and what makes the film a true postmodern satire of epic proportions, and why each repeated viewing brings on ever more hilarity. For example, it is deemed by the upper- floor residents that children should not be allowed in the pool because they can't control their bladders (the upper classes have actualized their autonomy and simply would not submit to any demands from any other, especially a child, so why even have one?), and every time the cameraman returns to filming the pool, you can see how editors bled yellow into the water where the children swim. Trust me—it does get funnier on every repeated viewing!The professional class (progressives) harnessed most of its power from the psychoanalytic movement, what had Kafka scream, ""No more psychology!"", and the Psychiatrist of High-Rise, Talbot, clarifies Kafka's concern, a psychology of self- centeredness in the radical promotion of self over everything, including every other, including children (""I can't be there for my child until I get myself together, dammit!""), and including history itself! The basic distinction between a liberal and a progressive is the latter seeks to kill the past to create its vision of a future, independent of all other influences, to make it pure! And the liberal seeks always to remember the past to avoid the existential horrors we get looped around in throughout history! And of all the professionals in the film, Richard Wilder comes closest to being an old school liberal force, but in whose animalistic pursuit of the truth in a concrete jungle turns himself into his own worst enemy, in the end fulfilling the Building's demand that he rape and murder to fully actualize his radical sense of justice! He is assigned by the Building to demote Charlotte who has gotten far too comfortable in her successful orchestrations of parties at all levels of engagement, and why a quick bond develops between her and the protagonist, Dr. Laing, both accomplished navigators, but Charlotte navigates inside the Beast to acquire maximum benefits, and Laing comes from a world of broad knowledge and seeks not only to move comfortably, but to seek restoration of nuts and bolts of true humanity in the process (an attitude glimpsed for flitting moments inside once suffocated tear-drops).Wilder is a man engrossed in a mission to uncover evil and promote the good, but he lives simultaneously in both worlds, the ancient liberal world of honor and fighting doggedly to reveal the truth, and the postmodern world where everyone is out for him/herself, and damn the truth in process!, and in his animal pursuit of truth and justice, he is taken over by the malevolence of the Building, and finally realizes the Building (postmodern culture) was always more powerful than he, and his dark side ends in manifesting absolutely in the power he utilizes to defeat the Building! Wilder more than anything wants to win, and so he ends in sacrificing his wife and children and his very humanity for this bold adventure into wining, not loving.Dr. Laing is the postmodern warrior par excellence. He not only has embraced his Iliad, but ignores an Odyssey (no home to return to). Charlotte chooses for Laing when she throws the picture of him and his dead sister to the floor, the last remnant of Laing's delusory clinging to a world that has passed away. He will not be conned by any peripheral, especially from the ""progressive class"" and its relentless Kantian maze of dysfunctional morality and ethics, although because he and Royal are both absolute visionaries, they share an affection for each other in this regard. But Laing, like Helen, is no Don Quixote trapped in egotism. He is willing to strip away every peripheral to arrive at the nuts and bolts of what is truly true about the human condition. Wilder gave him all he knew, and so did Charlotte and Royal and everyone else, and now it is left to Laing who knows where the heart of restoration begins, with everyone loving the baby born into a genuine community, the first incipient model of nuclear family restoration unto fully actualized community.",High-Rise
196,alexanderbarratt,If you are watching this film on a plane and the plane begins to crash - trust me; your day has just dramatically improved.,1,17 July 2017,"The most frustrating thing of all about this film is that it starts out with quite a bit of promise. Visually stimulating: interesting and tantalisingly bizarre story and characters - ""where will this rabbit hole lead?"" you wonder. Well my wife wanted to go to sleep and I was intrigued enough to keep her up on a Sunday night to watch more. As a result I've just been screamed at, I'm apparently spending the night on the sofa and I have specifically registered with IMDb to warn you away from this bubbling pustule of a film. Frankly I'm lucky to be on the sofa - after that decision I'm fortunate not to be face down in a foot-deep bath. It would be more than I deserve.As I mentioned, after about twenty minutes or so the director seems to give up entirely and simply throw this film into the pinball machine of art-house cliché, and what a score he achieves. In particular; slow motion violence coupled with classical music. I have more than a sneaking suspicion that the director is a big fan of ""A Clockwork Orange"" and especially the scenes of shockingly base violence coupled with classical music. If your favourite thing in the whole world is the sight of violence in slow motion backed by classical music then this is your lucky day - you are going to be in ecstacy watching this film. Sadly no-one ever seems to have explained to the director that watching violence is like watching porn; thrilling for the first ten minutes, boring for the next five minutes, before settling in to a depressing soul-crushing grind for all time thereafter.Every character is eminently unlikeable (whichever ""side"" you pick, both display shocking cruelty to animals, which for me is a massive red line), the story is exceptionally weak - the premise on which society ""breaks down"" is utterly pathetic. The whole trick of art- house film is to be able to create surreal metaphors which are cleverly interpreted observations on real life; this film can add itself to the list of wannabe art-house, simply scattering meaningless surreal imagery around with apparently no meaning or significance whatsoever. If you ever find yourself talking to the director and he mentions that he is planning on making another film, please do us all a favour and suggest that he find the nearest 40- storey high-rise block and throw himself off of the top of it.",High-Rise
197,sastrash,Failed attempt at art,4,2 May 2016,"I haven't read the book but judging it on its own merit I felt like this film tried to be something between The American Psycho and The Exterminating Angel. And it failed. It's lacking the subtlety of Bunuel's masterpiece as well as the wit of the latter, more modern film.The Non-Subtlety: When Laing goes to a party above his class he is not just under-dressed, he is RIDICULOUSLY under-dressed. When he tries to help a the architect's wife with a malfunctioning control box, he doesn't just fail, he fails SPECTACULARLY. Scene after scene you get everything spelled out as clearly and unambiguously as possible and it gets tiresome very quickly. Was this not supposed to be an ""art"" kind of film? Was the director expecting only morons to come and see it?The Lack of Wit: Even over-the-top films can still be enjoyable if they are handled right. The American Psycho is like that - the axe murder to the tune of Hip to be Square is fresh and whimsical, the business card scene was a FUN way to ridicule the main character's obsession. High-Rise on the other hand is just dull. I can't remember any one scene that I would want to rewatch just for the sake of it. Every one of them is just mechanistically chugging along with the plot.On the bright side there are some interesting sets and costumes and certainly the actors are doing their best with what they are given so it's not an all-in-all terrible movie. It's just that what it is trying to do was done way better before - in the two films I mentioned above.",High-Rise
198,davy_dodds,Don't be so sure...,7,18 March 2016,"I'll admit it - I didn't get it; I thought it Wheatley's weakest film but still compelling due to the premise and its visuals. It is a beautiful movie populated by beautiful people.Pseudo intellectuals will say 'class struggle/horrible rich people ya ya ya' but I'm not convinced. These are the same people who would think of the '...probably reads the Daily Mail' comment in Sightseers as being terribly socially aware. Unfortunately when it's spoken by a hypocritical self-loathing psychopath the meaning of the sentence changes fundamentally. It's this ambiguity that I enjoy about his other movies.The 'rich' in the tower are just as poor as the poor; they don't (apart from the architect) appear to live any better than the people on lower floors, the only difference would appear to be that they *think* they are privileged living higher up. This 'privilege' appears to be purely imaginary. The people on the lower floors party just as hard as the higher ups.The last scene with Thatcher talking about 'social capitalism' is worrying as it seems to have been (on first glance) crow-barred in to denigrate and to flash liberal/pseudo lefty credentials. But once again if you pay attention all is not what it seems; Thatcher introduced social capitalism to this country; it's why I'm sitting here typing on a computer (and you're reading on an iPad)at 10 o'clock at night, instead of preparing for the last hour of my 14 hour shift picking potatoes for 'our Dear Leader Kinnock'. I would hope, anyway. BTW if you think this is BS; you don't know anything about socialism. Move to Cuba or North Korea if you don't believe me; yeah, thought not.Anyway to the film - see it. Luke Evans steals this movie (what a performance!) and I'm glad to see that Sienna Miller is maintaining her position as 'quite the actress'. Take that Ally Ross!I was terrified that Wheatley would go the same way as Neil Marshall, fantastic with a £2.50 budget, awful (Doomsday!) when given a proper budget, and that is unfortunately true to a certain respect with this film. You wouldn't recognise this as a Wheatley movie and it's a shame for that. What makes Wheatley's other movies utterly compelling is the lack of money for visuals has to be replaced by 'whip smart' dialogue. This movie has the visuals; the dialogue, not so much.TL;DR - SEE IT! - beautiful movie, slightly overlong. I didn't get it; beware those who say they do...",High-Rise

The actors are really good at what they do and they really made this movie come to life. The movie was very entertaining and although disturbing to some, it was not at all boring just underrated. As an open minded viewer, I tend to look past the uncomfortableness and just dive into the story.

In that movie, the whole of society lived on that train, so initially, the lower class people had no choice but to deal with the conditions. In High-Rise, the planet is still completely habitable and society is functioning just as it is now. So why in the hell does this one apartment building turn into a post apocalyptic nightmare just because of minor inconveniences? Why are people eating dogs because the grocery store inside the building has been ransacked? Just go to a normal store! I understand the movies metaphors for people's desire for ""status,"" but the story is such an incoherent mess that the moment to moment scenes and lack of any discernable character motivations make the entire thing a long unsatisfying slog.",High-Rise

I could possibly see this being the product of some student film-maker doing an avant garde project, but to foist this on an unsuspecting public is a travesty that should be against the laws of common decency. The only thing I could take away from the experience of having watched this is a degraded sense of hopelessness towards the future of our species.

209,Bardilfula,Very valid piece of art! Not for casual entertainment,9,28 April 2016,"Just saw High-Rise. Wow. It was everything I was excited for. What a trip! My dad agreed to watch it with me. He was in complete neutral shock ahaha. I'm STILL trying to wrap my head around it. Easier for me since I read the book and the movie stayed pretty true to it. It was super refreshing to see a movie in 2016 less than a year old that was made for the sake of art rather than mindless entertainment and money. The reason why this movie has such mixed reviews is because it wasn't made to be idly enjoyed. It was critical. It was offensive. It spat a scary possible truth. It was ugly. It was gloriously out of control. This film is definitely not for casual movie watchers or anything below. It was visually very pleasing. beautiful cinematography. Every shot looks like it could be the fuel of a wonderful painting. Fantastic color schemes. It was very neat to see the clean, rich and futuristic, concrete, geometric and controlled environment that of the high-rise become trashed by the primitive nature its tenants fall victim too. The hierarchy and classism shone brightly even through all the short-term- fix chaos. The lower floors were hell, but the top floor was a misleadingly lavish purgatory. The acting was great from everyone! Tom Hiddleston's Laing was charmingly emotionally detached from his surroundings, making him the least expected to finally flip. Tom was cool, comfortable to watch, and confident in his performance. He made Laing relatable. Luke Evans' Richard Wilder was massive! Nearly unrecognizable with his 70′s getup, he dominated every scene he was in with full force and testosterone drenched fury. Luke successfully pushed the envelope exploring his character, making him one of the most colorful in the entire story. By the end, you realize this hell raiser was ultimately the sanest man in the building. Jeremy Irons' Anthony Royal was calmly intimidating, almost God like; being the architect of the High-Rise and realizing the role he plays in all of his tenants lives, but also showed a humble and frail side. Elisabeth Moss and notably Sienna Miller also followed through with their performances. Elisabeth's Helen was rightly washed up and pitiful just like her character is in the story. Sienna's Charlotte was vivacious, lusty, and despicably likable. Both women helped tie everyone's individual stories together. Overall, the film was a huge, glorified metaphor about how Humans are ultimately still nothing more than animals that still apply to basic biology. It just proves no matter how privileged a human you are, you are still mortal and just as low as anyone else when you are stripped of power over your surroundings. But it also raises the question of why didn't anyone just leave the High-Rise? Well, what would YOU do if you lived in a spontaneous, lawless, high-rise where you could do anything to you, anyone else, or anything that you wanted? Wouldn't you give into your fantasies? Wouldn't it be worth the madness around you to live everyday doing whatever the hell you wanted? Drugs, sex, taking what you wanted for free, finally being able to get even with the people you don't agree with. The tenants of the High-Rise became blindly comfortable and addicted to the disorder, that they simply chose not to leave I think. The film was very thought provoking and profoundly cringeworthy, and really makes you wonder about just how good and control of themselves humans really are. A topia could never exist; if life was perfect, all it would take to flip its world upside down is a few flickering lights. Highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates ART!",High-Rise

It needs just a one line review or even one word, can you figure out which word I mean.... Garbage.

Visually pleasing and had quirky moments with some unique humour. However, the plot did not seem complete. There were things left unexplained for absolutely no reason. The concept was great and it really had potential to be amazing, there just needed to be a few more motives laid out for the characters and a bit more context. It is definitely the sort of film which should have untold mysteries, just there were a few too many. Everyone in my showing seemed to be in a weird state of bewilderment at the end.",High-Rise
212,OzielMtzHer,A beautiful and incoherent mess,5,13 May 2016,"Ben Wheatley is known for his unique style, that is still present in this movie. But, unlike other of his films (Kill List, Sightseers), it's not accompanied with a competent narrative. The visual component of the movie is amazing and the production design is good. High-rise is a hypnotizing movie in that sense, thanks also to an excellent soundtrack that fits really well with the hypnotizing visuals of the film. The problem comes with the development of the story. We are presented in this world full of bizarre characters and this could be the best part of the movie. The introduction to the world of the high-rise is interesting, the different people that lives there and how the classes are divided. I haven't read the book but it sounds like the plot for what should have been a better film. The thing is, at some point in the movie, the conflict starts to escalate really quickly and everyone starts acting in an incoherent form that feels contradictory to what we had seen before. Here, I started to feel alienated from the movie. What is happening on the screen doesn't feel natural because we are never exposed to a logical development of the story that let us understand why all of this is happening. We are presented to a lot of bizarre and senseless situations and I just started to watch them without feeling involved in the movie, which makes it pretty tedious. I suppose that's the reason why a lot of people walked off during the exhibition of this movie. The acting is good, even if the characters start to act incoherently halfway through the film. It should had been a better experience. If we'd have had a better presentation of the story, we'd be talking about something better. However, the real star of the movie is the visual experience. In that aspect Ben Wheatley did an incredible work (we could be talking about his most visually stunning film) and I have to emphasize the beautiful musical score. The talent of the director to create an unique atmosphere is palpable. It's another case of style over substance I guess.",High-Rise

The idea of total degradation transforming people into violent animals and then making survivors one ill family is beyond my understanding. Ill movie about insane people.

But a movie must have something: this movie has absolutely nothing at all. No humor, no plot, nothing informative. I wouldn't even know how to categorize this movie considering it has nothing at all. Lot of details are put in and we just wonder why it's there. They don't contribute to the story and there is no story in the first place.

215,schuloze,Not Leaving Is the Point,8,29 May 2016,"I didn't get it either. I downloaded the book from a free trial offer from Audible this morning and have listened to three chapters so far. Narrated by Tom Hiddleston, it has all become clear. The film serves as an excellent visual to an interesting novel. I also perused a brief biography of the author, and plan to read many more of his works, and will watch the two other films made from his books. He endured an extreme situation during the war in his youth, and perhaps that is what enables J. G. Ballard to understand and write about the darkness of the human psyche, which the high rise sets free in this film. The point isn't about why residents didn't walk away. Instead Ballard explores the forces that mesmerize the residents. If we could watch war nightly as we watched the Vietnamese war in the 60s, it could possibly supplant reality television programs altogether. Perhaps that is the reason journalists were largely banned from subsequent wars especially in the middle east. It also explores the fascination we have with disasters, and even the stupid national quibbling that spills into these boards. When you see an inordinate number of responses to a comment, you can be sure someone has insulted one nationality or another. And we read them, and jump into the fray. Like the high rise residents in the film. Get real people. Bothered by accents? I like films where each actor speaks with his/her natural accent. If I were to judge all Canadians by my two best Canadian friends, I would believe all Canadian women were abused wimps, as one chose to stay with a physical alcoholic abuser for over 20 years until he stripped her of every asset, then dumped her, and the other chose to stay for 16 years with a rampant womanizer who sired a child born within weeks of his own child, in a tiny northern village, where every person knew exactly what was going on except my friend, until his arrest for illegal activity. One mutual acquaintance described her as a ""willing victim."" And since her rogue husband was northern European, that lets us off the hook on this continent. Only the old world could produce such an aberrant person, it must not be safe to be a tourist in Europe at all anymore, especially since they have admitted all those migrants. See? It is so easy to fall into that kind of thinking, as it springs from the innate biological urges we are all born with. It is amazingly stupid to focus on the behavior of individuals in countries with millions and millions of people. And that is the exact point of High Rise. Under certain circumstances whether of class, nationality, economic status, political power, ""What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas."" High rise and condominium living concentrates people to the point where moral boundaries disintegrate. My 94 year old aunt lives in one of these convenient communities, which have become the norm for her age group, unlike the time when the novel was written. She said once, ""They do it like rabbits around here."" Confused by Trump phenomenon? Same thing. He gives voice to the most base thoughts and emotions and the media licks him up.Kudos to J.G. Ballard for his close observation of various personalities, prescient imagination, and enduring works. Kudos to the film makers for their attempt to visualize this novel. It does expose the gap between the written word and the film. (One point off for this, a second for indulging the current fashion for too much gore.) I would even go so far as to suggest a narrated version, to bridge the two and make the film comprehensible upon the initial viewing. A similar thing happened with LeCarre's The Night Manager, which led me to this film. It was so chopped up it was impossible to understand what was going on in an initial, single viewing. When I watched it again, it did hang together, the pieces were all there. One realizes at the moment of the tryst, the Spanish lawyer was being outed, and his disposal initiated, a truly dangerous liaison indeed. For High Rise, one should probably read the book first.",High-Rise
216,jonwar,Faithful to the book,5,31 May 2016,"One of those films where if you've read the book it enhancers the film, but... the book still manages to be better.I did like the future/past aspect of basing the film in the 70's that the book is set in and it being out dated by our actual history, it being written before mobile phones and the internet, and when there were only 3 television channels in England. The director seems to have been going for a faithful translation of the book, at least as I remember it although it is many years since I've read it. It reminded me of 'A Clockwork Orange' but in that case the film shed light upon the book (mainly the slang). Again though... the book was betterIt seems that 'generally' the more favourable reviews for this film are familiar with the source material. Maybe not a date movie then uhh.",High-Rise
217,alexandruszabo-18706,Very good example of modern society,10,26 July 2016,"Is a good example of modern society. You can really taste this kind of experience in Antwerp - Belgium City with a low income like - 1k/month.. if you can live 3 years. The maker of this film tend to tell us about extreme parts of life. I decided to make this review because the movie was likely my bad past in a modern ""catacomb"". The human brain can be easily tricked is a low space with a modest income. My opinion about this film is great and it was a real pleasure to spend time at it. I really care about a good life in general and my opinion is to opt for bigger space.. not flat cities with walls.. For now i live in a combined place like - forests, mountains, beaches in a SOCIALIST society. And somehow i think is better to be ""stolen"" from ""somebody"" and not to be ""fooled"" with ""dreams"" because in an extreme situation like that people are not together..""reach people/poorest people"" they react for themselves with no price.For everybody who want to taste the real life of pleasure ... ""not material"" where you can look far away and you can really breath and where you can easily make what you want... you are invited in Romania !Life is life... and ""where is not war is not love"".",High-Rise
218,nstehelin-18688,"Well-crafted, and unique",10,26 April 2017,This movie is perfectly crafted and visually rich. Let yourself be absorbed by it's strange and brutal philosophy. It's brimming with impressive sequences and unforgettable moments that defy language. Probably the reason it frustrates people. If you want a movie that uses the power of film in the best way possible than this is the one for you. If you've ever been curious about Ballard or are a fan already then you'll love this.,High-Rise
219,mandpalmer,I'd give it 0 stars if I could,1,21 April 2020,"I do love Tom Hiddleston, but this was such a terrible movie. Unrealistic. Even from a fantasy perspective, it still couldn't hold it's own.",High-Rise
220,paul_h_williams,"""Why don't the inhabitants just leave the high-rise?""",8,13 October 2015,"Wheatley's High-Rise has received a fascinating range of reviews from dross to genius and somewhere in-between - so something must be going on here to cause quite such a reaction. In most ways it's entirely faithful to the book. A book replete with dark humour and above all a unique understanding and vision of human beings. The entire movie, like the book, revolves around one crucial point, as things go profoundly awry why don't the inhabitants just leave the high-rise? Once you understand that this story may not be dystopian at all but actually about a kind of utopia then what some reviewers have called a mess becomes clear. Utopia may turn out to very different from the adverts.",High-Rise
