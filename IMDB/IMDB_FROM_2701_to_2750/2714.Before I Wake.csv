0,Leofwine_draca,More Hollywood predictability,4,13 June 2018,"BEFORE I WAKE is yet another Hollywood CGI ghost story with a predictable plot, predictable look, and no decent scares. The story is once again about a grieving couple (is there any other type in this genre?) who take in a foster kid. It turns out that he's terrified of falling asleep, and for good reason as he ends up being menaced by a CGI ghost dude who proceeds to menace the rest of the family too. It's all faintly ridiculous stuff, not helped by the generic, predictable nature of the writing and the tired performances from Thomas Jane and Kate Bosworth, who both look like they want to be elsewhere. But then, can you blame them?",Before I Wake
1,SnoopyStyle,horror not scary,6,15 August 2016,"Jessie (Kate Bosworth) and Mark Hobson (Thomas Jane) are recovering from the death of their son. They adopt Cody (Jacob Tremblay) who is obsessed with butterflies. Natalie (Annabeth Gish) is his case worker. Strange things happen and it's soon discovered that Cody's nightmare can become deadly real.Mike Flanagan delivers a well-shot film. As a horror, it's not scary. Jacob Tremblay has a charisma about him. Kate Bosworth is fine. I don't think butterflies are scary and the nightmares are not nightmarish enough. There is nice reveal of the origins of his nightmares and there is a poetry to the story. Although it's just not scary.",Before I Wake
2,claudio_carvalho,Intriguing Supernatural Story,6,28 July 2017,"SPOILER: Jessie (Kate Bosworth) and her husband Mark (Thomas Jane) are grieving the loss of their son Sean (Antonio Romero), who drowned in the bathtub, and Jessie is in a group therapy. They decide to adopt the eight year-old orphan Cody (Jacob Tremblay), who was abandoned by two foster families. Cody is a lovely boy and becomes the pride and joy of Jessie and Mark. Cody avoids to sleep and Jessie and Mrk believe the boy has psychological problems due to the rejection of the previous foster parents. Soon they discover that when Cody sleeps, his beautiful dreams come true. But the problem is that the same happens with his dreadful nightmares. ""Before I Wake"" is an intriguing supernatural story of an orphan with a special ability. One great difference from other horror movies is that the boy Cody is sweet and not evil. There is explanation for what happens but the conclusion could have been more commercial and less gloomy. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Sono da Morte"" (""The Death Sleep"")",Before I Wake
3,nogodnomasters,It all starts with butterflies,8,4 November 2017,"Mark (Thomas Jane) and Jessie (Kate Bosworth) have lost their son in a tub drowning accident. Jessie has sleeping issues and goes to group. They adopt Cody Mason (Jacob Tremblay) a polite, clean, neat, well adjusted boy with real sleep issues. What Cody dreams comes true. It starts out with brightly colored butterflies. As Cody sleeps, Mark and Jessie can be with their deceased son in a fantasy world created by Cody's dreams. However, Cody has a monster. When Jessie slips Cody a mickey the fun begins....This is a heart warming horror story about Jessie being a good mom and Cody needing a good mom. The film has horror aspects that Jessie tries to figure out as a detective. The film nicely blends genres and not for those with a fear of butterflies.Bosworth delivers a good performance with a film that centers on her.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",Before I Wake
4,kosmasp,Don't fall asleep,6,13 April 2017,"And no this is not a criticism of the movie. Nor your reaction to it. While it's hard to tell what qualify as boring for some, I do believe this is decent enough to keep your on your toes (or the edge of your seat/bed), without you being in danger (no pun intended). Which cannot be said about the characters in this one.And while there are some inconsistencies throughout, and the usual ""why and who on earth would do that in real life?"" moments, will not be a big enough obstacle for your viewing pleasure. It is what it is and yes when it comes to kids, this one ranks pretty high in the horror list. The actors make this worthwhile I guess.",Before I Wake
5,Sleepin_Dragon,"So imaginative, visually beautiful film.",8,30 August 2018,"I'll admit the trailer didn't grip me, I watched it and thought I wouldn't enjoy it, big mistake, this is such an imaginative horror, which defies all the usual horror cliches, the usual proceedings are turned on their head, the child, Cody, is a really nice kid, not the usual Damianesque monster you are normally guaranteed. The parents are not sadistic or twisted, they're just trying to do their best and get by.The film is a visual treat, when it's intended to look good it's beautiful, the butterflies look stunning, so bright, and on the flipside the moths and Canker Man look menacing and dark. The scares are good, plenty of things going on, but you need to keep watching and concentrating. I wouldn't say it has much in store for those that love gore and twisted horror, it would be tame for those, but for the casual horror viewer, this is a smashing movie.The ending was the only part I felt was a little bit of a let down, such a good film deserved a better conclusion.Well worth seeing, 8/10",Before I Wake
6,lee_eisenberg,dream time,6,14 January 2018,"Mike Flanagan's ""Before I Wake"" is one of the more unusual horror movies that I've seen. It looks at how our experiences affect our dreams (does that make it more psychological thriller than horror?). Some of the scenes are kind of silly, but it's actually an interesting movie. Jacob Tremblay's character reminded me of his role in ""Room"".The thought of a person's dreams colliding with reality might sound like a ripoff of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", but this is an original story. I particularly liked Kate Bosworth's performance (Thomas Jane's was too underdeveloped). It's not a great movie - far from the scariest movie ever - but I enjoyed it. Also starring Annabeth Gish (Agt. Reyes on ""The X Files"").",Before I Wake
7,paul_haakonsen,Dreams turning to nightmares...,7,4 October 2016,"""Before I Wake"" was actually a nice surprise of a movie. And by that I mean that it was a most welcomed addition to the horror genre, especially with the myriad of generic and mediocre horror releases so far in 2016.What makes ""Before I Wake"" stand out is the way that the movie is built up, and for that I must really applaud director Mike Flanagan. The movie starts out at a good pace, and it does get far about the story quickly, so that the audience is up to speed right away, and then the movie just continues to progress at a good pace. And I dare actually say that there isn't a dull moment throughout the course of the entire movie.The story, briefly summarized and without giving away spoilers, is about young couple Jessie (played by Kate Bosworth) and Mark (played by Thomas Jane) whom have suffered a tragic loss of their son. They take in foster child Cody (played by Jacob Tremblay). Cody turns out to be a special gifted child, but something is following Cody, something dark and sinister.You quickly get comfortable in the storyline and feel right at home with the characters, because there is a lot of personality and story attached to them, and it is presented in a most enjoyable way. And the characters are so well-fleshed out on the screen that it feels like you are in the movie yourself.The cast in the movie was quite good, and they really did good jobs with their given roles and characters. Especially child actor Jacob Tremblay, he was really impressive. It was somewhat of an acquired taste to watch Thomas Jane with that hair as he had in this movie.And there is good amount of spooky and disturbing moments throughout the course of the movie. That is really a good thing, because it adds so much to a horror movie when the movie manages to instill some kind of fear or dread in the audience. And as for the actual thing that follows Cody around, well I will not go into details about what it is or anything, but I will say that it was really, really nicely made and it did really appeared spooky.""Before I Wake"" is actually more than just your average horror movie. I will not give away anything specific here. But once the movie comes towards an end, let me just say that so many questions from throughout this movie will be answered. And while the story is dark and scary, it is also actually a very beautiful story in a way. You will know what I mean once you've seen the movie.It has been awhile since last I watched a horror movie that managed to grip me as much as ""Before I Wake"" did. And this is definitely a movie that is entertaining. It is a most welcomed addition to the horror genre library of movies. If you haven't already seen ""Before I Wake"", and if you enjoy horror movies, then you really owe it to yourself to sit down and watch it.",Before I Wake
8,morrison-dylan-fan,"""Insomnia means no dreams.""",10,22 January 2017,"2014:After my nerves being left ripped by Oculas on the big screen,I decided to check what other titles auteur film maker Mike Flanagan was making. Learning that he was making another Horror movie with Thomas Jane,I started to look forward to seeing the result. Checking back over the next year or so,the only thing I would find is that the title was stuck in limbo,due to the original studio going bust.2016:Giving up on seeing a new Flanagan creation,I was shocked to see Hush suddenly appear on Netflix. Searching round for info on Hush,I was thrilled to learn that the Thomas Jane one had recently hit DVD,which led to me finally waking up.View on the film:Filmed after looking in the mirror of Oculas,editor/co-writer(along with Jeff Howard) directing auteur Mike Flanagan expands on the reflections displayed in his last work,with the use of extended sequences played in eerie silence pointing to the silent terror of Hush. Despite the studio ""issues"" leading to the main CGI effect looking a bit wonky, Flanagan delicately scatters the CGI to give the icy chills a poetic fantasy quality, startlingly lit via bright butterflies,whose colourful wings keep Flanagan's nightmare bubbling underneath .Cutting back to Shawn's death with razor-sharp edits, Flanagan expands on the blurring of reality and a horrific dream world of Oculas with dazzling tracking shots being tipped sideways by Mark's and Jessie's dream coming true.Showing a real liking for literal jaw-dropped screams,Flanagan reunites with cinematographer Michael Fimognari and co-composers (along with Danny Elfman) The Newton Brothers to fly the family into creepy horrors,sprayed with a light green and yellow over the house to give the backdrop an unsettling ""off"" atmosphere, highlighted in highly stylish shots focusing on what is slithering up the walls of the ""dream"" family home.Examining the parental loss in Oculas,the screenplay by Flanagan & Howard hits extraordinary raw power by expanding on the theme to look at the loss of a child. Avoiding the ""creepy kid"" clichés,Flanagan returns to the troubled suburban home to brilliantly look at the family unit for the first time, (which Ouija 2 would continue on) with the writers uncovering the grieving fantasies of Cody,Mark and Jessie,which hides the horror rotting the corners of their suburban home walls.Joined by Mike's son Rigby Flanagan-Bell playing a young version of him, Jacob Tremblay gives a great performance as Cody that keeps the character away from the bratty notes of other child characters,by Tremblay showing a real care towards keeping Cody mysterious,and keeping Cody's personal tragedies intact. Struggling keep things together after Shawn's death, Thomas Jane and Kate Bosworth give superb performances as Matt and Jessie,thanks to Bosworth gradually bringing the grip Jessie has held since the death to the surface to protect her family,whilst Jane casts the grief across Matt's face,as he hopes to see his son once more before I wake.",Before I Wake
9,Aaron1375,"Interesting premise and very promising start, just did not finish",6,11 April 2018,"I saw this film on Netflix mainly because it was recommended by a friend at work. It was interesting and hardly a waste of time, but like so many horror movies throughout history, it had something, but it did not fully deliver. It amazes me how often this happens, perhaps it is easy to come up with a creepy concept, but it is just hard to find a satisfactory way to finish said horror film. This one starts out very well, has some good creepy stuff going on, but kind of ends in a very dissatisfying manner that it made me enjoy the film less than I should have. One thing that surprised the heck out of me is when I came to this page to review the film, Thomas Jane was the dad. I do not know how the heck I did not recognize him when I was watching it! The story has a couple who have recently lost a child about to become foster parents to a troubled, but super polite young boy. This young boy seems to want to avoid sleep at all costs as he chugs sugary drinks and takes those pills that keep you awake. The mother tries to get him to sleep, but when the boy does strange things seem to happen around the house. Seems, butterflies appear and it is not long before the parents realize that the boy's dreams manifest themselves in the real world. The mother tries to take advantage of this gift to see her deceased son, but the father is opposed to using the boy this way. However, soon, both parents find out that not only do the boy's dreams manifest themselves, but so do his nightmares! The cast is pretty good and the film is rather well done. It has a similar premise to another film, ""The Disappointment Room"" in that both films feature a couple who have recently lost a child, though this one is far superior to that one. The ending is disappointing though, as it tries to be kind of happy, but it leaves so many things unanswered. Thankfully, though, the film has pretty good pacing and enough things good about it that the ending doesn't totally detract from the rest of the film. So the film had its moments, it just could have done a bit more to finish things out. The premise needed to be explored more fully than it was instead of leaving us wandering what the heck happened to certain people. The film features some good creepy scenes and has a rather unsettling creature within. Was not a bad film by any stretch, but not very good either. That is like a lot of horror films, they have a good story going for them and things such as an ending that fails to deliver end up making it less memorable and good than it should have been.",Before I Wake
10,trashgang,beautiful shots but a slow building supernatural flick,6,19 October 2016,"When I saw this title and the posters I thought it was going to be a horror, don't be fooled it isn't. It's more of a supernatural drama. But was it all that bad as some might say?To be honest, it wasn't my thing but it did had a few of creepy moments. What does work is the way it was shot. There are some beautiful scene's to catch. The movie itself was a rather slow once halfway the flick reveals what is going on. Slowly again it build further into what is going on.If you dig fantasy or supernatural flicks you will love this one but for horror geeks this is a waist of time.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",Before I Wake
11,deloudelouvain,Good enough to watch once.,6,29 June 2020,"Just finished watching this one and overall I can say it's worth a watch. I wouldn't watch it a second time though, for that it's a bit too slow for my taste. The characters move a lot in slow motion, whisper a lot, the music is kinda boring, and I don't think that was really a good idea. A faster pace could have made this movie better. The good things about Before I Wake were the scenes with Canker Man, those were creepy and even if they were mostly jump scares they worked nonetheless to create a certain dark atmosphere. The acting wasn't bad, even though I wasn't a fan of any of the characters because they acted too slow like mentioned before. All in all the story is entertaining, maybe far fetched and it didn't make sense all the time and but it's still worth watching.",Before I Wake
12,siderite,"Great potential, but cardboard characters. The ending was intriguing.",7,2 September 2017,"As horror/thriller movies, this wasn't bad, but the characters' shallowness messed it up. The underlying idea was fresh and interesting: what if the dreams of a little boy would become reality? Unfortunately, they kept the dreams and nightmares to the basic things the boy saw the day before sleeping plus one recurring nightmare. Try to remember what little boys dream and imagine how much more impressive (and scarier) this could have been.To me the worst part of it all was Thomas Jane's character. A nondescript dad, whose only role in the plot is to be a fun father and a placeholder husband. He played it OK, but man! what lazy writing.The movie started somewhat slow, only to accelerate to unacceptable levels at the end. If this would have been more than an interesting idea with sub par implementation of the details, it could have been a classic movie to be remembered by the fans forever. As such, it's forgettable and uninspiring.",Before I Wake
13,KineticSeoul,"It's fairly standard, but it's a horror movie that the whole family can watch.",5,29 July 2016,"This is a horror movie that just about anyone can sit through without it giving them nightmares. So if you wants a very scary and suspenseful scary movie than this movie is probably not for you. When it comes to the story, it's pretty standard. About a haunted boy or girl's past and supernatural stuff going on. Again this isn't a scary horror movie, this one seemed more like a fantasy movie with creepy ghosts. It sort of reminded me of the movie ""The Lovely Bones"" mixed with ""MAMA"" except with a lower budget . Where it leads to it having more heart and touching moments with supernatural elements thrown in. If you have seen horror movies before, there really isn't anything new when it comes to this. I personally found it boring since I have seen everything in this movie done before, except scarier. But if you are looking for a horror movie that the whole family can probably watch without it going overboard with blood and gore, this one might be it.5/10",Before I Wake
14,Hellmant,Doesn't quite ever live up to it's great potential.,7,2 February 2018,"'BEFORE I WAKE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A horror fantasy about a couple who adopt a child who's dreams, and nightmares, come alive physically when he sleeps. It stars Kate Bosworth, Jacob Tremblay, Thomas Jane, Annabeth Gish and Dash Mihok. The film was directed by Mike Flanagan (who's also helmed such other low budget horror flicks as 'OCULUS', 'HUSH', 'OUIJA: ORIGIN OF EVIL' and 'GERALD'S GAME'), and it was scripted by Flanagan and Jeff Howard (Flanagan's frequent writing partner). It's received mixed to positive reviews from critics, and it was released by Netflix through it's streaming site. I enjoyed it. After tragically losing a child, and being unable to have more kids of their own, Jessie (Bosworth) and Mark (Jane) decide to adopt. They pick an eight-year-old boy named Cody (Tremblay), who seems like a sweet and idealistic kid. Then the couple witnesses Cody's dreams manifest themselves in front of them. The dreams are at first beautiful things, like butterflies, and the couple also sees their deceased son (Antonio Evan Romero) appear among them too. Jessie sadly takes advantage of Cody, in order to create her lost son for her. Cody's dreams soon turn to nightmares though, and a horrific and deadly monster appears. I've really enjoyed Flanagan's other movies, and I really like this cast as well; especially Tremblay, who's turning into such an impressive young actor. The premise for this film is really interesting and creepy too. It's even beautiful and touching at times. The film overall is a little slow though, and it doesn't quite ever live up to it's great potential. Still, it's a decently made little horror flick, without a doubt.",Before I Wake
15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Wake in fright.,7,19 August 2020,"This fantasy horror flick is clearly inspired by the work of Guillermo Del Toro, positing a world in which monsters usually aren't what they seem to be. The plot of 'Before I Wake (2016)' revolves around a foster couple who welcome a young boy into their home, only to be amazed by his dreams and haunted by his nightmares. The piece is one of both genuine beauty and genuine terror. It's a hopeful film, despite its moments of heaviness. It's also about more than it initially seems to be, with most elements having an allegorical counterpart rooted directly in character. This character focus is refreshing and it makes for an engaging experience. The ending is a little protracted, featuring an extended explanation of the film's events, but it's also rather satisfying. It leaves you with a smile, proving that not all horror has to be nihilistic. The movie isn't afraid to use CGI, but its restraint in other areas makes it feel generally rather palpable. It has some great creature design and well-achieved scares, too. In the end, this is an enjoyable experience. Director Mike Flanagan continues to impress. 7/10",Before I Wake
16,Reno-Rangan,It all begins with the butterflies!,7,4 September 2016,"People think it is a horror, but it was a fantasy-horror. According to the director, it is a supernatural theme. You may ask what's the big deal, but if you watch the film you will get, particularly the conclusion twist. It was a decent film with a good cast. It marks the return of the wonder boy Jacob Tremblay, after a tremendous performance debut from the Oscar nominated film 'Room'. Once again, he was brilliant, but due to the different theme, it might not be recognisation on a big scale. The main narration was led by Kate Bosworth, really worth mentioning her role as she was excellent like never before in the lead.When a young couple lose their son, they adopt an eight year old boy, Cody. It's a new start for them, as well as for the boy, but after a few days later they come to know the boy has some kind of supernatural power. So they begin to use him for their own gain and neglect him on the other ground. But it won't stay long that way, as one day a dreadful event happens, followed many similar. The remaining narration is to tell us how they're going to fix it, but the real question is, is it possible to solve.It's a better film than what the rating states. But the issue was it is kind of improvised version of 'Oculus'. And it is not too scary or the too soft narration, but the kind of ending it had, it should have been targeted the families and children with more leaning on the fantasy stuffs. I think the horror concept brought in just to attract the adult crowds. Overall, it can be watched by everyone and that excludes little kids. For me the ending part made me consider it a good film. Because I believe everyone had such misunderstanding, growing up at that stage of the life, so did I.7/10",Before I Wake
17,paulclaassen,MUCH better than expected. Really great!,7,28 June 2018,"I started watching the film with the pre-conceived idea I wasn't really going to like it, or that it might be boring. I couldn't have been more wrong! This was scary. This was magical, sad, believable and beautiful! Yes, we've all seen movies before where a couple adopts a child and things then go very wrong. I actually expected this to be a 'been there seen that' scenario. The actors were really great and convincing.

It's not a long movie and things start happening very soon after the beginning.

It's a simple idea similar to A Monster Calls and I Kill Giants, though this is much more horror and less grandiose than those two. Seems this is almost a sub-genre now (better than zombies!)

Cody's mother died of cancer and the last time he got to say goodbye to his mother, she looked really sick and the monster somehow resembled of her last appearance. Cody's new mother stopped the monster with the butterfly toy that she took from the belongings of his biological mother in the hospital archives. Cody was protecting people in the old orphanage in the chrysalis like they were butterflies. He let them go as his new mother took him back home. She used Cody to see his dead son who drowned in the bathtub and she was so careless about her husband taken by cancerman too. Her husband, previous foster parents and the bully at school were all taken by cancerman and she told him a story about them coming back in bed. It consumes them by taking their into his. We don't know if Cody managed to bring them back although we saw them come back. It is not clear if it was the story she was telling or reality. I knew it was dramatic but I didn't know it'd be this heartbreaking. The kids were so innocent and pure like they were in Mike Flanagan's Haunting of Hill House. Cody and other kid actors were amazing. I really liked the story and i even understood how the sociopath mother used Cody to see her dead son.",Before I Wake
25,Anurag-Shetty,"A good film, that is more fantasy than horror.",7,18 April 2016,"Before I Wake tells the story of Cody(Jacob Tremblay). Cody has been moving from place to place because, different foster parents have been adopting him from time to time. Now, he is in the care of, Jessie(Kate Bosworth) & Mark(Thomas Jane). Jessie & Mark soon realize, that Cody's dreams physically appear before them, as he sleeps. The deadly fact is, the same thing happens during his nightmares. Before I Wake is an impressive film. However, it is not that scary. The jump scares are minimal. The suspense is superbly maintained throughout the movie, by director Mike Flanagan. However, the ending of the film, is disappointing & frankly, slightly silly. The biggest flaw with this movie is that it is not properly categorized. It is supposed to be a horror movie but, it feels more like a fantasy thriller. The script by Mike Flanagan & Jeff Howard is original & unique. However, I liked Flanagan & Howard's previous collaboration, Oculus(2013) better. Jacob Tremblay's performance as Cody, is the highlight of the film. Tremblay continues to impress us with his supreme acting ability, after being lauded for his performance in Room(2015). Kate Bosworth is great as Jessie. Thomas Jane is effective as Mark. Annabeth Gish is good as Natalie. Dash Mihok is awesome as Whelan. Antonio Evan Romero, Kyla Deaver & Hunter Wenzel are amazing as Sean, Annie & Tate, respectively. Before I Wake is not a must watch.

26,juanmuscle,Nothing short of majestic...,10,24 June 2016,"I just wish their could of been a novel as well to be able to hold onto the those precious moments longer, really delve fully into the thoughts and feelings of the protagonist, you almost wish it was a show and you could watch this protagonist grow up before your eyes for there is so much one can do with this gift/curse, whatever it is, it is doubtless an extraordinary experience for the viewer to be there whilst he goes through it all himself; learns to master his craft; learns how to attain wisdom; appropriate his needs dutifully; garnish art; adorn the dull; and perhaps even annihilate the ""evil"". There is so much material by which one can form moral dispositions bolstered by really rich undercurrents. For the material will always be teeming with creative scientific modes of life and all its vast ontological aspects and possibilities. He is playing God in a real life setting with an omni-omniscient voice you get only in novels. With his extraordinary gift every single scene has the potential to circumscribe philosophical ideologies, political and social doctrines; dogmas; social conditioning and god know what else whereon all of which can be expatiated to deliver the answers to burning questions which have plagued the learned, erudite minds with its all encompassing web which make up the warp and woof of our human condition, our human enigma since the dawning of the intellectual era. Hell you could do this show all over the world and it would yet sustain its unique and special value in all sorts of sociological paradigms. But I digress...This flix to me, seemed to have a immanent course on adoption twined with the undercurrent which raised questions about the common theme of filial bonds unto itself. Our fears as a father, as a mother, as a family, as an adopted family to which the spurious genetic bloody imprint which makes for an always narrow-minded, pathetic, intolerant puritanism to pervade and preside over tattling provinces with the rest of the captious and petty scandal-mongers. Growing up with these heretical social mores and corollary factions implanted over our formative years set the frame for an offing manifesting spectral tales disseminating from the propaganda machine whereupon we lick it up in nice obsequious dollops. We as potential parents tend to go through every other route before even beginning to consider this wonderful option. And as you can see in this super cool flix, the characters let us know through their own personal discourse how they were able to overcome these fallacious obstacles to by-pass the terrible filial crux scrawled in blood on stone whence the darkest most vile millenniums were borne. Whereby truly turning an absurd situation into something wonderful and completely natural for the parents and the poor lost tyke. Really truly a wonderful flix, you can put whatever tag, label, whereto file it away in a cozy lil' cubbyhole in which you feel most comfortable trying to gird another creative essence; but I would much rather simply call it a really fun super cool flix!",Before I Wake
27,spookyrat1,The Production Team Are Just Dreaming!,5,15 February 2020,"At time of writing I haven't seen any of director/writer/editor Mike Flanagan's other films. I can appreciate that he's trying to do something a little different from your typical supernatural/horror generic piece. But to put that particular hybrid together, he just asks the viewing audience to accept way too many story contrivances.(1) The Orphanage/Social Security people must have known/witnessed Cody's abilities before and after Jessie's & Mark's experiences ... and they do nothing???(2) Whelan Young seems to have been committed to an asylum for the disappearance of his wife, even though he appears very sane. Jessie's allowed to just cruise around and under no suspicion concerning the disappearance of her husband??? This is after her being castigated for drugging the kid, though the medical authorities do the same thing themselves for the same reason.3 The cops seem to do a lot of showing up with flashing car lights in this film, but not much else, especially investigating a bunch of missing people, all in Cody's proximity.4 In the second half of the film, Jessie just seems to forget about Mark, who she knows to have been murdered by Cody's dream monster. Her priority just seems to be getting Cody back under the same roof as she. Quite bizarre and really doesn't make any sense when considering how she seemed to be happy to blame Mark for Sean's drowning in the bathtub, though we're never told why.5 Which brings me to to exactly that. How does a 6 year old boy drown in the bath tub? He wasn't a baby. Surely this needed more explanation, than just taking the lazy way out and saying, ""It just happened"".Before I Wake is a fine looking film with a good soundtrack, decent special effects and a solid cast. It's just a pity that like so many of these horror genre pieces, more attention isn't given to ironing out the many flaws and loose ends apparent in the narrative. I'm just staggered how so often the creative forces behind these productions, just expect us to accept the results of lazy writing and do so without objection.",Before I Wake

29,Seth_Rogue_One,More of a supernatural drama than a full on scare horror,7,24 June 2016,"Decent movie, it has a couple flaws in the script (which I can't really point out without spoiling stuff so I won't bother doing that) but the resolution was brilliant and Kate Bosworth pulled one of her better performances as of late so it's well worth seeing.If you are looking for a horror movie to have you by the edge of the seat the whole time, this is probably the wrong movie to pick but if you want to see something original (as far as horror's goes at least) then this is not that bad of a pick.So yeah a solid effort with an emotional punch and it also looks very neat visually.If you liked HALF LIGHT (2006) with Demi Moore and DRAGON FLY (2002) with Kevin Costner then I think this should be right up your alley.",Before I Wake
30,apryla-58795,Thomas Jane is hot and about the only thing worth watching in this mess,5,12 January 2019,There is so much to unpack with this one!Jacob Trembley is adorable and very advanced for his age. I hope he goes on to have a long successful career without falling prey to the usual child star horrors.Thomas Jane is really hot. I wish he acted more. Where has he been lately? He was wasted in this.Kate Bosworth is beautiful but she's so thin I think someone should do an intervention. It's just not normal to be skin and bones. Her acting in one way was kind of realistic since she is supposed to be a grieving checked out person BUT that doesn't translate very well to the big screen so she seemed like she was in a stupor the whole time. Plus there was no chemistry between her and Thomas Jane.Dash Mihok was good.A few other random thoughts...They paint the kids bedroom and then he sleeps in the room that very same night. Ok unless they used non-toxic paint that just seems kind of ignorant. Paint needs time to dry yet they have all the furniture pushed back into place a few hours later? It's very harmful to inhale paint fumes so that was just kinda dumb.Who dries dishes with a hand towel anymore?! They have a huge house that no doubt has a dishwasher yet you see them drying dishes with a towel two different times. Weird.What kid is allowed to just roam the halls of their school unattended and unaccounted for? The bully just shows up to terrorize Jacob Trembley during recess and no one knows he's missing? That's a school that is not doing their job.What doctor just writes a prescription to a child (or anyone for that matter) without seeing them first?! So unrealistic not to mention the whole malpractice thing.Showing Thomas Jane slapping the kid to get him to wake up?! Not cool.Not sure how social services could take the child when she tells them that the pill was prescribed by his doctor.I doubt you could just walk into a mental ward and request to see a patient without a few questions first and also how did she just walk into the building where the kid was being kept? Where's security?! Same with hospital-you gotta have swipe cards for practically every door yet she's just gonna waltz into the old file area and take stuff from them?!She just takes the kid at the end with no issues from the social worker who had just got done telling her a few hours previously that she needed help and she never wanted to see her again?!Social worker was in a cocoon all gross then next scene she has nothing on her and her hair is perfectly coiffed.We get no reason why the kid drowned and why the mom blames the dad. Plus dad is taken yet she seems fine with him being out of the picture?Why was everything shot so close up? Seemed unnecessary.This movie drags and some scenes just go on forever for no apparent reason.Hopefully before I wake next time - I will have a dream that this wasn't so unrealistic and unsatisfying.,Before I Wake
31,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10),6,24 March 2019,"The stage curtains open ...""Before I Wake"" is a visual extravaganza - mystical, horrifying, and even magical all at the same time. Not exactly a Horror movie, not exactly a Thriller either ... and not even a Drama. It is hard to classify this movie. What it is, to me, is a Fairy Tale - what could be a terrifying fairy tale, that caters to the eyes.Some time after the Hobsons lost their own little boy to a drowning accident, they foster another special boy and take him into their home. He is quiet, unobtrusive and is afraid to fall asleep. But when he does fall asleep, wonderful things begin to happen. Physical manifestations of what he is dreaming about actually begin to appear - starting first with colorful butterflies, then their own son next to a christmas tree ... and then the darkness begins to show through. The 'Canker Man' arrives and suddenly, his ability is no longer wondrous - it is deadly.This movie starts out with a bang as the very first scene grabs your attention and keeps you glued to the screen. As the movie develops though, it loses some of its steam. I was not impressed with Kate Bosworth in this one as the foster mother. She was one of the most boring characters I think I've seen in recent memory. Pretty much devoid of any personality, she just kinda floats from one scene to the next. Her facial expression is the same in every single take.The strength of this movie is in its visuals. Fantastic - and yet, still not really strong enough to make this a recommend. Overall, I did enjoy the story and young Jacob Tremblay was impressive as the troubled dreamer. But, it was nothing really special or noteworthy. Some people are really going to love this movie, and I can understand why. I personally felt it was just okay.",Before I Wake

33,Mehki_Girl,Really Enjoyed This! Now the Whiners...,8,28 September 2021,"I read some of the other reviews and some people are listing things as these giant plotholes.Why isn't the mother more upset that her husband went poof?She's upset sure. But she's on a mission to get that kid back so she's got something to keep her occupied for the time being. Plus, there's always the possibility that her husband can come back. There is absolutely nobody else who can bring back her husband except the boy. She knows what happened. What else is she going to do?Why do the couple appear to have no visible means of income?The husband is seen at a desk drawing and so I imagine he's actually an architect and can work from home. They have a beautiful home and it's very possible that the wife simply doesn't have to workWhy doesn't the orphanage know that he has these magical powers?Actually it's possible that they never saw any of it happen. I would imagine that the majority of the staff would be asleep when he's asleep. This is not a kid who would allow himself to fall asleep during nap time.Why was the orphanage door open?Who says the kid didn't unlock the door in his dreams? Afterall he managed to wrap everybody and moth cocoons. I would imagine he could probably unlock the door in his sleep. Entities are solid while he's dreaming. This kid can do amazing things with his mind.Why didn't she wish for the husband's return?Perhaps, because she imagines her husband being with their son to take care of him.As we see at the end the little boy imagines a butterfly while he is awake. She says as he gets older and better in control, there's no telling what he can do. It's very possible that he'll bring back the husband, the little boy, the missing couple, and the wife.I like to imagine that he does.Yeah, I get that some movies, a lot of times, don't make a lot of sense and it's difficult to suspend disbelief. But unless the movie is really, really outrageously just awful, I'm always willing to suspend my disbelief because I'm trying to enjoy a movie and so I let stuff go.There are worst things in life than a movie that doesn't meet all of one's expectations.",Before I Wake

This is another chick movie. It has all the chick movie components. Dead kid, depressed beautiful rich mom with no friends, useless husband, group therapy sessions, sad piano music.It's pretty good as a Netflix-Lifetime chick movie without the drunk violent ex husband but it's not a horror movie or a ghost story or a thriller or suspenseful.

So in my POV it's more a Drama with some mystery elements. What i liked was the story: the imagination of a little child becomes reality and more importantly his pain gets a name and manifests into something (on the 1st sight) evil. Are the CGI perfekt ? No, but that's fine - remember, it's a child's mind trying to cope with his mother illness and death. So, it's a fresh breath to a worn out genre worth being watched.",Before I Wake
37,scottshak_111,A fantastical whimsy!,6,29 April 2016,"Before I Wake carries a beautiful concept that could have moulded it into a better flick if it were not for its flaws.Jacob Tremblay is everywhere. His cuteness is a delight to watch. He walks in with a confident mien to deliver extraordinary cutesy bits that are both enthralling and adorable just like he is in person. At the end of the day he is delivering, who's complaining? Mike Flanagan's yet another horror venture packs in a fantastical story that has been well thought of when you give an eye to its concept. Dreams coming alive! A fancy world something only a beautiful mind could create. But the big question is how does it all pack in its capsule? Starting with the direction, Before I Wake takes off beautifully. But there are elements that gnaw at it gradually stopping it from reaching a charming gleam. The first one being Kate Bosworth's character Jessie. We could have used a better cast here. Even though a tad distant, which was needed for her character, for parts where it mattered the most, she appeared kind of absent emotionally. Thomas Jane, au contraire, fit the bill just fine.The second crucial part of the flick was its tangibility. Even though we were wading deep in an imaginary world, it is the natural things that surround it that help the flick to get carved in a realistic feel. Something which the movie lacked profusely. You often wonder, ""Why is she not calling the police?"" or ""Why is she going there?"" or ""Where is everybody?"" The latter one seems to be a factor that every horror movie overlooks.When you look at the scary quotient of the movie, it amasses plenty to scare you. There are great horror bits that are downright chilling to experience. However, there is nothing that will continue to haunt you for days owing to the great concept it tags along with its slow thoughtful pace.Screenplay has nothing to offer. Good scary movies consider this factor well, so it was a big downer there. Music is just meh, considering the chills it was supposed to furnish.SPOILERS: It is only after Before I wake reaches midway that it actually starts to dwindle. You find Jessie actually reaching out for shriveled dark enclaves fearlessly which makes you question how fearless she really is. You would have wimped out from that dreary situation or maybe called the police first, and made it a universal thing. But then you realize maybe she was carved with balls, and that the role wasn't really cut out for Kate Bosworth actually. Any other sentient cast that wore her expressions better would have made it relatable.When things reach its climax, you get a better glimpse into the story, as you understand who the ""Canker Man"" really was and how Cody's head projected it. The revelation doesn't tingle you much as you wonder how an imaginative nightmarish creation could be stopped by a memory glimpse. Throws you in a thoughtful territory for a second, which is actually very good for your head.Eventuality becomes dope-high on fancy, as it endeavours to show what the child could do with just his thoughts, as the mother tries to let the child embrace his powers. She creates a happy ending for everybody to bring them back to life. But till that point of time you have really gone aloof trying to figure out how could his thoughts bring back the dead like Sean into reality for good.A great concept that steers in a clouded zone owing to its shoddy direction, and the questions it leave you with.",Before I Wake
38,dvc5159,A Human Heart to Go with the Scares,8,18 May 2016,"It is infinitely better to center horror films around flawed, adult human beings, rather than seeing another vapid pretty face slashed by a faceless mook. Filmmakers like Guillermo del Toro (The Devil's Backbone) and William Friedkin (The Exorcist) understood that notion, where human flaws and regrets coil up subconscious fears into horrifying supernatural manifestations. Greenhorn filmmaker Mike Flanagan, who scared audiences with his surprisingly clever Oculus years ago, returns to follow these veterans' footsteps with his flawed but nonetheless human sophomore effort.Here, Flanagan whips up another spooky tale that effectively doubles as a drama about loss and coping, centering around troubled adult couple Jessie (Kate Bosworth) and Mark (Thomas Jane) coping with the loss of their child Sean. They adopt gifted kid Cody (Jacob Tremblay) whose dreams - and nightmares - come physically alive. Jessie sees this as an opportunity to relive her memories of her dead child, while Mark becomes rightfully concerned. Bosworth and Jane play their roles straight without the slightest hint of genre awareness, instantly grounding the film in tragic plausibility throughout.Despite some shortcomings - including a half-baked coda that feels like a blatant Nikon ad, Flanagan's clever and wisely understated direction - including a refreshing lack of jumpy moments and music in the favor of slow burn chills - overcomes them and brings out the best in atmosphere and performances – specifically that of young Jacob Tremblay, who subverts the evil kid trope by convincingly looking remorseful about his 'gifts', unfortunately to little avail.",Before I Wake
39,fil-nik09,Quite good!,8,26 August 2016,"Before I Wake is not really a horror film. It is labeled as supernatural thriller and I can agree with that, but also it can be labeled as supernatural fairytale as - from what I understood - the film has a very happy ending.Must say that the kid who was playing Cody is great. He is really believable and his expressions throughout the film were really convincing ( either in school or in bed/home). His parents also did a great job.The story itself is interesting and keeps you guessing. The revealing truth at the end of the film is good as it gives totally different look on the kid's dreams/nightmares. If we did believe he is responsible for the ( unknown) death of his mother, now we see it isn't so.The only fault with the film for me is how suddenly and at once the ( new) mother is getting into the rescue of Cody and how she is not afraid ( how come?) of nightmares get to her because she has figured out the cause of all. Seems she overnight or less got into the story and everything - medical records, the diary, Cody's previous parents and so on... All in all, quite a good film. Not boring for a moment. Eight from me.",Before I Wake
40,pranayjalvi,Mix of Horror & Fantasy,5,14 August 2016,"From the director of Oculus - a creepy and nerve cracking horror movie, Mike Flanagan decided to become creative and it resulted in Before I Wake. More of a fantasy than a horror, the movie had its few jump scares, but with no strong storyline and mediocre acting, it disappointed where it could have been a good film. Before I Wake has its moments, but it never quite gels into something coherent or greater than the sum of its disparate parts. Rrgardless of the disappointing result, Mike Flanagan should be credited for making a new style of horror gimmick though it didn't match to his grade. I would go with 2.5/5 for 'Before I Wake'.",Before I Wake

42,rlaine,"Wow, what a great non-gore fantasy horror movie",8,9 June 2018,"I read nothing about this movie, but it kept ""haunting"" me on my Netflix recommendations. It looked like a forgettable b-movie, but boy was I in for a treat when I finally decided to watch this.The story is about parents who have lost their son in an accident and who adopt an 8 year old boy whose dreams manifest as real things. You can't really figure out whether it's a movie worth watching by reading the synopsis really, you're just better off watching it. Not the most logical movie ever made and you can probably find a plot hole galore, it's even a bit slow to start with, but in the end this was one of the most beautiful and at the same time one of the scariest movies I've seen in a while.Only now coming to IMDB I found out that this movie was directed by the same guy who did Oculus and Ouija: Origin of Evil, some of the better horror movies I've seen lately. Count me as a Mike Flanagan fan. I probably need to watch Gerald's Game now too, which I had zero intention to watch, but I saw it's also directed by him.Before I Wake is a very well made movie. Well shot, acted and directed. Highly recommended. It has zero gore and blood, but is scary as hell at times and is also very touching.

A tender and dramatic story with the sweet child that his gift or curse is that everything he dreams of takes place.

Jacob Tremblay is amazing and his perfect little boy with a secret side to him was pulled off incredibly without a hitch ""I'm Sorry"". Now Gorgeous Kate Bosworth was the character who made us cringe to no fault of her own the acting and dialogue from the writers was concise yet riveting. a lot of horror movies talk too much or not enough,a lot of them are non educational or don't offer enough clues to what's happening in their creepy minds as a director, Not the case with Mike Flanagan & Jeff Howard directing answer writing the story is original perfectly Paced with explanation that are surprisingly believable and not following the same lane for ending the movie as 90% of doom & gloom horror movies do. Thomas Jane also should be mentioned for becoming a horror actor with a cult following always amazing his latest role that blew everyone away in ""The Veil"" although this role was less demanding it was good but to him it was a cinch I'm sure of that. All in All the movie got 8/10 from me definitely recommend it. It wasn't the scariest but it was definitely very creepy and it was enough of it through out the whole movie with a good ending.

49,Sci-FiHorrorFan,A Strange but Interesting Film.,8,2 December 2016,"I Liked this film I thought it was well written and directed. I Like Kate Bosworth and Thomas Jane and I thought they gave good performances. There was good character development of the two main characters which I thought was a good idea because it made them more likeable. The Story to the film was interesting because it was different from most other horror films. The Story is about a little boy that is adopted by two parents Thomas Jane and Kate Bosworth and one night they see glowing butterflies in their house which randomly come and go. they Later find out that the butterflies are a manifestation of the boy's dreams. What starts out as nice dreams ends and is soon followed by nightmares about an unknown creature which appears in their house which was created from the boy's dreams. I Thought the idea about dreams becoming reality was a Good idea. I will admit the idea is similar to a nightmare on elm street but it wasn't the Exact same thing, In this film, it was done differently and I thought The Twist at the End was Very Clever. The Ending was also good and well thought out (if not a bit far-fetched). The special effects were pretty good and I Liked the music. The film Did not scare me much but I will admit there were some Chilling scenes and creepy images but it was nothing that Terrified me. What made this Film good was the idea about manifestations. I also Thought the acting from the Main child was quite good and he was very believable in his role. The film also had a lot of emotional scenes in it and those scenes made me like the three main characters. There are not many films out there that deal with dreams becoming psychical manifestations and I Enjoy that idea. The Film also did a good job of building Tension and dread and I thought all the nightmare manifestation scenes were shot very well and they were fun to watch. There were also some good Jump scares. I also liked the design of the creature, I thought it was incredibly Creepy looking! But The main thing that makes this a good film is its good story element and caring likeable characters. This is a horror film that focuses on story Suspense and Fear of the Unknown to creep out its viewer and Not Blood and gore, which in my opinion is Better. The Film may be a slow burn horror but if you stick with it you will be very glad you did. The Ending really surprised me! and I thought the idea was unique and I liked it.

1. Why didn't anyone investigate missing husband? They did, and that much was enough for a day or two worth's investigation.2. Why isn't she grieving her husband? She is, everyone deals with grief differently. Just because she wasnt wailing like it fits your narrative doesn't mean she wasn't.3. Why was the front door of orphanage unlocked? They sedated him and as soon as they did, his dreams started (injections work faster than pills) and no one had chance to lock down the facility.4. Why was tha... Shutup. Use your head. This isn't a flawless movie but it's definitely not as silly as your smart pant thinks it is.Now on to the review.Marketing this movie as a horror movie is so unfair and unfortunate for the director because this really isn't. Those who are going in expecting horror movie with cheap jump scares and gore, sit down. There's nothing for you here. I am actually furious while writing this because this movie does not deserve a 6.2.First of all we almost never get a horror movie with heart. Somehow Mike Flanagan managed to cram in beautiful composition, emotional moments, motherhood, grief and innocence in this film. There are some really heart touching moments. The casting director has done a fantastic job. I guess without that perfectly casted child and mother recovering from loss this wouldn't have worked.I am not a parent and I am someone who doesn't intend to become one and yet this movie touched me. Mike Flanagan is one of the best horror movie directors working right now who is expert behind the lens, brings very creepy visuals, is innovative and makes movies about psychology rather than nerves and cheap thrills.The final monologue and reveal is Goosebump inducing.

As with most horror movies - i went in without too great an expectation and was pleasantly surprised that i really liked it.This movie may be a little bit too soppy or ""nice"" to be classified a real horror movie.It does not rely much on jump scares. Actually it uses scares only sparsely - and instead goes with story and mystery. The roles of the foster parents are actually nicely done and acted. They are a lot less clichéd than countless other ""typical foster parents in suspense/horror movies"".Special effects were alright but not too great - i would have loved to see more practical effects, because the CGI kind of made it look like a rather cheap computer cut-scene sometimes.All in all - recommended - but not if you are looking for a real scare.

So everything pointed it was a great movie.I can honestly say it was good...but the trailer was very misguiding, to me this movie was a dream project that Guillermo del Toro or Tim Burton...in his prime would have made the this such an intense movie, I mean in more experience hands this could have been much better. This movie had horror elements but it felt more like dark fantasy than straight forward horror. And yes Kate Bosworth can actually make a believable performance from time to time, I was glad Thomas Jane was in most of it to make this movie more likable, but it felt flat as soon as Kate took the lead.

56,HorrorFanatic4Life,"Fantasy, thrill and emotional all in one",8,21 November 2019,"This film was great, I'll start with that. It was not at all what I expected and that could be party to blame on how they portrayed this movie to begin with. Do not expect much gore (if any) if that's what you're into when you see a ""typical"" horror/thriller movie. Nonetheless, it was still a great movie overall.The kid was just adorable in every way and really pulled me in to his feelings. I felt bad for the kid to be honest. However, mom and dad lacked a bit in their area. By that I mean they didn't seem as emotional as you would have expected given the circumstances they were dealing with. More so Mom than Dad. But I guess that could have been on purpose seeing as her one and only son died in a horrific accident. Either way, something just seemed a bit off about her character.Now the story was something to be told. It went in so many directions, but it played out so well in my book. It was sentimental with tons of fantasy and bits of horror. That ""cancer"" dude in his nightmares was frightening to me so I'd say they did well with that. I just loved the fantasy part of this movie more than I would have thought.With that being said, I did have a few questions on some plot holes I noticed. One being why noone at the orphanage questioned this?? I can't imagine they didn't notice something off about him, yet they still kept adopting him out to families for them to figure out. Also the ending just seemed too easy of a solution to the entire thing and seemed a bit rushed. I don't know that I really cared for how it ended. But, to me, it wasn't bad enough to hinder my review of the rest of the movie.Despite the mom character and those few minor plot holes, I would definitely recommend and watch it again myself.",Before I Wake

She just goes on like she was never married. No investigation nothing. Ok???What in the world are we seeing in the end? All of the ""dead"" people are seen ""alive"" in some weird story sequence except for the fact they aren't. In the hall she says ""let them go"". Um what?? WHERE ARE THEY? How the F are they even dead in the first place? Why is it some feel good ending when there's literally several effing people missing and we don't get ONE SHRED of explanation as to what happened to them? CanCER man eats them and boom they're gone LOL. HOW IS THAT A HAPPY ENDING?

59,venusboys3,Interesting ideas played out poorly,3,3 October 2016,"I've enjoyed Mr. Flannegan's movies before this one. But right from the start Before I Wake got on my nerves. You've got the perfect couple living in an amazing house without any visible means of support. What do they do for work? The kid is ridiculously adorable mini-Bieber with a cutie-pie pout and way of speaking. Perfect perfect perfect. It's pure Hollywood fantasy.Then there's the usual holes in the think-through of the basic concept. Like, how did the people at the orphanage (or wherever the kid was staying between foster parents) not know about his weird powers? How come no one ever thought to take him to some doctors/scientists to figure out what was going on? (The Exorcist got this part right and was all the scarier for it) How come 'let them go' results in just one release? (though we see multiples coming loose from the roots). How come the wife seems oh so fine with the situation as it stands at the end of the movie? I get that this is a fantasy movie... but if EVERYTHING is unbelievable/implausible then the fantasy elements are lessened and just more of the same nonsense. Yes, the movie is well made, the acting is fine. My gripe, as usual, is with the writing... with the way the characters don't behave like real people. Except for a bit of spooky stuff this could have been kids movie about a magical boy living in a magical land full of magic. So my end opinion is, 'Ick!'",Before I Wake
60,pmdawn,Dark fantasy-horror hybrid Fable,7,8 August 2018,"Having seen and liked Flanagan's other movies, I still approached this with some caution. The reviews and even the director himself were referring to this as a dark fantasy tale, but having seen it I would classify as a mix of that and horror, because there are certainly some horrific events taking place in this movie - until you realize, by the end, that it's also a fable and a dark one at that, for my money.While I didn't know in which direction this one was going, I can see some why folks might have frustrated by this - either because it's not a pure horror film, or those who may have seen the ending coming from a mile away. I would summarize this movie as a series of metaphors about how we deal with loss, memories, and the limits of imagination. At the same time, I can't help but think of this movie with fondness and awe of the beauty of these things, but also knowing one has to let go, after all - life goes on.",Before I Wake

You immediately feel a connection and sentimental attachement to Jessy, Mark and Cody who are all dealing with personal grief from their past.The films opening scene looks a little like the beginning of the Amityville horror but soon turns out to be more reminiscent of the classic boogeyman tale. The movie has timed it's suspenseful moments well so you always feel engaged with the storytelling. The film was both cast and directed incredibly well. I thought Mark as the father figure was the perfect choice and my pick of the film. There was never any moments in which you drift away from the main plot so it makes you feel engaged from start to finish. And by the end everything just seemed to fit into place nicely.Some of the CGI of the Canker man and the ending of the film itself was a little cheesy, but it was quite enjoyable to watch nonetheless.7/10",Before I Wake

68,thomasshahbaz,Ruined by music and CGI,3,18 November 2016,"This could have been so much better. It's an original story, so it's a shame it was brought down to this mediocre level, largely by generic sounding horror music (absolutely run-of-the-mill and eye- rolling) and over-slick CGI (admittedly I think CGI always looks crap, and long for the days of more laborious, physical techniques). Moments such as the monster appearing in the classroom could have been far more chilling were it not for the stock sound effect used (a low BOOM, and/or echoey clanging noise ZZZzzzzzz). I can only imagine whoever does the sound for these things is asked to make it very standard so as not to disappoint the droves of morons who hate be surprised and challenged at all. Another criticism is that the first time the couple see their dead child (i.e. before they're expecting it), a few tears roll down the mother's face, but surely they would have been utterly devastated? To be perhaps slightly stereotypical about it, surely at least the mother would have been completely crushed, and wailing and sobbing uncontrollably? It just didn't ring true. This, and all other emotional scenes are spoilt, again, by the heavy, gushing string music telling you how you should feel, though this is usually the case in any film, and probably says more about my personal tastes than it does about the film.

Very disheartening to have a flu and nothing to do... just to see a movie. Then I saw the poster, and a butterfly led me to Jacob Tremblay. I don't know why. I just love Thomas Jane, but I didn't care, just wanted to see why people talk a lot about Tremblay. This was my opportunity to see what he can do. And, yes... thank you freaking flu for make me do this search! I just met a child who I will admire from now on. I loved the movie, it was a new point in dreams come true, not in the Freddy Krueger way but something original. We have the mind of a child working here, a very powerful mind working, and not kidding. Truth to be told: I have friends of mine, that lost a child (for cancer, incredibly) and Thomas did it great, he convinced me (as always) and reminded me that dad I knew in real life. Damn! Was exactly like him. Kate did it just fine, a good work. She is beautiful and stunning, a great actress, but didn't reminded me to that mother I met, I couldn't fine the pain I saw once there, or close to it. But, she acted well, her performance was very good. Just didn't reach me. Again, she is really stunning. The children in the movie did great also. Sometimes kids are distracting with bad acting (they are kids, is understandable) but wasn't the case here, they played their part very cool, fair to say. But Jacob is a huge spectacle! This kid is awesome, seriously. I haven't see that talent since young age of Dakota Fanning. I just loved him. He just have won a new fan here for life. Back to the movie, the script is very good, but it could have been better, specially with ""Jessie"" and ""Mark"" conversations. And they should do a deep work in the school. The photography is beautiful, and the images are so clear and ""dreamful"", the fantasy part is a work of art... and the creepy parts are creepy, totally awesome. Just a few jump-scares, enough and no more. It wasn't really necessary, because the very point in the movie are not the dreams or nightmares, but the loss (I don't have kids, but I cannot imagine worst pain than that loosing a son or daughter, and for what I saw in real life friends, it must been horrible) of a loved one, letting go, deal with pain, and what someone are capable of for getting back the one who loved. This movie is not horror or terror at all, but a psychological supernatural drama, or a psychological fantasy drama. Anyways, the end is just (no spoiling here) a bittersweet road, I liked it, and it touched me... is not the typical ending in this kind of movies, is not predictable. You have to understand it to like it, really. So: I jut loved it, and recommend it. 10/10 (it was 9/10 because I wanted more, but Jacob was so awesome that I can't help myself to give that point up) Watch it, and judge yourself.

A brain storm led me Amazon.CA (Amazon in Canada) and sure enough they had it. It seems it's available almost everywhere except the United States. Since the Region Codes are the same for the US and Canada, I ordered it and it arrived today.I popped it into my computer for a test run and it would not play with Power DVD. It kept telling me I needed to update Power DVD for it to play and of course the ""updates"" would not work and it still wouldn't play.Next I took it to a Blu-ray player and after watching at least five hideous previews it finally came on the screen with a small box that said, ""Restricted"" and would not play. So I hit the ""Menu Button"" and got it to play – in English – with English Subtitles. I hit the ""Menu Button"" again, switched it back to the regular version, and presto, it began to play like any normal Blu-ray would.Immediately this film brought a couple questions to mind. Who the hell thought up the scuzzy drug dealer haircut for Thomas Jane? And, how did this couple afford their lifestyle when neither of them appeared to work or have jobs? If anyone knows how one can do this I'd like to find out.Other reviewers have covered the plot. I'll just say that for me this film was worth waiting for. It engages the viewer's emotions as well and giving a large dose of suspense. Its ability to transition from grief to supernatural thriller was rather amazing.

79,Yvie81,"Not a horror film and several plotholes, but it doesn't matter!",7,2 October 2019,"This movie can't be named a horror film, cause it simply isn't very scary apart from maybe 2 or 3 jumpscares. Cody's childlike dreams and nightmares that become real simply look too childlike to be scary (at least for a die hard horror fan like me). But the reason they look childlike, because they are manifestations of a little boy's mind, justifies that in my opinion.
Also there are some obvious plotholes and illogical actions by the main characters. Normally I'd get annoyed over that but in this case for some reason it didn't really matter to me. I think this film is mostly a fantasy story as a metaphor for loss, mourning and overcoming loss. I think if you see it that way instead of just a regular horror film you'll appreciate it a lot more. Jessie had to overcome the loss of her child and Cody never had the chance to process the loss of his mother because he was such a young child when she died, he just couldn't understand what was going on.
Anyway, for some reason it really touched me even up to the point I was crying at the end! So I guess purely for being able to touch me that well I give this one a 7, even leaning towards an 8!",Before I Wake

This film is provocative in that it makes you think and feel throughout. It is at times vastly uncomfortable, but magnificently redemptive.

What it suffers from is completely misdirected and misleading marketing which has done this gem a huge disservice. I'd watch it again. I'd recommend it to friends.

Weird to see a movie releasing so late in the US when it was released in India a few months back and even made it to flights - yeah I saw it on one of my long journeys as I couldn't go to the theater in time. I dug around a bit and turns out that the production company went bust; it was actually supposed to hit screens as early as mid of last year. So they kept pushing the dates and when they got some money, they released the film in a few countries. I guess they were smart, knowing that the movie wouldn't really be able to make much money. So I am surprised to see now they are releasing in the US.Even though I saw it in a flight, I can tell you that it was pretty clear to watch and sounded good, so all you purists, don't go judging me :) and take my word when I say that even if you saw it in a theater, your experience would be the same. Now I really like Kate Bosworth and Jacob Tremblay, they are great actors and they do a great job in this movie as well but the story just isn't there.It is a supernatural thriller about this child whose dreams and nightmares become real, physically alive. He has been through a few foster homes and there are a lot of dead and missing people, all because of his nightmares, one of which is Canker-man, an alien/deformed monster who eats people. When he makes it into Jessie and Mark's home, he fills them with hope as they see a beautiful butterfly on the first night he is there. They lost their son when he accidentally drowned in the tub and they have been grieving since then. They love each other but the strains in the relationship are beginning to show and with Cody's introduction into their lives, they look for a new beginning. But alas, that is not to be. Cody's moods start to change and his beautiful dreams become nightmares that take on an ugly turn. The climax is not what I expected but without giving away too much, I think that could be the only ending.I have seen Mike Flanagan's Oculus, which is one of my top recent horror movies and I have heard he did a good job with Hush as well but Before I Wake fails in the story department. Where it succeeds is the acting and the visuals. I think the visuals were really good, even when you see it on a small screen. Tremblay gives another solid performance and the true horror of possessing such a gift/curse was emoted really well by him. I still think it is a one time watch because of all the rubbish movies out there; this one is based on flawed human beings and that makes for a much better watch compared to slash/gore teen flicks.

I can't give too many details without spoiling it, but other than requiring a small suspension of disbelief at the boy's ability and the results of it, they really explained things very well in the end and brought it to a good conclusion.

About the movie it is difficult to review it without spoilers. Let's just say that it was a great horror movie/thriller with cool effects and a few nice true genuine scares.

The last 10 minutes are just amazing. I gave this movie 7 stars rating despite the horrible acting of Kate Bosworth. She was by far the worst thing that happened in this movie. Totally emotionless.

97,reviewandrepeat,"Stop Classifying Everything As ""Horror""",7,29 May 2020,"Before I Wake, in my eyes, is a supernatural drama all the way.This story deals a lot with grief, coping mechanisms, lots of sleep deprivation, and copious amounts of coffee.The first half of Before I Wake was very tense and it had a great eerie atmosphere which I appreciated. Then we had some real action with the Cancerman and at first I found the design to be almost laughable but I tried to keep in mind that it was coming out of the mind of an eight year old. So I gave it a bit of a pass. And then at the end we learn the meaning behind the Cancerman and it all made more sense and my heart ached even more than it already was.When Cody is able to show them the dream version of their son Sean for the first time my heart broke into millions of pieces.There was one scene that I especially enjoyed where Jessie is staring at a hollow eyed version of her son Sean sitting in an old style stand alone tub. And then he starts acting out his death scene and she stands her ground and she's able to turn away from him and walk out of the door. That took real strength for her to do.Before I Wake is a really great movie and I think more people should give it a chance.

As I say, I enjoyed this film but I think the film would have been more compelling to watch if the child's dead mother wasn't a stereotypical screaming banshee and her role was toned down a little.

Then, i saw Oculus, mainstream horror attempt, which was average.Now i thing the director is aiming at mass entertainment movies, which isn't always bad. But it's not the case here since Before I Wake is full of predictable moments and Hollywood clichés.First of all, the characters, secondly the jump scares and CGI.The characters are a bit two dimensional, not fully developed, the acting is average though. It fails at being a good grief and loss drama and it kinda fails at being a fantasy horror movie.The jump scares are nothing that we haven't seen before in tons of mainstream productions. Build up is not always effective and the script not always coherent.Mild spoiler: Same recipe used: child has a gift, something went bad, the woman investigates the past and brings closure.It's not all bad, cinematography and acting are good from time to time, hence the vote, a 6-7 out of 10.

The main kid actor was great!Dislikes: The main female's acing was flatter than a pancake. I don't know if she took too much ambien herself or what the deal was, but she didn't seem grief-stricken half as much as just plain high.Also, the plot holes, if you can call them that. How is it that this kid went through SO MANY FAMILIES that didn't immediately start researching supernatural phenomenon, or turn him over to a team of scientists or something?!
I feel like if my adopted kid started manifesting any kind of bug, or my dead son, or anything else that I'd be reporting it rather than just going along with it! Holy cow! Most humans don't just accept things like this!What's more, I wanted to know more about the kid's powers. Where did he get them? Is he a character in the Marvel comic universe?
Are children with psycjic abilities common in this world? Where DID the physical people go that were absorbed by the monster?! Who was his father? Did anyone else in his lineage have abilities?

So if you're going to watch it expecting a regular scary movie, you shouldn't go ahead.
But you have to judge a piece entirely for what it is and not for what you want or expect it to be. So let's see.While the plot it's not flawless it has a very interesting premise that is certainly more than well executed. The entertainment is granted as it develops at a good enough pace to not fell rushed or dragged, so that factor should be out of the question.
Additionally, the technical view of the film is very well done. Good-looking and believable special effects and a very good acting. The dream monster, buddy Mr. Canker, is well-made and while it isn't scary for a horror flick, it's disturbing enough for this kind.
At the end, the movie leads to an emotive ending that isn't predictable and doesn't feel cheap or corny, since it's all about a well-made resolution.So, this wasn't what I was expected before watching it, but it was a pleasant surprise.
Would I recommend it? Well, if you'll get into it expecting some scares I wouldn't. But generally speaking and judging by my rating of course I would. This is really well done.",Before I Wake

We have Cody, with the literal power (initially) to physically manifest his very THOUGHTS into existence while asleep (seemingly and unwittingly)...in real-time. This ability takes the rather abrupt turn in those last 8 minutes; apparently leaving an opening for a possible sequel...as in those final moments he is able to generate a butterfly while awake, a-la The Twilight Zone: The Movie's ""It's a Good Life"" segment ""hook"" .

A couple who lost their own child adopt this kid who appears not to have a very good history regarding adoption. It soon becomes clear that the boy has a gift (or some would say a curse) for making dreams come true and often frighteningly so. This film explores loss and how different people deal with it and also gives an insight into what occurs after death. A little like The Sixth Sense and I would say good performances from the main leads and the young boy. I would say more fantasy then horror and I think it deserves a follow up movie.,Before I Wake

As if there is a huge part of beginning and then there comes a slightly clumsy resolution to a story not in terms of the content, the kind but because it all happened so fast. Despite this, it is a descent fantasy-horror thriller and even a feel good movie.(I guess..) it is a movie for every kind of movie person. I would also like to point out that the child actor was amazing here and I'd love to see him in any other horror show as well. I can't tell whether Kate Bosworth nailed the role as she screams out as "" I'm acting !"" in some particular scenes.

The seemingly odd combination elements in the film do fit together when you consider the perspective they are revealed to represent at the end.The kid in the film is pretty cute and manages to make you feel protective of and sympathetic towards him without saying that much, which is an achievement in itself. The effects are OK - sometimes they look really good and sometimes a bit quirky but that kind of makes sense by the end also.All in all, quite enjoyable if you are in the mood for slightly scary film with a warm heart.",Before I Wake
122,meydianarizki,I scored this a 10. Let me tell you why:,10,30 October 2020,"Original, Beautiful Film- Not What You ExpectRarely does a film surprise me at all but this film certainly did. Mike Flannigan created an enigmatic speculative on childhood love, loss, fear and death that is both uniquely interpretive and otherworldly fantastical. For those who go into this film anticipating a run-of-the-mill horror film with gruesome effects and bloody deaths, you will be exceedingly disappointed. This film is provocative in that it makes you think and feel throughout. It is at times vastly uncomfortable, but magnificently redemptive. What it achieves is a rare feat- one I would classify more in the realm of Pan's Labyrinth than something like The Ring. What it suffers from is completely misdirected and misleading marketing which has done this gem a huge disservice.I'd watch it again. I'd recommend it to friends.

Their responses to events (that would excite 99% of people) give off a ho-hum vibe. In fairness the actors weren't set up well as the writing for some dialogue was off the mark.A LOT of practical/non-supernatural aspects of the story were implausible, with huge gaps as to how people or agencies react to events. (Someone disappears with seemingly no investigation? The spouse is told 'I don't want to see you again!' by Social Services for doing what any parent would have done?). In some respects, these parts are even less logical than the dream-driven sequences.Supernatural pieces themselves were inconsistent, though overall not much to complain about.

Since then I've kept an eye on his other films. While I thought Hush was excellent, I found Absentia to be an interesting concept with a low quality execution. Before I Wake was similar to Absentia in that way.Before I wake was the least ""horror"" of Flanagan's horror film, in that the story mainly focuses on a sad mom of a dead child and how a foster child helps her heal (or makes it worse?) Even the scary parts are more thriller overall, and so I can see how people going in expecting something classically horrifying like Oculus or Hush could be disappointed. However, the strength of the film lies in the interesting story, even if it was not particularly frightening. If it was executed in a more interesting way, this movie would have been taken from okay to excellent.Overall, I'm happy I watched Before I Wake, but I would not care to re-watch it like I would with some of Flanagan's other films.",Before I Wake

This is one of those stories which shows us perhaps less of gore and spooky scenes but tells something more.
It is a nice story about children who can make their parents lives a dream, however, their power to turn them into the nightmares is equally strong. And it is very important to go into the journey of their subconscious before it is too late instead of ignoring signs of growing problem. It was really touching and profoundly moving. I felt great sadness while watching the second half of this movie which is unusual for this genre. Bravo.
Furthermore, the effects are beautiful. All of this dreaming with eyes open world was so colourful and vivid!
Surely, overall Before I Wake is not some kind of extraordinary movie that I am going to remember all of my live, anyway, it made my weekend quite enjoyable and I recommend it for those who want to see a well-made horror movie with less of illogical scary scenes but filled with some reasoning and ideas.",Before I Wake

The acting was adequate, not necessarily the best I have seen from these actors, but it was ok. The worst part was the constant plot holes. It was just so hard to get into a movie when in the back of your mind you are saying, that would never happen like that, a person would never behave like that.

132,romessanadeem,What I've Come to Expect of Flanagan,6,25 June 2016,"Based on my thoughts on Occulus and Hush, I've come to expect a great plot and questionable execution from Flanagan's productions and he did not disappoint in this. The heavy reliance on butterflies and a woman coming to appreciate and love a child that's not her own (among other things) reminded me of a better horror movie; Mama. All this did was make me wish I was watching that instead of Before I Wake. But then again, Before I Wake isn't a horror movie and it shouldn't have been marketed as one. The film is one part fantasy, one part drama and one part horror/thriller (whatever you want to call it) but it has a difficult time balancing this out. The script and screenplay is too half-baked to advance the film to the heights it wanted to reach.While the characters are not totally flat, it's hard to grasp their motivations exactly. The mother (Kate Bosworth) seems to be driven more by a sense of obligation to her son and later as some sort of moral obligation to herself and her husband instead of an emotional drive toward her adopted son. (This is something which was smoothed over in the last scene of the movie though.) Throughout the film, I had no idea how it was going to end. I was confused about where the film would go but unfortunately, so were the filmmakers. Not being able to develop a screenplay which could support the aspirations of the movie as a drama/thriller/horror/fantasy film, the ending was vague and the movie itself was full of ineffective jump scares and loud noises. Cody's affliction never manifests beyond the typical horror genre clichés that Flanagan relies so heavily upon. Despite this, the story is undoubtedly interesting and would have fared well as a stand alone fantasy film in the hands of the right director/ writer. The dream sequences are often beautiful, the closing act has a bittersweet melancholic note to it and Before I Wake does have moments that inspire some emotion in the heart of the watcher. But so many things are skimmed over and left unexplained, even in the real world the movie tries to depict (how can one bring hidden confidential files home or break into a foster home) While it is not totally incompetently directed, it is a messy film which can't find focus. Before I Wake is entertaining enough and fairly enjoyable, but one can't deny that it is filled with clichés and certain sequences which often become flat out boring or worse, laughable.",Before I Wake
133,flyingsexsnakes,scary and sentimental,8,11 June 2016,"Imaginative and sad, the movie pulls you in with compassion for the parental figures and the child in the movie. (Which is sometimes underachieved in this genre). Though there are some points of child horror in the movie, I can happily say that for the most part it steers clear of making the child the focal point of fear, we all know how kids are basically living spawn of Satan in horror films. And if you're like me, it's a very tiring trope. Cody's dreams are beautiful but turn very dark very quickly, the amount of stress the boy feels is understandable and makes him an extremely sympathetic character for the audience. This is one of the first horror films that has successfully made me fear for the safety of a child (Cody) during the story. The movie plays on the loss the parents feel for their first child and the temptation to use Cody as a way to be with him again. This causes tension between the parents and leads to an interesting conflict between the two. Though I feel the conflict was not focused on enough before continuing with the story.I feel that the fantasy horror element for the movie is a fine approach. It reminds me a great deal of Guillero del Toro's films. (Think Pan's Labyrinth but with no blood and a few jump scares.) I feel that if you enjoy Guillero del Toro's films, this movie will be an enjoyable experience for you as it beautifully combines fantasy with horror and builds up to a bittersweet ending that leaves you with a bit of an inspired feeling about where the characters may go from where the story leaves off.",Before I Wake
134,xroastedink,Atypical in a Good Way,9,2 August 2021,"Before I wake, directed by Mike Flanagan, stars Kate Bosworth, Thomas Jane, and Jason Tremblay. According to an interview on Dread Central, Mike Flanagan thought of the idea for the film while watching his son sleep. He also stated that the movie was difficult to classify, being more of a ""fable"" or ""fairy tale."" The film, originally titled, ""Somnia,"" is considered by Flanagan to be part of an unofficial trilogy consisting of Absentia and Oculus, as well.We meet this genuinely nice couple whose son met his demise in a tragic accident. Jessie works in a hospital, and her husband Mark is an architect. The pair have this massive, beautiful home and they decide to take in a foster child, as they are unable to conceive any more of their own. Here comes Cody, this saccharine-sweet little boy with a love of butterflies, a good heart, and more pain than someone his age should be allowed to carry. The couple soon learn that Cody has a special gift -- the ability to turn his REM sleep into a reality that exists within our waking world.If you watch this movie, pay close attention. There are subtle, creepy entities hiding in the background sometimes, which add a layer of murk to the atmosphere of this would-be happy home. Flanagan was right about the film being difficult to classify. The effects are so spectacular at times, it feels like fantasy, and the emotional elements are straight-up drama. I do believe that with a story like this, horror is the winner; not by much, but enough to count.I believe Flanagan created a beautiful film, and I also believe the horror genre needs more films like this. When you think about it, it makes sense. Just as you cannot have light without darkness, you can't have a good horror film with no contrast. This was a delicate balance of three main elements (Horror, Drama, Fantasy) that was executed in a heartwarming way.",Before I Wake

Yes, it was a few ""horror"" scenes, but it's overall like a weird fantasy movie. I also didn't expect this to make my cry my eyes out at the ending lol. I was adopted and my sister was a foster-to-adopt, so the ending personally really touched me deeply. If you enjoy movies like ""Relic"", ""Babadook"", ""Mother!"", ""As Above So Below"", and ""The Maus""... then you will love this movie! This movie and all of the other movies I just mentioned are about personified feelings/traits/traumatic events (loss of a loved one, death, guilt, ego, dimensia, PTSD, etc). Like those, this movie is very artistic and beautifully directed. I would give it a 10, but I feel it would've been better if they explained where the missing people disappeared to once they were taken by the nightmarish character (physical people can't just vanish into thin air along with an imaginary character without an explanation).

I get the movie is meant to be a female empowerment movie like all netflix junk, but do they have to make them so narcissistic and unpleasant, keeping your husband dead so you can be the strong independent woman on the block is deplorable. Babadook was an infinitely better execution on the mother-son horror movie. Other than that, the movie could have gotten a 6 or so, what can you expect from a progressive propaganda platform.

There's no artistic pretensions in the photography. The pacing is terrible. Already in the first ""nice"" dream you can see a ghostly presence, they could have waited a bit more. And after that, the dialogues become long and tedious The acting and dialogues come from a Hallmark picture The director makes neverending closeup shots on actors that show nothing.

Now, there were a lot of very haunting images, some jump scares, and lets face it, our nightmares are truly the ulimate horror; then what if they came true? But to me it is less about horror, and more about a beautiful supernatural story. I feel no need to nitpick it, to me the story was executed brilliantly and I could easily fill the holes some have complained about (though I generally don't search for holes anyway, it's a movie, the point is to tell a story, sensational or not. Just like cars that blow up in action movies. That has become a much loved cliché, not a thing to nitpick. So I never did understand nitpicking movies. Every time my husband does it, I remind him it is a movie, he says you're right, and goes back to simply enjoying the story.) And comparing to Pans Labyrinth, YES!

170,starwars_fan_77,My theory...,8,23 August 2018,"I got creepy vibes from Mark the whole way through the movie. It is my belief that Mark drowned Sean and was abusive to Jessie.I have trouble believing a child that age/size would drown so easily in a bathtub. He'd have to have fallen and hit his head, and from the flailing in the flashbacks I'd say that wasn't how it happened. Maybe he had an underlying condition like seizures, but it was never mentioned. At one point in the movie Jessie blames Mark for taking Sean away from her. He reacts as if he knows exactly what she's talking about and gets upset that she still blames him. Which makes me think Sean died on Mark's watch. It might be believable that it was an accident but Mark just seriously creeps me out, I think he drowned him.I think Mark is the one who hit her in the bedroom scene, I think that she was just so mentally worn down she blocked it all. Note how the people around her all seem to know that he's abusive and she's the only one denying it. But some part of her knows, which is why at the end when she says what could happen to the people who disappeared into Cody's dreams she let her husband die for good but the others she let live.I think they did overreact a little to her giving him a sleeping pill. But you saw how she obtained it. She's clearly a nurse or something and used her connections to get her buddy to write a prescription. That is definitely red flag raising.I would like to know why there was absolutely no security at the orphanage and how the case worker let her take Cody without even signing paperwork. I imagine the caseworker was out of a job the next morning. At the beginning she seemed to know the family and be friendly with them, then suddenly she's blunt and telling Jessie to get help for her situation.Everyone gave me the impression that they thought Mark had run out on Jessie, and maybe abducted the bully too.I figured out the reveal about the canker man before they showed us because the bag of belongings from the mother were marked as being from oncology.

182,jankozlatic,A potentially amazing story crammed into a bit too familiar cliché form,8,16 May 2016,"""Before i wake"" stars Jacob Tremblay as Cody, a child that believes to be haunted by some sort of supernatural force, and Kate Bosworth and Thomas Jane as his new foster parents. It is directed by Mike Flanagan, who became well known amongst horror fans for previously directing a highly underrated ghost possession movie ""Oculus"" and ""Hush"", a classic home invasion movie with a fresh twist.The film sets off with a great first act in which you get a glimpse of the true potential this premise really has. It gets you highly involved in the story which becomes increasingly emotional. But the movie doesn't build on that. It dilutes its very engaging story with a restricted and unimaginative approach off its makers, who succumb to using every horror cliché in the book. The horror elements are the weakest part, as they are poorly done and feel weirdly out of place when compared to the dramatic and far more mature content of the core story. The film loses its focus and somehow crawls to a very predictable ""finale"" of the second act. The third act found me unimpressed and almost given up. Im glad that i decided to give it the benefit of the doubt because with just a few very intelligent scenes, it pulled me right back into an emotional roller-coaster of an ending which makes up for the previously lazy storytelling.All of the actors do a fine job, although at some moments Kate Bosworth gives off a vibe of just going through the motion. Jacob Tremblay on the other hand gives a very convincing and mature performance.""Before i wake"" shouldn't be viewed as a horror flick, but rather as a very deep and touching story of love and loss of those closest to us.

The body of the movie was the idea of ""dreams that inflict on reality"", which is a pretty cool thought in itself, but there are already other movies (Nightmare on Elm street, Insidious for example) that had a far better and scarier interpretation on that idea. I felt like the concept art had a childish style, and a lot of the horror elements in the movie became not as frightening because of that. I do realise that the childish style probably is intentional, but if you want to see a true horror movie with good dramaturgy and manuscript, I wouldn't recommend this one.",Before I Wake

There were so many un-answered questions that the ending was just annoying. Kate Bosworth seemed so unfazed that her husband had disappeared, like literally not bothered in the slightest. The lack of facial expression from her throughout the whole film was borderline ridiculous. I didn't understand why they were absolutely mortified that she had given the child a sleeping pill, which was prescribed by his doctor which lead to him being taken away yet they were quite happy to physically hold him down and inject him with something to make him sleep. Right, okay? Also the ending in which she just walked out of the orphanage that was unlocked (again, ridiculous) with the child was just bizarre. The social worker person was just like meh, okay sure, take the child. She basically waved them off. This film could've been a lot better with better writing and better actors. Disappointing and I'm annoyed I wasted my Saturday evening watching it.",Before I Wake
185,eyesteinantic,Masterpiece of a brilliant mind.,10,9 July 2016,"This movie has what it takes to be a beautiful story. At first I want to say that the characters did a very awesome jobs! Jacob and Kate really revived their characters. So, little boy Cody has his own secret that is purely awesome. But as every other secret, it has it's own dark side. Brilliant part of the movie is that you can't see what is going to happen. It's totally new, and totally different. You all have my strong recommendations to watch this great artwork. So, as for the brilliant acting, they have choose a really good ones. But one thing goes wrong. This isn't horror, even if it has a horror elements. It's more psychological movie, that constantly playing your mind. Also, quite interesting is that butterfly story, because, you can never guess what's hiding inside of it. I'll use one of my old sentence to describe the movie: ""Amazing things comes to those who wish hard enough"".",Before I Wake
186,midnit3,"Out of genre, but not a bad movie",9,28 October 2018,"Everyone says this movie is out of genre and honestly it is a bit. But that does not make it a bad movie. Yeah, it is not the top scariest horror movie, but it has some horror aspects that can be quite scary in one's first watching. For me, this movie is more of a plot and character driving movie rather than a scary movie to get the chills.
The idea is completely original and I personally thinks the movie execute it pretty good. I need to give som points for the actors. Especialle Jacob Tremblay, who acts like I think a little and scared boy in that age would act. He is the perfect sweet boy to counter his dark nightmares.
I personally adore the score. It is suspenseful, when it needs to be, and it is happy-ish, when there is room for happiness.",Before I Wake

188,brodieburlhoffman,"Sure, it's normal to see butterflies wafting around the house!!!",4,24 January 2018,"I'm only half-way into this movie, but I already feel compelled to write a couple of comments. Even though I haven't finished watching the movie yet, I'm giving it a poor rating or 4 out of 10 stars. Why you ask? Simple. The married couple's response to seeing their living room full of blue monarch butterflies; followed by seeing their son in the flesh, IS TOTALLY RIDICULOUS!!! Unless you were born and raised in the land of OZ, where crazy-ass occurrences are the norm, you simply wouldn't respond with the emotionally-muted question of, ""GEE, WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM??"" Then, if the appearance of the butterflies out of NOWHERE didn't catch your attention, don't you think seeing the butterflies DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR, MIGHT CATCH YOUR ATTENTION???? Not these two! They just head off to bed, like nothing ever happened. Even more RIDICULOUS YET, the following night, when they see their dead son in the flesh, THEY DON'T SAY A SINGLE WORD TO HIM!!! They hug him, and then cry when he disappears; after which, they just trot off to bed, again, like nothing ever happened. ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!?!? The only way this response would make any sense, is if these two popped some acid; but, based on the story line, that is not the case. THIS MARRIED COUPLE SO UN-INQUISITIVE, THAT EVEN IF SANTA CLAUS SHOWED UP IN THEIR LIVING ROOM, I SUSPECT THEY WOULD JUST OFFER HIM SOME COOKIES, AND THEN GO TO BED!!! This is just horrible writing!!! No sane person is going to encounter these events, and then just skip off to bed, with absolutely no discussion about it at all. DUMB!!!",Before I Wake

200,Daku66,Mike Flanagan's weakest,3,28 August 2018,"As someone who is a big fan of Mike Flanagan's work, I was very excited to check out this when I saw it on Netflix. Unfortunately, it was far from what I expected. Like many other people have mentioned, this is not truly a horror movie as Flanagan has continually called this a ""dark fantasy"". Which I'm perfectly okay with.Unfortunately, the movie wasn't all that great on its own either. I had to strain my eyes and turn up the brightness on my TV to actually see what was happening half the time. Also, some plot points and most of the scares were extremely predictable. The ending also feels extremely forced, almost seeming like they changed the ending after they shot everything else, leaving some scenes to make no sense and leave a lot of story for the protagonist to magically assume.However, the acting in this was very well-done, especially from Kate Bosworth and Jacob Tremblay. Thomas Jane felt a bit wooden at times, but whenever he had to be emotional, he blew it out of the park. Plus the effects were extremely good looking, any ""dream moments"" were particularly stunning.All in all, I definitely didn't find it a good movie, but if you're a fan of Mike Flanagan or you're looking for an okay dark fantasy movie, you might enjoy this more than I did.",Before I Wake
201,jhyland-565-122969,Refreshing and Thoughtful... Makes You Jump But Makes You Think,8,12 August 2016,"The biggest strength of Before I Wake is in my opinion the writing. I was impressed with the story and background of characters from the beginning. Horror films these days, with the exception of a few, don't seem to have plot development beyond a vague explanation. But I appreciate a horror movie that has a strong story element. Flashbacks were used throughout to show reasons behind certain character actions. The story itself is something you'd think is from Stephen King. So if you like that kind of thing this movie is for you. A foster child has the power to make dreams (and nightmares) real. His new foster parents are unsure what's happening when their home starts to become a wonderland of dream creatures..including monsters. The fantasy element colors the movie a much different shade than something like the Conjuring. As it develops, the mysterious circumstances keep you guessing which is fun if you're watching with someone. My girlfriend and I were both trying to figure it out before things were revealed. By the end I was left wanting more and while that may bother some moviegoers, at least it leaves room for a sequel. See this movie if you can and keep an open mind!",Before I Wake

However, compared to others of this genre I'd give it a 9. Although the acting is rather mundane and some of the dialogue implausible, the premise is fascinating, the story is coherently told, the action is well-paced and it is appropriately eery, creepy and scary. Perhaps most importantly for this genre, the movie actually makes a reasonable attempt at a conclusion to explain itself, something most horror movies either don't even try or when they do they fail miserably.

208,zahraa_shams,Creative movie,8,10 April 2016,"This movie isn't a typical and predictable ""happy ending movie"", however it has many twist plots and is amazingly creative. I loved the idea at the end and how the ending was a bit open, making the audience think a bit for themselves. Frankly speaking, this story throws a bomb at the end as you struggle throughout the whole movie of sudden terrifying scenes, it's all worth it. Jacob Tremblay is an amazingly talented kid and his acting skills slay in this movie, especially in certain scenes. However, I think in some specific scenes, Kate Bosworth's character and her ""husband"", lacked showing emotions. I feel that if a bit more emotions were portrayed from the characters, it would've been much more powerful. Overall, great movie, worth the watch! :)",Before I Wake
209,tre_in_tdot,"Failed to deliver satisfying conclusion,here's why..(Long review)",4,30 September 2016,"I thought this movie was very interesting I was right into trying to unravel the3 mystery, gave me a similar vibe like when I first watched the sixth sense, in that I was waiting for a totally unexpected and cleverly planed ending, like when Bruce Willis was the dead man the whole time, those type of films whether horror, thriller, drama are very few and far between, majority of mainstream films are dull and easily predictable, that is why the sixth sense in my is one of the best written movies I've ever seen. The way it was written with such a satisfying and thought provoking ending had me thinking about it for weeks after which has not happened with any other movie. I should add that there may be others out there, and I'm by no means the type of person who watches every movie. The Sixth Sense,was written like a true puzzle that I could not solve, until the unexpected dramatic and satisfying conclusion, which rarely happens in main stream movies. As I said I watched Before I wake and it had my full attention;which rarely happens by the way, I was truly thinking this was going to deliver a twist or unexpected conclusion as to what really happened to the boy or his current foster family. Was he dead? were the foster parents and the boy all dead looking for some kind of answers in there unrest? living in some kind of afterlife dreamland unknowingly? The canker man is actually the boys manifestation of his loving,sick dying mother who had cancer,and he related it to a monster, hence the name 'canker' as he was just a child and wasn't able to fully grasp the concept or read. At this point I thought to myself ""wow this is actually a great and cleverly thought out way of showing how cancer literately eats those we love, and how it is a evil monster(metaphorically) speaking of course, that takes away ""eats"" people, like we see the monster slowly absorb its victims. I started unraveling the story in my head and said, wow that is a unique and interesting way to explain the reality of cancer and how it eats people until they are shriveled and frail, this was going to be a clever and hard hitting story about how cancer metaphorically ""eats"" and ultimately leaves its victims looking like ""monsters"" from a child's perspective,after its wrath. I thought it was going to say the boys mother, step father, bully, were in fact actually eaten, by the hideous real life monster everyone knows by the name of: cancer, from the perspective of a child as he sees cancer as a real monster. Now that would have made this a 5/5 for me, story telling and entertaining and mysterious puzzle all in one. However, Before I wake lacked to deliver any ending, felt as if the writers kind of had a great idea, just didn't quite know how to deliver a good conclusion, as if they said this is good enough, lets just put it out there, a dull ending with no real twist or revel. This could of been great, and it was for the majority of the movie, until the boring and unsatisfying, dull ending. What seemed like a sure firecracker of a movie, however, its inability to deliver any hard hitting explanation or thought provoking twists,made this film a dull and boring dud.",Before I Wake

211,joshdietz,Taking The Meaning of Horror Further,9,11 August 2016,"I have found many films in this genre to love, all because that which is yet undiscovered, that in the darkness which has yet to be illuminated, has always fascinated me. I also enjoy very much the suspense of not knowing what powers are just beyond the veil, and possibly learning something about the nature of it. Most horror films are bigger on scares and weaker on meaning, but this film balances both better than I dare to expect.Unlike a number of other reviewers, I did not find this film lacking horror. It is not The Descent, nor is it The Devil's Backbone (I personally did not find Devil frightening at all). If you have high standards with dialogue and plausible character choices, there is no doubt you will at the very least appreciate how carefully and well- executed this film is. The acting and the plot are excellent, and I was shocked to find by the end of the film that it had managed to address the nature of horror in a way few films are able to do, as well as give one of the most satisfying horror endings I have ever experienced.

They take in Cody, a sweet, polite, adorable 8-year-old. They soon discover his dreams-good or bad-come true. Yes, Kate Bosworth and Thomas Jane seem too 'perfect' (and what in all that is holy is up with Thomas Jane's hair?!) and there are a few holes in the plot but you know what?

I was very disappointed after seeing this movie, it was mostly predictable jump scares and everything was very rushed or not explained enough. The ending really upset me most of all when Kate Bosworth goes to the orphanage to take back Cody while all his nightmares are being released. For the first time the Canker monster decided to eat any of the people there and on top of that every time Bosworth came face to face with a nightmare she easily walked away from it. Then she sees this monster thing and gave it a hug and instead of it becoming Cody's actual birth mother (which the monster is based off of) it becomes Cody, cause you know that makes sense... Anyway Bosworth takes Cody home without any trouble, literally none, the woman who runs the orphanage is just like meh okay take him. Then Cody learns all about how the canker monster became his fear and how all those people that went missing that were eaten were just gone forever, not like anyone really looked into their disappearances from the start though. But hey Bosworth gets a new son because hers drowned no questions asked (no you will never find out how he managed to drown or why she blamed her husband for his death)",Before I Wake
