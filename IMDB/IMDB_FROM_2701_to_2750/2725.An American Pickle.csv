0,nogodnomasters,The Second Hundred Years,3,9 October 2020,"Hershel (Seth Rogan) works at a pickle factory and gets trapped in brine. After a 100 years or so they open him up and he is still alive. He goes and lives with his grandson who is also played by Seth Rogan. The relationship has issues.This is an ego-fest for Rogan. He is just not that good to be on the screen all the time. He does a Monte Markham thing in the story. It would have been better if young Rogan had a girlfriend who likes gramps better. The gender/religious slurs were idiotic and did nothing to help the feature. It would have been different if they were funny. Slurs that are not funny are just that. Poor plot line.Guide: No F-words, sex, or nudity.",An American Pickle
1,classicsoncall,"""It's the brine. Make people go crazy.""",7,4 October 2021,"If you go for the quirky stuff, this film might do it for you. You could call this a modern day Rip Van Winkle story of an East European immigrant in the early 1900's, who falls into a huge barrel of pickle brine and is preserved for a hundred years. With no known descendants except for a great grandson, Herschel Greenbaum embarks on a twenty first century odyssey of coming to grips with a new world while trying to maintain his Old World values. Seth Rogen portrays both the quizzical Herschel Greenbaum and great grandson Ben, and while not uproariously funny, there are humorous and tender moments throughout the story that touch on family relationships and the necessity of moving forward when life throws some roadblocks in your path. For a guy who makes brine pickles by pulling them out of a dumpster with the required amount of salt, along with 'all sorts of animal parts in there', the saga of Herschel's up and down acceptance in Brooklyn and the rest of the country is put to the test time and time again. Never fazed by the technology that has replaced that of the prior century, Herschel maintains a positive and goal oriented attitude that brings him full circle to an understanding of what he had been missing in his early relationship with Ben. This probably isn't a movie everyone would enjoy, but I liked it well enough to offer a mild recommendation if you're looking for something different in your movie fare. I won't spoil it by saying 'hold the pickle'.",An American Pickle
2,lee_eisenberg,present-perfect tense,9,18 August 2020,"After years of playing pot-smoking slackers who comment on bodily functions,* Seth Rogen plays a more serious role in ""An American Pickle"", as an immigrant preserved in pickle brine for 100 years and the man's great-grandson. The movie gives a sense of the different values of different eras, and also how experiences color interpretations of things. It's not a masterpiece, but I'd say that Rogen is one of the undeniable comic geniuses of our era. I recommend it.I also recommend a recent interview with Rogen in The Guardian in which he reveals a major lie that he got taught as a child.*Rogen also played a fairly serious role in the 2011 dramedy ""50/50"".",An American Pickle
3,paul_haakonsen,Could have been a whole lot more...,6,30 September 2020,"Initially when I sat down to watch the 2020 movie ""An American Pickle"" from director Brandon Trost I wasn't really having much of any anticipation, given the fact that I am not overly keen on Seth Rogen as an actor. But still, this being a movie that I hadn't already seen, and I was given the chance, I ended up sitting down to watch it.I will say that ""An American Pickle"" was actually an entertaining and enjoyable enough movie for what it turned out to be. Sure, this movie was by no account groundbreaking or particularly innovative, but it definitely did have its moments. And I will say that Seth Rogen was actually good in his two roles in the movie.The storyline was adequate, and it definitely had some interesting aspects to it. I just feel, however, that the entire movie was too shallow. It just felt like writer Simon Rich didn't really delve into the full potential that was readily available with the script and storyline. So the movie came off as being sort of half-hearted most of the times. There were so much potential for delving deeper into many things and exploring them further.I am rating ""An American Pickle"" a six out of ten stars. It was watchable sure, but it just wasn't an outstanding or particularly memorable movie ultimately. Nor do I think that this is actually a movie that I will be watching a second time ever.",An American Pickle
4,CinemaSerf,a Yentl little comedy drama...,6,8 September 2020,"Seth Rogan is ""Herschel"" a Jewish gent who, along with his wife ""Sarah"" (Sarah Greenbaum) is forced from his home by Cossacks. Arriving in New York, he is employed as a rat catcher in a pickle factory that is as likely to bottle botulism as it is cucumbers! Anyway, the rats turn on him, he gets trapped inside a vat of his vinegary produce and 100 years pass. When he is finally released into his new world, he manages to track down his great-grandson ""Ben"" (also Rogan) and the two start down a pretty bumpy road. This is essentially a drama, at times quite poignant, about a man so far out of his comfort zone, but who has spirit and determination and a fair degree of humanity too. Sadly, once the joke was worn a bit thin (after 20 mins or so) the rest of it is all just a bit too fluffy; the plot twists truly implausible and though it does take a gentle swipe at political correctness and all things ""artisanal"" it's all just a bit predictable with a last half hour that is just plain daft. It isn't a terrible film, and fans of Roagn will probably appreciate it more, but for me it was a nice to watch 90 minutes that I don't see the need to watch again.",An American Pickle
5,Cineanalyst,One-Man Band: A Not-So-Fresh Pickle,4,12 January 2021,"An American businessman takes to Twitter to make bigoted remarks from another era and makes more bigoted remarks in a debate while threatening to run for the presidency of the country. Things get so bad that one Seth Rogen tries to escape to Canada while the other is deported back to the Old World. Their problems are only solved when they hit upon the power of nepotism.Beyond that half-witted satire of America, there's also the secular Judaism of the modern man clashing with the traditional, religious conviction of the ancestor. But, mostly, ""An American Pickle"" is just an amusing premise that's barely developed beyond, say, ""Encino Man"" (1992). The opening scenes are pretty funny, including scientists supposedly explaining how a man could be brined for a century in perfect preservation to awake in the modern day, but the supposed scientific explanation of which is muddled by Rogen's voiceover narration humorously only stating that the scientists proved it to everyone's satisfaction.After Rogen meets himself in dual roles, a cinematic trick, by the way, that itself is over 100 years old (e.g. Georges Méliès forming a band with seven versions of himself in ""The One-Man Band"" (1900)), the picture quickly becomes less interesting as it follows a familiar formula--one even used in rom-coms--where the couple break up and eventually reconcile. The difference here is that Rogen is in love with himself--even more so than usual. Give him a great actress, say Charlize Theron, to play of off, as in ""Long Shot"" (2019), and the formulaic nature of the thing may be somewhat overcome, but even for someone like me who finds Rogen's comedic talents partly amusing, two of him is a bit much to entirely base a movie upon. The pickle quickly becomes stale.",An American Pickle

8,Floated2,Quite different but enjoyable,6,15 September 2020,"Having remembered when this film was during its beginning stages of production and reading its brief plot description, wondering as to how it would turn out. It seems relatively silly and simple but the performances by Seth Rogen make this film worthwhile.It isn't overly funny but also does not try hard either, as it is very tame for a Roger picture (no cursing, no smoking).

9,eddie_baggins,A decent comedy with one of the better Seth Rogen performances,6,20 September 2020,"Released in America direct to streaming via the HBO max service, An American Pickle gives Seth Rogen the most his had to work with over the last few years in a dual role job that allows the funnyman to deliver one of his best singular performances in a film that would've benefited from a tighter focus and more belly laughs.With well and truly one of the years most outlandish premises, a Jewish immigrant awakens after years upon years of laying in a state of suspended reality due to being incarcerated into a vat of pickles only to discover his last living relative is a wannabe APP developer failure with no prospects or family, Pickle embraces its utterly over the top nature and allows Rogen to get his hands dirty as both the old school Herschel and the modern day Ben but there's never a feeling like we are watching a new comedy classic in the making.Directed by D.O.P by trade Brandon Trost in what acts as his feature debut, Pickle enlist's the help of screenwriter Simon Rich to bring his short story to life but in doing so you can sense the film struggled to find its real identity or vocal point as it wavers between drama, comedy and family centric tale with a sense that a more improvised or loose vibe would've helped the film that goes from depressing to bonkers often in the space of mere minutes of screentime.What at first appears to be a fish out of water tale and mismatched buddy affair gives way to a more scheming comedy as Herschel and Ben try to one up each other in a battle of wits and business smarts and while this at times provide Rogen with some great little moments, such as selling pickles on the sidewalks of New York or getting himself in trouble at public Q and A sessions, there's a sense that we are just watching a series of skits and ideas play out other than a fully formed plotline that would've helped elevate this quickfire affair to another level.One undoubted positive about this exercise that has its share of good little moments is the dual performance of its leading man.After a few so-so years in mostly forgettable exercises, Rogen is as good as his ever been in a leading role with his ability to neatly play off against himself as the brash Herschel and the more mild mannered Ben provides the film with many of its most enjoyable comedic moments.Final Say -A fun, forgettable and unfocused comedy that has a lot of nice ideas that never get time to play out the way you'd have hoped, An American Pickle is an enjoyable watch but one that won't stick in the memory for very long.3 unsanitary jars of pickles out of 5",An American Pickle

11,southdavid,Dill-igent,6,17 August 2020,"Despite heading straight to HBO Max in the States, UK cinema's thirst for new content since reopening after the Corona closedown means that ""An American Pickle"" hit the silver screen. Though probably better suited to the smaller screen and, maybe because I was just happy to be out of the house, I found to be a decent enough experience.Herschel Greenbaum (Seth Rogan) accidentally falls into an industrial pickle vat at literally the moment the factory is condemned and sealed up. Awoken 100 years later, Hershel must come to terms with the death of his wife and son whilst trying to start a new life alongside his great grandson Ben Greenbaum (Seth Rogan) and the strange conceptions of the 21st century.When I say that it might be better suited to the smaller screen, it's because ""An American Pickle"" isn't the broad 'stranger-in-town' comedy that it might have been. It's a much more quirky affair than that, and offers more in terms of . . . well, not quite drama . . . pathos maybe, than you might anticipate. Both the Greenbaum's end up having to deal with the deaths in their lives and the role that Judaism plays. Both of them have good and bad traits too, so it's not a case of an obvious wide eyed innocent vs. cynical modern villain, although there are some moments of that.There are a few laughs along the way, Rogan is great in both roles and the way the doubling is done is decent enough that there are only a couple of times you can tell it's someone else. There are plenty of digs at modern life, artisanal culture, about the role personal opinions have on business opportunities. It just doesn't amount to very much, it's not quite funny enough to justify a trip to the cinema (or at least it wouldn't be in normal times). It's definitely worth a chance though, when you can see it at home.",An American Pickle

Very well acted. Quite amusing.Any bad? This is NOT a straight forward comedy, so beware of that all you Seth Rogen fans. But I found it still quite an amusing watch, because I love comedies in which characters are acting seriously. Seriousness enhances the comedy effect for me personally. Some might find it a bit boring though, because there is a lack of the usual blunt Seth Rogen jokes. I love this more subtle kind of humor though. I love the mellow, slow burning story as well.The story: Seth Rogen (a computer nerd) suddenly is confronted with a family member from another era.

15,aidanratesmovies,"An odd, and enjoyable little comedy",8,24 August 2020,"An odd, but quite funny film, An American Pickle may not be as even as you want it to be throughout, but for the most part, it is a rather enjoyable and surprisingly simple comedy and satire about family, beliefs, and the world we live in today. Seth Rogen plays the main two characters in the film, Herschel and Ben Greenbaum. He plays both roles rather well, though unfortunately, the script does not do wonders for the character of Ben throughout most of the film, as he seems to be less of the character and more of a engine to keep the plot going. Nevertheless, Rogen and co. bring there A-game to this flick. It is the first PG-13 film from Rogen, and surprisingly, it shows how the film doesn't need to be raunchy to be a good time. It's thoroughly entertaining throughout, and though it struggles a bit to keep its plot afloat for a reasonable length film, An American Pickle is never a burden to watch, and will certainly have you smiling throughout.

18,arungeorge13,An easy-breezy Seth Rogen dramedy that doesn't explore all of its exciting possibilities! [+54%],5,8 August 2020,"An American Pickle gets a double dose of Rogen and doesn't go all the way with it. The film is a clean family watch that plays around the equation between a ""pickled-for-100 years"" great grandfather and a liberal, non-religious grandson in present-day New York. I liked the concept for its unlikelihoods - it attempts to shed some light on generation gap and how society, religion, and attitude towards life have changed in a timespan of 100 years. Herschel is a ditch-digging Jew in 1919 and Ben is a freelance app developer in 2019. When these two contrasting personas collide, what can happen?Well, to answer that simply, a number of laughs (the raunchiness of Rogen's R-rated films is completely absent here), some feel-good vibes, a few realizations, and some totally over-the-top Jewish-isms & American-isms. When perceived in totality, I felt An American Pickle balances out its thematic lows with its comedic highs. We don't get a lot of scenes with the two Rogens together, but they play each other off superbly. When they're dealing with their individual lives, the fun quotient is a little less.While religion is satirized early on with a decent dose of circumstantial humor, in the end, the script turns on its head and uses (the nicer side of) religion to reunite the duo. It felt more like a 'Seth Rogen thing' than something universal. Maybe, that's the case with religion all over. Thankfully, the film doesn't take itself too seriously. It'd have done the film a tonne of good if Herschel's fish-out-of-water scenario had been explored beyond its uneven surface. Instead, it shifts focus to Ben's attempts to ruin Herschel's life - a stretch that doesn't fully deliver.It definitely isn't Rogen's most memorable comedic outing (more of a dramedy tbh), but An American Pickle holds up just fine as a comfortable one-time watch.",An American Pickle

24,msbreviews,Seth Rogen shines with a double performance in the pretty decent An American Pickle.,6,17 August 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)HBO Max arrives to become one more proof of how vital streaming has been to new filmmakers and writers all around the world. An American Pickle is the very first original film released by the respective service, and it gives the opportunity to Brandon Trost (solo directorial debut) and Simon Rich (feature film screenplay debut) to demonstrate their talents. Despite my curiosity about what they could offer, my eyes were obviously focused on Seth Rogen's double performance. Even though he's not the greatest living actor, I always enjoy his comedic roles, most recently in Long Shot and The Lion King. Possessing a premise with tremendous potential to deliver amazing laughs, how did it go?Well, I'm surprised by how grounded and ""realistic"" Trost and Rich's approach ends up being. In the first twenty minutes, everything points to a straight-up ridiculous story where the most absurd things occur. Basically, I love every single thing until the title card shows up plus a few more minutes. Herschel's life goals, his relationship with her lover, what leads to him getting brined for a century, the (technically brilliant) ""scientific"" justification that they give after he's found out to be alive and that he didn't age a day... Everything is ludicrous, but what would you expect from the already crazy premise?Never forget: having the wrong expectations (unrealistic, overhyped, nonsensical) can quickly turn your experience into a nightmare. An American Pickle has an absurd narrative because it develops an absurd concept. That's what's so incredibly entertaining about it: the possibilities are infinite as long as the people at the helm are creative enough. This is why I feel somewhat disappointed that primarily Rich couldn't take this story even further, both character and story-wise. In fact, as soon as the end credits started to roll, my first thought was ""is it over already?""Throughout the whole runtime, the viewers have to deal with only two characters who aren't deeply explored. Herschel is a man out of his time, but with his impressive determination and hard-working personality, he seems to surpass every challenge thrown at him. On the other hand, Ben struggles to get his product/idea on the market, but he doesn't seem to have the same will that his great grandfather holds. Therefore, the whole narrative is stuck on a loop of Herschel doing things right, and Ben getting jealous over it and trying to mess with his success. Each reiteration becomes less funny, less entertaining, and less plausible (I can accept most plot points, but some are indeed way too nonsensical for the world it finds itself in).Obviously, the comedy bits are almost all linked to Herschel and, as expected, to his dated cultural knowledge. It's a matter of time until he says something he shouldn't, mostly stuff related to his views on religion, racism, and every sensitive subject you can think of. Some viewers might even get offended by a couple of jokes, which are precisely the ones I laughed at the hardest. Unfortunately, Rich's screenplay doesn't have the imagination a premise like this demands (too focused on stereotypes and easy jokes), but having in mind this is his first writing role in a feature film, it's a good start. Trost does a pretty decent job, especially when it comes to film two characters interpreted by the same actor, so I wouldn't mind seeing these two working together again.Nevertheless, it all comes down to Rogen's double performance, and he nailed it. He's the main reason why I'm giving this movie a positive review. He's able to dive into these characters in such a compelling manner that, at some points, I genuinely thought this film was written and directed by him. It feels like a personal project, something that I can easily picture as a Seth Rogen's movie. He's hilarious when he needs to be, and extremely serious when the time calls for it. Finally, I don't look at this film as a comedy because ultimately I don't even think it is. It's strangely a sweet story about family and why it should matter so much to every single one of us.All in all, An American Pickle surprisingly takes a grounded approach on the ""man out of his time"" concept, making the whole message about ""family"", even though its premise is absolutely bonkers. The first act sets up a logically ridiculous yet hilarious story that unfortunately doesn't quite reach its potential. Debutants Brandon Trost and Simon Rich do a reasonable job with the narrative, but Rich could have explored the main characters a bit more, having to ultimately thank Seth Rogen for such a fantastic double performance. The style of humor present in the movie will not work for everyone, but it definitely did for me, even though it lost steam throughout the runtime. Its comedy is at its best when it tackles the dated cultural restrictions in Herschel's mind. It's a short, fast-paced story, with a neat score by Nami Melumad (Michael Giacchino wrote the themes), that anyone can enjoy just as long as they have the right expectations.Rating: B-",An American Pickle
25,0w0,The movie soured half-way through...,5,9 August 2020,"Instead of continuing and building on the whole 'man from 100years ago, discovers the modern age' plot device... the director rather turned the story into a convoluted 'bad guy vs. bad guy' story with both bad guys trying to one-up each other in a series of schemes and childish ploys.The movie was honestly not bad at all until about 40minutes into the movie, and I was interested in the movie up until that point... but then this whole 'tit for tat' story started and the movie derailed badly.Overall, the movie could have been a 7/10 if it stayed away from the petty plot-line that it adopted in the latter part of the film, and instead kept focusing on the 'bright side' of the plot. Unfortunately, it results in a poor 5/10 showing, not really worth even watching once.",An American Pickle
26,MrDHWong,"A quirky, sweet-natured tale about the importance family and traditional values with a nice touch of humour for good measure",7,24 September 2020,"""An American Pickle"" is a comedy-drama film based on the short story ""Sell Out"" by Simon Rich. Starring Seth Rogen in a dual role, it's a quirky, sweet-natured tale about the importance family and traditional values with a nice touch of humour for good measure.In 1919, Jewish workers Herschel Greenbaum (Seth Rogen) and his wife Sarah (Sarah Snook) immigrate to the United States from Europe after their village is brutally pillaged by Russian Cossacks. Upon settling into their new lives in America, Herschel finds a job at a pickle factory in Brooklyn, where one day he accidentally falls into a large vat of pickle brine just as the factory is being permanently closed down. One hundred years later in 2019, Herschel wakes up perfectly preserved and unaged thanks to the brine and soon discovers he has one living relative named Ben (also Seth Rogen), his great-grandson who has an apartment right there in Brooklyn. Ben allows Herschel to stay with him as the latter tries to adjust to a brand new futuristic world much different from his own.By this stage, there have been a decent amount of stories that involve both time travel and a fish-out-of-water protagonist, with the animated sitcom ""Futurama"" and the 1992 film ""Forever Young"" perhaps being the best examples of this genre. Much of the entertainment value can be found in watching the main character growing accustomed to their startlingly new environment and the ways in which their older methods of thinking may not sit right with current trends. ""An American Pickle"" doesn't really break new ground in this regard due to its predictable outcome but its heart is certainly in the right place. Despite beginning as a typical foreigner working in a new land style of film, this all changes when our lead character Herschel meets Ben for the first time, which then turns it into a nice bonding story with a welcome amount of warmth. Each scene these two were interacting, I couldn't help but feel touched at seeing them grow closer to each other as they found comfort in their shortcomings throughout their lives, even though their plights are separated by many generations. This is quite unusual for a film starring the likes of Seth Rogen, as he is often cast in raunchy and often lowbrow comedies that only mean to make us laugh rather than offer any deep emotional connections. That's not to say this film doesn't have its fair share of humorous moments, although they are mainly lighthearted chuckles rather than belly laughs.Like with most works of this nature, we get a good juxtaposition of life from several years ago versus life today. The customs and core values that Herschel holds true to his character naturally yield mixed results when applied to the modern world of those who are constantly plugged into social media. This is especially noticeable with how politically divided America has become in recent years and how virtually everything you say or do can be uploaded for the whole internet to see. Thankfully, the film doesn't seem to pick sides as both conservatives and liberals are mocked for the extreme reactions some of them may have regarding how someone may simply be acting the way they were raised and aren't necessarily making a personal attack. Scenes like this are clearly played for laughs but I could definitely see that there is some kind of social commentary here on how some elderly people must feel when trying to cope with their beliefs now being questioned by the current generation.It's great fun to see Seth Rogen play these two different characters in the way that he does. Rogen is often typecast as the loveable chubby stoner in most of his movies so it's quite rare to see him show his dramatic side from time to time. As previously mentioned, this film marks something of a change from Rogen's usual style of comedy, as the humorous scenes here are relatively clean and dry, so much so that I'd just about say that this film could be viewed as one for the whole family to watch. He plays these polar opposite characters so well that I even found myself believing they actually were separate people at certain times. I hope Rogen ends up being cast in more dramatic roles in the future, as like with Adam Sandler, he can give a solid dramatic performance when given the right material.Overall, what the film lacks in surprise it more than makes up for with its emotional centre. This oddball story involving a man being preserved in pickle brine for a hundred years has such a kind-natured tone that it is easy to overlook most of its shortcomings. Like I said, hopefully Rogen will consider doing more movies in this style, because who knows, he might just convince the detractors who didn't believe he was capable in the first place. Not that I ever doubted him to begin with but even I have been won over by this shift in change.I rate it 7/10",An American Pickle
27,rdoubleoc,Not bad.,9,19 November 2020,"If you like Seth Rogan, you should like this movie. He does a great job acting both roles (his other character is believable as being someone other than the first, without giving too much away), but the plot could be a little more unique after the initial twist/element (again, without giving too much away).It's one of the better movies I've seen lately for sure, however. This pandemic seems to have brought a lot of cheap content with it, or at least not much new content. HBO Max is a blessing during these times, but wish they had more stuff like this (that's where I saw this movie). Movies like this is why I think HBO Max will be good later on, but it's seems like not as many of my friends know about it as they should. I really hope we'll keep seeing more high quality movies with a good budget like this, though.Edit: I originally rated this a 7 or 8, but once I watched it again and realized I wished they made more comedies like this, I gave it a 9. The plot isn't that unique, but at the same time it's a lot more unique and entertaining than half the movies coming out lately (except for huge movies like The Invisible Man, obviously).",An American Pickle
28,garethcrook,Terrible,2,14 September 2020,"Seth Rogan makes a good Eastern European Jew circa early 1900s. He looks the stereotypical part. Big beard, OTT Russian accent. He's a ditch digger. Dirt poor, literally. It's a Rogan film though, so of course it's silly, with Herschel Greenbaum (Rogan) playfully narrating, seeing him and his wife, with all her own teeth, head to America. If it continued in this vein, I might be onboard, but... well it's not going to is it. No, Herschel falls in a vat in a pickle factory and is inexplicably pickled, only to be discovered and reanimated 100 years later in modern Brooklyn. Oh dear. Herschel is alone in a scary new world, full of crazy new adventures. He's accompanied in these by his great great grandson Ben, also played by Rogan (sans beard). I don't really like Rogan. Two of him at once is a bit much. Herschel gets to experience Alexa, cabs, fizzy water. None of it is remotely funny. There's a mildly interesting thread about how Judaism differs for different people and the relevance of religion in modern culture, but I'm projecting really, trying to find some worth. Anyway, for Herschel religion is his world. For Ben, well he couldn't care less. After oh I don't know, a day or two, they fall out. Partly over Ben's lack of faith, partly due to Herschel ruining Ben's none existent app developing career. Herschel sets up a pickling business, obviously and becomes internet famous thanks to a load of hipsters in Williamsburg. This pisses Ben off and... oh dear god what the hell am I watching. I'm watching Seth Rogan fight with himself! Then it tries to get all post-modern with a commentary on hateful online culture, as Herschel discovers Twitter and becomes a far right poster boy, gets Ben deported and blah blah blah. It goes on with this ridiculousness for 90 minutes, with the predictable redemptive ending. I can't bring myself to say any more, I just want to forget it and never speak of it again.",An American Pickle
29,thejcowboy22,Fiddler on the Pickle Barrel?,3,1 July 2021,"On my way home from Florida flying on Delta Airlines, I noticed the movie screens recessed in the seat in front of me. One of the selections that caught my eye was a man who looked exactly like Tevye the milkman in the classic production of Fiddler on the Roof. I also love Pickles, so I chose this movie to pass the time heading north to my destination. My experience with actor Seth Rogen goes back to 2011 in the film the Guilt Trip. In that film Rogen playing a momma's boy opposite his domineering Mom Barbra Streisand. This film starts with Rogen's narration showcasing a bearded ditch digger Hershel Greenbaum, heavily made up with heavily accent. Having a meager life, the lonely Hershel meets the love of his life Sarah (Sarah Snook). Kudos to the makeup department for the authentic turn-of-the-century sets and local peasant characters. As I was watching I was wondering about my ancestors who struggled each day to make ends meet. The sets seemed authentic with the Russia/Poland village resembling the Fiddler on The Roof motif. (Not quite clear the locale), Sarah and Hershel Wed then Kosak's invade destroying their village. The two end up in America. Another blessed event occurs when Sarah is expecting. Hershel gains employment in a pickle factory. His job is mainly killing vermin with a cleaver. One day as fate would have it, Hershel accidentally falls into a pickle barrel. The factory workers are distracted and close the lid without knowing that their co-worker is trapped inside. Concurrently the Health Department condemns the building. One hundred years have passed as we see a decrepit building. Two youth stumble upon the dusty baron factory. They hear sounds emanating from an abandoned pickle barrel. To their astonishment they see the bearded relic submerge through the brine. Hershel appears unaffected. Apparently, the brine preserved Hershel who hasn't aged. Lack of continuity plays a role in this film as the Scientist or caregivers in handling this freak of nature (Hershel), have to educate and rehabilitate this one hundred old relic on how to adapt to his strange new environment of horseless carriages and buildings that touch the clouds, but this movie has only 88 minutes to tell its story. Hershel finds out that his last living relative is his Great Grandson Ben also played by Seth Rogen who lives nearby. Alone in his apartment Ben is unattached. He welcomes Hershel into his world unconditionally. Ben is a product of the computer online, web site age and is working passionately for 5 years on a project he hopes will sell. Pleasantries are exchanged as Hershel learns the fate of his beloved Sarah and wants to visit her grave. To his dismay, the cemetery is neglected and abutted by a superhighway. To add to the degradation, a tacky billboard is being erected which causes our story to go into a negative light with cultural differences between Ben and Hershel a sort of self-loathing erupts starting with Ben and Hershel in a scuffle causing them to be arrested. Hershel starts out on his own with a makeshift pickle cart. Jealousy and cultural, religious beliefs also cause problems for our Jewish Rip Van Winkle. To me personally, the loss of the old world cultures disheartened Hershel as he couldn't fathom his grandson not knowing how to say the prayer for the department or keeping with traditions. I would have rather had Ben ask Hershel about his time in history and his experiences in the old country. I solely would find that fascinating. But again the story has time restrictions. This was a good attempt in measuring Rogen's range as an actor playing a dual role. Despite the holes in the story, It kept my interest. I guess as the movie progresses Ben and Hershel recognize themselves as each other. They also realize that Ben existed within Hershel and Hershel's spirit lives through Ben. Currently living in a country that is divided, I didn't appreciate the writers putting in current political views to the clueless Hershel who fumbled verbally on the topic of Christianity. I would have preferred the fish out of tank responses rather than political correctness but that's my opinion.",An American Pickle
30,danielmanson,This did not tickle my pickle,5,1 May 2021,"Yes, I spend the entire film thinking of this amusing title and don't tell me you didn't snigger. In all fairness this film just didn't completely fish me in. I'm not going to say it's a disaster or anything, but for a comedy I feel it fell too short.So the plot itself wasn't so bad and if anything I wanted it to be a bit longer so the director could flesh it out a little more.I'm not so keen on films where the actor plays both characters, but I definitely feel this one is one of the better ones and they didn't make it silly either, which is always a bonus!So why wasn't I keen? I just didn't really find it funny. I genuinely think I laughed maybe twice. The film tried to be a bit too heartwarming and serious and it took away the comedic element. I mentioned earlier that I wanted the film longer and sticking with this theme, I feel the film could have taken longer showing us Herschel adapting to the new world and gone down a comedic route. But it seemed to just skip that part and jump right into it all. I genuinely thought my recording of the film on sky was missing a part. But no, it was just made that way. So it felt quite jumpy.I'll end with a plot hole. The one thing I couldn't stop thinking about: Herschel was preserved for 100 years, he would be worldwide news for months and known by everyone, so it's inconceivable to me that he isn't recognised by a single person and when he ""offends""
people, they would know who he is so it's allowed.Overall though, it's not the worst film in the world, just not very funny. You won't be disappointed after watching, but that's about it in all honesty. 5/10 from me today.",An American Pickle
31,PyroSikTh,Lulls Hard in the Second Act,6,4 December 2020,"An American Pickle is about a Jewish Romanian who seeks a better life in America, but once he arrives he finds himself pickled in a freak accident, only to be awoken a hundred years later. The meat of the movie follows his interactions with his great grandson Ben, who's been caught up working on an idea for an app for five years. Hershel gets himself back into the pickling business and causes a stir on the streets of New York City almost overnight, and a rivalry between the two men bubbles to the surface. If this movie is really about anything, it's about family and grief. Ben still hides in the shadow of his grief for his parents who died in a car crash, while Hershel's main aim in the movie is to restore his family graveyard plot so he can properly pay his respects to his wife. Tied into this is how the dead are respected in Judaism, and how Ben's more modern approaches to his religion have taken by the wayside, much to his great grandfather's disappointment. These are all meaty themes to tackle, but An American Pickle gets distracted by other things it wants to say, like the dangers of social media as the modern-day mob rule, and the kind of people that use it as a mouthpiece.
But what An American Pickle really struggles with is deciding whether it wants to lean into the inherent silliness of the concept and go all-in on the comedy, or whether it wants to be more serious and sentimental, focussing on the emotional drama between two men from different times. Rather than making a decision, it toes the line in the middle, never truly committing one way or the other, and thus both sides suffer for it. There's some great moments for humour throughout, but the movie only really makes the most of it in the first act, such as the scientists explaining how he was pickled making ""perfect logical sense"". There's of course some great moments of drama as well, particularly in the third act, as Ben confronts his latent Judaism and makes peace with his parents death once and for all, and finding worthy family in Hershel. But the second act is where things completely fall apart. The rivalry between the two men just doesn't feel right. Ben comes off as unnecessarily cruel, while Hershel rides a rollercoaster of acceptance and rejection by the general public. Its inherent themes of family and grief disappear almost entirely, the interactions between Ben and Hershel are reduced to basically nothing, and the comedy value takes a nosedive by the worst offence of just not being all that funny. It's an entire act of padding, to ensure it can meet the ninety minute runtime. To make matters worse, Seth Rogen is at his best playing off other actors, but here he just plays off against himself, and half hour of just Seth Rogen is too much. This movie needed a side-character, or some sub-plots, to keep it interesting.The movie's best moments are, without a doubt, the opening montage back in 1919, filmed in an old-timey aspect ratio, muted colour pallet, and some pretty cool painted backdrops that gives these sequences their own visual identity above and beyond what you'd expect from a movie of this calibre. The relationship between Hershel and Sarah is beautiful, and I'd definitely clock in for more of that. Once he awakens and meets Ben we get some great fish-out-of-water moments, and again I would have loved to have seen more of these moments. An entire movie of this would've kept me more entertained.Yeah, I'll say it, An American Pickle was a little disappointing. It wasn't a bad movie by any means, and there's still plenty of laughs and sentimentality bumbling around for it to hit most of its goals. I was never particularly bored or turned off, and in fact I almost felt the movie ended too early. But I don't have much inclination to go back and watch it again. Ever. There's no hook. I give An American Pickle an underwhelming 6/10.My wife enjoyed it though, so there's that.",An American Pickle

I was excited about all the comedic potential that could be extracted from this fish out of water story but it just didn't pan out.An American Pickle has a great start and sets us up perfectly, but everything that follows is pretty uninspired. I'm struggling to remember a moment when I actually laughed. I can recall cracking a wry smirk occasionally, but a full on laugh? Not even close.I think the story took a bit of a wrong turn in the direction it went, building towards an emotional pay off at the end instead of focusing on the comedy in the middle.Seth was great as expected, carrying both characters brilliantly, but he's at his best when he's the writer of his films.Its a decent watch, but could have been a lot better and I won't be rushing to see it again.",An American Pickle

35,akcenat,An American Pickle takes absurd comical idea but has no real idea what to do with it,6,12 August 2020,"HBO Max's (low key production) ridiculous dramedy ""An American Pickle"" is Seth Rogen's most Jewish film by far and the type of movie that will probably appeal more so to Jewish viewers than a rest of audience. His character, Herschel is a religious and family-rooted man just trying to make an honest living and bring pride to his family. 100 years ago, this was seen as the typical American, but in today so called modern age some might consider this character offensive or outdated. ""An American Pickle"" might not be to everyone's taste, my wife liked it (because it is different), I didn't. To conclude, for me, it was a disappointing way to kill some time during 2020 pandemic. Film didn't produce the laughs I was expected, no matter it's one of the safest PG-13 rating ever for a Seth Rogen-produced comedy. Basically, movie is just decent-enough dramedy endeavor in which comedy works occasionally. A whole film of just Herschel adjusting to modern gentrified Brooklyn and Herschel grandson not understanding anything about his own background would've been a far funnier movie.Rating: 6-",An American Pickle

I really like Herschel with the typical eastern Europe accent. Seth Rogan did an amazing job overall. Movie had really good premises and I have enjoyed the intro, that reminded a fairy tale, I was expecting that the movie would be made with this style, but unfortunately, they decided to shot it like a typical movie, and it lost immediately its magic.There are a few scenes that are funny, I liked how the movie mocked the traditional media, the internet and the American and Jewish cultures. Jokes made me laugh, they are not offensive, even if sometimes can be subtle.Seth Rogan did something a little bit better than his average movie and I am happy to see him in this hybrid role, in the middle between comedy and drama and he managed to represent both sides pretty well. It is a nice watch, I recommend it. I gave 5 stars out of 10 as we are talking about a pretty basic movie, with nothing new to propose",An American Pickle

41,DeBBss,What a Sweet Pickle!,6,7 August 2020,"An American Pickle has such an outrageous plot that can only be justified by Seth Rogen. I can't stress enough that this movie was so perfect for Seth Rogen. What surprised me though, was how well acted this movie was. Seth Rogen has never been taken seriously because of his roles, but in An American Pickle, he gives one of his best performances so far.Surprisingly, An American Pickle doesn't have that much comedy. Yes, there are funny bits, but a good 95% of the runtime was just about the story. So, if you don't like Seth Rogen comedies or comedies in general, you might enjoy An American Pickle. The pacing was also really good too. An American Pickle is just 1.5 hours long, and it never got boring; honestly, the time really flew by. With all the good, An American Pickles does have its issues. The second and third acts weren't nearly as good when compared to the first act. If An American Pickle was more consistent with its acts, then it would've been a solid 7/10, or even 8/10.The characters were really likable, especially Herschel Greenbaum. What I love so much about An American Pickle was how it didn't go for the cliches. In Hollywood, when a character gets introduced into an entirely new world, they act mesmerized and blame it on magic or something goofy like that. Fortunately, An American Pickle doesn't do that with Herschel.If you like Seth Rogen comedies, or just comedy, An American Pickle is worth a watch. Granted, a lot of people aren't going to like this movie, and I can see why. But since 2020 has been such a poor year for movies, An American Pickle really stands out in terms of comedy this year.",An American Pickle

Some of the jokes start to fall flat mid-way through it, and... it kind of transforms itself into a weird movie about... selling pickles? For a while.But I thought the last 15ish minutes of it were cute, they go to a more emotional side of the characters we hadn't seen up to that point, and I thought it worked! I like the ending, even tho it's a complete different movie when you compare it with the first half of the story.

48,sirwillisiv,Disarmingly quirky and sweet...,8,8 September 2020,"An American Pickle is a breath of fresh air - or rather, a jar of fresh pickles. Seth Rogen plays Herschel, a Jewish immigrant from 1919 who wakes up in 2019 after being preserved in a vat of pickles. He meets his only living relative Ben - also played by Rogen - but tensions rise and he attempts to launch an old-timey pickle empire, sparking an envious rivalry between differing eras. While the fish-out-of-water concept is done-to-death, I found the offbeat charm of Rogen's performances and the film's offbeat concept to be disarmingly quirky. It could've very easily had a villain, but the only kind of conflict we witness is a form of jealousy that we all recognize and that's enough to tailor effective drama. I feel the humor could've been stronger, though. I mostly found myself smirking, never laughing out loud. While Rogen proves to be an engaging actor when given the adequate material, he's definitely been funnier in many pictures before this one. However, I still recommend An American Pickle for its peculiar sweetness. It's got a simple but valuable message to chew on: Despite radical differences, family is family - appreciate it while you have it.",An American Pickle
49,isantistao,An American Masterpiece,10,9 November 2020,"First of all let me say to just ignore the bad reviews. These people are obviously reviewing poorly for a one of a few reasons: They were expecting the typical late night seth rogan comedy and do not have the mind for something more refined, they are easily bored, they are not intellictual and do not appreciate art, or perhaps all of them.This movie is practically a masterpiece. It is in fact laugh out loud funny. And there is something funny in every scene. Not only that but it is amazing story telling. The writing is very good. And it is an intelligent and refined comedy that is extremely meaningful. It is not just about the laughs it causes, but the messages. This is a movie that is more wholesome, and is about family values and the importance of family. It is about the changing times and how different the world is today than it was 4 generations ago (it has changed more in the past 100 years than it did in the thousands of years prior), and just what the culture shock would be like if someone came from 100 years ago to today. It is about entrepreneurship and being a self starter and using business to give your life purpose and pursue something important to you. It is also about how in spite of the fact that most people these days do not feel like religion is relevant anymore, there is still a need for spirituality or at least some sort of meaning in life beyond the superficiality of the mundane world, and especially to help us with things such as grieving over the loss of loved ones or falling on hard times.So you are probably wondering, with such great wholesome meaningful messages, how could there be such bad reviews? Yes, as I said, those people are obviously extremely vapid. This movie is a very great film. It is not only meaningful, but it is clever and funny. It is well written, well acted, well directed, well produced, and all around well done. Here is a movie that is not only extremely entertaining but extremely thoughtful and touching. This not only made me laugh out loud a real lot, but it made me tear up at the end too. And it touched me so profoundly that it left me thinking about it for weeks afterwards. I kept on playing parts of it in my head that I found inspiring. I found myself wanting to make pickles (which I did by the way, and was awesome), and listen to the music from the movie. Until eventually I had to just watch the whole thing over again not much more than a month after seeing it the first time (and I rarely ever watch a movie over again, and if I do it would have to be only after a long time, like a year or two at least).I'm telling you that this is a great american film.

51,Slarkshark,Lighthearted Comedy,7,29 September 2020,"A toned down version of Seth Rogan, which is not a bad thing. Rogan of course plays both the main characters, one from 1919, and the other in the present.This is not a mindless raunchy film, but instead tries to look at how different our society and culture has changed in the last 100 years. Organized religion is almost a thing of the past, and other traditions and values have seem to have been tossed to the wayside. It helps us remember some things that are actually worth our attention, such as family. As I was watching I thought that it had similarities to 'Being There' with Peter Sellers, especially during the TV interview. If you've seen 'Being There' you'll know what I mean; two people that are getting huge public attention without actually knowing what's going on.I had some slight issues, not with the story but just with the overall realism. Being from Canada, as I know Rogan is as well, I would expect that just because they hike to the Canadian border it does not become a winter wonderland in a 10 mile span (it was fall weather when they started hiking). Also, when present day Rogan gets deported because he is accused of being pickled Rogan. They were both arrested and it was noted that he now had a criminal record. Your fingerprints are taken when you are criminally charged and if there was any question with identity this would be checked. Although, we are talking about a movie where a guy is brined and perfectly preserved for 100 years after all, so I suppose I can forgive the minor details.It has its comedic moments where I chuckled here and there, but it is by no means gut busting. It's mostly a light comedy with heartfelt moments.",An American Pickle

He would never be fined $12k for having a pickle cart, he would not be an illegal alien since he came to the US legally and would literally be the longest living person in the US. Going to Canada would just make him an illegal alien in Canada. A prosecutor can't call for a defense's case to be dropped since the defense has no case bought. There would be a ton of ways to prove who you are in court, from DNA to just knowing your bank passwords, and in his case answering any questions about history a 140 year old pickled guy would not know. Any strip mall lawyer would have gotten him off.And how does an illiterate Russian speaking peasant speak perfect English, let alone understanding modern slang which Ben uses constantly?

54,diggnuts,Poignant critique of the fib that is the American dream.,7,8 August 2020,"The ""character placed out of time"" trope is a classic plot device to write a story around. It has been done a lot of times for a very good reason because it allows to explore a vast array of topic by juxtaposing the old and the contemporary.This story is a comedy first, but in a semi-subtle way, it also is a scathing critique of modern day society. It addresses problems with group-think, zeitgeist, economic inequality, immigration hypocrisy, privatization of everything, social media and privacy concerns and the socio economic knife-edge we are willing to balance on just to fit in.It doesn't as such have a message about it, but more a mirror. It navigates the various pitfalls of, for instance the American dream, which is correctly portrait more like a nightmare, where the playing field is savage, based on mostly luck, where image is the most fragile and valued commodity. It shows the petty existence of people deluded into thinking this is freedom, while it is clear they are all slaves to image, group-think and fashion.If there is a message to be had, it probably is that without a proper balance between individualism and an emphatic society, everybody is a monster, everybody is a hypocrite and everybody is a self-centred maniac. So help yourself to help others and help others to help yourself.Competently written, well shot, acting was fine. easy 7.",An American Pickle

It was interesting, in a positive way, to watch a film where Seth Rogen is restrained and does not resort to vulgarity.

It's a complex film that's unlike any other Seth Rogan film that you'll see. Hence, the wildly varied reviews going from 1 to 10. It has its ups and downs and you really have to watch from start to finish without blinking or turning away to get the entire experience. There were times in the movie that I thought 'this is stupid' and came close to turning it off. But, in the end, my day was enriched for watching it. Because, in the end, it's about family.

66,DeadMansTrousers,Nothing amazing but it was enjoyable,7,7 August 2020,"As others have pointed out this is not your typical Seth Rogen film. This is his attempt to make a fish out of water story in the style of Splash or Big and while he doesn't reinvent the wheel in doing so there were some enjoyable moments. This is obviously meant to be a film which you can watch with you family, it is not vulgar and it focuses on the importance of family values and relationships. There are many moments/jokes in this film that have to do with Judaism which Seth has joked about previously, but here this is much more of a love note to that part of his life. I think maybe some of the negativity being directed at this film is because some people don't understand that aspect of it. They instead are expecting the normal stoner humour Seth Rogen. I think this movie is worth watching if you want to see a different side of Seth and don't mind seeing the things I mentioned.",An American Pickle
67,Criticalstaff,How I stopped worrying and became a religious bigot,5,19 August 2020,"Despite all the signs pointing to it, this movie is not a comedy. It is more of a drama with funny moments.For all its faults, at least it is technically competent. The cinematography and special effects are surprisingly well done. It is not necessarily nice or visually interesting, but there is a lot of visual variety and it supports the story well. The acting is good as well. Not necessarily that Seth Rogen gives a great performance, but he plays these characters sufficiently far away from his own persona that it is nice to see and enjoyable.Yet, this movie left me with a bad taste. So what is the problem?The problem of the film is not the humour, the visuals, or even the acting; it is the story.The story on the surface is how an isolated hipster living in Brooklyn comes at peace with the death of his parents and the loneliness of his life thanks to the intrusion of his anachronistic relative in his life. Most of the movie is showing how Herschel upsets the life of Ben by applying his last-century logic to the modern world.My problem is not that the plot is razor thin and relies on cheap characterisation of modern society. My issue is that by doing this the movie paints a worldview that is ultimately very alt-right. At the end of the day, this movie presents us with a far-right might makes right mindset and does nothing to challenge it. Presenting him as a sympathetic character, Herschel's attitude and actions are validated by the movie.The movie shows that: sanitary and labour regulations are bad, hipsters are naïve imbeciles, aspiring to a socially responsible business is hypocritical, freedom of speech is a fallacy, conservative religious views are the only thing defining your identity so you can only be yourself and become realized if you embrace them.The movie hints at being about Jewish identity, yet it has nothing to say about it. Ben gets saved by the brotherhood of Judaism, and it offers an explanation of why religious community might have been important in Tsarist Russia. But, in the context of the movie it is mainly the reason of his demise. Ben's American Dream is destroyed by Herschel's attitude, which culminates with his intolerance.Of course, I am being willingly unfair. Of course, the movie did not intend to have a political message. The movie is a lazy drama with Seth Rogen. Yet, the point is that by not being accurate, the movie lends itself to promote this worldview. Granted it is the worldview of the past century, but it blends worryingly well with modern political discourse.The movie needed to rebuke Herschel's worldview. At least, it needed to balance it out with something else, for instance slapstick humour. As it stands, the movie's tone is somewhat austere and serious in a way that does not allow for the kind of levity that would dilute the message. The movie's humour is not only very dry, but it is secondary to the family drama. The movie tells the story of Ben grieving his dead parents, peppered with jokes and funny situations that inadvertently support right-wing ideology.",An American Pickle
68,filmtravel101,Good acting but Story is terrible and boring - and Religious overtones with Seth Rogan? Huh?,4,16 August 2020,This film had so much potential with Seth Rogan playing two very unique parts that he pulls off in the beginning of the first Act very well. But then it suddenly changes into this dull boring plot of childish revenge and then out of the blue becomes a Religious theme of trying to convert him back to Judaism which seemed a real stretch. Seth Rogan as religious person is a big stretch but who knows what made him try to make this serious dull movie. Best to stick to straight comedy. A 4 mostly for his acting.

Director Brandon frost and the double role of Seth Rogen gives us the same treatment with American Pickle. The screenplay of the movie makes it feel like rushed and in it's entirety the movie looks like an episode of a TV series.

76,G33KEd,Seth Rogen & Seth Rogen in one movie? What a big pickle!,9,6 August 2020,"'An American Pickle' is one good HBO Max original movie to watch from Seth Rogen, the star and producer of 'The Disaster Artist', '50/50', and 'The Night Before'.The movie is an adaptation of a 2013 short story, 'Sell Out'.The story is about a Ashkenzai laborer, Herschel Greenbaum (played by Seth Rogen) who fell into a vat of pickles and is bribed for 100 years. Then, the brine has preserving him and when he has emerged him in present-day Brooklyn, he realizes he hasn't aged a day. But, he is shocked to find out that his only living relative is his great-grandson, Ben Greenbaum (also played by Seth Rogen), a mild-mannered computer programmer in which Herschel can't even begin to understand.Seth Rogen's double role is very satisfying; the casting is very talented; the setting is great; the story is very good; the cinematography was impressive; the humor is very hilarious to laugh at; and the story is perfect.If you love comedy-dramas, then 'An American Pickle' will be one of the perfect dramedies to watch!",An American Pickle

Simon Rich is a great writer, and Seth Rogen plays both main roles very well. saying that this is anything below a 5 is ridiculous in my opinion.Being rated Pg-13 I can see how some Seth Rogen fans would be disappointed that this isn't more like all of Seth Rogens other movies, but I like this movie and I'm glad they made it.If you know what your going into, I honestly think you will enjoy it.",An American Pickle

This must have been one Rogen wanted to make for a long time - probably as much as Barbra Streisand wanted to make her own identity movie, which is referred to in an end title scene. No cheap laughs, and no big effects here, but a double identity that really needs developing, and some finetuned humourous comments on today's society. The Jewish cementery is now under a higheay bridge, the romantic lake now looks out to an ominously rumbling nuclear facility...
21st Century Ben Greenbaum is a man unconnected to family or values, 19th century Herschel teaches him a few lessons. The scenes in the ghetto are slightly awkward, since Sacha Baron Cohen's exploitations, but no cynicism here. Somewhere in the middle developments become a little predicable, and it is a pity that a big plot movement, speeding up the scenario (no spoilers here) happens so late in the film. Some things I didn't get: how can Ben survive for 5 years in New York on no income? How can a 19th centuty man fly to Schlupsk without assistance?

Nothing too deep, but it has some commentary.The story is very predictable and gets muddy somewhere in the second act, even tho you know where it's going. Seth does a great job playing both characters and is fair at being earnist and his characterization of his own great grandfather is amusing and non-offensive but in the end one dimensionalI much prefer Pineapple Express, This is the End, and even The Interview over this movie, but if you've seen those recently and just want to turn your brain off with some Rogen this movie will do just fine.

All this science, technology and convenience is bad while a primitive, suffering life and - notably - religion hold the *true* answers to happiness?If ""hipsters/millenials are lazy and entitled"" is the message, then Rogen is near the top of hypocrite mountain - that this very movie exists is the result of laziness (the writing) and entitlement (while other talented artists struggle to get their work made, this character apparently has to snap his fingers and we're blessed with yet another cinematic discharge from him), and Rogen would not even have an audience if not for pothead millennials.Check out Rogen's resume here on IMDB - SuperBad was good, but the rest were just super bad.

It covers most of the cliches, tropes, and cheese associated with this type of film, but I found the plot a little unexpected and it does a decent job of keeping it fresh, even if the finish is nothing unexpected.

118,GuilhermeTeixeiraSilva1002,Seth rogan best performance,7,14 August 2020,"After falling inside a pickle tank Herschel Greenbaum stays there during 100 years. One day two kids accidentally open the tank.
The first thing that pops out is the obvious confrontation of the different generations, been this difference represented by Herschel and Ben Greenbaum (his great great son). The movie shows the different approach that both generations choose to face life.
To be honest I think the movie would gain more if the drama aspect was more into the movie to be more balanced because sometimes it feels that the comedy aspect downgrade the emotional investimment of the audience.
I like the critic that the movie does to some people that interpretes some opinions of the past with the values of today and it critics the people who tries to interpretate some opinions making them more that what they are. The criticism of egoism of the new generation in any ways, since the fact that people want everything for themselves and the fact that people don't want anyone to succeed.
This movie is great, despite going throw a road that I think is not benefit for the movie and it downgrade the emotional potential, the picture give us some criticism to society since the religious obsession, to egoism and it give us one funny experience envolving two different generations",An American Pickle

While most of the movies about accidental forward time travel gives us comical characters that seem not to have a sound mind or common sense, this movie does not do that. It gives us two flawed human beings. Flawed, but human. The only reason I did not give this movie a honorary 10 is that movies really need to stop painting Eastern Europe as a big gypsy village. Come on, learn some history, and google up how Easter Europe looks before making a dumb scene in a movie. Yes, there are slums, but there's those in all parts of world.

122,omeralaa,Is this was supposed to be a comedy movie?,3,7 August 2020,"I didn't expect a lot from this movie I just wanted to laugh, then it impressed me at the beginning.
The movie started with an amazing narrative style as the cinematography was fascinating then the exposition of the love story was both funny and beautiful.
And that's all what I loved about the movie and I raised my expectations after that (I wish I hadn't)The way of turning him to a pickle was ridiculous and that's okay I'm not watching a comedy movie to look at this kind of things but it should have been funny at least.Then the second act, Herschel's reaction after he had back was cold and it was supposed to be much funnier (another missed opportunity)
Then the movie reached the maximum level of the lazy writing, the hole pickle project was ridiculous then Ben's continuous attempts to ruin Herschel's life were illogical.The director ""Brandon Trost"" and this is the first long movie he has ever directed, didn't show me that he knew how to direct a comedy movie, he cared a lot about the cinematography (as he's a cinematographer) and forgot about the music.
The music was terrible, the most of the movie was quiet and have that sad vibes, there was a track that can be fit in a thriller movie, and the movie's colors were dark, also the cuts was super weird, all of that didn't help to get the comedy movie mood.Seth Rogen as Herschel has only one facial expression and as Ben was overreacting most of the time, neither of them was funny for me.In the end, I think that ""Brandon Trost"" has totally missed up and didn't know how to come out with a comedy movie.",An American Pickle

129,a24wang,Interesting Premise,5,17 August 2020,"I mostly watched this movie because of its premise (a guy who's preserved in pickle juice? i mean how can this not be funny?), and the first 30 minutes really didn't let me down. the 4:3 ratio in the beginning and the slow morph into a 16:9 while new york city transforms from 100 years ago until today were pretty amazing. it took me a few minutes to get used to the whole atmosphere of the movie, and decided to not take it too seriously, and i did have a good time.
my biggest issue was the plot/the plot development though; while the first third felt consistent, the rest of the film felt more like an indecisive mess to me. there were moments that were funny and unique to this movie, but overall, i personally just couldn't really follow the story, the characters' motivations and the writer's intentions. i wish they'd focused more on the original setting instead of trying to push this movie into different (political?) directions.

Indeed, a sad air hangs over the whole film.Sure, the jokes and the protagonist's strange accent make us more than a smile, but don't expect a movie like Rogen has accustomed us to.Personally I liked the film, not as I expected, but I have no doubt that it managed to surprise me.",An American Pickle

It has its moments, some laugh out loud at work moments. It's not Sandler, nor Borat. Rogen has done better in almost every movie he's been in.",An American Pickle
138,AGuyNamedJake,A Heartwarming Movie About Faith And Family That Never Really Tastes Like The Pickle It Should've Benn,5,29 August 2020,"Seth Rogen continues to surprise me as an actor. Sure, he's the raunchy comedy guy with the trademark laugh that you either love or hate, but he's also proven capable of turning in an impressive dramatic and emotional performance. ""An American Pickle,"" although not a great film, definitely stands above some of Rogen's other works as a worthwhile dramatic performance peppered with affectionate comedy that really moves the heart, even if it may feel a bit too unrelatable for some.OBLIGATORY PLOT RECAP: A Jewish immigrant from the early 1900s gets locked in a vat of pickle juice during a factory shut down where he is preserved for 100 years, awakening in modern day New York where he meets his great-great-grandson.Rogen plays both characters in this movie, the immigrant with a hilariously thick accent and extreme traditional family values, and his modern day descendent, a lonely app guru who has lost his family, his faith, and is on the brink of professional ruin. Rogen slips into both roles effortlessly, bringing a strong emotional arc to both characters. I mean, he's not getting any Academy Award for this, but for the type of dramedy this ultimately is, he surprises.The movie's plot sounds like a zany comedy, but at its core this is a movie with a profound message about the importance of family, faith, and overcoming loss to become stronger, better people.BUUUUUT.... THE MOVIE DRAGS: Without giving too much away, I'll just say that things don't always go smoothly between the two characters. They certainly have their differences which leads to a sort of war between the two with each trying to one-up the other. It's old vs new. Traditional vs modern. But this back-and-fourth between them gets old fast. Even when the competition slows down and you think they've both learned their lesson, it ramps up again.The movie has a fulfilling emotional climax with--like I said above--a profound and somewhat surprising message about family and faith, but the plot seems to fizzle out. There wasn't any kind of big event that made the ending memorable. It just sort of... ended... and that ending, unfortunately, because it's steeped in rich Jewish tradition and faith might go unappreciated by too many.I feel like there were other aspects of the strange family dynamic between the two characters that could've been explored, but the movie seems almost afraid--or maybe even oblivious--to tell the truly magnificent story that COULD be told. Don't be surprised if by the time the credits role you find yourself wondering about all the possibilities the movie wasted.Is this a must see? No. Is it funny and upbeat? Sure. Will you remember it once you brush the flavor of pickle juice out of your mouth? Probably not. But it's a great stepping stone for Seth Rogen and I look forward to seeing what he builds next.",An American Pickle
139,pwbeatty,A Decent Watch,7,15 August 2020,"Herschel Greenbaum is a struggling ditch digger from Shtetl who, after falling in love and wanting a better life for his family, decides to find a better life in America. While working at his new job at a pickle factory, Herschel falls unnoticed into a vat of brine, perfectly preserving him for 100 years (don't question the science). His only successor in present-day is his great-grandson, Ben Greenbaum, who meets Herschel. Herschel doesn't understand Ben's lifestyle, and Ben is quick to dismiss any advice given to him by his great-grandfather. 'An American Pickle' explores the family dynamics of different generations of the same family, and while not the balls-out comedy we are used to seeing from Rogan, is a charming and entertaining watch from start to finish.Both Herschel and Ben are played by Seth Rogan, who leads this adaptation of the book ""Sell out"" by Simon Rich impressively. I enjoyed watching Rogan play both a serious role as well as the fish out of water role which is both endearing and impressive to watch. The technical achievements of playing against your own character in the same scene are always magical to behold. Ever since Lindsey Lohan's 'The Parent Trap', to Paul Rudd's Netflix series 'Living With Myself', I never get tired of the camera trick that is used in a unique way in playing with the idea that your ancestors and you look alike.I've always had an interest in family genealogical work. Tracing your roots back to where you came from eventually leads to the question; ""If they saw me today, what would they think?"" What ""An American Pickle' does by exploring this concept as well as how would the modern-day world reacts to someone from a different time is incredibly topical. How would someone who never grew up with technology, social media, or even modern-day health regulations, learn to survive in the 21st century?The weaker moments in 'An American Pickle' are where the film goes against it's set rules for the world you are in. In some moments it seems incredibly topical and accurate to the world we are in with consequences for actions. But when it serves the story progression forward, those rules no longer apply to the characters which kind of underminds the films established guidelines. While Rogan's performance is very impressive, there isn't a lot of characters other than Rogan's that maybe could've been interesting to explore in a b plot.Overall, I had fun watching An American Pickle. I would recommend you watch this if you're a fan of films like 'The Disaster Artist' or '50/50, and want to see both a comedic and heartfelt performance by Seth Rogan",An American Pickle

I love the character of Hershel but I feel like his relationship and eventual rivalry with his great grandson Ben is a bit rushed and a little hard to believe. But i can't be too hard on it.

186,haring-hudson,This movie is good,10,7 August 2020,"Having read most of Simon Rich's work, I must say Sell Out was one of his best stories in my opinion. The movie changes quite a bit from the book, cut's out the main character's girlfiend, and focuses much more heavily on the bonds of family. They create a much clearer arch for Ben's character, than Simon in the book. The opening of the film set up the scenario quite nicely. The film is much more political than the book, and sympathetic to the modern generation. In some ways this leads to some positive changes to the story, I do miss Herchell's awe at Simon's lazyness in the book, and I think making Ben a hard working entrepenuer undermines Herschell being able to show Ben how much he takes modern technology and convenience for granted. The movie also makes it seem like things just come easy to Herschell, and you don't see him working hard in the movie, nearly as much as he works in the book. Overall I like this version of the story, it has more heart, but it does weaken the criticism of the modern generation that the book so hilariously gives.",An American Pickle

I now realize that the only thing worse than a Seth Rogan movie is a Seth Rogan movie that tries to feign a certain amount of gravitas in the midst of the ""humor"". So, in addition to being unamused, I found myself wondering at certain points as to whether they were trying to elicit feelings of nostalgia or warmth. Then, a bad attempt at humor came in to rescue me from the nebulous ether.In the end, i realized I wasn't feeling anything, but was just staring at a pointless, ludicrous, unamusing story.

There is some very strong and obvious stereotyping of the main characters, with heavy unconvincing accents, but that's kind of the point. It's not supposed to be an accurate portrayal or drama, its supposed to be a comedy. There were a few small chuckles at the beginning when Herschel and his wife discuss their 'impossible' dreams and when he first awakens from his pickle incident, finding himself in modern America 100 years later. As for the remainder of the film, it doesn't really have that many funny moments and certainly no laugh out loud ones. The film starts to get a bit silly and runs out of steam to the point that I wasn't really that bothered how it was going to end. Okay, but I wouldn't watch it again and it's pretty forgettable.",An American Pickle

Seth Rogen does the best that he can, but neither of the characters are likable and you can't (or don't want to) identify with either of them.This movie could have been a solid meditation on the hopeful optimism of the past would mix with the cynical pessimism of the modern day, but instead it's just a big waste of time and potential.Don't bother.",An American Pickle

But this one is different. His acting is on a ""Whole nother"" level. The film, with the help of the music and visual effects, is sometimes very sentimental.

214,fawlty-1,Don't be afraid of this film.,7,7 August 2020,"An American Pickle (2020) is possibly the least offensive Seth Rogan film since Monsters vs. Aliens (2009).It is a truly heartfelt metaphor for the way American immigrants find their way in a country where they don't speak the language and have no supports they can turn to.There is a very personal message about family pride, tradition, and religion built-in. Credit to writer Simon Rich on that one.The comedy is strong. It is built on silly slapstick instead of Seth's usual variety of anatomy and fart jokes.And the acting is incredibly skilled (for a Seth Rogan piece).The only frustration I had with the movie is the weak representation of gender roles. One of the messages involves wifehood and the fish-out-of-water character's narrow view of women's' roles. The writing shows how off base he is but does not demonstrate any more refined examples for the 21st century. Most of the good representation is reserved for same-sex relationships. But these are a little too overwhelming. There should be a good spot between under-representation and blatant over-representation.Don't be afraid of this film. It's not the usual Seth Rogan fare.
And keep an eye on writer Simon Rich. He has a great future of thoughtful storytelling ahead of him.",An American Pickle

I was especially impressed with Seth Rogan's performance as the immigrant. But as the story line progressed it became very evident what the message of the movie is. That as Americans we are family. Some of us are from an older school of thought and some of us from a newer school of thought. How the new school wants to point the finger and accuse the old school of its plain to see out dated mode of thinking- but no one else sees it until it's revealed by the the new school. Wreaking havoc and financial demise on the old school. And the story basically follows this line until it's revealed to the old school that the new school actually perpetrated all of this on him. But by the end of the movie the old school tries to look like the new school, they look very similar, but you can still tell they're different. The new school recognizes that the old school still has something to offer what the new school is lacking- work ethic. While they work out their differences they know they're from two different worlds but need to learn to live with other. After all, the old school begat the new. It's really an age old story.

Poor script , Poor screenplay , Poor dialogue acting and casting was moderate .This flip will no not be successful both in business and from critics perspective . Complete waste of money as well as time .",An American Pickle
249,neobruner-998-392754,Really a 7.5,10,9 August 2020,"I gave the film a 10, but it really deserves a 7.5. It is an enjoyable film that is quite funny at some points while being oddly touching in others. The reason I am giving it a 10 is to try and balance out the reviews. Most other reviews I have seen on here are 1 and 2 stars because it isn't Pineapple Express, or This is the End. People were going into this movie expecting it to be something it isn't. If you go in not expecting anything, and with an unbiased opinion of the film based on Seth Rogan's previous work, it is actually quite enjoyable!",An American Pickle
250,jared-139-217925,Seth Rogen's best,10,6 August 2020,"This is one of the most amazing moving movies I have ever seen. The outlandish plot is part of it and it is able to get over itself perfectly and tell a beautiful and hilarious story about family, religion, forgiveness and the climate of America. Seth Rogen's performance as Hershel Greenbaulm is his best acting work I've seen.",An American Pickle
251,dheerajn99,It is a drama rather than a comedy,8,13 August 2020,"I started watching it hoping to have a good laugh with friends after we got stoned. Couldn't watch it past 30mins and had to switch to a different movie because it was boring. But after watching it alone and sober, it seemed quite impressive. Seth Rogen did a great job, although the story is silly. It's a heart warming movie and resembles 'Forest Gump' or 'The pursuit of happiness' to an extent if you are into those kind of emotional movies.
You'd be disappointed with the movie if you expect it to be a classic Seth Rogen comedy, otherwise it's pretty good.
P.S: Definitely wouldn't be the movie that you'd like to watch with a bunch of friends or when you're high.",An American Pickle
252,dstew619,What a let down.,5,10 August 2020,"I wanted this to be good, love Seth Rogen. But a lot of it was just over the top stupid humor with a story line that took too long to develop.",An American Pickle
253,gotulsaok-1,ADHD folks won't appreciate...,7,7 November 2020,"Not an action, yuck it up flick. Thoughtful character development, sentimental, but still comedic. Props to Seth for playing divergent roles very effectively (especially Ben, who was less caricatured and developed more emotional intelligence as the film progressed.) Surprised no one has compared the film to the 1991 ""Late for Dinner"", with a similar plot line, but less anachronistic, more of a scifi RomCom, but very enjoyable. If you enjoyed the ""Pickle""appetizer, you'll love ""Dinner"".",An American Pickle
254,ismanassif,Meeeeh,6,26 August 2020,"I love Seth rogen and everything he does,I think this movie had lot to offer but instead of that ,the plot it's just unorganized.",An American Pickle
255,jbwbevis,Shockingly underrated,8,14 August 2020,"I am baffled by how many people dislike this movie. It deserves at least a 7. It's a brilliant script from Simon Rich (the writer behind ""Miracle Workers""), brilliantly acted by Seth Rogen. It made me laugh; it made me tear up; it got me thinking on multiple levels. It's an over-the-top feud movie in the vein of ""Tin Men""; it's also a clever satire with heart. Yes, the plot is absurd, but it's a satire! That's the point. If you liked ""Tin Men"" and/or ""Miracle Workers,"" if you were raised Jewish or with any other religion, if you had immigrant parents, if you like satire, if you simply enjoy thinking and watching intelligent films...you will like this movie. If you just want a dumb comedy, you won't.",An American Pickle
256,seethevaan,Easy to relate as a Jew! For the rest it's harder but can be done!,10,7 January 2021,"Love it or hate it the message is there! The most important thing in life is what you leave behind after you go, the desire to believe that your family line and legacy prospers. Great movie to open your mind and realize what really matters.",An American Pickle
257,jaderiowalker,Fantastic Film,10,18 September 2020,"Thoroughly enjoyed it. I laughed, i cried and Seth Rogan was amazing. Would recommend.",An American Pickle
258,geirj-1,Just boring,1,5 October 2020,Not a comedy. Stupid story. Haven't seen a worse movie since 'The life aquatic with Steve Zissou'.,An American Pickle
259,kk-09567,Boring,1,7 August 2020,"Not funny, bad acting, and just simply boring. Don't waste your time on this snooze fest that try to be funny, but just simply just plain stupid.",An American Pickle
260,andriamj,Great film,10,26 August 2020,I love this film because it is a unique and funny story that also taught me more about Jewish culture and history. I thought it was a wonderful representation of the struggle a Jewish man in the modern world goes through while he connects with his roots. Highly recommend to anyone with a soul,An American Pickle
261,madelinjones,No,1,12 October 2020,"If I could rate this movie lower than a 1 I would. It's not funny at any point and I wish people would read Seth Rogen's script before green lighting it just bc he's Seth Rogen. Anyways don't watch, it's a waste of ur time. Seth Rogen do better.",An American Pickle
