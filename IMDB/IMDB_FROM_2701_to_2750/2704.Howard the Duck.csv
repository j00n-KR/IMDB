0,MartinHafer,"Don't believe them,...they must all be George Lucas' family members!!!",1,1 November 2007,"When I checked out the reviews for HOWARD THE DUCK, I was flabbergasted to see that many people actually had the nerve to give this turkey of a film a 10. Now it IS possible for someone to like this family (after all, some people liked The Spice Girls and New Coke), but only a complete and total nut or a member of George Lucas' immediate family would consider this film to be on-par with GONE WITH THE WIND or CASABLANCA!!!! Ignore the sad individuals who deliberately over-score this film in order to boost it's overall rating to a still pathetic 3.9--it is a truly awful mess of a film.Much of the cause for this monstrosity of a film can be placed on two major problems. First, making a movie out of the comic book was practically impossible and few people out there even cared about the concept in the first place. Second, with more money thrown into this than the space program, it couldn't help but create a huge backlash--people waiting to say ""wow--they spent THAT much money and it SUCKED THAT badly!!""--and sucked it certainly did.The movie also suffers from a horrid and often sick script. Double-entendres abound as well as naked duck-ladies from Howard's home planet (complete with boobs--a sight so disturbing I felt ill when they appeared out of no where) and references to sex between the duck and Earth ladies (yeccch). So, for all those who naturally assumed this would be a kids movie, it was insulting and gross and certainly NOT a film for the younger crowd.Nasty, stupid, poorly scripted and with some of the worst dialog of any film I have ever seen (including many of Ed Wood's)--this is a mistake of monumental proportions. About the only mistake George Lucas made other than producing this abysmal film was his insistence that the public loved Jar-Jar Binks. Jar-Jar and Howard the duck are, collectively, Satan!",Howard the Duck
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Love as a child, hate as an adult, part 2",1,1 June 2011,"Many of my childhood favourites have held up wonderfully, films like Disney's Beauty and the Beast and The Wizard of Oz. Howard the Duck is not one of them, in fact along with 1996's Kazaam it is one of those films that I cannot believe now that I loved as a child. It's not even so bad it's good, for me it is just excrement, and a fine example of a film that aimed to ""quack me up falls fowl"". It does start off alright, but the last forty five minutes especially is so weird, creepy and dull it spoils the whole movie on its own. The production values are not that good, the special effects in particular look as though they were made on the cheap. The whole film is poorly scripted with jokes that made me groan rather than laugh, the story is bizarre in a distasteful way and the acting is poor. Howard is annoying, Lea Thompson plays it straight to the point you want to give her a steroid shot and Tim Robbins mugs embarrassingly. All in all, a real mess. 1/10 Bethany Cox",Howard the Duck
2,Leofwine_draca,"Weird, but not the worst",5,5 August 2018,"HOWARD THE DUCK is undoubtedly the oddest Marvel film in existence and the weirdest thing that George Lucas ever put his name to (as producer). It's a bizarre, comic book-style adventure in which the eponymous hero is transported to Earth and involved in a madcap plot involving evil gods from outer space, science boffins and a beautiful young singer. It's tonally bizarre, with adult jokes and wisecracks at times, but it looks and feels like a kid's movie. Go figure. I always found Howard a rather creepy creation - it's the eyes - and the film does nothing to dispel that feeling, although with Jeffrey Jones in the cast it's pretty creepy overall. It's dated, it has poor effects and lame gags at times, but it's not one of the worst films out there; it does have a kind of madcap '80s charm which sees it through on occasion.",Howard the Duck
3,SnoopyStyle,fun bad movie,6,24 January 2016,"Howard the Duck comes from an alien planet Duckworld. He's a cigar-smoking non-swimmer. One night, he gets pulled from his world and lands in an alley in Cleveland. He rescues rock singer Beverly Switzler (Lea Thompson) from two thugs. Beverly brings Howard to her scientist friend Phil Blumbertt (Tim Robbins). Dr. Walter Jenning (Jeffrey Jones) recognizes Howard's feather which floated down after his laser experiment exploded. The laser had brought him from his world. As they try to reactivate the laser, it explodes again. This time Dr. Jenning gets possessed by one of the Dark Overlords of the Universe from the Nexus of Sominus.First of all, Howard the Duck looks weird. He's not nearly as cuddly as he needs to be. He's stiff and a bit ugly. This suggests a perfect movie to remake with a CGI character. There are tons of duck puns. This will either annoy you or you could have a bit of fun. The writing is not good but I still had some fun with it. I actually like Tim Robbins' wackiness. The inter-species love affair is awkward although Lea Thompson is looking very hot. There is a general problem with this movie. It's definitely not aimed at kids and yet it was rated PG. I don't think it could be aimed at adults either. Even the thugs look cheesy. It makes this very odd in tone. The movie seems to be slightly long. It's been a long time since I saw this movie. I had forgotten about the Cajun Sushi diner. That section has lots of problems. The fight scene is silly. Jeffrey Jones looks crazy and yet nobody else seems to notice. The mob trying to cook Howard is really off-putting. I would rather cut most of this section out. This movie has some fun moments. One little scene has both the possible charming fun but also the awkward humor. With Beverly looking through Howard's wallet, she finds some fun duck-puns. Then she finds an ugly looking duck condom. Like the duck boobies, the humor is pushed too far at the wrong time. However, not everybody is put off by duck boobies.",Howard the Duck
4,Hitchcoc,What a Waste of Time,2,2 December 2016,"We took my nephew to see this back in the day. He is a person with virtually no taste. I believe he was thirteen at the time. Afterward, it was hard to get him to open up about it. He was trying to be positive but was having a hard time coming up with much to say. He said that the duck costume was kind of stupid. Yes, you could see the human eyes through the eye sockets. It was no different than a Halloween costume. I won't bother to malign this movie. Others have done an adequate job. All I could think of was all the films that never get made and the talent that is out there, and this is what they come up with. Someone may say, ""But it's only a kids' movie."" Yes it is. But it is an insult to any kid who thinks for a minute. It's lack of success means that the word of mouth that went out was pretty bad--kids didn't beg their parents to take them. A 1980's low point.",Howard the Duck
5,claudio_carvalho,Cult Silliness,7,10 January 2009,"While watching TV, the humanoid duck Howard (Ed Gale) is dragged from his planet to an alley in Cleveland through a mysterious force. He befriends the rock-'n-roll singer Beverly Switzler (Lea Thompson), who introduces him to the clumsy scientist assistant Phil Blumburtt (Tim Robbins). Howard gets in many troubles until Phil brings his colleague Dr. Walter Jenning (Jeffrey Jones) that explains him that he was accidentally pushed through a laser beam of his experiment in Alpha-Centauri, and he proposes to revert the beam to return Howard to his planet. However, Dr. Jenning is possessed by the demon Dark Overlords that has also come from the outer space. When Beverly is kidnapped by the Dark Overlords that needs energy to bring other demons to Earth, Howard and Phil join forces to rescue Beverly and save our planet.The underrated ""Howard the Duck"" is a cult silliness from the 80's. The anti-hero Howard is cool and it is funny to see Tim Robbins in the beginning of his career performing a clumsy scientist and Lea Thompson in a sweet role singing many songs in her early career. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Howard, O Super-Herói"" (""Howard, the Super-Hero"")",Howard the Duck
6,classicsoncall,"""Are you ready for an incredible story?""",3,2 August 2015,"It took an after credits appearance in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" to remind me that Howard the Duck had already made his film debut almost three decades earlier starring in his own film. What's truly astonishing to me is how Budweiser, Reebok, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Heinz all committed product placement resources to this turkey of a duck film. How I willingly managed to get though almost two hours of this nonsense now remains a total mystery, but it did manage to persuade me that Lea Thompson must be a decent enough actress to simulate the appropriate response needed in virtually every scene she appeared in. Nice legs too. But at the same time, her character Beverly, the lead singer of Cherry Bomb also managed to accurately describe what I think most viewers would agree with - ""This is way too depressing"".Beak me, Baby.",Howard the Duck
7,gavin6942,What a Strange Little Film,6,30 September 2017,"A sarcastic humanoid duck is pulled from his home world to Earth where he must stop an alien invader.Although several TV adaptations of Marvel characters had aired during the preceding 21 years, this was the first theatrically released feature film, coming after the serial ""Captain America"". Now, there is an interesting story about how and why that came together, and how this film indirectly created Pixar... but that is all history.I first saw this film as a child, maybe 12 years old, thanks to my babysitter. It stuck with me pretty well, as even now 25 years later there are scenes that are familiar and jokes that were lodged in my brain. This has ""cult film"" written all over it. Not good, not bad, but bad enough to be good in a bad way.",Howard the Duck
8,jboothmillard,Howard the Duck,2,17 May 2014,"This (also known as Howard: A New Breed of Hero) is talked about a lot as being one of the worst films ever made, and I knew that George Lucas produced it, having seen one or two clips I was up for challenging myself to see what I would think. Basically in a world of anthropomorphic ducks, Howard T. Duck (voiced by Chip Zien, portrayed by Ed Gale, Tim Rose, Steve Sleap, Peter Baird, Mary Wells, Lisa Sturz and Jordan Prentice) is a twenty seven year old who lives on Duckworld, and one night while looking through Playduck Magazine his armchair starts quaking, and then all the sudden while sat in it he propels backwards, being pulled into outer space. He eventually lands on the planet Earth in the city of Cleveland, Ohio, and after being thrown out of a club he ends up in a trash can in an alley, he sees club singer Beverly Switzler (Back to the Future's Lea Thompson) being assaulted and confronts the thugs with his own brand of Chinese Martial Arts, or ""Quack Fu"", she lets him stay the night at her place. The next day Beverly takes Howard to supposed scientist Phil Blumburtt (Razzie nominated Tim Robbins) in the hope of helping him return to his own planet, but Phil is only a lab assistant, so Howards shuns Beverly's help, accepting he may have to stay on Earth he tries to get a job, this also fails so he goes to make up with Beverly, she sings in the band Cherry Bomb, and he confronts their sleazy manager to release them from their contract. Beverly suggests Howard becomes Cherry Bomb's new manager, they are interrupted while flirting by Phil who has brought along his colleagues Dr. Walter Jenning (Beetlejuice's Jeffrey Jones) and Carter (Miles Chapin), Jenning explains that Howard came to Earth because scientists were experimenting with a dimensional-jumping device that happened to be aimed at Howard's universe, he was sucked to Earth by mistake. They think there is a way to reverse the process and send him home, but arriving at the lab the laser is they find it is malfunctioning, and it causes Jenning to be taken over by an alien from ""the Nexus of Sominus"", this creature in the doctor's body introduces himself as ""the Dark Overlord of the Universe"" and displays supernatural powers, and he kidnaps Beverly, and Howard goes to find Phil to help him rescue her. Back at the lab the Dark Overlord has tied Beverly onto a desk under the laser, Howard and Phil race to the lab in an ultralight aircraft, and elsewhere in the lab they find a ""neutron disintegrator"", they shoot this military tested weapon at Jenning and force the alien out of his body, the Dark Overlord turns into a large and hideous scorpion like creature. Howard fires the neutron disintegrator again destroy the Dark Overlord, but more Dark Overlords are approaching Earth, he must destroy the laser and stop them, but in doing so he will not be able to go home, he chooses to do this and banish the monsters back to their dimension, Howard becomes the manager for Beverly and her band, and Phil is a crew member for their tour. Also starring Paul Guilfoyle as Lieutenant Welker, Liz Sagal as Ronette, Dominique Davalos as Cal, Holly Robinson Peete as K.C., Tommy Swerdlow as Ginger Moss and Richard Edson as Ritchie. I had no idea that this was based on a Marvel comics creation, that maybe explains why it was made in the first place, some sarcastic lines from the lead character, pop culture references and good special effects towards the end are not enough, some of the music is cheesy, the story is predictable and unengaging most of the time, and the acting and dialogue is terrible, there was a tiny part of me engaged, but maybe that's because it was so ridiculous, a silly comedy fantasy. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, Worst New Star for the six guys and gals in the duck suit and Worst Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Worst Supporting Actor, Worst Director for Willard Huyck, Worst Original Song for the title song ""Howard the Duck"" and Worst Picture of the Decade. Pretty poor!",Howard the Duck
9,Woodyanders,Much better than its poor reputation would suggest,7,8 March 2018,"Smartaleck mallard Howard finds himself stranded on Earth. Howard befriends spunky aspiring rock singer Beverly (an appealing and energetic portrayal by Lea Thompson, who looks absolutely adorable) and must save our planet from an evil alien being that has possessed the body of kindly scientist Dr. Walter Jenning (Jeffrey Jones having a delightfully histrionic eye-rolling ball). Director/co-writer Willard Huyck and co-writer Gloria Katz deserve praise for joyfully running with the absurd premise; this picture certainly rates as one of the most bizarre and ridiculous big budget movies to be produced and released by a major studio in the 1980's. Moreover, Huyck and Katz definitely nail the sense of go-for-broke pull-out-all-the-stops outrageous excess that permeated the 1980's: While this for the most part works in the film's favor (a wild action chase involving Howard flying a small plane is both funny and exciting in equal measure), said crazy excess does on occasion go a little too far (the infamous love scene between Howard and Beverly comes perilously close to being icky and distasteful). Tim Robbins contributes a lively turn as goofy'n'geeky lab assistant Phil Blumburtt. Richard Kline's slick cinematography, John Barry's dynamic score, and the flashy special effects are all up to par. Super catchy theme song and cool rock concert finale, too. A bit uneven and a tad overlong, but overall a real hoot and a half.",Howard the Duck
10,BA_Harrison,"Ducking hell, that was fowl.",2,3 August 2019,"An experiment on Earth accidentally propels Howard, a talking duck, from his planet to our own, where he is cared for by pretty punkette Beverly (Lea Thompson). While Howard tries to figure out a way to return home, seeking help from janitor Phil Blumburtt (Tim Robbins), scientist Dr. Walter Jenning (Jeffrey Jones) becomes possessed by a dark overlord from a far flung region of space that intends to destroy the human race and take over the Earth.In 1986, Marvel's Howard the Duck got the big budget movie treatment courtesy of producer George Lucas; the film tanked at the box office, partly due to the questionable appeal of a film about a talking duck, but largely because it is badly written (sooo many terrible duck-related gags), poorly acted, and scrappily directed, with weak visual effects from ILM, and a rather unsettling titular character (there's something about those eyes) played by several dwarfs in an unconvincing animatronic duck suit.Of the cast, Tim Robbins and Jeffrey Jones slug it out for worst actor, both putting in absolutely terrible performances that defy description, making the film difficult to bear at times. Only Thompson comes out of the film with any dignity intact, despite being called upon to get sexy with the diminutive duck: she puts in a likeable turn as Beverly. As for the direction, this would be the last film to be helmed by Willard Huyck (whose previous movie, the Eddie Murphy flick Best Defense, was also a big flop). Say no more.2/10 for the duck tits (hilarious!), Lea Thompson in her underwear, and the stop-motion animated monsters at the end. And that's being generous.",Howard the Duck
11,Quinoa1984,"The Ed Wood award winner from the 80's (hostility is, like, psychic boomerang!)",6,8 June 2002,"Ed Wood, who made some of the worst movies of all time, came to mind as I watched this again.  It has it's bad acting, lurid visual effects, lines so cheesy you can lick them off your fingers and humor that is strangely above par.  Howard the Duck is a stab of bad moviemaking, but if you have a sense of humor you'll have fun.It also brings to mind of George Lucas, and his Holiday Special. This, like that, will horrify fans but will bring laughs to those who can take a joke.  It seemed as if Lucas couldn't, but you can't blame him:Howard the Duck tells the story of a 3 foot 1 (3 foot 2 thank you) talking duck from Marshington DC who travels to earth unintentionally and along with Beverly (a cute Lea Thompson), and Phil (Tim Robbins in a reason why he definitely needed Shawshank) has to stop a dark overlord of the universe, played by Jeffrey Jones (yes, Jeffrey Jones).  Surprisingly, it might appeal on a level for kids if they havent been subjected to real movies, and while many may want to beware, it has its audience somewhere...Between B- and C+",Howard the Duck
12,BandSAboutMovies,I actually like this,6,25 April 2020,"George Lucas went to USC with Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, who later co-wrote American Graffiti with the Star Wars director. Readers of this site wil recognize the two more for Messiah of Evil, a classic of 1970's horror that is sadly underappreciated.After finishing American Grafitti, Lucas told Huyck and Katz about Steve Gerber's Howard the Duck comic book. It took until 1984 to start the process rolling, however.The film was optioned by Universal Studios after a partnership with Marvel Comics. Universal was excited, as they'd passed on previous Lucas projects and lost out on some major profits. Huyck and Katz felt that the film should be animated, but because Universal needed a summer blockbuster, Lucas suggested that ILM could create a live action movie.The hard part of the whole movie is that in the comics, Howard is abrasive and rude. That's not the way a main character should be in a Hollywood movie. The storyline is also straightforward while every adventure of Howard had a major streak of surrealism. After all, he was ""trapped in a world he never made.""Gerber often referred to his writing of the comic book as an existential joke: ""This is no joke! There it is. The cosmic giggle. The funniest gag in the universe. That life's most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view. Anyone who doesn't believe this probably cannot enjoy reading Howard the Duck.""That said, he helped with the script, was there on the shoot and felt that the movie was true to the spirit of Howard and Beverly.Howard the Duck - played by Ed Gale, but also voiced by Chip Zien and acted by numerous pupeteers - is pulled from Duckworld to Cleveland, Ohio, where he meets Beverly (Lea Thompson), who will become his one true love.Soon, the duck comes into conflict with the Dark Overlord of the Universe, a villain beyond the wall of sleep that possesses Dr. Walter Jenning (Jeffrey Jones) and menaces all reality. There's also a subplot about Beverly's band Cherry Bomb, which features Katey Sagal's twin sister Liz, Dominique Davalos from the band Dominatrix and Holly Robinson from 21 Jump Street.Paula Abdul, Kim Basinger, Belinda Carlisle, Jodi Benson, Tori Amos, Sarah Jessica Parker and Lori Singer all tried out for the role of Beverly, but Thompson does a great job. She even sang all of the songs in the film.The film was considered a box-office bomb , as it made only a million more than its overall production budget. Universal production heads Frank Price and Sidney Sheinberg supposedly got in a fistfight over the results, with Price eventually leaving the studio. Seriously, movies have flopped much harder than this, so I've never understood the stink that is on this movie. Perhaps - before the prequels - people expected more out of Lucas.Huyck never directed again - he had also made the Eddie Murphy movie Best Defense - but he did write Radioland Murders with Lucas and Katz.I loved that Howard showed up at the end of Guardians of the Galaxy. It felt like Marvel's first theatrical star finally got his moment, after being considered a failure for so long.A postscript: Lucas had just built Skywalker Ranch complex and was counting on Howard the Duck to pay it off. He had to sell off assets to stay in business.Steve Jobs offered to help by buying Lucasfilm's newly-launched CGI animation division for a better than market price. It turns out that he got a great deal, because that division is what we now know as Pixar.",Howard the Duck

14,preppy-3,Call me crazy but I liked this!,8,15 May 2010,"Howard the Duck lives on an alternate world where ducks walk, talk, dress like humans. He's (by mistake) zapped the this world and has to find out why and how to get back. He saves singer Beverly Switzler (Lea Thompson) from being beaten up by using quack-foo (no I'm not kidding). She falls for him (!!!) but tries to help him get back to his world with the help of two scientist friends (Tim Robbins and Jeffrey Jones). But then the plot goes barreling out of control and the Dark Overlord of the Universe shows up...and it just gets increasingly silly.I'm SO tempted to say--""This was a fowl flick but it made me quack up""--but I won't:) This was produced by George Lucas back in 1986. At that point in time he had done the three ""Star Wars"" films that made millions. So, he could do ANYTHING he wanted and he did. ""Howard..."" was originally a comic book series from Marvel back in the 1970s. It was (for a comic book) pretty adult and Howard smoked cigarettes and was sarcastic nonstop. For the movie he was toned down. He doesn't smoke (except once) and he isn't as sarcastic as he was. But seriously, how did Lucas think this could work as a movie? For one thing Howard himself looks stupid. CGI didn't exist back in 1986 so they (I assume) used a little person in an ill fitting duck suit with BIG blue eyes to be the character. I was one of the few people who saw it in a theatre back in 1986 and I remember people laughing out loud when you got your first good look at him. Aside from him all the special effects are excellent (for 1986). The Dark Overlord especially at the end was done in excellent stop motion animation.Special effects aside this was a mess. The script rambles all over the place. It's full of incredibly stupid jokes, nonstop car chases and tons of pointless explosions. It seems the makers decided to throw everything they could into the plot and just prayed it would work (it didn't). But, despite all the noise and bad jokes, I loved it! I was never bored and the special effects are still pretty impressive. Acting helps. Considering the plot and everything Thompson is excellent. She takes the role seriously and carries on all the way through. Also Tim Robbins plays it way way over the top. He's frantic and running around and mugging at the camera all the time. It actually works quite well next to Thompson's straight face. His first meeting with Howard was actually hysterical! Ever want to see Robbins quack like a duck? This movie has it! Jones is, unfortunately, given nothing to work with but he is fun. As an added bonus Thompson's character plays with a punk rock band called the Germ Bomb (seriously). Naturally this is Hollywood's idea of punk rock so they all look squeaky clean and play songs that preschoolers would love. Also the title tune is just horrendous.So, it IS terrible but I was never bored and liked it a lot as a bad movie. Just turn off your brain and enjoy it. I give it an 8.",Howard the Duck
15,utgard14,"""It's not nice to fool with the dark overlord.""",4,21 June 2015,"This movie has the distinction of being the first feature film adaptation of a Marvel comic book. Having read many of Steve Gerber's Howard the Duck comics from the '70s, I can say they left me unimpressed in a ""guess you had to be there to get it"" kind of way. The comic was a satire on various trends from the '70s but mostly it just reads as dated now. Anyway, the movie is far from satirical. It's just a straight-up sci-fi comic adventure that requires no thinking. In fact, it discourages it. The first thing you notice about the movie is how ugly it is. Visually it is just awful. Most of it is dark and drab, kind of like the Masters of the Universe movie. The suit for Howard (which supposedly cost $2,000,000) is kind of creepy-looking and always very obviously is just a dwarf walking around in a duck costume. The special effects on the whole are unimpressive considering the budget, which was pretty big for the time.For years I thought it was impossible to make it past the first hour of this but I finally did it and I can honestly say that whatever weird charms this has, it really peaks by the half-hour mark. The voice for Howard is provided by Chip Zien, who sounds a lot like Steve Buscemi. He does about as good as you can expect given the script he had to work with. Tim Robbins stinks in a supporting role. Jeffrey Jones hams it up but provides most of the movie's few funny moments. Lea Thompson is the best part of it all. Her enthusiasm is contagious and every time I felt like turning it off she managed to keep me interested enough to keep going. The movie descends into full-blown stupidity with an extended slapstick plane and car chase sequence in the second half, which totally feels tacked-on because they could tell 'something' was missing and didn't know what else to do. There are some good parts, just not many. Space rabies, Playduck, the cheesy theme song finale, and adorable Lea Thompson are the highlights. But ultimately it's just a big bore that goes on way too long.",Howard the Duck

Of course, it was not only the worst picture, but the worst screenplay and worst visual effects. It was also nominated for worst director and worst original song, and Tim Robbins got a worst supporting actor nomination for his part. believe me it deserved every accolade it got. Of course, if it wasn't for Mommie Dearest, it would have been the worst picture in the 80s.Of course, the time wasn't a total loss as Lea Thompson (Back to the Future, Back to the Future II) was a delight to watch.George Lucas must be hanging his head in shame.",Howard the Duck
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Just really, really, really bad",1,12 October 2004,"I honestly don't know how I've managed to sit through this P.O.S. movie even once; it sucks so bad that it's impossible to know, or even speculate, how on earth it got through the entire production process, and all the way to the movies. The fact that this film isn't on the bottom 100 list here on the site is both astounding and scary. The movie is carried by usual 80's action/adventure clichés, bad acting, awful special effects, a wandering plot that barely makes sense no matter how you look at it, or how much you suspend disbelief. Believe me, the ridiculous dialog(with lines like ""No! He'll hit you! Duck!"" ""And proud of it!"") is just the nail in the coffin. Seriously, what was wrong with the people who made this movie? They get almost painfully attractive Lea Thompson(probably best known as Caroline of Caroline In The City), place her in a scene in her underwear, and then they stop there. What's wrong with these people? A talking duck? Come on... I know that this was based on a comic book, but judging from the movie(and its success, or, rather, lack thereof) it should have stayed as a comic book. The film even makes Tim Robbins, a very good actor, look like a complete and utter moron, not to mention a poor actor(which he definitely is not). The film is just so horribly dated and poorly done that it's ridiculous. Granted, it's somewhat original, but originality does not equal greatness. The film is basically a tour of the 80's, and a great example of how (poor) movies were made in the 80's. At least it did terrible at the box office, so we weren't forced to tolerate a sequel to this crap. Some might enjoy this, but I certainly didn't. I recommend this only to huge fans of typical 80's movies. Everyone else; stay away. Far away. 1/10",Howard the Duck
18,view_and_review,Rocket and Howard the Duck,7,7 August 2019,"Before The Avengers, before Spider-Man, before Blade Marvel released Howard the Duck executive produced by George Lucas. This movie is a far cry from the mega-successes the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe went on to become but it is fun and funny. It could definitely benefit from a modern touch up in the form of a remake. It's a quacky... I mean quirky concept but it works. I think the large humanlike talking duck allows Rocket (the Guardians of the Galaxy raccoon) to be as popular as he is.In fact, I just had a great movie idea: Rocket and Howard the Duck together on screen. One can cameo in the other, it'll be great. They're both small in stature, anthropomorphic animals, and very talkative. It'll be a hit.",Howard the Duck
19,Aaron1375,This duck simply was destined not to fly.,3,5 July 2005,"This movie was a bomb when it was released, but fortunately over the years it has attained a sort of cult following so there are people who enjoy this film. I am not one of them, however, I found this movie a bit boring with a rather stupid concept. Not that it doesn't have anything to it, I actually chuckle at some of it, overall though it is not much of a ride. I have to agree with the one reviewer that said one of the problems with this movie is that it looks cheap. Which is surprising considering we have the man who made the Star Wars trilogy behind this film. Unfortunately, you can't tell he had anything to do with this movie as the effects look like a cheap science fiction television show's special effects. The duck, the star of the show is annoying and the star of the show should not be a character you tire of hearing from during the course of the movie. Then there is the switch in the flick from a bit of a comedy to strange alien invasion movie that adds seriousness and action to a movie that would have probably benefited greatly from more comedy and a change in the way Howard spoke. Then the movie ends with a rock concert ending that is so lame you will roll your eyes and turn off your tape or change the channel before it finishes. It is funny though that I think this movie originated from a comic book. At the time there were so many comic books that had yet been translated to the big screen, I wonder why they decided to make this one?",Howard the Duck
20,Mr-Fusion,Time has been kind to this duck,7,20 January 2015,"Box office and reputation notwithstanding, this has got to be one of the most '80s movies out there. It's like throwing a Marvel B- character into a mashup of ""Buckaroo Banzai"" and ""Big Trouble in Little China"". When it works, it captures feelings from both movies, and that's to its credit. Let's be honest, adapting ""Howard the Duck"" in 1986, how straight could they possibly play it?There's plenty to like here, especially Lea Thompson in all of her New Wave glory. But you've gotta hand it to Jeffrey Jones for hurling himself into the bad guy role - seemingly with just a funny voice, but it's still a memorable performance. Same for Chip Zien, who lends Howard immense personality with just a voice. Honestly, the story is completely out there, and some pacing issues tend to drag things down just a bit. But between the performers and the sense of humor, this movie demands another look. 7/10",Howard the Duck
21,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Cheesy, lame, but still a lot of fun",7,20 February 2004,"Howard the Duck is a film that I grew up with, I was only a 1 year old when it was released, but my mom and I would watch it together all the time. I think that's the reason why this movie is just special to me. But still I watch this movie and honestly it's not as bad as most people exaggerate it to be, granted it's not Citizen Kane, but it's still awesome to watch. I think people take the movie too seriously, first off look at the title, if you're expecting a duck to deliver an Oscar worth performance, get your head checked, second people make fun of the ""flirting"" between the duck and Lea Thompson, which was meant to be a joke, not real. Third, the ending, people make fun of it and it's being over the top, I personally found it to be so funny and still a ton of fun to watch, how could you not get a kick out of Jeffrey Jones' performance? He was awesome! If you wanna know what the movie is about, read on before you see the movie so you can get a good idea and judge for yourself.The film begins late at night in ""Duckworld,"" which is a version of planet Earth, but with talking ducks living there in place of human beings. As Howard tries to relax, his armchair begins to vibrate violently, and Howard and the chair are promptly yanked through outer-space, all the way to Cleveland on planet Earth. After ending up in an oil drum, Howard hears a fight involving a woman and two thugs pretending to be her fans. Howard uses his skills of ""Quack Fu"" to defend her. Intimidated by a talking duck, the thugs scamper. The woman, Beverly, thanks Howard and, feeling sorry for him because he has no warm and dry place to sleep, invites him to her apartment. The next day, Beverly takes Howard to see Phil Blumburtt , who she believes is a scientist that can help Howard get back to Duckworld. It turns out Phil is actually a janitor at a museum and Howard, infuriated with Phil's charade. A few days later, Dr. Walter Jenning , and Larry who explain to Howard that they were doing a routine procedure at the lab, only for the experiment to go out of control, causing the laser to hit Howard's planet instead. Howard suggests he can be sent back to Duckworld if the laser can be put into reverse. He is taken to the Dynatechnics lab alongside Beverly, only to find out on arrival that the laser is seriously damaged due to another explosion. The explosion brings down a ""Dark Overlord"" who is not seen by the audience at the time, and takes over Jenning's body. Howard and Beverly see Dr. Jenning, but he is in the process of being taken over by the Dark Overlord. With Howard and Beverly both unaware of this, they escape in Jenning's car onto the freeway with him driving dangerously due to his worsening possession. They stop outside a diner just before he is fully taken over. Inside the Diner, the Overlord explains his attempts to call forth his fellow aliens from the Nexus of Sominus so that they may take over the world.Honestly, yeah the plot is a bit much to grasp, but cut the movie some slack, it's about a duck for goodness' sake! For me, it still makes me laugh and I have a ton of fun watching it. I loved seeing Tim Robbins and Howard trying to get to the factory to destroy Jeffrey Jones before he could take over the world, Tim was absolutely hilarious! Yes there are a few things about this movie that are over the top but I still think that this movie is just mindless entertainment. Hey how many movies do we have where a duck saves Planet Earth? Hmm, I guess this is the only one; but give the movie a fair chance, it's a cute one.7/10",Howard the Duck
22,thesar-2,Duck Me – It Really Isn't That Bad,3,14 April 2014,"Unbelievably, Howard the Duck was the first Marvel movie. Not sure why they started with him, but luckily they followed him up with Blade, X-Men and Spider-Man. But, this comic-turned-movie wasn't necessary to test audiences. Howard the Duck wasn't a masked superhero or a vigilante crime fighter.It wasn't a great movie, either. And still, it wasn't as terrible as I've heard ever since it was released until I saw it for the first time last month, in 2014. I mean, I see where they were going with it, it was very 1980s and you couldn't bring any realism to the table here.Basically, after a freak accident, Howard T. Duck's thrown from his home planet to ours, spends half his time yelling at the people trying to help this giant, talking duck and another portion trying to defeat what seems like an afterthought villain.Oh, and Lea Thompson is creepily and thoroughly sexually aroused by the birdman.Admittedly, some of it made me chuckle and I saw little harm in this Rated PG (but should've been at least PG-13) adventure, this middle of the quality road movie is not worth a watch. Personally, I only watched it because the gang over at the How Did This Get Made podcast had it on their list and I've been watching all they covered. It's been nearly 30 yearsIf I hadn't watched it before they encouraged me to, I would never had.* * * Final thoughts: I love flashbacks to scenes that took place less than 10 minutes prior because the director has almost zero confidence the audience wouldn't remember. Oh, I forgot, Georgie Lucas helped make this. Explains a lot.",Howard the Duck
23,ElMaruecan82,Of Ducks and Men..,5,2 August 2016,"I'll be the devil's advocate and speak about ""Howard the Duck"", a film I discovered at a time where Internet didn't exist and which I enjoyed. Of course being under 12 at that time helped a little, but even at that age, I was able to pinpoint flaws in movies, I loved ""Look Who's Talking"" but disliked the sequel, I liked Howard but I knew a ""Back to the Future"" or ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" it wasn't. Now, I wouldn't even dare to mention these films in the same sentence, but I think Howard has been lynched by an unfair crowd, and its cult-status now has a little more to do with the recognition of a few redeeming qualities rather than your typical ""so-bad-it's-good"" guilty pleasure. Don't misread the words, I'll never go as far as saying that ""Howard the Duck"" is a 'misunderstood' or 'underrated' gem, but just because it didn't leave a mark as indelible as ""Ghostbusters"" or ""The Goonies"" on the 80's Golden Book (rather a stain that could be assimilated to turkey crap) doesn't mean that the movie is as atrociously bad as the stuff we call bad like ""Troll 2"" or ""Leonard Part 6""... not to mention the horrific ""E.T."" rip-off ""Mac and Me"", just have a look at Mac on Google Images and tell me if he doesn't make ""Howard the Duck"" look like ""E.T."". Of course, the whole concept of an alien stranded in a hostile environment was nothing new on the big screen, but the film was based on a popular Marvel comic-book and the fact that Howard's homeland was a ducky version of Earth (which by 80's metonymy, means America) was the silly but funny little twist, and the source of the numerous gags all based on parallels between humans and ducks. The film could work if it didn't take itself seriously. But it did, and the makers chose the wrong angle which was to portray Howard as a social outcast trapped in the nightmarish world of pimps, punks and unemployment offices. They bet on the wrong duck and it must have been quite a frustration for all the people involved in the making to see the audience making faces that said something in the lines ""What the hell am I just watching?"", ducks aren't just as appealing if you turn them into 'serious' characters, could you imagine if Roger Rabbit was a live-action creature? The concept wasn't wrong by itself but the execution didn't do justice to the comic-book. So they had the casting with Lea ""Lorrain McFly"" Thompson, Jeffrey ""Ed Rooney"" Jones, and an unknown lanky Tim Robbins who played the film's dingus , it had the word George Lucas as a technical endorsement, it had damn good and believable special-effects for its CGI-less time and it even had a song ready to top the charts, yet it lamentably failed. Morality: if you feel like you're about to pioneer a genre by creating ""A New Breed of Hero"", make sure it works. A guy like ""Deadpool"" can pass for a new breed of hero, not a Duck, or a dwarf wearing a duck disguise. Maybe the film was too ahead of its time, who knows there might have been original inspiration at some point, but the film follows the action-packed comedy thriller guidelines by the book and get from one predictable mess to another: you have the obligatory fight sequence (Quack Fu? ha-ha), the car chase, while the microlight sequence was creative enough, you have the panties-flashing moment à la Kerri Green in ""Goonies"" and a big ugly scary-looking villain who utters ponderous threats as if he was Darth Vader's jealous cousin. And why is the Police so damn personal about Howard, why would one officer give a 'aim the heart' order? Speaking of heart, this is the only department where the film tries to be original but it's all wrong and makes Lea Thompson's incestuous lust on Marty McFly acceptable. There have been inter-species relationships before but Howard is no Jeff Bridges in ""Star Man"". So, while the audience enjoyed a movie like ""Temple of Doom"" where Indians were portrayed as Monkey-brain eaters and a heart was ripped off a body, ""Howard the Duck"" was too weird and creepy for the audience's taste, so much for the new breed of hero. The film won many Razzies and became a contender to every single worst list made after, even George Lucas disowned the film, but I don't see why he should escape from the blame, whatever failed is everybody's failure. But now that the passing of time improved movies like ""Police Academy"" by the simple nostalgic value, why shouldn't Lucas acknowledge what was a well-meaning accident. ""Howard the Duck"" has as many flaws as a film can get, but in thirty years, we've witnessed so many craptacular creations to make judge ""Howard the Duck"" with more forgiving eyes. It seems like the film's reputation is more famous than the film itself and this can vividly influence a judgment, if not clouding it.""Howard the Duck"" isn't ""Howard's End"", but it has its moments: the acting is decent, the chemistry between Howard and Beverly, within its own wicked and controversial way, works most of the time, and it has good production values and special effects. The problem is mostly the writing, the indecisive plot construction between making the film a family friendly entertainment or a dark existential thriller... it does have two lines I love though, Howard lusting at Beverly's panties, saying: ""I have developed a greater appreciation for the female version of the human anatomy..."" And there's one line I often use in real-life and that I owe to 'one of the worst films of all-time', it's the one delivered by that scene-stealing waitress: ""You know, hostility is like a psychic boomerang"". A film that provides such a clever line can't be that bad...",Howard the Duck
24,ericstevenson,Quack is indeed whack,2,7 April 2017,"I remember hearing about this movie from my dad who said it was the worst superhero movie ever made. Well, he didn't use those exact words, but that's what he was heavily implying. It seems like most people agree with him. Well, maybe not the worst but certainly one of the worst. Maybe it's not technically a superhero movie, but at least a movie based on a Marvel comic book and part of the Marvel Universe, so I think it counts. Anyway, this is probably George Lucas' worst movie, although I don't know if he directly worked on the Star Wars Holiday Special.The worst thing about this movie is how predictable it is. I remember a scene where the police are talking about a manhunt for a duck and I knew that they'd make a joke about a duck hunt. Also, there's a scene where a police officer calls the guy Jack, and I knew he'd say not to call him Jack. Worse, I knew they'd show Howard faking being possessed. Well, the first time it looked like he died they didn't so I was glad they didn't use that cliché. Then it looked like he died again and they used it that time. The pacing is this film is terrible. It really is dreadfully boring. The fact that the first five minutes show a duck's naked breasts in a PG rated film makes you know it will be unwatchable.This happened to be the first theatrically released movie based on a Marvel comic and dang, has Marvel gone to infinity and back since then. There's a scene where Howard and his friend somehow know how to build a plane and fly it in this drawn out fifteen minute sequence that goes on forever. I'm surprised the Nostalgia Critic didn't make a joke about that. Speaking of which, I love his review of that and it has one of my favorite jokes from him. People in the movie say, ""Dat's a duck!"", ""What is dat thing?"", ""Dat's a duck man!"". This causes the Critic to say, ""Dat's a duck!"" (points to tie) ""Dat's a tie!"" (points to desk) ""Dat's a desk!"" (points to movie) ""Dat's a dupid, dupid movie!"". *",Howard the Duck
25,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Howard, forever the Underduck",7,20 February 2008,"Let me tell you something about film critics. It's easy to pick faults in someone else's work, even if you do not have it in your power to create an equal work of art. The average film critic, by his very nature, is just a pretentious know-it-all who is quite frequently talking from the wrong end of his alimentary canal. When HTD came along in 1986 it was the first true victim to the pop culture critic.For 22 years it has been called 'the biggest flop of all time' and other such terrible labels. Well, it cost $30 million dollars (nothing compared to today's budgets) and took $37 million worldwide and that's not even counting the higher-than-you-think rental revenue. Add it altogether and HTD is most definitely NOT the flop it is accused of being. But since it was a rather eccentric family comedy (an easy target) and one of the first films to significantly under-perform at the domestic box office (George Lucas expected the returns to be astronomical) it became a scapegoat for bad studio spending and taste.I guess that the world needs something or someone to blame when pop culture goes wrong and the jackass critics I mentioned already seized upon Howard's failings to make a name for themselves. Derogatory soundbites are easy to come up with and everyone who hated the film used some kind of duck-themed insult to put it down and make themselves feel clever. But, when you think about it, these are basically the same people who will deliberately give a bad film a great review just to see their own name on the poster (yes, I am talking to you Paul Ross).The film also suffered a further bad rep when George Lucas publicly disowned the film. It's under-performance forced him to sell off a part of his company which went on to become Pixar (think of how much he could have earned if he didn't) and it really made him quite angry. Wouldn't you be? Me? I am a huge fan of the late Steve Gerber's comic-books. HTD was basically the first BIG comic-book movie and came surprisingly soon after he found success in his own series. Howard first appeared in an issue of Man-Thing and starred in a few other issues of Conan and even Spider-Man before getting his own wings in the late 70s. The comic-book stories are the most surreal, archaic and satirical I have ever read and it's a shame that they had to tone it down for the movie, but that's to be expected.As an ordinary duck working for an advertising company on his home planet of Duckworld, Howard is blasted across the universe right out of his living room by an experimental laser developed by Dr. Jenning (Jeffrey Jones). He lands in Cleveland, where he meets Beverly Switzler (Lea Thompson) a singer who takes him under her wing...I mean arm. Now trapped in a world he never made the one attempt at sending him back home unleashes the forces of the Dark Overlord of the Universe on earth through the possession of Dr. Jenning and he intends to bring more of his demons through the portal. Yeah, that sounds pretty heavy.I'm actually a sucker for duck-related stuff. I don't know why. Donald Duck, Daffy Duck, Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Duckman etc. The list goes on and on. What I particularly like about the HTD movie is how most people seem to be completely at ease at talking to a humanoid bird.Some of the fairer critics claimed that the film might have been a bigger hit if they had used CGI or traditional animation to bring Howard to life, but I must disagree. Part of the appeal of Howard is the fact that he is actually physically there and not some ghost who has been photo-shopped in afterwards. I love the duck suit, to me it is completely convincing and Chip Zien's voice work is perfect. I'd totally love to have Howard as a pal.No joke, this film has a unfairly notorious history and a totally wrong perception by the general public or those who turned their noses and beaks up when it came out in 1986. Clear your head of any preconceptions that you might have and enjoy it on its own level. Though we really could have done without that silly narration over the opening title.",Howard the Duck
26,atlasmb,A Faulty Premise Drags This Comedy Down,5,18 May 2017,"If you don't really care about what happens to a film's title character, there is not much chance the film will succeed. Howard the Duck has less personality than most college mascots, though he offers sarcastic comments. The three-foot protagonist of this film has limited mobility and a head that is fairly inexpressive. His tale of woe is that he has been displaced from his world to Earth and he feels like a small duck in a big pond. But he speaks English (lucky duck!) and there are no differences in customs except those that relate directly to ducks (like duck hunting). So he can cope. But he has to deal with humans who are surprised to see a relatively tall, talking duck. Actually, the reactions to Howard are inconsistent and not credible.One could make the case that HTD, being a comedy of outrageous premises, should not be seriously reviewed. But there are good comedies and bad comedies. HTD is lame at best. Though Lea Thompson and (the great actor) Jeffrey Jones try to breathe life into this turkey, the concept never flies.It is best to watch HTD as an attempt at camp. On that level, some scenes are mildly humorous. The relationship between Howard and Thompson's punk-rock singer is awkward. You have to give her bonus points for really trying to sell the odd chemistry between them. But it's not a situation that works (unlike the relationship between Marty McFly and his mother in ""Back to the Future"", which really works on a comedy level.)On the other hand, if Lea Thompson had been sucked through an interplanetary portal to a world where ducks were the salient species...nah, it just doesn't work.",Howard the Duck
27,Bored_Dragon,Duck! And proud of it!,8,16 January 2017,"This is the first Marvel movie and, after of course ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", definitely most entertaining one of all about 25 I've seen so far. The movie was a theatrical disaster and won a bunch of ""awards"" for worst movie, directing, acting, etc. Is it an artistic masterpiece? Of course not. But it was not supposed to be. The movie title is ""Howard the Duck"", what those people expected from the story about an alien duck that saves the world from evil space demons... I enjoyed it very very much and I intend to watch it many more times. It may lack artistic value, but other Marvel blockbusters don't have it either. The only thing that raises them above this one is high budget and CGI. But while they are arrogantly pretentious, ""Howard"" is down to earth honest adaptation of the comic-book that does not pretend to be something it is not. It is simply two hours of cheerful action for comic-book fans.8/10 (maybe even 9)",Howard the Duck
28,ironhorse_iv,This movie is a lame duck! This quack is whack!,3,14 July 2015,"For all the criticism that director George Lucas gets for the Star Wars prequel trilogy; at least, it's safe to say, those movies is not as bad as the movie, he produce, call Howard the Duck! Howard the Duck is just the ugly duckling that didn't turn into a swan! Directed by Willard Huyck, and based off, a marvel comic of the same name, by Steve Gerber. The movie tells the story of Howard the Duck (Voiced by Chip Zien), a sarcastic anthropomorphic alien duck that was accidentally brought down to our world, by scientist, Dr. Jennings (Jeffrey Jones). When, Jennings attempts to return Howard to his world with his humans' deep-probing observatory laser-scope; instead of transferring Howard, an evil alien spirit was transfer into his own body. Now the wisecracking Howard, must fight this evil essence, while also finding a way to fit in with our society. Can Howard stop this alien invader or will the Earth be doom? Watch the movie to find out, if you really want to. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found it, a bit odd, that Marvel Entertainment Group (MEG), sold millions of options to studios to produce films based on Marvel Comics characters. Yet, this movie was the first Marvel Comic to ever be adaptation for the big screen. Wow! Just Wow! Although there had been several TV adaptations of Marvel characters during the preceding 21 years, this was the first attempt at a theatrical release since the Captain America serial of 1944. I'm deeply surprised, by that. Honestly, I would have, thought, Howard the Duck would be last comic book to be adapted! Anyways, the movie was supposed to be an animated feature originally, but at the last second, changed to live action, because Universal needed a film for a summer release, and couldn't wait for long term, animation to be made. Lucas suggested that the film could be produced in live action, with special effects created by Industrial Light & Magic. While the special effects were pretty good at the time, they became very dated, with each, passing year. It shows that the special effects weren't as sophisticated as George Lucas, has thought. The animatronics for Howard the Duck by far is the best and still pretty believable today. It allow for a very good range of motion and realism. During production, a stronger emphasis was placed on special effects, rather than the story. Due to this, the story kinda lost focus and became directionless. The whole tone of the film is very differ compare to the comics. The film was market for kids, while it's clear, the comic books were made, for adults, due to its risky film noir satire elements. While, the harsh complex nature of Howard were somewhat clean up, it's still hard to figure out, if this film, was intended for adults or children! I was deeply confused by the sexual elements of the film. Why could they feature a notorious scene where a human character, Beverly (Lea Thompson) tries to seduce Howard!? Was Bestiality, alright to show in a 1980s kid's film?! By far, the most distracting and tasteless scene was the glimpse of duck tits. Why would they do this!? It's already, disturbing enough, showing Howard, working at some type of hot spa sex club! Come on! Are the writers, perverts? Younger kids might also might be disturbed by the villain's monster mutations. The movie gets noticeably darker once the Dark Overlord possesses Dr. Jenning. The absurdism levels are really high in this film. The film gets worst by having some of most obnoxious silly side characters ever. Jeffrey Jones as the Dark Overlord was laughable. He looks like an outcast demon from the 1984's Ghostbusters, mixed with MegaMan's Dr. Wily. It gets funnier, throughout the film when he sounds like G.I Cobra Commander, drinking Helium. Tim Robbins is really wasted, here as scientist, Phil Blumburtt. While, he is great actor, his character is very annoying. As much, as I love Lea Thompson, as an actress. I really didn't like Beverly, the rock-star, as well. Not only does, Beverly not appear to be smart. She seem so one-dimension cartoony with her 1980s hair rock-star gimmick. Everything about this film is dated. The classic styles, fashions, hairstyles, and trends of the 1980s are shown in all their laughable glory here. The music by John Barry is pretty catchy. It's by far, one of the better things about this film. The humor, not so much. Most of the humor kinda miss the funny bone, for me. I thought, the merciless ducks puns could had been better. Howard the Duck's 5 second appearance at the end of 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy was better than this entire movie! While, Howard the Duck laid a rotten egg at the box office and ended up earning several Razzies, including Worst Film. It's deserve its reputation as one of the worst films, ever.

In a way I guess I can do without this film, though it is one of those classic 80's films that do bring back memories of a period in cinema where the special effects weren't digitalised yet still were realistic enough that they were able to create a pretty good film.This is what one would call a Fish out of Water film. Poor old Howard, who happens to be a duck, but not any ordinary duck but a duck that had evolved to be, well, like a human. On his world (which happens to be shaped like an egg) Ducks evolved as opposed to apes. However, one day, while sitting in his comfy chair, smoking a cigar and drinking a beer, he finds himself sucked into a vortex and dragged all of the way to Earth. Suddenly, he finds himself in a situation that he realises that he is out of his depth.It is not that Howard is any better that the people around him, just different. He is an evolved duck, and even then he cannot fly and he cannot swim (the first because he has evolved beyond wings, and the second because, well, he never learned to swim). Mind you, this movie isn't just about Howard wondering around trying to get used to Earth, that is only half of the movie. The other half involves him coming up against the Dark Overlords of the Universe. However, I suspect that many of you, at least those of you who are as old as I am (and I am not going to actually tell you how old I am) will already know this. Another, thing that I just thought of, this movie is pretty much an 80's version of Ted, except that Ted is a soppy feel good movie, where as this movie has The Dark Overlords of the Universe.",Howard the Duck

Their attempts to find a way for Howard to return to his own planet are assisted by Beverly's friend Phil (Tim Robbins), who brings in Dr. Jenning (Jeffrey Jones) but their research only results is something much worse being brought to Earth.So, no. It's not good. Not good at all. Particularly for the first half. Tonally it's all over the place, with duck playboy magazine and the visit to the brothel feeling at odds with the PG Certificate. The plot takes an age to get going and the set pieces are dull or incomprehensible. The acting is terrible, from some pretty big names too - what is Tim Robbins doing? It's also not helped that time hasn't been kind to the very 80's sensibilities, from the awful band, to the massive hair, to the outfits that everyone wears to the weird Rock club, to the generic 80's street thugs.But is its reputation as one of the worst films of all time actually warranted? Not really, of course it was a financial failure and essentially ended up costing Lucas Pixar, but those consequences shouldn't really be considered when appraising the movie. Does ""The Shawshank Redemptions"" initial financial failure affect people's opinions of that film? The second half of the movie is alright, when the plot finally starts. I actually quite like the effects for the evil overlords race, I'm a bit of a sucker for stop motion animation.Whilst never approaching a level you would describe as ""good"" the film is, never the less, rather unfairly grouped in during the ""worst of all time"" conversations and Howard himself is overdue his full MCU reboot.",Howard the Duck

This begins in a far away galaxy, on a Duck Planet where we meet Howard (Gale). Soon, he's mysteriously pulled out of his home and flies through space landing on Earth in Cleveland. He meets singer, Beverly (Thompson) and tries to figure out how to get back home to his planet. Howard then meets scientists, Phil (Robbins) and Jenning (Jones) who try to figure out a way to send him back. Something goes wrong before Howard and Beverly get to the lab and Jenning is painfully sick. Beverly and Howard discover that he's possessed by a demonic alien called, a Dark Overlord that was accidentally transported to Earth like Howard and wants to send his race on Earth. Jenning kidnaps Beverly and Howard attempts to rescue her with Phil's help. This is definitely one of the most underrated films.

How come the writers of this movie didn't read the comic book a little more carefully? George Lucas' film company needs to bear some responsibility for producing this movie.

39,MBunge,Sometimes a bad movie is just a bad movie,3,22 November 2011,"Don't be fooled by any attempt at resurrection or redemption. Howard The Duck is not a good a movie. True, the first half of it isn't nearly as bad as its infamous reputation. That second half, thoughye gods. The first hour is like a lame 80s sitcom in tone and tenor. Imagine My Two Dads starring a little person in a duck costume and you've got an idea of what it's like. The second hour is one of those epic crapfests where the film got completely away from the filmmakers and they didn't know how to get it back. It's also evident that the people who made Howard The Duck did not understand the way Steve Gerber's embittered everyduck was bound up in the zeitgeist of the 1970s and doesn't really work outside that era. Throw in an at times mind blowingly inappropriate soundtrack and you've got a motion picture that does deserve most of the disdain directed at it over the years.In the comics, Howard was an anthropomorphized duck from another dimension transported to Earth and trapped ""in a world he never made"" to be the cynical, struggling centerpiece of writer Steve Gerber's surreal social satire. His adventures became one of those mini cultural sensations that flare up and disappear almost as quickly, like the Adam West Batman show but on a much smaller level. There's only one scene in this movie that reflects Howard's comic book sensibilities. The rest of the time, this story could have been about Daffy, Donald or any other duck.In this film, the three foot high waterfowl finds himself transported from Duckworld to Earth, where he quickly meets Beverly Switzler (Lea Thompson), the lead singer in a girl band. She takes Howard in and leads him to over excited lab assistant Phil Blumburrt (Tim Robbins), who eventually connects Howard to Dr. Walter Jenning (Jeffrey Jones), the man whose experiment brought Howard to this planet. After trying to recreate that experiment, Dr. Jenning is possessed by an alien monster and Howard and company have to stop him from bringing the rest of his kind down and destroying the world.The list of good things about this movie isn't very long. Lea Thompson is cute as the dickins and admirably plays along with these filmmakers' poor sense of humor. Tim Robbins also eats the scenery with aplomb and Ed Gale and a set of other little people do an okay job of giving Howard a physical personality.As for the restoy.The musical score to Howard The Duck is one of the most unfortunate ones I've ever heard in any film. Imagine if Ghostbusters had had the soundtrack from Out of Africa. Now imagine if Ghostbusters also wasn't funny. That's what the music here is like. The writing is full of willful clichés, unearned sentimentality and lazy plotting. The direction is sterile, never giving the audience a defined point of view. We aren't shown the world through the eyes of Howard or any other character. The camera is always at an emotional and intellectual distance, which only highlights the dull-witted attempts at comedy.Even if the talent fairy had waved her magic wand and gotten the people behind this film to fix every other problem, it still would probably have been doomed by the terrible miscasting of Howard's voice. Chip Zien gives the curmudgeonly mallard all the depth of an infomercial host and all the edge of a Mormon candidate for President of the United States. Zien sounds like one of those bad standup comedians who get a TV show that airs for 6 episodes and then are never heard from again. Given the technical limitations of the day in regard to Howard's look and expression, getting the right voice for the character was absolutely essential and they blew it as bad as it could be blown.Some folks may try to tell you that Howard The Duck is a ""cult classic"". They're wrong because the first half of the movie isn't nearly bad enough to qualify as ""cult"". If you're in a forgiving mood, you might even like it. Not even Nelson Mandela has even forgiveness in him to tolerate the second half, but that has too much hackneyed, conventional Hollywood nonsense in it to merit ""cult"" status either. This is just another failed comic book adaptation, notable only for being one of the more eccentric comics to ever be brought to the big screen.",Howard the Duck

Its not a cinematic masterpiece, but its definitely worth watching. I know that this is the type of movie that's bound to get some insults, but the amount of hatred towards it is honestly a bit surprising. Sights and Sounds - The overall look of this movie is actually pretty decent, especially considering when it was made. The cinematography is just ok. Nothing spectacular, but certainly not boring. The audio was surprisingly good. I usually have a lot of trouble hearing what's being said in older movies, but I had no problems with this move. The costume (or puppet, I'm not entirely sure) for Howard is actually pretty good for the most part. Some of the effects are pretty bad, but for the time they're good. Characters - The acting isn't that bad, but it isn't good by any means. Some of the line delivery is a bit iffy, but its not terrible. I mean, yes, some of the acting made me laugh through the ""serious"" parts, but its not as bad as it could be.Tone - This movie is hilarious, especially when its not trying to be. There are actually a considerable number of scenes that are trying to be serious and dramatic, but they're way to funny. This movie is a comedy all the way through.Plot - This movie probably shouldn't be rated PG. There's a lot of adult themes in this movie that could've been explored if they weren't trying to market this towards children. That being said, the plot is a bit simplistic for a lot of adults to enjoy. There are actually a lot of concepts in this movie that are actually pretty interesting.

Confused and screaming, Howard lands in (of all places) Cleveland, Ohio where Beverly (Lea Thompson) takes pity on him and takes him home. As the plot wears on we discover Howard's trip was the result of a laser beam experiment perpetrated by scientist Walter Jenning (Jeffrey Jones) and his assistant Phil (Tim Robbins). Can Howard find his way home or will he be captured on earth for slicing, dicing and sautéing.It's not that Howard the Duck is a bad film. Sure it's on the level of Waterworld (1995) and John Carter (2012) for being a big, huge miscalculation on the part of the studio. And sure the story of an alien anthropomorphic duck causing trouble on Earth seems like something a twelve year old would come up with after learning to draw in the lines. The acting is terrible, the dialogue very much phoned- in and the special effectswell you got me there.Yes Howard the Duck despite all its faults is a tremendous spectacular mess with some pretty impressive set pieces. In fact Howard the Duck should probably be in a film industry museum, studied by wannabe special-effects gurus. One scene involving a roadside diner is basically a crash course in effects work involving stunts, miniatures, photo animation, prosthetics, animatronics, air cannons, squibs and light computer effects. After the diner scene there are two more massive and impressive set pieces, one involving an Ultralight and another involving a gigantic monster done with clay and stop-motion. With a bloated budget of $37 million dollars it's easy to see where that money went.If only more money went into making the character of Howard look more real. The fault was not entirely on the creators who I'm convinced did what they could but if Peter Jackson can make Meet the Feebles (1989) a no-budget Muppet parody that same decade and make the characters much more believable, I'm sure George Lucas and director Willard Huyck could have come up with something better than ""let's stick a bunch of little people in a stuffy duck suit."" Actors' career's like Lea Thompson and Howard's voice Chip Zien never really recovered from Howard the Duck. Likely because Thompson's new found niche for characters falling in love with odd things (Her son in Back to the Future (1985) than this?) is a bit too narrowly tailored. Willard Huyck's career also took a tailspin which started on a high note with screen writing credits for American Graffiti (1973) and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984). Somewhat ironically Ed Gale, one of the seven little people stuffed in the aforementioned duck suit has said that he gets more fan mail from his performance in Howard the Duck than any of his other movies which includes Spaceballs (1987), Child's Play (1988) and O Brother Where Art Thou? (2000). Then there was the relatively green UCLA graduate who later made waves. I'm talking of course about Tim Robbins who went on to win an Oscar for Mystic River (2003). As for Jeffrey Jones; the less we say about him in this review the better.The unbelievably clunky execution of the duck in conjunction with a bad script and horrid acting deservedly puts the film in bad movie territory. Yet deliberately and knowingly making a movie of this caliber naively thinking it's going to be a big hit does not a ""worst movie"" make. It's almost like the film was done on a dare. I can imagine the back story to how this foul picture got made is similar to The Producers (1968). Let's go all out and make a profit out of the worst idea that could be found.

50,TheUnknown837-1,"""Howard the Duck"" is a stomach-twisting disgust most of the time and insufferably boring the rest of the time",3,17 September 2012,"""Howard the Duck"" is one of the most unpleasantly mean-spirited movies I have ever seen. It is an utterly joyless exercise, one that seems to drag on to no end, and leading nowhere good. Whenever it's not flat-out boring, it is absolute revolting, generating more twists in my stomach than most gross-out horror films have accomplished. In terms of sheer disgust, it ranks pretty close with Roger Corman's dreadful ""Galaxy of Terror."" This may be worse, however. For ""Galaxy of Terror"" used mostly slime-coated rubber monsters and gallons of blood, but it's lowlight was an infamous rape scene involving a giant worm and a human female. Very nearly disgusting is this movie's lowlight: a near-sex scene (consensual, mind you!) between a human female and a duck from outer space.The most shocking thing is that this sequence and many others are contained in a movie meant to not only be a comedy, but a comedy for children. Why, I cannot imagine. I admit I am not familiar with the original comic book material, save for a few cover photos I have seen. The Howard the Duck from the comics, to me, resembled a chain-smoking caricature of Donald Duck. Well, the duck here smokes, as well. He also cusses, is a master of Quack-Fu, is libidinous toward human females, and is one of cinema's most entirely unsympathetic so-called protagonists. The movie would like us to laugh and empathize with Howard, but my morals refused to. Straight from the beginning, Howard is an unlikable little twerp, and he remains an unlikable little twerp. I do grant that the special effects used to create him are fairly good. His bill opens and closes smoothly and with lip movement, his eyes do not merely sit in their sockets, and the suit movement is decent enough. But taking this vulgar character from the comics and making him into a likable figure was a tough challenge, and clearly the screenwriters were not up to it.Speaking of the screenwriters, is it a coincidence that the storytellers of this fiasco were the same duo who wrote ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom?"" Both films are unnecessarily grim, clumsily juggle whimsy with nightmare images, and are simply difficult to endure. ""Howard the Duck"" is very much the same, except, unlike ""Temple of Doom,"" it does not have a director who can produce some nevertheless redeeming features. What it does have are those same traits I mentioned above, as well as disturbing moments such as one where a group of bikers and truck drivers in a roadside café strap Howard down to a table and try to behead him with a kitchen knife. Decapitation is one of the more disturbing means of execution; it should be used sparingly in the movies, let alone kids' movies. Just the idea of it is disturbing. And what do the makers of ""Howard the Duck"" do in an attempt to soften the scene? They have Lea Thompson, who is, by the way, the duck's human companion, plead ""Don't kill him! He's my boyfriend!"" A truck driver responds: ""That is disgusting!"" A true statement, but not the least bit funny.There are numerous other would-be gags, which include: a female duck with creepily humanoid breasts sitting in her bathtub; a waitress saying ""We don't allow pets on the premises!""; the constant wisecracks for citizens who see Howard for the first time; Howard scaring a group of children.The people in the movie don't fare much better. Miss Thompson is whimsical and easy on the eyes, but she's too dizzy to be charming. There is also Tim Robbins doing a decent-enough job and occasionally forcing a grin out of me. The only other person on-screen long enough to be worth mentioning is Jeffrey Jones, who is stone-faced when a scientist and goofily over-the-top when possessed by a demon from outer space. They are also surrounded by a lot of production design and special effects, some of which are dazzling. The dust we see floating around in outer space and the lights spewing from a giant proton machine are pretty, and the climax of the movie features an excellently animated stop-motion insect. He should get his own movie. But ""Howard the Duck"" is too lopsided and gross-factor-heavy to beguile an audience. It is a stomach-twisting disgust most of the time and insufferably boring the rest of the time.",Howard the Duck
51,IonicBreezeMachine,"There's fleeting moments of absurd inspiration, but the movie never comes together as a whole.",4,13 March 2021,"Howard, a humanoid duck from a world where ducks have evolved to be the dominant species, is a lecherous, alcoholic, chain smoking, cynic working as an advertising copywriter. While sitting in his apartment one evening an unknown force drags him and his recliner out of his apartment and through the vastness of space eventually winding up on Earth. Howard lands in Cleveland, Ohio and is subjected to all manners of abuse and humiliation at the hands of punks, vagrants, and gangs but when he saves Beverley (Lea Thompson) from getting jumped he finally has his first positive interaction with a human when she invites him to stay with her. Howard after struggling for employment eventually becomes manager of Beverley's band Cherry Bomb, but a visit from Dr.Walter Jennimg (Jeffrey Jones) promises revelations that may lead him back home or possibly lead something evil to Earth.Released in 1986 to poor reviews and lackluster box office, Howard the Duck became a punchline almost immediately after its release including winner a Razzie for Worst Picture. Based on a comic book of the same name from Marvel comics, the comic attracted George Lucas with its mixture of film-noir aesthetic and absurdism and attracted Universal Pictures as partner on the film (after passing on several other Lucas projects that became successful). While there's an idea in play on screen, the movie never comes together as well as it wants to.The effects to bring Howard the Duck to life are okay (if a little clumsy). While Howard isn't on the level of Jim Henson's puppetry, considering the time the film was made Howard does have weight and presence thanks to the team of 6 who brought the character to life via costumes and puppetry. Sometimes Howard can appear somewhat dead-eyed and does seem to be looking where he's supposed to be, but all things considered it's not a terrible costume.The approach Howard the Duck takes to its premise is similar in nature to other effects driven comedies of the time such as Ghostbusters, Back to the Future, Real Genius, or Big Trouble in Little China where the effects are used to make over the top creations that contrast with reality in a way to deliver laughs from the excess on display. The issue Howard the Duck runs into is that Howard is played as the most grounded individual in the movie while the human cast are playing themselves very over the top. In the case of Lea Thompson's Beverly she dials up stereotypical air-headed Cyndi Lauper type persona complete with big hair, spandex, and neon colors that made up contemporary fashions. Her performance is not subtle, but given the nature of the world the movie creates I think that may be part of the joke. Tim Robbins has a supporting role as a socially inept ""scientist"" named Phil, who's actually a janitor who tests Howard for superpowers (in what's basically a long string of comic book references). I think what Robbins is going for is a parody of stereotypical comic book fanboys and apparently a similar joke existed in the comics where police thought he was an X-Men, but in this movie Howard isn't part of an expanded superhero universe nor is there any establishment of superpowers outside of Howard so this joke is completely divorced from what made it work in the first place when it was in comic format.The movie's structure is very messy with the first half being a series of encounters Howard faces with exaggerations of 1980s urban culture complete with rowdy punk rockers, shouting vagrants, unemployment officers talking about the public dole, and there's no sense of structure to this part of the movie as Howard just ambles from one setpiece to another with little driving the plot or character motivations. Even once the plot kicks in around the halfway point with the revelation of a science experiment being responsible for bringing Howard to Earth, the movie doesn't get much more focused even when it establishes world ending stakes because none of the characters take the threat seriously.While Howard the Duck has all the special effects of movies like Ghostbusters, Back to the Future, and Big Trouble in Little China, the movie doesn't understand what made those movies work. In the examples mentioned there was always a grounding element in the movie where characters would take aspects of the absurd plot seriously which allowed the humor to take place. Kurt Russell's Jack Burton in Big Trouble in Little China for example was a straight man to the wizardly and monsters in Chinatown and that allowed them to be funny because he was confused and reacted to these elements. Same with Marty, George, and Doc from Back to the Future or Peter, Egon, and Ray from Ghostbusters. You need realistic grounded characters to bounce the oddness and weirdness off of to give them any semblance of meaning or impact. Howard the Duck doesn't have that because either the Humans are written to be stupid or blissfully unaware, or in Howards case he won't stop cutting one-liners even when he faces peril.Howard the Duck has a decent enough premise for absurd laughs and high concept fun, but it kills itself with the execution. A lack of grounding with the characters undercuts the oddness of its premise and a lack of structure and overly long runtime kill any semblance of comedic pacing. There's some decent effects work and clear commitment from the cast on display, but it's unfortunately in service of a movie that doesn't work.",Howard the Duck
52,emasterslake,No wonder it's forgotten.,3,2 January 2009,"I never heard of this movie until I looked it up on George Lucas's filmography. I learned it was a flop of it's time, and didn't see the whole film till 2008.Howard the Duck is about a duck who got tractor beamed from his planet of the Ducks to Earth. Where he was about to witness a world that's similar to his except ducks aren't the superior species on the planet, but humans. Alone and chased by those who find him to be a mutant. Howard eventually befriends with a diva who was trying to get her all girl band to become popular. After meeting Howard she tries to find a way to get Howard back to his home planet.This is one of those movies that couldn't be done successful on live action format. If it were animated it probably wouldn't be any different since the script need a lot of grading to do. I heard that the comic is different from this movie. But I doubt I would find the time to read a lesser known comic series.Just to be brief, there's nothing special about this movie. Even if it's left open for a sequel. That will never happen in this life time. Cause the whole idea and plot of this film are hideous and sloppy. It's not something to watch a second time. To me this movie would of been better if the script was re-written so that way it would be more bearable to watch. Plus Duckman was way more cooler than Howard is. If it weren't for this movie, George Lucas would of had more money in his pocket & the original CEO of Universal wouldn't of gotten the boot back in 1986.Since it's so unpopular it's unlikely we'd ever see a DVD release of this film. Even if there was one it just be one of those bone dry DVD bargains that have zero features to them. And you'll bet this will not likely to be released on Blu-ray either. Cause presenting this film in better definition won't save it from the trash bin.In case you're so curious in seeing this film, I won't stop you after giving out so many cautions. You'll only be able to see this film on used VHS tapes that are less than a penny.",Howard the Duck
53,ElijahCSkuggs,I knew I remembered seeing Duck Boobs!,7,11 December 2007,"It's been easily over ten years since I've seen Howard the Duck. I remembered enjoying quite a bit as a kid. But, we all know over the years, movies tend to change a little bit. Back then the humor was silly one-liners, now the funny thing to do is ramble until you get a laugh. In any case, I saw Howard the Duck available for free OnDemand, so I had to jump at the chance. And surprisingly enough, it still has the charm I remembered it having over 10 years ago. Though it's not as funny, or as entertaining as I remember it, it still has that 80's charm.As you know Howard the Duck was accidentally brought to Planet Earth through some Laser-Science thingy. He ends up meeting Caroline in the City and they set forth to try to get him home. But obviously that's side-tracked to silly 1980 rock concerts, nerdy scientists played by Tim Robbins, themes of bestiality, and so much more. Eventually an evil Warlord is also brought back through another Science-Thingy mishap and now they have to stop him and save the day. Or something like that.Howard the Duck is known as being an awful film. And that's just not the case. Sure it has crappy corny jokes revolving around being a duck and what not, but it has a fun feel to it also. You've got Tim Robbins playing a silly part as a scientist, Caroline in the City showing off her tight little bod in her undies. You also, I think got the guy who got in trouble with Pee Wee Herman concerning child porn playing a great part as another scientist who's body has been taken over by a demon Warlord. You also have those great 1980 special effects. The electricity special effects that you've probably seen in Masters of the Universe etc. And a great monster at the end, that's not in CGI. The movie is 80's gold, and I'm sure it'll be thought that way for a long, long time.",Howard the Duck

55,one9eighty,"Not as QUACKERS as you might think, Howard fits the BILL as a unassuming hero",7,4 January 2021,"Having seen the anthropomorphic sarcastic duck from the Marvel Universe in recent features over the last few years (e.g. ""Guardians of the Galaxy 2"" & ""Avengers""), I decided to revisit his stand-alone film which came out in the 1986. This film came out long before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was established and has no connection to any of the modern superhero films you may know post 2000. Directed by Willard Huyck, produced by Gloria Katz and written by them both too, this film boasted none other than George Lucas as an executive producer. Yes, Lucasfilm is credited here as the production company with Universal Pictures being the distributers - and yet a lot of people don't know about this film and it's hardly mentioned in the annuls of great Lucasfilm features. Originally intended to be an animated film, the live action film came about due to contractual obligations (Lucas was required to provide a distributer with live-action films). I must not forget to mention, the smack talking duck is a creation of Steve Gerber.This was the first attempt at a Marvel film since William J O'Sullivan's 1944 ""Captain Marvel"" feature which starred Dick Purcell as Grant Gardner/ Captain America. Of course, nowadays we know Captain America to be Steve Rogers, and in fact it's fair to say that the 1944 black and white Captain America was nothing like the Captain America we know today. He was District Attorney and there was no sign of super soldier serum of specialist military training - he was just a masked crime fighter. It's also worth noting that this 1944 film was based on a Timely Comics character rather than a Marvel Comics character too. To anybody who doesn't know, Timely Comics is nowadays know as Marvel Comics so that last statement is just a technicality, what I'm getting at is that it could be argued in certain camps, that the 1986 ""Howard the Duck"" film was the first Marvel Comics film feature - previously there had only been small TV live action segments, or feature length animations.The film stars of in an alternative reality, where anthropomorphic ducks are the normal (Duckworld). We see various tongue-in-cheek posters for duck versions of things we know (""Splashdance"" instead of ""Flashdance"", ""Rolling Egg Magazine"" instead of ""Rolling Stone Magazine"", ""Breeders Lost Stork"" instead of ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"", ""Playduck"" instead of ""Playboy""), and then we are introduced to 27-year-old Howard T. Duck, who lives in Marshington DC. A normal working duck who enjoys the single life, drinking beer, sports, cigars and TV. Without warning he is mysteriously sucked out of his world and spat out across the cosmos into a reality where evolved apes are the normal - our world. To be more specific, he ends up in Cleveland, Ohio. After a shock introduction to the new world he prevents the lead singer of 80's pop-punk band Cherry Bomb (Beverly Switzler - Lea Thompson) from being attacked by using his unique Quack-Fu skills. She takes him home to her apartment to spend the night out of the rain as a thank you for helping her. She takes him to scientist Phil Blumburrt (Tim Robbins) who might be able to help, but it turns our he's just a lab assistant cum janitor - so Howard resigns himself to life on Earth. It eventually turns out that the laboratory that Phil works out had been experimenting with a ""laser spectroscope"", it was pointing at Duckworld when Howard arrived, and by that logic it might be used to reverse the procedure and send Howard back. Before this can happen the machine malfunctions and lead scientist Dr Walter Jennings (Jeffrey Jones) is possessed by a life form from a distant region of space. The life form identifies itself as a 'Dark Overlord of the Universe' and starts causing chaos. He tries to use the laser to bring a fellow entity to Earth, including getting one into Beverley's body. It's up to Howard and Phil to save the day, save the planet, and if possible - get Howard back home.This bombed and bombed badly - I mean really badly. It was a commercial and critical failure and scooped more prizes for being a bad film than it did for any praise. There was a time in fact, when this was considered the worst film ever made. Some said at the time that it was lucky enough to recoup its budget; it cost $30-37 million and grossed $38 million. During award season this film won 4 out of the 7 Golden Raspberry Awards it was nominated for, including; Worst Screenplay, Worst Visual Effects, Worst New Star (for all 6 of the actors who played the duck), and it was a joint winner of the Worst Picture Award (tied with ""Under a Cherry Moon"" starring and directed by Prince). It was just pipped to the other 3 awards which were Worst Supporting Actor for Tim Robbins, Worst Director and Worst Original Song. All these Raspberry Awards aren't necessary things the film producers were particularly proud of, and probably still aren't. It also won the Stinkers Bad Movie Award for Worst Picture and shed load of other awards which said how bad it was. In fact, it was reported that this film was that bad that the actors struggled to get work after the film and took anything they could get hold of. Imagine if Tim Robbins didn't act again and was never in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994), or if this film prevented Lea Thompson from reappearing as Lorraine in ""Back to the Future Part II"" (1989). It turned out that hindsight proved that it wasn't all doom gloom for the actors, from Robbins to Thompson; from Jeffrey Jones to all 6 actors who brought Howard to life - they all found work, it was probably just a little more challenging due to the critical reviews. It wasn't completely doom and gloom for the entire film and everyone involved with it either - I guess it was just the immediate reaction to the film that caused the studio to panic and panic they did. Director Willard Huyck never directed again, and Frank Price, the head of Universal's motion picture division was sacked. Price has been in charge when successful films like ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Fletch"" were released, he was already on thin ice after alienating Steven Spielberg from the studio when he announced that ""E.T."" would only appeal to kids. Flash forward almost 30-40 years and this film isn't as hated today as it was back in 1986.It's not all bad though, for every trough there must be a peak too. With this bombing, an expensive divorce, and sales of Star Wars merchandise dwindling George Lucas sold his computer animation division to Steve Jobs for $10 million. Free from the Lucas empire the division would eventually go on to become Pixar.What did I think??
I watched this film in the 80's and I didn't hate it; I've re-watched it and I still don't hate it. I mean I don't love it, but I don't hate it - hate is too strong. Considering it got written up as one of the worst films of all time I can confirm that I have seen hundreds of films that make this film look like the best thing since sliced bread. It's a typical 80's film with 80's acting, a cheap and predictable 80's plot and story, bad 80's CGI and special effects, 80's costumes, make-up and prosthetic suits, and 80's songs throughout which wouldn't be out of place in an episode of South Park. The film is a product of it's time and doesn't look out of place next to films like ""Mac and Me"" (1988), ""Short Circuit"" (1986), and ""The Garbage Pail Kids Movie"" (1987) - but to be honest, those films aren't greats either! Re-watching this provided a nostalgic tour through my youth and lets me see how far comic book films have come since this came out in the 80's. It might not be the most exciting film; it might not be the most realistic looking with its anthropomorphic ducks - but it is not terrible. It is not for film connoisseurs, nor is it for kids either. It's for degenerates like you and me that grew up in the 80's and don't have an instant hatred for trash cinema. Those of us that don't mind the camp or kitsch mixed in with some over the top rubbish. At 111 minutes this film isn't too long to make you feel that you have been robbed of time.",Howard the Duck
56,vitaleralphlouis,Outstanding Cult Comic + George Lucas = Awful Movie,1,8 August 2005,"The best ""continuing story"" comic strip of the past 20 years was, in my opinion, Howard the Duck. This brooding film noir-type comic had us sneaking outside work every day at 3:30 for the Washington Evening Star just for this 3-panel strip. Howard just was not happy to find himself trapped on Earth, in Cleveland, living in a slum and interacting with his sexually useless (being human rather than fowl) girl friend Beverly. Like Groucho Marx with a bad hangover, Howard's continual rants about his rotten situation made a great comic strip. Along comes executive producer George Lucas, who strips away every single thing that provided Howard with character, and makes him nice; worse he makes him cute. Gag! If that weren't bad enough, the film has Howard and the Lea Thompson character engaging in post-sex afterglow --- thus advocating human with animal sex and spitting on the Judeo Christian ethic, for the sake of an unfunny site gag. This film is now George Lucas' dirty-little-secret; a part of his legacy; and worse than any of the last 3 Star Wars movies. Boo! Hiss!",Howard the Duck
57,Mister-6,"""Duck"" this one....",1,10 October 1999,"I've read the ""Howard the Duck"" comic books when they were out.  They were funny, sharp and more satirical than anything.Why they just didn't make an animated movie about Howard is beyond me.In fact, this whole fiasco is beyond me.  That it was written by Huyck and Katz doesn't bode well for any inherent entertainment value.  It is so bad that you'll wonder who pointed a gun to George Lucas' head to give the green light for such an idea.The only good thing about this headache-inducer was seeing Thompson in a sheer nightie.

58,khanbaliq2,"That's it, no more Mr. Nice Duck.",3,26 March 2016,"Howard The Duck is an interesting film to review. It's a big budget special effects spectacle, and yet there's plenty wrong with it. It is, to put it straight, odd. First of all, there's the twenty-seven-year-old duck Howard (voiced by Chip Zien). He's just like a normal person, except that he's a duck from Duckworld. He doesn't have any superpowers, but he does know quack-fu. The filmmakers made him look appealing, even cute at times, but his range of expressions isn't great because he's brought to life mostly by an animatronic suit. Still, I think that, for their time, the special effects (animatronic suits, costumes and puppets) look good and work well. I didn't have a problem with taking the duck seriously. The only problem with Howard, in my opinion, is that he's not a very likable protagonist. The Howard in the comic book is rude and obnoxious. The Howard in the film is sarcastic. Maybe the problem lies in his personality. Maybe the problem lies in the situations that he gets into. The film was supposed to appeal to children, as well as adults, but some of its dirty humor is not suitable for children. Howard gets beamed from Duckworld to Earth at the very beginning of the film. While this is happening, we're shown impressive views of space, planets and stars, which wouldn't look out of place in Star Trek. But, when Howard ends up on Earth, he has one problem after another, and his situation is a bit depressing because he's like a lost pet or a down-on-his-luck person. This is certainly not Back To The Future (1985). There are problems with the cast as well. The actors don't deliver bad performances, but, because the film is a comedy about a talking duck, their performances are sometimes strange. Firstly, there's Lea Thompson (playing Beverly Switzler), the beauty whose role in Howard The Duck was her biggest one yet. She was cast because of her appearance in Back To The Future. Her performance in Howard The Duck is definitely not one of her best. In some of her interviews, she talked about how unpleasant it was for her during filming. She's good at times, she looks nice, but, with the direction of Willard Huyck, she's often bland. Still, her involvement in the film made it better because she's a good screen presence. Tim Robbins plays Phil Blumburtt, a janitor who pretends to be a scientist. His performance is wacky. One can say that it's bad, but, in my opinion, it suits the film. Jeffrey Jones plays Walter Jenning, a good scientist whose transformation is memorable, yet strange, to say the least. It's also a bit scary, and what is with that voice? Another one of the film's problems is the direction by Huyck. Sure, the film seems coherent. It's not hard to follow the plot. But scenes seem to just happen, often without purpose, and some of them drag on for too long. Anyway, I can go on and on about what's wrong with Howard The Duck. Hardly anything about it seems right. Just about everything seems odd. It has a boring middle section. Did I mention the romance between Howard and Beverly? So, why do I, like many other people, like it? Well, it's because it's a film from the 1980s. It has that 1980s charm, those 1980s special effects, a good rock soundtrack, and it has Lea Thompson. It's a ridiculous, sometimes poorly-made film, but, so much money and effort was spent on it, that it's just interesting to watch and be marvelled by it. I definitely recommend it.",Howard the Duck

On that same note, it too depends on whether or not you love to laugh in the face of stupidity, because ""Howard the Duck"" is just that, stupidity.A film about a duck from another planet, who is accidentally trans-placed into our own Earth. The plot was well undeveloped, and I think they knew that when filming, but it went unchanged. The acting was well under a Hollywood fare.Tim Robbins and Emma Thompson star in this infamous tale along with Jeffrey Jones of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986)"" fame. I believe that if given the proper treatment in writing, the film may have done well better.",Howard the Duck
60,Squonkamatic,"When The Mighty Fall, They Fall Mighty Hard",2,11 February 2008,"It's not just that HOWARD THE DUCK is a bad movie. That would be fine -- I love ""bad"" movies, savoring them the way a connoisseur might linger over a fine wine, porterhouse steak, or other delicacy. Bad movies are my life to a degree: GALAXY OF TERROR, WEB OF THE SPIDER, Spaghetti Westerns, Turkish made super hero ripoffs with guys running around in skeleton suits, Mexican wrestling horror with some freak in a silver mask fighting vampire babes. Love 'em.The problem with HOWARD THE DUCK has to do with proportions. You might even say ""Less is More"" when it comes to a good grade C minus movie, especially if it manages to leave you wanting more. With HOWARD, you want less. Far less. After about the third car chase, the fifth fistfight, countless pyrotechnic telekinesis attacks, the ultra-light aircraft chase, the runaway Mack truck, and the big climax at the exploding nuclear plant, you sort of want to reach into the screen and make it all stop. And even then the movie isn't over, as we are treated to a genuinely nightmare inducing scene of Howard wowing the audience at a rock concert with his Chuck Berry impersonation as his unspeakably jaw-dropping awful signature pop song plays.Who thought this movie was a good idea? George Lucas? He can't solely be to blame. Gloria Katz? She had co-written ""American Graffiti"" and ""Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom"". How did she have also written this? Or better yet, WHY did she right this? Her husband, director Willard Huyck? His career was more or less finished after HOWARD THE DUCK (shades of ""You'll never work again in this town."") even after he too had co-written ""American Graffiti"" & the ""Indiana Jones"" movie. In 1972 Huyck directed a marvelous little grade C zombie schlocker called MESSIAH OF EVIL (originally titled DEAD PEOPLE) that has one of the most insanely brutal & artistically unexpected endings to a horror movie ever. It's a marvelous little horror thriller, deserves to be resurrected, but THIS is the film he will be remembered for.It's a shame, see, because on their own -- even with former film school classmate George Lucas in cahoots -- they could not have raised the $36 million dollars ($50 million in today money) it took to finance this movie, and the additional nine million to promote it: $45 million dollars, down the drain. Urban legend has it that some poor schmuck of a Universal Films studio chief who green-lighted the project quit and eventually attempted suicide over the 100% deserving negative reaction that HOWARD THE DUCK engendered within those who, for whatever reason, were compelled to see it. The public very wisely stayed at home, yet HOWARD inexplicably accumulated a passionate, massive cult following as a video era relic that I am at a loss to account for.The point being that not just someone, but **LEGIONS** of devoted, thoughtless, sycophantic film industry professionals, craftspeople, and talent apparently did think that HOWARD THE DUCK was a good idea. Track down the German DVD and check out the ""Duckumentary Teaser"" where Hollywood big mouth actor Tim Robbins speaks raves about HOWARD. He was convinced it was the movie experience of the year, maybe even his lifetime, and indeed Robbins pours his heart and soul into a frenetic, meaningless performance as some sort of biologist who helps Howard save the world from a giant mass of protoplasm & tendrils that looks like Jabba the Hutt turned inside out. At least Jeffery Jones has the insanity clause working in his defense if HOWARD THE DUCK ever comes up during a job interview.The movie is a loud, annoying, incoherent, seemingly never ending mess. It goes on and on, with more mayhem and destruction staged for untold millions of dollars that all amounts to absolutely nothing. The most disturbing aspect of the film is actually Howard the Duck himself, a two million dollar animatronic duck costume inhabited by a series of little people ... and because little people move in a certain way, whenever Howard is on screen you are painfully aware that what you are watching is an effect: A dwarf in a really expensive duck costume. He never convinces as a character and will seep into your nightmares as he scuttles across the floor, dodging an exploding golf cart or piloting an ultra-light aircraft overhead as police cars careen & crash into bits, wasting millions of dollars of needless waste in their swath of destruction. And then there are the expensively detailed sets, props, effects sequences, stunts, robotic thingamajobs, and exploding electronics that punctuate every possible frame of the movie's gob smacking 140 minute length. The level of waste and manic futility is biblical in nature; this movie is bad on the scale of Iraq, the Dark Ages, Kraft Foods, graduate school, and MySpace all wrapped up into one self-indulgent, nauseating craptacular.There is no way to verbally describe how annoying, excruciating, and utterly un-enjoyable this movie is to sit through. It can't even be enjoyed as a ""good bad"" movie or inspire drinking games to turn it into a lark. You have to endure it the way one endures doing your taxes, or maybe having a manual prostate examination. There are certainly ""worse"" movies, but not many that are on the same scale. That's why it will forever be regarded in hushed awe when other mega-bomb stinkeroos like the remake of ROLLERBALL, JOHN Q., and CROSSROADS with Britney Spears have long been forgotten. And yet by all evidence available from the time of release, everyone involved with the production was 100% convinced that HOWARD THE DUCK would be a blockbuster hit.

Howard is a duck out of water in a world of humans, and in the comics this is the starting point for sometimes grim social satire. In the movie, the 'why am I here and why are humans so weird?' ruminations are shoved aside in favor of expensive, noisy chase scenes and outrageous creature effects better suited to low budget B-movies. Comic book Howard's bitterly ironic sarcasm is replaced with 80s action movie throwaway one-liners.

The same thing must have happened when Lucas (or whoever) went to screenwriters Huyck and Katz and asked them to do a treatment of Gerber's ""Howard the Duck"" strip. H & K apparently had no idea of the type of humor the strip used, or at what demographic it was pitched. The result is a kiddie move that tries hard to be adult in all the wrong ways.

Don't forget your best bud Spielberg also had a colossal dub too (1941, another Universal coffer draining production). But seriously what's there not to like about Howard? It's got action, comedy, explosions, animatronic suits, duck-on-human love, quack-fu and dark overlords of the universe. Oh did I mention it had a hot Lea Thompson in it? Just watch it already In Conclusion: It was a bit before its time but thankfully it's developed quite a rabid (or is that duck rabies) fanbase over the years. I guess all those emails to Lucasfilm and Universal finally paid off. Did I mention it had a hot",Howard the Duck
70,RevRonster,Terrible...but accidentally hilarious!,1,21 August 2013,"It's amazing how far we've come with the comic book adaptation. Before this, terrible TV adaptations of Marvel comics polluted the airwaves and now we get ""The Avengers."" That's progress! Yes, ""Howard the Duck"" is an awful film. The story is stupid, the acting is ridiculous, the robot duck is silly and the lame jokes are funny only because you realize that someone must have thought what they wrote was in anyway a passable excuse for humor. Even though this movie is awful (and somehow some actors actually were able to have a career after it) the film is an accidental brilliant comedy that is fun to watch for all the wrong reasons.Occasionally, when I'm bored, I pull this on out of the archives (yes, I own this) and laugh my butt off...and then cry uncontrollably because there is anthropomorphic duck nudity and that just scares me...but, thanks to the internet, seems a tad tame now. All the terrible, awful, and terrible again elements that make up the physical manifestation of this film work in concert to make comedy.The film is like the world of cinema was sick and ""Howard the Duck"" was what was expelled from its body but it's fun (and hilarious) to watch just to see what someone actually thought would make a decent movie and is the perfect film to get together with a group of friends and make fun of it, laughing the night away.",Howard the Duck
71,Java_Joe,Misunderstood but deeply flawed.,4,23 March 2019,"Howard the Duck is literally one of the first movies ever released about a Marvel character. And for that it really needs to be remembered. It's also a terrible movie and showed that maybe George Lucas was a little over rated but at the same time it can be rather entertaining if you stop and look at it a bit more closely.This is based off the Marvel comics character called Howard who starred in his own comic book ""Howard the Duck"". The story goes that he's an anthropomorphic duck from a parallel universe where ducks are the dominant species who's transported to Earth against his will. Here he meets up with Beverly who eventually becomes his love interest and they go on lots of weird adventures together. The comic itself was a social satire employing parodies of genre fiction as well as using a bit of metanarrative to advance the story. So in other words he was meta before Deadpool took over that role.And that's the problem. If you look carefully at the movie itself you can see that they were trying to recreate that world on the silver screen. The problem is movies of that type need to be a little more obvious because otherwise they get taken literally and that spells the death of the movie. Which is what happened here. A lot of things happen in the background and no attention is brought to them as they should. For example in the restaurant scene where Howard almost gets killed and grilled by the crazy cook. If you read the sign it was a place that specialized in Cajun and Sushi. Two foods that were considered very trendy in the 80's except they're being served together. It's a strange pairing and in the theme of the comic book it makes sense. Here? Most people miss it and the joke is lost.That doesn't excuse it's many glaring faults however. The biggest of which is the costume. This was originally supposed to be an animated feature, at least that's what I've been able to dig up. And yet for some reason they just put a little person in a suit. Sure a case could be made that it gives Howard a true outsider aspect as nobody else looks like he does. But it doesn't excuse the fact that everytime I see him I just see a guy in a duck costume.There are decent scenes, some good actors trying to put some life into this pile of whatsit and let's face it Lea Thompson looks great here. So while it's not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination it's not as bad as people make it out to be.",Howard the Duck

Howard's face is straight-up creepy, a duck's head with human eyes is just wrong. The scene in the bar makes no sense...the duck weighs like forty pounds, tops, the guy could easily push him away. The bedroom scene is cringeworthy. See, there's a reason that this film flopped upon its release and why it has such a low IMDB rating: it simply isn't any good.",Howard the Duck

It cost around $40-50 million dollars to make this idiotic mess (expensive by 1980s standards; if this was made today, it would have cost over $100 million). ""Howard the Duck"" is based on a comic strip, and it should have stayed there. I don't know what was on George Lucas' mind when he agreed to executive produce this.

74,Rautus,A great cheesy 80's flick,10,21 February 2008,"Howard the Duck is one of those movies that's so bad it's good, it's cheesy and campy in parts but that just makes it more entertaining. The film is loosely based on a Marvel comic character, apart from the title and character Howard the Duck it's nothing like the comic since they was a little more darker and satirical. The film Howard the Duck is just a cheesy 80's flick, one difference is that the character of Beverly Switzler in the film is a singer in a rock band while in the comic book she wasn't. An interesting thing about this movie is that Gerorge Lucas (Creator of Star Wars and Indiana Jones) was executive producers of this movie and actually expected this to be a box office hit, the reason was because he spent a lot of money on the Skywalker Ranch and needed this film to be a hit to regain some of his cash. Howard the Duck however was a box office flop, it's gross was under the budget for the film. One funny thing is that the Howard the Duck costume cost $2 million to make and needed eight people to use it, that's a lot compared to the size of the costume but CGI wasn't around during the 80's so having a guy in a suit was the only possibly solution, stop motion is another effect they used for the Dark Overlord. The stop motion effects are actual effective for the character and makes it look more menacing in parts. Howard the Duck does have some really cheesy lines and scenes, some of the acting in this movie is pretty campy. The end scene with the theme song is one campy and silly part in the movie but I guess that's what gives this film such an appeal because it's entertainingly cheesy. Howard the Duck is a classic cheesy 80's flick that should be seen especially if your looking for a laugh. Check this out. 10/10",Howard the Duck
75,rdoyle29,Wretched garbage,3,31 July 2016,"This is a terrible movie on multiple levels. It's an awful adaptation of the source material, completely missing the satirical tone that made the comic book so much fun to read. It can't even settle on it's own tone. It seemingly wants to replace the adult atmosphere of the source with a kid-friendly tone, but then there's Lea Thompson in sheer underwear threatening to have sex with a duck. (I'm not complaining about the former, but the latter sure adds a sour taste to the proceedings.) Seemingly completely unaware of what it wants to be, it substitutes terrible overacting and loud effects laden action for entertainment. Absolutely wretched.",Howard the Duck

78,rlcsljo,Expectations for this movie were too high,8,26 March 2000,"Because a lot of talented people and money were behind this film, I believe that people rated this movie against their expectations and not against other movies.   When this movie is compared to other movies of its ilk it is very good!    I saw this movie only knowing that G. Lucas (he needs a nick name--the great god of SFX?) was behind it, not knowing that some of the other talent had appeared in much better/ tonier fare) and I was thoroughly delighted--viewing after viewing.  Lea (was she chosen because of her similarity to Leaia?) did about as good of a job as anyone can when your romantic lead is a duck.  Her trademark short skirt and legs did a lot to help.  The other actors seemed to be having fun with their roles as well-- and that is what this movie was supposed to be about fun.  Ever since Entertainment Tonight began pushing box office results as an indicator of quality, this has virtually become the only criteria of quality--but dont be fooled!  What the public spends its money on does not always a good movie make(and vice versa).  Ignore the tyrants of the dollars, spend a couple on Howard and you will be more than rewarded!",Howard the Duck
79,RiffRaffMcKinley,"In the beginning, there was Howard the Duck!",10,11 April 2008,"There is no longer any point to bash this movie. If only people could take it as a comedy and as a fantasy (rather than a political statement!), they'd realize what a work of genius it is. Howard is a beer-swilling, cigar-chomping waterfowl from another planet who gets transported to Earth, befriends a struggling rocker (Lea Thompson, who gives the best performance of her career, I kid you not), and finds enmity in the form of an evil Dark Overlord.When it was released (and every day since then), ""HTD"" acquired a strong build-up of loathing from critics and viewers everywhere. Most people jumped on its cheesy one-liners, bad visual effects, numerous bestiality gags (those are pretty bewildering, I'll admit), and probably an early scene in which a female duck in a bathtub is shown with eerily bizarre anthropomorphic bosoms. But those (except, again, the last two) are the reasons why the film is so great.Nobody laughs at a master of Quack Fu! Desperate ducks commit desperate acts! What's white, ovoid, and reminds me of my birthday?- The eggs! ""Ducky"" also has a fantastic soundtrack, both in John Barry's score and the Thomas Dolby-produced original songs (both ""Hunger City"" and ""Howard the Duck"" have to be two of the best movie songs of all time). And the visual effects at least look semi-realistic-- or they would, if such things were physically possible. Today's technical FX wizards have but to punch computer buttons and things just appear for them; I appreciate the fact that these people put in some real effort.Unfortunately, it was quite clear that these people *couldn't* make it in Hunger City, and the film will never find its niche. But as far as Lucasfilm movies go, it's better than most of the Star Wars movies and every horrid second of ""THX 1138."" It's even better than ""Willow""! So check it out.",Howard the Duck

82,squeezebox,The Worst Movie Ever Made?,1,16 September 2005,"I've often pondered what is the worst movie of all time. It's easy to point at low budget disasters like CAT WOMEN OF THE MOON and TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE, but those movies did what they could with no money and no talent. The fact that they were made at all is something of an achievement.To really be fair, one has to take into consideration the budget and the talent involved to truly interpret just how bad a movie is. With this criteria in mind, I continually come back to HOWARD THE DUCK. Until I can be convinced otherwise, I have come to the conclusion that this pile of hippopotamus vomit is THE worst movie EVER.In fact, HOWARD THE DUCK is so godawful, it almost seems intentionally so. Not like ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES, which was a good-natured parody of bad B-movies, but more as a ""f*** you"" to the audience. I have no idea what producer George Lucas or anyone else involved in this movie could have been so enraged about in order to feel the need to unleash this form of torture on the public, but it must have really hit a nerve.The movie looks great. It's well-shot and the special effects (especially toward the end) are terrific; from a technical standpoint, there's not a lot to complain about. Even the actors seem to be genuinely trying their best to please, so the blame can't be laid at their feet either. Who, then, can we point at for this abomination? The obvious party is George Lucas himself. He had everything in 1986. Several blockbusters under his belt, his own independent multi-million dollar production company and an entire staff of effects artists at his fingertips, ready to bring anything that popped into his head to life. Maybe his ego got too big too fast, and he thought he could pull off this ill-advised project. Maybe he thought anything with the Lucasfilm logo on it automatically turned to gold. Boy was he ever wrong. He must have known so, as his name doesn't appear ANYWHERE in the on screen credits of the movie. Even ""Lucasfilm"" is buried inconspicuously in the end credits.But the real culprits are the writer-producer-director team of Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz. After writing a serviceable-at-best screenplay for INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, their buddy Lucas gave them Carte Blanche to create a mega-epic to end all others. It didn't quite work out that way.The screenplay is mind-bogglingly awful. Even worse, Huyck and Katz seem to think their dialog and characters are really funny and quirky, which only causes the script to get more and more awful as it lumbers along. Add to that Huyck's clueless direction and Katz's overblown production and you've got a movie for which there are not enough derogatory words.I can sum up HOWARD THE DUCK using ten such words: STUPID, POINTLESS, OBNOXIOUS, DULL, EXCESSIVE, ANNOYING, INSULTING, INEPT, REPUGNANT and DISASTROUS. And those are just off the top of my head.Unless you want to feel the overwhelming urge to kick in your TV screen, never, NEVER watch HOWARD THE DUCK.",Howard the Duck
83,deepfrieddodo,Chaotic,5,27 August 2021,"Infamous as the film that nearly ruined George Lucas, Howard the Duck is also one of the most chaotic films every created. Oddly enough, for the first half of the film, although clearly not a good film, isn't all that bad. The plot is instant, the characters are likeable, and it's properly funny at times, especially watching a duck toe the line between a film rated 12 and all the adult scenarios he's on the threshold of. Saying that, within 5 minutes you witness a duck with human breasts having a bath, so any impressions that this film would have any sanity involved were gone from the beginning.Then it hits the midpoint, and the Dark Overlord is introduced, and everything goes downhill pretty fast. Mostly hindered by the awful special effects - which there isn't much excuse for, the original Star Wars trilogy had come before this without this blemish - the villain of the film is just a little too tacky on top of what was already a ridiculous film. Decisions to incorporate stop-animation for the climactic scene are mind-blowing, and chaos really does ensue.It's known as one of the worst films ever made, but it's a good, bad film. It's still enjoyable, and everything captured within it, particularly the fashion and music, are classic 80s. What starts off as semi-promising leaves an audience dumbfounded, and that's what gives it a cult following. It must be seen to be believed.",Howard the Duck

I mean, it was a kid's movie, right? I only saw it once back then, and decided to be quite nostalgic sometime ago and popped in the DVD to watch it again.Boy, big mistake! Originally I didn't pick up on how detestable and annoying Howard actually was, and that he looked freakishly messed up with sub-par visual effects! Nor did I pick up on the terrible special effects overall, and the overuse of 80s fashion to the extreme. But worse still, the awkward and inappropriate spark between Howard and Lea Thompson- churned out with crappy dialogue and a duck-sized condom to boot! Could it get any worse? I remembered cliché bad guy in Jeffrey Jones being in the movie (who is actually quite decent even with the 'voice'), but had no idea that Tim Robbins was in this disaster, as a nerdy scientist before his claim to fame. His performance is embarrassing, but I still wanted him to pull out a gun and shoot the heck out of Howard!

In other words, recycling other people's opinions.Me, i personally loved HtD when it came out (and i saw it in the theater); Sure, i was young, and totally OK with a talking duck, but then again this was the 80s and people who hate on this film turn around and praise such hit shows as Alf, Manimal, Starman, Knight Rider, and more, all of which were a hit because of the general consensus. So my take on HtD is that it's the trend to hate on it, just like its the trend to love the A-team; i mean, they make tanks out of broken bottles and never hit anyone with that hail of gunfire, but it's great, right?Howard The Duck is the story of your average, office-life duck who finds himself captured by a sort of tractor beam and deposited on earth (the place where ducks don't work in offices).Here on our planet, he undergoes the obligatory scientific examination a-la Keanu Reeves in TDTESS, but pulls out of it with some rude city language. From here on, its a classic 80s adventure film. He even gets the girl, or rather, talks too bold but can't back it up and ultimately gets embarrassed and (lol) chickens out. Classic scene, if you ask me.Then, there is the once again obligatory bad guy, the Supreme Overlord who, as his name implies, is really badass. Some pretty decent puppet monsters later, there is a big explosion and the heroes win the day.The whole shtick is peppered with mild, 80s-political correctness jokes (this was the era when the FCC ruled the airwaves), the same uninspired direction that nobody complained about in Ghostbusters, the same photography nobody complained about in 48 Hours, and the same puppettry that every film with an alien had back then.I don't think Howard The Duck is an amazing film; but it has a good looking chick, an easily offended duck, kung.. pardon me .. quack-fu, a killed theme tune, a joke or two, a story which makes more sense than highlander 2, a plot which actually starts, proceeds and ends (unlike, idk, Contact, for example), and a totally badass bad guy, with the best name a bad guy has ever had.My final vote: (realistic) 6/10, or 7/10 if you have never seen it.",Howard the Duck
89,michael_the_nermal,Grossly Underrated Comedy Classic,7,18 July 2010,"This movie is most famous for bombing in the box office; it has, with the exception of ""Ishtar' and ""Pluto Nash"", the dubious distinction of being the most infamous movie bomb of all time. Yes, it probably wasn't the best idea to take a fairly unknown underground comic book and water it down for mass consumption. The result, however, is still fairly entertaining and campy, and is buttressed by the brilliant acting of one Jeffrey Jones, who is---and I say this without any facetiousness or sarcasm whatsoever---one of the most talented and underrated actors Hollywood has produced.Do not take ""Howard's"" humor at face value. The script is deliberately cheesy and campy. From the moment we see Howard's home world to Tim Robbins's explanation of ""duck evolution"" to Lea Thompson's budding romance with Howard D. Duck, we are shown the absolute goofiest stuff ever put on celluloid. Yeah, Howard has terrible one-liners, but they're purposefully groan-inducing, in the ""so bad they're good"" category. The viewer simply cannot take ""Howard"" seriously; it's meant to be just a fun movie. Many recent comedies try to take their messages seriously, and this is where they fail: they forsake comedy for some social message or theme they try to beat the audience over the head with. On the other extreme, they forsake any pretense to clever or tongue-in-cheek script-writing in favor of fart jokes or other forms of toilet humor; or they make references to the latest fads in popular culture (watch ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" to see what I mean). ""Howard"" is funny because of it does not rely on toilet humor and because it does not beat the audience over the head with a message, other than ""love is blind (between a human woman and a duck-man)"" or ""curiousity killed the duck."" The movie doesn't really take off until we see Jeffrey Jones possessed by the Dark Overlord of the Universe. Why Jeff didn't win an Oscar for this role is beyond me. The Dark Overlord was a more complex and funny role than the principal in ""Ferris Bueller."" Try growling and speaking with a Cobra Commander-like raspy voice for a prolonged period of time, while scowling at yourself in the mirror, and see if you can criticize Jeff then. The Dark Overlord's quest to satisfy his lust for power (both in the sense of lording over others and in refueling his body) is some of the best entertainment I've seen. Try thinking of the Dark Overlord scenes simply as entertainment rather than acting in a movie, and you'll enjoy it more, trust me.In short: Tim Robbins does a cheesy Donald Duck impression, Jeffrey Jones sounds mighty scary in a Starscream-like voice, the Howard D. Duck voice-over guy makes lame puns about ducks, and Lea Thompson is credible as a beautiful punk-rock goddess who falls for our feathered friend Howard.

90,Der_Schnibbler,I loved this movie!,7,25 June 2007,"Sure, ""Howard the Duck"" can be ridiculous at parts, but not quite as ridiculous as someone who comments that the film was ""so terribly bad that I have been brought to tears crying at simply recalling scenes from this flick."" Some people need to grow up.Speaking of growing up, I haven't seen this film since I was an adolescent. Nearly twenty years later, I finally found it again and sat down with great excitement to see this ""awesome film"" that I remembered having watched countless of times while young.So, did I have the typically disappointing experience that usually accompanies such a visit to the past? Yes and no.Perhaps my view of the film is still coloured by the fact that I loved it as a child, but I will try to be as objective as possible. I will skip the plot, since it has been said here so many times already.What struck me the most about the film when watching it as a jaded adult were a few things.First of all, the whole sexual innuendo between Howard and Beverly happens incredibly fast. So quickly, in fact, that its already built-in silliness treads on incredulity. Funny how I found that a perfectly reasonable progression as a kid. But hey, what did I know about women back then! The second thing is that the film feels as if it's really two films put together, but the real problem with that is really the way the two halves are partitioned. The first half is relatively quiet, interesting, and very well paced (aside from the ""romance"" part). We are interested in finding out what will happen to Howard, and how he will return home. Then, out of nowhere, the film switches to a painfully long chase scene. If you thought the wisecracks in the first half were silly, wait till you see the second half.Speaking of wisecracks, the entire diner scene really tests ones nerves. I don't know whose idea it was to include some lame ""joke"" in every other line, but it got very annoying.Finally, in the end, there were some... um.. special effects.. involving a monster. I must admit here: this was the most shocking thing for me, both as a child and as an adult, though for entirely different reasons. As a kid, I found the thing scary, man. When I watched it yesterday, I nearly chuckled. What a shame, really, as even by 1980s special effects technology, there is really no excuse for this. Still, it does what its supposed to do.I do not understand why every know-it-all wannabe Hollywood lackey wants to blast this endearing film as if it were ""Armageddon."" I saw significance in Howard's resemblance to us. The scene in the diner in particular took on a very new light for me with this latest viewing, one that showed humans as brutal, unthinking animals. Of course, that is not to say a film this silly hides some kind of earth-shattering reflection on the human condition. It's just fun! In conclusion, then, we have a funny, corny 80s movie about a duck who comes to save us, with the second half's chase scene becoming slightly tedious, and a great ending. It's endearing, it is heart-warming, and it's also ""dumb."" That doesn't make it any worse than a host of other ridiculous films from the 80s: the unbearable idiocy of ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" the mindlessness of ""Armageddon"" (which should really be used as an IQ test - the more you laugh, the stupider you are), or anything where Will Smith tries to act cool. Every Will Smith film, in other words. And let's not mention the slew of typically perverted Hollywood spewage concerning teens, parties with teens, and teens on trips through Europe. Throw in the deviancy and face-in-the-mud scum-filled ""comedy"" of the majority of Adam Sandler movies, and you'd be hard pressed to vilify a film as lovely and harmless as ""Howard the Duck."" Of course, stooping so low as ridiculing ""Howard the Duck"" is pathetic enough, but what is even more amusing is those who attempt a scornful laugh at it. I guess some people are desperate for self-elevation.""Howard the Duck"" is a great film to watch with family or friends, when you are in the mood for something lighthearted and fun.Recommended!",Howard the Duck

Some not-good acting, cheesy, corny dialogue and jokes that become old very fast, some aged visuals, (Although the appearance of the villain at the end was pretty impressive for the time) and all of the characters including Howard become pretty annoying by the end of the film.I can definitely see how this could be some peoples ""guilty pleasure"" movie though.

He destroys the dark lord and sends his pals back at a horrible price. He now is to remain on Earth.Along with a few laughs we also have a few words and some sexual tendencies. So this isn't for young children. More or less for children that are 11 and up.",Howard the Duck
94,anthonyf94,Howard the boring,5,21 October 2019,"Between sci-fi, noir and comedy, ""Howard e il destino del mondo"" has not to much to do with superheroes' movies. It is quite an effort to make the spectators laugh with continuous sketches that arrive too statically and too frequent to be appreciated. The adventure part is based on the fight with a creature that took scientist's body, but, beyond a poor animation, there's not, moreover, a real definition of characters that can make you empathize with one of them or simply think about psychological strengths that would have to be showed. What save a little this movie are the 80s ambientation that nowadays is interesting, the difference with modern Marvel movies and the fact that has become a kind of cult for entertaining eighties b-movies. Adviced just for collection.",Howard the Duck
95,jamhorner,Pretty Good Duck Movie,4,11 July 2007,"I remember when this movie came out. I only wanted to see it because my friends told me that there would be a naked duck in it and I was convinced. Needless to say there was, but for a brief moment. The movie, though frowned upon, was actually pretty good. The acting wasn't top notch, nor was it bad and the whole concept was wacky and entertaining. I liked some of the sarcastic comments that Howard made and I like some of the reactions people had to his being.Jeffery Jones, after being taken over by an alien, was funny and convincing. The special effects were okay and the Lea Thomson was pretty good a struggling female rocker. Tim Robbins was great as a geeky scientist who was in love with Beverley.But the downsides are, it may have been to soon for a not yet ready public. The design on Howard was a little poor and the monster at the end was a let down, after it was built up for the entire movie. The climatic battle was sort of predictable and the end concert scene was corny and cheesy.",Howard the Duck
96,moviemattb,"It may be bad, but I really enjoy it",8,14 August 2014,"After reviewing ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" you may want to know what do I think of the original ""Howard the Duck"" from 1986. When I first saw this movie on TV, I hated it and feel bad for Lea Thompson and George Lucas who happens to be one of my favorite filmmakers gets to be an executive producer of this movie. As time went by, I gave this movie another look on Netflix and I started to laugh at for some reason. After watching it, I thought the movie wasn't that bad, but its by no means a good movie and I do see other movies that are very much worse than ""Howard the Duck."" I did have a fun time watching this movie by making fun of it. For me, this is one of those movies that I has to be seen to be believe that no one like George Lucas would get involved in this, and get his friends that worked with him on his second feature film ""American Graffiti."" Willard Huyck co-wrote and directed the movie, while his wife Gloria Katz produces and co-write it. The movie is based on a Marvel comic book that was created by Steve Gerber, and it was Marvel's first movie; everything about this movie does have some weird elements like a female duck in a bathtub showing off her breast, which it is not real nudity and you have a condom that happens to be in Howard's wallet along with Thompson's character trying to make out with Howard in bed. Everyone who have seen this movie cannot make up their minds if this movie is intended for kids or adults. I have read some of the comics, and to me as I agree with Thompson's comment about the movie that comics were very much for adults (No I don't mean showing nudity or anything like that I mean for its own kind of bizarre type of humor). Parents that have bought this movie on VHS OR DVD are going to think that this is a kids movie, which it is not because no one is familiar with ""Howard the Duck"" because they have never read the comics; it is rated PG but I think it should have been either R or PG-13. With that said, I thought Lea Thompson has done a great job for her role a Beverly Switzler, and for also doing most of her signing work. Jeffery Jones is over the top, but seems to be having for playing the villain as the Dark Overlord of the Universe. Tim Robbins in this movie was just pretty much overacting, but I have gotten used to him. The special effects by ILM was not really that bad because I have seen movies that have bad special effects. The duck suit itself that everyone keeps talking about looks fake; to me, I thought it looked okay, and I thought the special effects team and the rest of the film crew did tried to put their best effort to bring Howard come to life in live-action form instead of an animated feature as what they originally were going for (It was Universal's idea for live action, watch the features on the special edition DVD's extra feature). They can't used CGI because this movie was made in the 80s, and there is nothing more that you can expect. Of course, the animatronics would have been better if they took it to Stan Winston or Jim Henson for creating the duck suit or this movie could have been made years later so they would make Howard CG, which it would have made a better movie. Speaking of the duck suit, I thought the stop motion animation for the Dark Overlord looks kind of cool, and Phil Tippet does a fine job with the look of the Dark Overlord. Of course, it may look cheesy but I think it does add a charm to it by just providing a ""B"" movie feel. The music by John Barry was very good, and I think the songs by Thomas Dolby were also good too. My favorites are ""Hunger City;"" ""Don't Turn Away"" (Both Dolby's and Thompson's); and the ""Howard the Duck"" theme. The movie doesn't feel boring, but I do think the pacing of this movie goes by pretty well. Overall, it may be bad, but I really enjoy it. ""Howard the Duck"" really deserves to be seen, and it depends on whether you think this movie is either underrated or just so bad its really good. If you think this movie stinks, so be it. For me, I enjoy watching this movie on how bad it is and really am going to have fun time as I just turn off my brain for some entertainment. Mindless entertainment as what I mean. I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",Howard the Duck

100,benxrichardson,Impressively Bad,2,5 November 2021,How a big budget George Lucas film managed to get everything wrong is beyond me.Why did they make Tim Robbins act like Pee Wee Herman? He is so much better than that.The Duck costume has no facial movements so it displays no emotion. Combining that with the bland voice actor and it makes the character completely lifeless.The almost sex scene between the Duck and Lea Thompson is just off the charts wrong.I'm glad I finally sat down to watch this train wreck of a film. It will make me look at the world in a different way from now on.,Howard the Duck
101,Sic Coyote,Why does everyone slate this movie? Maybe they need to lighten up.,8,20 November 1999,"Everyone seems to slate this movie and say it's crud, except the people on here not understanding why people slate it. I can't understand why, I watched this when I was young and I loved it it's a great sci fi adventure movie in the same kind of vein as flight of the navigator. The music I think its great, but then I am a bit of an eightiesphile the costumes are great with a very good looking duck and with Dr Jenning turning into the dark overlord it's great! And the special effects are totally awesome, for that time the Dark overlord is one of the coolest stop motion animated monsters I've ever seen in a movie he looks cool he movies cool he sounds cool, he is just cool! The ending was brilliant! a great face off between good and evil kind of similar to Transformers The Movie, but instead of a matrix of leadership he has a big flip off laser blaster. And it's funny, if a little far fetched all the way through! the whole movie is a really enjoyable rollercoaster of a movie that just keeps you going along with it with great action scenes and then a big grand finale! I must have watched this movie a hundred times as a kid and I wish it would come out o dvd so I could get a good widescreen copy with the footage in it that was cut from it in the UK to get a PG like the scene with the claw and the cigarette lighter. Fantastic, even though it bombed! 8/10",Howard the Duck
102,the_mysteriousx,Sympathy for the Duck,5,10 April 2010,"Having not seen this film for about 23 years, I feel a need to say something about this unfairly notorious film. All I remembered was how hot Lea Thompson and her trendy hair were at the time and the talking duck. Well, HOWARD THE DUCK is no classic but definitely worth the time for people who like unusual and original ideas. It's quirky, odd and a true amalgamation of ideas that equally work and don't work. And Lea Thompson still looks hot, though her hair in this film was truly a 1986 thing.Having just viewed the DVD, I must say I have to hand it to the technical work on the film. For 1986, the animatronic duck looks as good as anything done up till that time. The actor inside the duck did a good job of hitting his marks and the bill and the eyes were skillfully done. It's just that there isn't a great appeal to this character to begin with. He's basically a middle class guy with an attitude on his duck planet and comes off just like that type of person from our planet. They could have either gone farther with his attitude and dirty talk or totally backed off and made it more child-friendly.The same goes for the bizarre match of music. If film songs could tell you the exact style that was in for the mid-eighties, this film reeks of it. Unfortunately the songs are all mediocre and they are blended with a wonderful, but completely out-of-place John Barry score. Barry's scores on the James Bond films were great and he had a level of sophistication and adventure that few composers had then. His love theme in HOWARD THE DUCK is simply touching. Considering the subject manner, in retrospect Danny Elfman would have been a far better choice for the score (heck, his band Oingo Boingo could have done a few songs as well).The Production Design also needs to be commended - this is really a 'B' film made with 'A' money. The special effects are mostly good. The scene where Jeffrey Jones is in the diner is perfect for the time period, but the creature version of the Dark Overlord at the end is lit incorrectly and doesn't match the rest of the real background. You can tell all of the actors worked hard. Lea Thompson did her own singing and always has a nice sensitive side. Jones is great in what amounts to two roles - the competent scientist and the Dark Overlord. And a young Tim Robbins really chews up the scenery and you can see how much talent this guy really has playing a geeky and silly character - a character we would no longer see from him in future films.The most interesting thing to me looking back now is it really says a lot about the time it was made and yet it was rejected by the people in that time. I think the duck's condom and the ""love"" scenes definitely made people uncomfortable for a PG film. The idea of following a duck-man around for two hours in a sci-fi/noir also seems so contrived that it took a huge risk thinking millions of ticket buyers will latch onto it. The film seems to have basically ended the careers of Director/Writer Willard Hyuck and writer Gloria Katz that they have no other big credits after this. Lea Thompson, who was the star, was unable to rise higher despite having a still successful career. Jones, having come off AMADEUS and FERRIS BUELLER wasn't totally knocked down by it, and Tim Robbins actually was lucky he was unknown and a few years later got BULL DURHAM and carved a new path for himself.HOWARD THE DUCK is a true time capsule of a film. It is entertaining, it has a heart and it isn't like any other movie you'll see from 1986. If you appreciate good, hard film-work and can forgive the weak story and the not-completely realized concept, it's quite a curious time period piece now. And, on a side note, I have to wonder what Tim Burton could have done with this at that time as it was between his wonderfully imaginative PEE WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE and the visually stunning BEETLEJUICE.",Howard the Duck
103,Jsimpson5,"If you have read the comic book, then avoid this.",5,19 May 2007,"If you have asked someone who has watched the movie Howard the Duck, the answer that you will get one will be similar to these items listed below:1. That film was horrible. 2. Worst film of the 80's. 3. The comic book was better than the movie.It's almost impossible to find Howard the Duck in stores, mainly because it was released on VHS, and any DVD version of it you find, is a HK (Hong Kong) version which has VHS quality. One day when I was looking at free movies on my cable provider. I saw that Howard the Duck was on there for watching. So later that night I selected Howard the Duck, and enjoyed the film. If you have read the comic book, then you will probably hate this film, as most people who hated the film read the comic book. Basically this film is about Howard the Duck who comes to Earth by accident from a world that is very similar to Earth, however ducks evolved instead of people. Now Howard must find a way back to his planet, while trying to survive on Earth. For the most part the cast was well chosen, and everybody did their job to play their parts to the best of their ability. What got me was the script. The script was bad as times and they way the script was written most of Howard lines are some the worst lines in the film. Some of the lines are just corny which is okay, but some are just outright bad. The special effect are pretty good considering that this film was made in the 80's. The best characters in this film in my opinion would be Beverly and Dr. Walter Jenning. The only part of the film that really made me a little unhappy was the Beverly and Howard scene where Beverly in her bra and panties and is close to hinting seduction to Howard. Now from my research in the comic books is is hinted that Howard and Beverly do have a sexual relationship. The film decided not to make it outright that do have this type of relationship or don't but make it so that it not quite right. If you like bad films and have not read the comic book, then you will probably enjoy this film. If you have read the comic book then ignore this film, you will most likely hate it.",Howard the Duck
104,brower8,A humorless mess,2,20 November 2003,"This may not have been the worst movie that I ever saw in whole or in part, but it's close (Inchon!). Supposedly it's a comedy about a hapless alien, but it's hard to feel any empathy for a wise-cracking critter. This is Donald Duck with an unsavory attitude, E.T. without charm. One laughs at Howard, not with him. It's the diametric opposite of Charlie Chaplin's ""Tramp"" character, who is at least better than his environment and attracts our empathy for it. The movie makers could have learned a few things from Charlie Chaplin's ""Tramp"" character, who is ordinarily a hapless fellow in the wrong place at the wrong time. Good movie-making is, above all else, good story-telling, and if there is any element of adventure, one must have cause to cheer on some hero. That's why the Indiana Jones and original Star Wars trilogies succeed and this one fails miserably. It's best watched in bits and pieces, and probably best appreciated drunk, on drugs, or with a low IQ, if at all. The human characters put together a maudlin story of witless stereotypes. I'll give this a ""2"" so that a ""1"" can apply to something not only bad but extremely offensive or even harmful (Tell Your Children, a/k/a Reefer Madness).",Howard the Duck
105,anchoreddown,"Please, please, please, send me to the Oscars!",7,21 March 2009,"There is something childish about this movie that seems to keep it on a level that isn't off the top! Howard The Duck probably should have been the next big hit right after Lucas' third Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. However since it bombed in the box office it got shelved and was considered a B-Movie of the 80s that nobody wanted to see. What's screaming at me are all these amazing special effects that wouldn't be in a B-Movie because those films just don't have that kind of production money. As an 80s film, Howard The Duck fit right into the mainstream of the rock and roll genre with big hairdos and razzy outfits on the stage. Seems like the controlled part of the storyline is Howard. Much of the effects are done in the same fashion as Ghostbusters with the diner with furnature being shoved around, plates and cups flying off tables or breaking suddenly. That section of film is probably the biggest part of the show aside from the climax. Jeffrey Jones that everybody knows and loves from Ferris Beuller's Day Off does an amazing performance with the doctor and the villain roles switching out. He's something you can't take your eyes off of because you don't know what's going to happen next with this character. Overall I'd say it could have used some improvement, but not much because there's already enough storyline to work off of. And since the recent release of this film on DVD, I can't help but say this, especially since the ten year anniversary is here for a certain insurance company icon - AFLAC!",Howard the Duck

It's dull, it's unimaginative, it's totally unconvincing and furthermore, it has no real qualities that would allow it to be marketed as a film for children, with many violent bar fights and lots of innuendos to adult humour. Howard the Duck himself looks like a Gerry Anderson Puppet, but at least Gerry Anderson kept his puppets in the model world. Apart from that, he is loudmouthed and overly sarcastic with the worst run of one liner's since Mr Freeze in Batman and Robin. Also, the idea of normal people being horribly killed and mutated into aliens seems rather dark as well, and I wouldn't expect something of that calibre to be in a kids film, but more something with at least a 12 Rating, it's just a lame and silly film that really isn't fun to watch.",Howard the Duck

The special effects are just unconvincing and not vivid, you clearly see its animitronics and puppets and stop motion effects(which is horrible, because I love the art of stop motion). The duck wordplay is just downright unfunny and simple, and it's just to make a new song you will purchase on iTunes(iTunes wasn't alive back then, but still, it's just marketing).

110,ARTaylor,Must See To Believe,5,21 August 2011,"Howard the Duck is one of those movies that everyone should see at least once. There are no words that can describe it. It certainly is a spectacle in what missteps a movie can make.The movie is adapted from the Marvel Comics character. The movie version is almost nothing like the comics. One of the things about any adaptation is, at the very least, it should remain true to the spirit of the source. Comic Howard is rude and crude, his stories are usually social satires, and is often aware of the truth of his existence. Movie Howard is none of these things. There are rare glimpses at a more faithful Howard but the movie fails to go anywhere with them.One then has to wonder why Howard was chosen for a movie. This was back in the day when only Superman and Swamp Thing graced the screen. Long before Batman, X-Men, or Spider-Man. Howard was hardly a well-known property, sure he had a following but nothing big. If this was to adapt a comic book, why choose such a relatively obscure character? If this was a pet project, why so little faithfulness? Certainly, George Lucas could have used his Star Wars developed technology to make an interesting early X-Men or Fantastic Four film.Derived from Howard's characterization, the tone of the movie is not at all consistent. It's rated PG, though I'm not sure why. The movie goes between silly kid stuff to more adult fare. They try to have some more R stuff like drugs, alcohol, a near-sex scene, and some puppet nudity. But then they seem to water the movie down so much to keep a PG, as if they were just looking to get the Star Wars crowd to come. PG-13 had already been used so why not go for that middle ground?The best part of the movie is the visual effects. Howard's puppet is quite effective. In this day and age, CGI can do anything and everything but even the best creatures look like they were made in a computer. I always find it refreshing to watch an older movie and see some practical creature effects like Chewbacca, Jabba the Hutt, or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. Seeing a Howard that actually exist in the world he's supposed to be in looks good. Plus, the stop motion at the end actually works for the whole alternate universe Dark Overlord thing since that was really not supposed to fit in. But that's about it for the good.The acting can be viewed as either over-the-top campy or simply uninspired. The only standout is Chip Zien as the voice of Howard. He's the only one really trying, even if he isn't given much to work with. There's a reason Lea Thompson hasn't been popular outside of Back to the Future, and this shows why. She's mostly going through the motions. Jeffrey Jones and Tim Robbins are both so over the top to the point of making fun of themselves. The story is nothing interesting. Again, given the source you'd think it would be more interesting. It's your typical fish, or duck if you will, out of water story. Except that he and the world adjust to each other a little too quickly. The love story between Howard and Beverly is weak at best. And every scene with the Dark Overlord seems like you need some drugs in your system to fully appreciate. If anything, it's just an example of the over-the-top goofiness we got from many 80s movies.If you think about the movie, you won't enjoy it. There's simply too many problems with it. As a whole, it may just be campy enough to enjoy. Is it one of the worst movies ever made? Certainly not, there are far worse movies out there. Is it the worst comic book movie? Perhaps, but in today's age it's got competition from Jonah Hex and Fantastic Four.Watch it and see for yourself. Cause there is really no way anyone can describe it to you. It is either slightly greater than the sum of its parts, or a complete mess.",Howard the Duck
111,clh-1,"I Love this Movie, I Really Do.",8,27 April 2021,"In my entire, comic book reading life, I have read exactly one comic featuring Howard the Duck. And he teamed up with Spider-Man in that story, so it probably wasn't that indicative of the stories centered on the titular water fowl.But taken on its own, the film is a LOT of fun. Even things that are ""bad"", have enough charm to carry them through to the next good part.To begin with, both the Duckworld and Cleveland set scenes are a perfect skewering of 1980s pop culture. The duck-centric jokes are puns centered around ducks and birds. Those set on Earth are a send up of hair bands and 80s pop music.The special effects are, for their day, actually pretty decent. The animatronics and stop-motion puppetry hold up well, but the optical composite shots are a tad weak.For a ridiculous premise, the cast are all acquitting themselves very well; they mostly inhabit that sweet spot between taking themselves far too seriously and playing it so broadly and making the film devolve into camp. Particular praise must go to Chip Zien perfectly matching his vocal performance as Howard to various suit performers (primarily Ed Gale), which comes together to seemlessly create a single character. And even greater praise must go to Lea Thompson as Beverly Switzler, she absolutely carries the film as the human point of view character, she also did her own singing and it's excellent.Following on from Lea Thompson's great singing is that the film has an awesome soundtrack. The score by John Barry and Sylvester Levay matches the emotion of each scene perfectly, and the pop songs penned by Thomas Dolby and performed by Lea Thompson and her in-film band Cherry Bomb are some serious toe-tappers.Even for being ""infamously bad"", the film really is an enjoyable romp. It's the kind of movie that is just fun to watch, and even more fun if the viewer is of age and partaking of an adult beverage. So just let loose and have a good time.",Howard the Duck
112,phantasmda,What's all the fuss about?,10,5 June 2008,"I've personally just watched this movie for the first time, I was lent a copy by a friend after I spied it in his DVD collection. I was instantly intrigued, I mean, a movie with George Lucas's name attached called Howard THE DUCK??? I just had to see it. Before I put it on I have had a glance at the IMDb boards and found that this was a very expensive film that bombed miserably at the box office and has been panned to death by critics and buffs alike. Why???I just finished watching it and I thought it was great, no masterpiece by any means but it gave out exactly what it promised. For all you people who hate this movie, you didn't really expect Gone with the wind or The sound of music from a film about a talking alien duck did you?Sure it was cheesy as hell, and some of the jokes were just terrible but the charm it oozes comes at you in bucket loads. The movie is over 20 years old and yet some of the special effects are better than in some of the dross out nowadays, and are definitely better than most movies out in the 80's. The humour is hit and miss at times but I thought it far funnier than anything the likes of Adam Sandler has done to date. The big no no for me was the music which I have to admit was really pants. Not so much the songs the band play during the film but the actual score itself. But that's just a minor gripe.Tim Robbins was so over the top and Jeffrey Jones was a hoot, so c'mon people, it's a kids movie about a talking duck. On that score it delivers on every level. 3.9 is mega harsh a score in my book so I've given it a 10 (not that it will make that much difference) my honest score would be a solid 7.Amusing, cheesy, plenty of fun action, decent effects for the time, ridiculously over the top and packed to the hilt with an 80's nostalgic feel, I'm sorry but I have to say it is a very good movie for what it is. Far better than I was expecting from the comments I've read.",Howard the Duck
113,dmc102,Many Call it a Legendary but Undeserved Flop. I Call it a Classic.,10,20 August 2004,"D: Willard Huyck. Lea Thompson; Jeffrey Jones; Chip Zien; Ed Gale. Wildly enjoyable Sci-Fi Fantasy in which `Howard T. Duck' is mysteriously transported from his home in Duckworld and dropped into a rough community in Cleveland. Based on the Marvel comics series by Steve Gerber, Writer/Producers Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz teamed up with Star Wars legend George Lucas to adapt the wacky character to the big screen. A film that is widely remembered for being one of the all time great flops at the box office (it cost upwards of $35,000,000 to produce and took in around $16,000,000 U.S), it should be remembered as a pioneering effort in the field of Mechanical Effects, Stop Motion Animation (done by Phil Tippet) and `Super Light' Visuals (done by Joe Johnston). The lead character in the film, Howard, is created using a midget (successful actor/stunt performer Ed Gale) in a highly complex mechanical suit (which cost $2,000,000) and really must be seen to be believed. However, the film's chief problem appears to be that it is not aimed at children, to be honest it really isn't suitable for kids. This is not a children's film, and this is possibly the reason why it did not succeed. But for all comic book movie fans, seek out this rarity and enjoy it. Do not let this classic die, and pray for a DVD release. Highly recommended! Willard Huyck's final directorial effort to date.",Howard the Duck
114,lerkim,For Kids This Movie Will Rock And Stay In The Hearts Forever,9,10 April 2006,"I thought i wanted to update my little comment of this movie...!!!When George Lucas made this movies his intentions were to show a movie not deemed worthy of anything, as it came out people fastly decided to hate the movie, it was just too unrealistic and too weird, now 20 years later it is in many's minds, i guess i know why nobody liked it back then.Story 8/10 Well you have a duck who drops down from his planet to earth and of course the story here is that a scientific problem happened and now he has to save the whole planet, the story isn't really that special, but the persons and the way it flows actually can pull you in. Of course there are many cheesy moments in the movie, but it all does well actually, i think that the reason this movie didn't get that much fame was because people don't want to see to much unrealistic things, thats why i know that kids will love this movie, scared of it at times, propraply at the end with the Dark Lord. We adults don't see the same way as kids, i think the kids who saw it back in the days loved it, and some who likes fantasies understood it in some ways also.Actors: 9/10 Actors the ones in the movie is what makes this movie tick the most, you cant not love Howard sometimes, he is witty and funny, yeah the lines are weak at points but cool at other places, Lea Thompson plays the role of Beverly very well, she is also very hot and cute no matter how you look at it, Jeffrey Jones was a great actor back in the days, he is usually most known for oldies, in Howard the duck he plays as Doctor Jennings very well also. I don't think anyone other then him good do this part better then he does, he is a great great actor. the last one is Tim Robbins if i should be sincere and i shall then i don't like new movies with him, in this movies i believed he wasn't that bad, he was great as well. It is the actor that holds this movie the most and they do it very good.Music: 8/10 Every song in the movie is catchy and it lingerers to you if you just have seen the movie, i liked all of them very much. I liked the main theme, but my favorite wasn't one they sang, only in one single moment when Lea Thompsons sings it, it is of course the song ""Dont Walk Away"" with Thomas Dolby. The small tunes in the movie is nothing to bitch about they aren't the best but the do what is supposed to do.Special Effects: N/A I wont bitch about the special effects they are really not that good for an 80es film, but then again they do make children believe in it, a little scary when you are small, but i think that is what is so good about this movie. Adults will see its wrongs at the first sight, but children will like them at the first sight. The are not bad at all, but they aren't good at all either they are in the middle.Overall 9/10 I will give this a 9 because i believe that this movie grows on you, and later in time it will grow more even though it has long stopped to being produced. But it is a classic for many people and i thinks it grows on you in time, i will end with 2 of my favorite quotes in this movie.""Cleve-Land. Perfectly weird name for this planet."" And the other. Beverly""I never even had any pets, they seems like a lot of hassle you feeding them cleaning up after them, Howard""Ill try to be careful.""",Howard the Duck
115,Pozdnyshev,"Painful, Interesting Failure",4,29 December 2019,"This legendary turkey of a movie happens to be personal to me. I loved it as a child, or rather I loved its special effects.I recently re-watched this childfhood flick of mine to see it with grown-up eyes. And oh my God, it's bad. Yeah I loved it as a child, but I literally cringed and covered my face through like 60% of it, it was so bad.Why? Well that's more interesting than most of the movie. To me, it's not the stupid plot where a ""laser beam"" somehow can target one individual on a planet trillions of parsecs away and instantaneously spirit it back to earth. No, what makes this movie an abomination to me is this insufferably stupid quality in the way the characters were written, and the way they interact with each other.It's hard to articulate, but the writers seemed to have a certain type of humor in mind here that just never EVER works the way they intend it to. Everyone is a cartoon character with no depth at all, just a certain schtick that defines them. Philsey the scientist is a loud, hyper-energetic goof. Beverly is a hot chick who develops an implausible crush on an anthropomorphic duck. The cop wants to arrest Howard, ""dead or alive."" There is an absolutely lifeless void here where pathos and some personal conflict should be.I don't know what they were shooting for with this kind of character writing, but what they got was a million dollar high school play that had less emoptional depth than a saturday morning cartoon. It holds a close kinship to Broadway (which I despise) in a strange sort of way in that its utter lack of darkness makes it unbearably trite, insipid, and saccharine.I will say that the special effects still look pretty awesome, especially the go-motion monster at the end from an animation genius at the top of his game (Phil Tippett).Should you watch it? It's got top-shelf production values and great special effects. It's an interesting failure that you may want to experience once. It's a rare and well-produced turd which probably proceeded from success going to the filmmaker's heads, like this movie's spiritual cousin ""Zardoz.""",Howard the Duck
116,hippiegal,Why!!!???!!!,1,29 October 2001,"I notice that this movie, Leonard 6 and Ishtar all seem to tie on people's list as the worst movies of the 80's. I guess I'm lucky because I've only seen this movie of the three. Howard is a annoying character. The movie tries to make him cute, but he's just irritating. Plus watching a guy in a duck outfit is not my idea of great cinema. The plot stinks. The puns are awful. Lea Thompson is wasted. The whole movie is just not entertaining unless one is a glutton for punishment. I used to hold the believe George Lucas was God untill I saw this on TV. The truly scary thing is this is one of my boyfriend's favorite movies. Now that is truly terrifying.",Howard the Duck
117,the-jerk,Should I be embarrassed?,9,11 May 2005,"Should I be embarrassed because I loved this movie? I was only 9 when it came out, and at the time I thought it was great! Yes, it's implausible and goofy, but come on, the dialogue's not all that bad, and it's actually funny in parts. There's a lot of duck puns. A LOT of duck puns. But beyond that, there's a lot of other funny lines and bits of dialogue too. My favorite part was the diner scene, with the waitress tossing off great line after great line. Howard gets into a fight. Jennings, by now already almost completely taken over by the alien, makes some comment about how the end of the world or the universe or something is coming (I can't quote many specific lines of dialogue, because it's been a while), and the waitress responds ""Oh, no, we get fights in here all the time."" Classic. The opening scenes on the duck world are hysterical! And yes, there were some adult themes, and maybe the duck breasts were a little questionable, but I still feel that this was a kid's movie and should be judged as such (By comparison, ""Goonies"", another classic 80s kid's comedy, had a fair amount of profanity, not to mention a tiny stone penis). Even the last time I watched it, a few years ago, I loved it! Lea Thompson playing a punk rock girl? Tim Robbins of all people as a bumbling lab assistant? The world being saved by a duck from another planet? If you haven't seen this yet because you heard how bad it was, and you ever get a chance (I don't know if it's been released on DVD, but with it's reputation, it may never be), I suggest you try watching it. It's not so bad it's good, it's so goofy it's good, and I think that's an important distinction. Sure it's implausible, but really, can you honestly say better about ""Spiderman"" or ""Superman"" or ""Batman"", for god's sake? At least this one wasn't TRYING to be serious. More proof that George Lucas is a genius!",Howard the Duck
118,tomsters,"Its what it is, not what you demand it to be because of its namesake.",7,17 May 2017,"This movie is easily a 7 on its own merits. The problem with most critics is not the movie but who made the movie and everything he makes must be of the same like kind and quality. If any unknown made this movie, it would have become a classic. It was funny, silly and exciting. I enjoyed it a lot when it first came out and i still do. I didn't even know it was a Lucas movie at that time until it was being bad mouthed in the news. Same went with Willow. Can't the guy make anything else without it being held up in comparison to the great one? I'm sure if he made Thx or graffiti after stars at battle with themselves, they would be put down in comparison too. I still wish Starwars was named something more relevant to the movie and not so general. To bad it wasn't just called 'a new hope' and left off the Starwars and etc for each one following.Duck is a good movie, not a great movie. And definitely not a bad movie.",Howard the Duck
119,adudewhoiscool,Somehow enjoyable,6,22 March 2007,"Because of the reception that ""Howard the Duck"" has received, it is very difficult to review a movie of this caliber. After all, the average critic and moviegoer panned this movie. In addition, it was nominated, even won some, for several Razzie awards for not only that year but for the decade as well. If one were to admit that he or she enjoyed ""Howard the Duck,"" that person would have been made fun of. The question is: is ""Howard the Duck"" as bad as everybody says it is.A science experiment, gone wrong, brings an extraterrestrial life form to the planet Earth through a laser beam. That extraterrestrial is none other then cigar smoking, beer drinking, duck named Howard. Unfortunately, another experiment brought home an alien life form bent on destroying the human race. Can Howard stop the alien and save the human race? From viewing this film, this reviewer can see why everybody hates this movie. However, some parts of this movie are actually enjoyable. There were some humorous moments, mostly unintentional, throughout. Boy and the dialog, wow, this reviewer has never heard so much lame duck puns in his life. At some times, there was dialog that would not sound strange in a Mel Brooks movie. It truly was bad, yet, somehow enjoyable. Unfortunately, why there are many things you can really laugh at, there is not enough to make this film a classic though.The actors, if they were looking back at their role today, would probably be embarrassed. The weird thing was that there were some big names. Lea Thompson plays a women name Beverley Switzler that becomes Howard's friend. Jeffrey Jones was very over the top as Dr. Jennings. Even Tim Robbins is in this film as an annoying scientist named Phil Blumburtt. Not one, not two, but seven little people, in a duck costume, played Howard the Duck.Overall, if you are into those types of movies, grab a few of your friends, rent it, laugh at it, and forget about it the next day. If you want to see a movie that features an awkward romance with Lea Thompson, at the time she was still attractive, with a great theme song at the end, you cannot go wrong with this title. To answer the question about whether or not ""Howard the Duck"" is as bad as everybody says, the answer would be yes. However, for the same reason as most of the 1980's, it is somehow enjoyable.",Howard the Duck
120,limesoda,I Luv this movie.,10,24 April 2001,"Don't you notice how cute it is when some one writes the word love as ""luv"". That's the best way to describe this movie it may not be altogether right (love) But it is just too appealing to dislike (luv).Just a note before I give my review: To all those people bad mouthing it saying the effects sucked or it was really stupid. Go find a photo of yourself from 1986... now let me read your mind. ""Man, did I look stupid, and that shirt really sucks."" But at the time brown and white striped with huge green collars was really hot. You'll see how this experiment ties in, in a sec.I saw ""Howard"" When I was 5 in 1987 and I loved it. I saw Howard a second time in 1989 at the age of 7 and i loved it. Between 1989 and 1990 i think i rented it from the video store at least 50 times. Then I saw it again in 1999 at the age of 17. (Reverting back to the picture) and not only did I enjoy the movie I was able to laugh at the cheesy effects and ludicrous story.... and who could forget the theme song apparently not the 100 napster users who have it on their hard drive (101 now).Don't compare it to films made today, and don't compare it to ""citizen Cain"" Just look at it as a fun 80's romp about a talking duck, and maybe if George Lucas could remove his head from his own butt for and hour and a half he'd see he removed his name from the only decent thing he ever made.9/10P.s Lea Thompson was HOT (and sweet) in this movie; I think she is still the only woman who could turn me on.",Howard the Duck

Of course there are a few cringe moments which made us fowl. The John Barry score was oddly used to underscore Beverly and Howard's duck out of water relationship early on, as if were pushing them into it. Of course during the 3rd act Barry's James Bond touch was perfect for the climactic action. Jeffrey Jones was a treat, doing his 80s thing he was so good at.

Because when it came out, a lot of critics hated it.However some people who reviewed Howard the Duck, also gave it a bad rating. Well I'm gonna set the record straight, you guys need to have an IQ test by the Janitor in this movie. Because it is one of the funniest movies that came out in the 80s, even though back then it was regarded as a flop.I'm not gonna get into the story of this movie, because most of the reviews on IMDb have already done that. The main part of this story is an experiment that went wrong and transported Howard from his world to ours.The end result was a cigar chomping duck with a very sarcastic sense of humour, he isn't a happy duck after landing on our planet. (But then again, would you be if you ended up getting transported to his planet and getting the same treatment he went through in this movie) One person who took pity on him was Beverly played by Lea Thompson. In the end Howard does come to her rescue when an accident causes a scientist to get possessed by a dark overlord.What I find very interesting now is that with the cameos of him appearing in Guardians of the Galaxy one and two, now would be a good time for the critics and the people who gave it bad reviews, give this movie another glance.I also believe that anyone who has seen Guardians of the Galaxy one and two, should also consider watching Howard the Duck. As it would give them an idea of what his character is like.All in all, where the special effects and story line are concerned, That's the only area which lets it down. But if your looking for fun and a lots of laughs, this movie would fit the bill. (bad choice of words I know, sue me) Just ignore the critics and the bad reviews, give Howard the Duck a chance.

I'm exaggerating here, but only slightly.Why am I bothering to write this? The other day I ran into an old girlfriend who once dragged me to this film and insisted on staying through the whole thing even though it was readily apparent it was worthless. She kept insisting the duck character was actually cute and the movie ""wasn't that bad."" Trust me, she was wrong. Good thing that was a short relationship or I could have been subjected to more of the same. Anyhow, when I saw her the other day for the first time in years, the first thing that popped into my mind was that she was the fool who made me see Howard the Duck. I felt a duty and obligation to warn others to stay away.What's so bad about it? I don't know where to begin. Take every element of the film process and insert the word ""bad"" before it and you'll get the idea.

Yea TV was awful and renting 5 Movies a Weeks was normal for me :))I had no expectation's except talking duck and scifi - yea. I dint know it was form comics until today (not a comic fan, never was).Today, after talking about this movie and nostalgic looking it up i was shocked about that Rating. Was it really that bad?No it wasn't. I still remember every Detail from that Movie - well I've seen it several times. It was the time of Ghostbusters and past Starwars and it fitted well into that period.It was funny, a lot of Gags and Fun, enough action to enjoy it but not to much as in today comic movie. The characters where really likable and the special effects where extraordinary for that time and even today some scenes are sill top.my favorite action sequence where in the Diner - i mean really, wasn't that cool. But specially the Howard character where really sympathetic. however some people say it was creepy with its human eyes. well and it maybe its true not to family kids friendly but also not to R rated for adults.personally i think its even today worth to view it again. specially it doesn't have that R Factor. maybe iam just tired of all that over violent and sexual movies nowadays and this movie gives a nice break.Its light funny and then not so light and sometimes even a little deeper moments with a tiny often frightened but brave duck who gives a duck about his odds and never gives up.Verdict: This move is even better today as a refreshing innocent movie specially for adults with a good not over the top humor. Kids could also appreciate it but i guess many gags would just miss them, still would have plenty of fun.The actors well, they are not bad, and hey its the 80s.

130,will-schwartz,It's An Overall Failure,1,16 December 2012,"Howard The Duck is based off an old DC comic. The story is that Howard comes from an alien planet filled with walking and talking ducks. Then, one day, Howard is warped out of his living room and into Cleveland, Ohio. Once Howard enters Earth, he tries to fit into society, which as you could imagine, doesn't work too well for him, that is until a rock star waiting for her big break, Lea Thompson, takes pity on him for some undesirable reason. After this, Howard is brought to a janitor/scientist, Tim Robbins, who is better known for his roles in ""The Player"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" but for this movie was nominated for worst supporting actor at the Razzies. Coming along to help wreck this absolute failure of a movie is Jeffery Jones from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, playing the scientist that is thrown into the movie for the sole purpose of being possessed by a weird ass demon. The supporting actors and other extras also seemed to take the sight of a talking duck pretty relaxed, but then again, it's Cleveland after all.The character of Howard is at many points in the movie, disturbing and weird. You could also tell that the makers of the movie did not care if Howard looked real or not, because Howard looks like, and is, just a short guy in a duck suit. The relationship between Howard and Lea Thompson is one of the stranger things about this movie, especially the scene where the two of them share a little love. This 2 hour disaster is drawn out much longer than it needed to be, and near the end, I was sure that every scene would be the climax, but no, the movie kept dragging along. All special effects in this film are awful. The animations and locations looked like they were cut out of cardboard. Honestly, I don't know why these usually good actors and producer George Lucas decided to sign off for this utter catastrophe. Its only good aspect was that at times it was so horrible, that it actually made me laugh out loud. I give Howard The Duck a 2 out of 10.

No feasible plot is presented anywhere in this film and the premise is absolutely inane. High production values are tainted by absurd imagery, nonsensical dialogue and a poor screenplay. Howard smokes cigarettes whilst walking around as aimless as the story he's in, and his costume is nothing more than a dollar store get up over a tiny man. Leia Thompson has a moment with Howard, and it's the opposite of pleasant. Leia is the prettiest part about this film, but pity the fool who cast her in it. George Lucas produced this for reasons probably unknown even to George Lucas. The funding is visible behind the scenes, but nowhere else.

The Lone Ranger sent a tarnished silver bullet. Sergeant Pepper sent a tarnished silver cornet. Popeye sent an empty, rusting spinach can. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang sent a flat tire.

After ""HTD"" he was going to make ""PLANET OF THE DUCKS"" and ""THE ADVENTURES OF QUACKAROO BANZAI,"" or something. So I plucked out a quill-feather and signed away. Basically, his company promised ""THE MALLARD WHO FELL TO EARTH."" Even more basically, it turned out to be ""XANADUCK."" That turkey (no pun intended) went down harder and faster than my Uncle Horace the day he took both barrels of a 10-gauge. The papers called it a ""base canard."" Frank Price, who ran the movie business at Universal Studios, quit. VARIETY's headline read, ""'DUCK' Cooks Price's Goose.""

Was it my fault Huyck and his co-screenwriter Gloria Katz wrote in so many lame ""duck"" puns that I nearly quacked up? Oh, I'm plenty tough...no Mahatma Gander, so Huyck and Katz at least got that part right. But they turned me into something totally indifferent and uncaring--practically human.(For those of you who didn't do your own homework, Huyck and Katz are two old friends of Lucas, who wrote the screenplay for his movie ""AMERICAN GRAFFITI."" Tragically, they also wrote the screenplay for his movie ""INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM."" Nobody's perfect, but that still should have been a sign, don't you think?) I'm a little down now, I admit it. These days, people want a duck, they don't call me; they call Daffy, who ain't got the brains of a decoy. My agent calls up the other major studios, and they keep saying, ""Howard the Who?"" *Nobody* wants a duck whose picture cost $50 million and lost $35 million.Lately, I been hitting the sauce pretty hard...And that orange sauce is a killer; I can't tell you how many ducks I seen lying face-down in the stuff. Who would have thought Howard the Duck, that webbed wit who conquered the Incredible Space Turnip and the Horrible Hellcow, could be finished off by something as ridiculous as Hollywood?",Howard the Duck
137,dylan-ramsay91,Howard The Duck,6,7 May 2018,This is a cute film. I really had no complaints while watching the movie up until they started doing the long drawn out action scenes. Other than that the movie had some good and funny moments.,Howard the Duck
138,fenoixrising,Leave Howard Alone!!!!!,7,8 February 2008,"Okay, I will admit that this movie was stupid. But it was stupid in a good way. It was funny and it was funny without bare boobs or butts or sexual situations or drugs. I guess that to be ""good"" a comedy has to have sex, gross humor or humiliation in it. Some people don't think that way. Movies like Howard and ""Spaced Invaders"" are just plain funny.We need more movies like Howard. Not everyone likes to watch grossness or just plain retarded behavior on the screen. Keep your ""American Pie"" and your parodies. If you are into mind-numbing stupidity. I'll stick with good, clean silliness. Howard is a movie worthy of the comic geniuses of the past.",Howard the Duck
139,B&W-2,cute...,8,6 April 1999,"I just recently watched this film, and it's not nearly as bad as the hype suggests. In fact, it's a rather sweet romance between an alien duck and a surprisingly mellow punk-rocker (Lea Thompson). There are flaws of course, the plot meanders, and Tim Robbins is ANNOYING, and not in a funny way... However, Geoffrey Jones is marvellous once he becomes possessed by the Dark Overlords, and the rapport between Bev and her duckie is well done. It's not as good as Steve Gerber's bitterly satiric comic book series of the seventies, but then, that's not to be expected...",Howard the Duck
140,Fmobley2746,"Yes this ""Howard the Duck"" is a bad movie in all honesty, but it is far better than what I had heard before seeing it.",5,24 November 2010,"I purchased ""Howard the Duck"" on DVD the other day for $5.00. I wasn't sure what to expect but I figured that I would enjoy it more than the critics did. After watching the film I was in total shock. I did not know how to go about writing a review. You see, this film has heart, good special effects, and is enjoyable, but it also suffers from some bad acting, some bad screenplay, and just a strange atmosphere. Also, Howard wasn't mean like I had heard he was in most of the comics. He also had a different voice in the film than I had imagined him to have. When I first heard about the film I expected Howard to be wild and crazy like a mix between the Mask and the original Daffy Duck. I also expected him to get an attitude like Donald Duck. I thought very wrong because he was not wild or wacky and he did not have much of an attitude.Because I am such a huge fan of movies, especially the weird ones like this one, I was able to look past most of the flaws and admire it for what it was trying to be. It was entertaining and a nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon or something.Last thing is that this film is a bit underrated. It is hated by many probably because of Howard's costume and the wacky plot and screenplay. I guess the people just don't understand that even George Lucas used costumes similar to Howard's for the star wars series.I think this should have been an animated film but it is what it is. It is not a GREAT movie by any means but it does have a lot of heart and I was impressed with how real the emotions on Howard's face were. The crew worked really hard on this film and it is enjoyable.",Howard the Duck

142,keith-774,Even Worse than I Remember,1,24 November 2016,"My wife, bless her heart, has occasionally heard me comment about Howard the Duck. So when the DVD came available in a $5 bin she picked up a copy. Hoping that the film's apparent cult status meant there was some redeeming value I had missed as a teenager, we started to watch it.We lasted 30 minutes. What a pile of tripe. I kid you not, we actually found greater entertainment reading the reviews from Rotten Tomatoes than we did watching the film --- by a considerable degree.The script is slow and boring, the acting is bad, after 30 minutes there still wasn't a plot (I suppose one would have materialized after the bad guy appeared, but he hadn't in 30 minutes...), the sets were bad, the editing was bad. Honestly, it's like Ed Wood had risen from the grave to make one last clunker of a movie.Finally, I'd like to echo the words of the eternal Gene Siskel... ""Who was this stupid film made for?"" It's too brain-dead stupid for adults, it's too coarse for children (even by today's standards). My wife and I literally couldn't figure out the intended audience. It's all over the map. Ten-year-old cuddly one moment, condom-vulgar the next. Sheesh! So, save your money and watch anything else. Even Youtube videos of kittens are a more valuable use of your time than Howard the Duck.",Howard the Duck
143,NickSoapdish,Too groovy for gravy!,6,4 August 2005,"Ah, yes, Howard the Duck; one of the biggest bombs of the 1980s, but it's not all that bad. This movie certainly has an odd plot. A humanoid duck from a faraway planet accidentally gets warped to earth. He adjusts to life on Earth in addition to saving the planet from an evil alien (played by Jeffrey Jones). Did I mention he falls in love with a woman?(played by Lea Thompson, who also played a teenage girl in love with her future son in Back to the Future, has she ever played a woman with a healthy, non-perverse relationship in a movie?) Or that TIM ROBBINS (!?) is in this movie? This is a far cry from Mystic River, I'll tell you that. Despite the odd plot, this movie is fun to watch if you are just looking for some silly mindless fun one afternoon. It's funny seeing this small duck fighting an evil alien, and the sequence on the duck planet is amusing. So if your expectations are low, give this movie a try, you may just like it more than you thought you would; I liked this movie; maybe you will as well.",Howard the Duck
144,moshomaniac,Howard the Duck: so bad it's great!,8,6 June 2019,"In 1986, filmmaker George Lucas(you heard that right)was the executive producer of this notorious 80s flop. It was based on the Steve Gerber Marvel Comics character of the same name, a sentient duck from outer space who winds up on Earth.The biggest problem with Howard the Duck seemed to be the fact that it was live-action. The crew wanted an animated movie, but the contract prevented the time nessesary for an animated film. The animatronics in 1986 were not up to snuff to convincingly make Howard, and the appearance of Howard in the movie was considered to be poor. On top of that, Howard the Duck's writing was viewed as bad, and the film had adult humor in it not considered appropriate for young kids, which eliminated it's perceived target audience.But the question is: was Howard the Duck really that bad? It lived in infamy for years as a movie you were required to hate, if you knew anything about movies. Maybe it was the fact I was only a kid at the time the movie came out, and knew nothing of the film's reputation, but I saw the film on television at my Grandparents' house, and found the movie a lot of fun (seeing it on television was probably better as it censored the infamous ""duck boobs"" scene). But as a child, I was able to appreciate the movie for what it was: a fun, silly little flick.Years later when I heard about how horrible most people found the picture, I didn't really understand what the problem was. We're talking about the 80's after all, a decade that gave us ALF, Small Wonder, Fraggle Rock, Ducktales, etc, so you think a movie like this would be right up everyone's alley. I was beginning to wonder if I had wrongfully found enjoyment in this film, that I was just an easily pleased kid that couldn't see the movie for the stinker it really was.Years later, my brother found that the film had been released (shocker!) on DVD, and bought it. Years after my initial impression, would I still find the same enjoyment, or would I now as an adult be able to view this work as the truly terrible experience it was? I sat down and watched it again.....and to my surprise, it was every bit as enjoyable as I remembered it.Did Nostalgia blind me? No, I saw the flaws in the writing, some of the effects, and the hilariously bad premise. But I still enjoyed the movie in spite of its shortcomings. Howard the Duck is not a classic per se, but it is not even half as dreadful as people say.Plus, I had a little vindication for my audacity of liking such a cinematic bomb, as further research revealed something I was unaware of: I was not alone in the film's fandom. Not even close. Howard the Duck is considered a cult film, as it had been rediscovered by a new generation that had fallen in love with it. They got the premise as I had: that it's a film that you don't take seriously, you accept the absurd premise, and just have fun with it.To close, I'll just say this, if you like a movie, don't worry about what the majority says. Judge for yourself. If you like a film, don't let others convince you otherwise. That's what I did with Howard the Duck, a film I still have in my video collection, and put on whenever I'm in just the right mood.",Howard the Duck

146,alpha128,"""Couldn't possibly be any more retarded""",1,19 January 2003,"Just saw this as Surprise #1 at the 28th (my 24th) Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Science Fiction Marathon.  My buddy brought his twelve year-old son, who provided the quote I'm using as my one-line summary above. You know what they say about the mouths of babes.I spent $25 to see the fifteen Marathon movies, meaning I paid $1.67 to see this.  That was about $1.67 too much.This is one of those movies that make you wonder, ""What were the film makers thinking?""  The only reason I can imagine this movie exists is George Lucas' presence as Executive Producer.  He was hot off the original Star Wars trilogy at the time and the studio must have figured anything he touched would turn to gold.This is also one of those movies that make you wonder, ""What was the CWRU Film Society (organizers of the Marathon) thinking?""  I guess they showed the film because it is set in Cleveland, Ohio where the annual Marathon takes place.  But if you live somewhere other than Northeastern Ohio, don't expect to gain any insights into life here by watching this movie.  The WMMS sticker on Lea Thompson's guitar case, an RTA bus, the mention of East 9th street, and the logo of Cleveland Museum of Natural History are the only touches of authenticity.  The city in this film and the surrounding countryside don't even remotely resemble the Cleveland metropolitan area. And if you come here to visit, don't look for the Cuyahoga Nuclear Power Plant - it never existed.I understand this is science fiction, and that location shooting is expensive, but nothing in this film rings true.  For example, Lea Thompson's character plays electric guitar in a Cleveland rock band.  Well, I happen to play electric bass guitar in a Cleveland rock band and I've never walked home from a gig like Lea Thompson's character does, for the very simple reason that I have an amp that weighs 125 pounds!  When I saw that scene, I couldn't help but ask aloud, ""Where's her amp?""In conclusion, don't waste your time or money by watching this movie.  The character of Howard the Duck is intended to be humorous, but comes across as merely annoying.  I've never seen a ""comedy"" with fewer laughs, even unintentional ones.  Two hours of unexposed film stock has more entertainment value.",Howard the Duck
147,ZhuLien,One of the 80s greats!,9,23 July 2007,"One of the only things funnier than this movie is reading some of the negative comments about it in here. Are these people serious? Howard the Duck is a fantastic sci-fi comedy romp with a cool plot, awesome special effects, good acting. Sure it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it definitely is well made as you would expect from George Lucas. Leah Thompson puts on a good performance and so does Howard. There is even a young Tim Robbins in there. The movie mostly is a comedy but with some sci-fi and horror elements (my younger brother freaked when he saw the cigarette lighter bit) but still it is suitable for all ages - perhaps with parental guidance for the young ones. Don't take my word for it that this is a fantastic movie - watch it!",Howard the Duck
148,robertmfreeman,Much better than people remember,8,5 January 2008,"I like Howard the Duck. I'm not saying I love the movie. I don't own a copy, and have no real desire to own one. However, if it was on television, I'd watch it. If it was chopped up into several pieces and put on online, I'd check it out. If I already picked out two movies for a 3 DVDs for $5 special, and I saw 'Howard the Duck' in there, I'd grab it.Howard the Duck has many flaws, but at no point is it annoying to me. The 'duck' jokes aren't funny, admittedly, but the atmosphere is interesting, Howard himself is funny, and the movie is pure 80's. Also, Lea Thompson is HOT. Again, there are plenty of later movies where you can see her naked, but she was at her peak (and in her underwear) in Howard the Duck.Character actor Chip Zien, the voice of Howard, pulls off the performance with genuine charm, and Tim Robbins is delightfully goofy. To add to it, almost no one in the city really cares that Howard is a Duck. He spooks some, but for the most part they just ignore the alien wandering through their city, and rather than it being unbelievable, it comes off as delightful satire.Just as you think things are wrapping up, the movie becomes ridiculously epic, giant killer aliens show up, and Jeffrey Jones is really funny as the 'possessed' scientist. What can I say? The movie works for me.The only creepy thing is that despite all of Lucas' special effects it's disappointing that they still had to use the 'midget in a costume' technique for all the scenes. Almost anything else would have been better. A guy in a full sized suit? A cartoon effect? Hell, the movie itself probably would have worked a LOT better as a cartoon, rather than live action.Oh, and there's one other bad thing: the 111 minute run time. You can't tell me they couldn't chop 25 minutes out of that movie. Come on, the movie stars a small, talking duck.Despite all that, it's an enjoyable movie. You might not be laughing at the parts they intend you to laugh at, but you'll be laughing, regardless.",Howard the Duck

(i was three or four at the time) Lea Thompson became on of my favorite actresses. Sure, it's corny...but it's still fun to watch. Did you know that Lea Thompson did her own singing in the film?? It kinda has that ""There's No Place Like Home"" feeling...Howard has that anyway. Anyway, i still love this movie!!",Howard the Duck

It's far from that. It, however, may be one of the biggest disappointments in the recent history of film. Compared to a truly awful ""big"" film like ""Ishtar"" or the recent ""Gone In 60 Seconds"", HTD is at least somewhat entertaining.Fast forward to the scenes with Lea Thompson - who is one of the finer actors of her generation - and skip the rest.

I also like how this movie manages to knock one of Hollywood's most overrated icons down a peg (What was George Lucas thinking putting his name on this) This movie is about a duck being pulled through space from his parallel world that has ducks instead of people. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense and seems to take it self too seriously which makes the movie all that much funnier.All in all a funny movie where the biggest joke seems to be that someone made it in the first place.",Howard the Duck
153,LilVixen,Maybe not the worst movie EVER- but definitely the worst I've ever seen,2,6 December 2007,"When I was seven years old, I was badly injured by a four wheeler that clipped me while I was on my bike. I lost control of my bike and suffered a head injury, hanging onto my bike for dear life over a ditch. I was then rescued by the school bus driver and brought to the general store where I was laid out on the front counter and told to squeeze fingers if I could understand the people around me. I suffered scars, a concussion, and amnesia... all incredibly painful things... But nothing was more painful to me than during my recovery,I asked my dad and brother to pick up a Donald duck video for me to cheer me up. They came home with HOWARD THE DUCK. God knows why they thought this movie would be appropriate for a seven year old, brain injured girl who just wanted to be entertained by DONALD DUCK. If they had read the back of the video box... would the plot summary have convinced them? Maybe it's the cigar smoking duck on the front cover? I don't know, but I do know that we all watched it together as a family. Or at least we attempted to. Between attempting to figure out what the heck was going on, the lousy and distracting music, the weird and uncomfortable sexual ""chemistry"" between Howard and Lea Thompson, the bad acting and lack of any plot that makes sense, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Even now, 17 years later, the memory of my entire family shaking our cocked heads in disbelief at what we were seeing and dropping our jaws at the incredibly bad acting, bad special effects and horrible dialog, persists in my head. It's rather comical if you use this movie to play a joke on your friends. Tell them your going to see a really good movie. Wait about five minutes for them to say something negative. Then tell them it gets really good a little more in. See how long they can stand this movie before they give up on it and either burst out laughing or run from the room screaming, ""this is the worst movie I've ever seen."" As a platform for your own entertainment... I guess it depends on how much you like movies that are so bad... their just bad. I personally think, aside from playing that fun trick on friends or family, Howard the Duck, the original copies, duplicates, videos and DVDs?

Whilst admittedly more of a turkey than a duck, the film is nethertheless worth giving a chance.Some songs, books, tv shows and indeed films become so bad they actually become good for that very reason.  A perfect example is the entire recording career of William Shatner, especially ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"", and another is ""Howard The Duck"".This film is absolute cack, so much so that it is rendered brilliant for those who love high-class rubbish of the finest calibre, like myself.  I switch off, stick this film on, and know I'm not going to be bothered by serious plot lines, good acting (bar the ever reliable Jeffery Jones) or anything else of note.What I get instead is a midget in a duck costume and lots of stupid lines that wouldn't seem out of place in a Mel Brooks film, such as ""I'm not Jenning anymore, I'm... someone else..."".

While most of this film fails miserably on almost every level, it does deserve credit for some of its technical achievements.

Howard himself is fun to watch as the wisecracking, fun-loving duck. For those of you who may not have noticed, the black member of Thompson's rock band is a young Holly Robinson-Peete. Also, one very interesting aspect of this story is that the only difference between Earth and the planet where Howard comes from is that the inhabitants are ducks.

I suppose that is something to recommend it, in an alternative universe, prison-camp-hell sort of way.If you find fake plastic puppets believable, have a tendency to lose control of your sexual inhibitions over a large yellow duck's bill and webbed feet, and enjoy fantasizing about such a puppet having the smarmy vain personality of the creepiest 'ladies man(?)' ever hammed up - plus enjoy watching a virginal girl-next-door actress (a rather sweet gal who didn't stand a chance of redeeming herself in this creep-fest) reduced to displaying hard-to-watch horniness for this dork...I mean, duck...then Hey, your stomach is stronger than mine.(I felt sorry for Lea Thompson at the time - it was hard to watch - she had this pretty solid 'image' going from the successful BTTF series - likable and talented - then to see her get trashed - likened it to seeing her in a porno or something. I give her props for her desperate attempt to portray as believable a direction that seemed to be coming from a drug-fueled, sadistic, pervert bent on humiliating her. I mean, it was that bad.)

165,antiprice,the critics were wrong,9,31 January 2006,"Take notice, people. This flick has more ""loved it"" reviews than ""hated it."" I urge you to take notice of this monumental moment. Of course the film has flaws, but it's a film with a talking duck!! It kicks the snot out of Kangaroo Jack, destroys Andre, and pummels Operation Dumbo Drop.Meet Howard: everyday schmoe on his home planet filled with ducks. After some Douglas Adams-esqe exposition, Howard finds himself on our world circa 1986. The plot follows your basic fish out of water story until the planet is threatened by a horde of scorpion-like beings bent on possessing the planet.Certain flicks have that rare quality of having ""everything."" I don't literally mean everything. What I mean is that it has everything within the confines of the story. You get a beer-swilling midget in a duck suit, a punk-rocking Lea Thompson, French kissing a cigarette lighter, ORIGINAL soundtrack, a neutron disintegrate, and Quack-fu. There's tons more but you get the idea. This flick rocks like Wilma Flintstone giving birth to Bam Bam.I seriously doubt that anybody who liked the first Star Wars prequels will appreciate what Howard the Duck represents. This is all according to the ebb and flow of popular culture. Films like Big Trouble in Little China, Buckaroo Banzai, and Blues Brothers (at the time of release), were all panned. At present they all attain a crowning supremacy. Howard the Duck is not a perfect film in that it suffers from typical formulaic writing. The mistake was trying to make it appeal to the general public. I guess that makes sense if you've spent over thirty million on the budget. It should have ended with something less spectacular than an intergalactic invasion in order to lower the budget, yet appeal to a smaller market.Everything else aside, this film is worth multiple viewings in that it presents a totally fictitious story with some blatant reality. For instance: Howard lands on Earth and immediately ponders about getting employment. This film actually takes into account the necessity of getting a job. Howard actually weighs the options of returning to ""Duckworld"" versus remaining on Earth whilst the bad dudes are immanently about to arrive on said Earth.You are a fool to ignore the reviews on this site. Do not believe the hype that this film was a mistake. I have read the comics and they are far better than the film. However, just because the film does not live up to the comic does not mean that it is trash. You douche bags will sit through Waterworld, Episode I-III, and Hanibal. Give Howard the Duck a chance. You cannot honestly spend an evening renting Malibu's Most Wanted or the latest Jack Frost sequel. Do yourself a favor and get Howard the Duck.

166,zaldymir,It Honestly Wasn't That Bad,8,18 September 2001,"I don't understand how Leonard Maltin could give a trashy movie like Lifeforce two stars and give this one a bomb. At least this movie has a coherent story! Sure, Howard is nothing more than a small person in a large duck suit, but that's part of this film's charm. It really doesn't take itself seriously; I doubt it ever meant to. I think people were probably simply expecting something completely different from what they got and weren't willing to be forgiving enough to observe how funny this movie actually is. A lot of the dialogue (especially Howard's) has a very nice razor-edge to it and the action, in my humble but firm opinion, was well-shot. I especially love the ultralight chase and the fight against the Dark Overlord, and I absolutely love the music, especially the catchy songs by Thomas Dolby. I wonder how many viewers of this movie got to read the novelization by Ellis Weiner... if they did, perhaps they'd better understand how far in-cheek the FILM'S tongue is; Weiner goes positively overboard in the book and launches so many narrative jokes it's possible to laugh at one page for several long minutes. It's very true this film is not for everyone, but to condemn it so fiercely is really unnecessary; there are plenty (and I do mean PLENTY) of films out there that are far worse. I was glued to this movie as a kid and I'm still glued to it. In fact, I let my son watch it recently for the first time, and he was glued to it too. Maybe it's simply a film for the young-at-heart. I dunno. But no matter which way you look at it, there's no denying that it's a fun and unique film that deserves some credit... plus where else can you see Lea Thompson in her skivvies or Tim Robbins making such an appropriate fool of himself? To those who have seen it before: give it another chance, with the mindset that yes, it IS a comedy. To everyone else: give it a try. You might actually like it.",Howard the Duck

In reality should attack a good part of American films filled with special effects and messages of propaganda. I noticed that this site has a tendency to attack brutally all film that had formed the generation of children of the 80s. We live in a historical period of apathy and love for cinema, good part of American films rely on special effects and little plot. This film is an excellent film for children, I like and I am in VHS cassette. I saw on TV when I was small and friendly is the idea of making a duck humanized It 'a really good film, one of the most original films of the 80s was so attached that first sent him on TV constantly. The same goes for Dragonheart, Casper all films unfairly attacked. Bel fim, to see and appreciate. If you have made an award raids this should also give Donnie Darko. Cagata crazy.

168,thirstypony,A 'great' achievement in the world of bad cinema,6,18 March 2013,"This movie was very fun to watch even though the ending was over the top and Howard the Duck himself looked incredibly fake (especially in broad daylight). It's a nice, cheesy popcorn flick of the late 1980s. Too bad it was a complete box-office failure and got heavily lambasted by critics. True, George Lucas was way over his head in making this film and should have stopped at the mention of ""talking duck,comes from outer space"". I actually enjoyed this film right up until the big chase happens with Howard and Tim Robbins on the flying machine. Before that point, the movie seemed to be going along at a nice pace. We meet Howard, who is a kind, hard-working duck, just returning home from a tough day and about to relax. Then he gets pulled from his homeland to Earth and has to adapt to his new world. He meets a friend in Beverly but it soon starts turning into love and quickly snaps back to normal. We learn that a giant laser that malfunctioned is responsible for Howard's arrival. A Dr. Jennings is embodied by something known as the Dark Overlord and plans to call fellow aliens down from space. (BTW, Jeffrey Jones' voice of The Dark Overlord is classic and very well executed).Back to the chase. That's when things got out of hand. Everything started to look unreal and weird. The final scene where the evil Jennings sets his plan to take over the world in motion was laughable. And when I finally saw the actual Dark Overlord I merely chuckled. It was so incredibly phony looking and not at all scary. The 'Howard the Duck' song at the end was the worst thing I have witnessed but it was a nice ending to a pointless movie anyway. This film had it many faults but I do say it had some charm and humor to it. It was a cute film that might have been good for children minus the controversial bed scene between Howard and Beverly.",Howard the Duck
169,occupantroom6277,Nobody of a Sound Mind Would Like This,1,19 August 2014,"I don't even know how to properly express my anguish. I suppose it would be fair to admit that I am, usually, an avid lover of terrible movies. ""The Room"" was a work of brilliance, and it really doesn't get much better than ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"". ""Howard the Duck"" was crossing the line. This transcended the threshold of ""so bad it's good"". It wasn't bad in a ""Ghost Rider"" way. It wasn't even bad in a ""Dogma"" sort of way. This movie has put to question what terrible cinema truly is, at its core. I'm honestly disgusted with myself after having seen this movie. Crusaders in its defense have united in a joyful cry of Howard's ""originality"" and ""playfulness"". Pray tell, what exactly about it is unique? Aside the fact that our main protagonist is a space- duck... what else? The story itself is deeply wanting in creativity, as are the painfully wooden characters, and campy, repulsive dialogue. The special effects, while acceptable, were not mind blowing. Especially Howard himself. The ""good guy"" should never give you nightmares. Howard was trollish and creepy. Not to mention, seriously flawed in his character. What a jerk. I'd also like to address the idea that this movie was some sort of B-movie phenomenon. This movie, believe it or not, was made in a very serious way. I think the mere fact that George Lucas was somehow attached to this project ought to demonstrate that. That in consideration, there really is no excuse for how vile this movie was. This wasn't a movie that was parading its own flaws, that wasn't ""egotistical"" or ""vain"", and it certainly wasn't aiming to please the cult crowd. The sorry truth of the matter is, Howard the Duck was spawned in the same ambitious way as Star Wars. THIS was supposed to be an epic. That's just unacceptable. This whole movie is unacceptable. I feel betrayed.",Howard the Duck
170,doctorgonzo64,Believe in Unique Cinema,10,21 November 2008,"I honestly think Ed Wood was a brilliant director. I value films with a unique vision of the world. I think Larry Cohen and Ken Russell are some of the greatest directors we've had. I think camp is a good element to any serious film, as David Lynch has later shown to be true. And I'm serious when I say that this is the greatest contribution George Lucas has ever made to celluloid. I've long thought Star Wars, even the original trilogy, to be extremely overrated. Those films aren't terrible, but everything Lucas has done since this film has been astronomically worse, and if you thought the new Indiana Jones movie or Episode I were pretty cool, don't watch this. You won't like it. You know why? Because you have bad taste.This movie has taken so much abuse by so many critics. If you think a film is bad because Roger Ebert said so, don't watch this. With the critics partly to blame, this film failed and destroyed the careers of Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz. And if you think a movie that does bad at the box office is probably bad, don't watch this. You have bad taste.Why is it okay for critics to praise William Castle and Russ Meyer now? Because they're dead. Those films are old, and it's now hip to think they're cool. In an ironic way, of course. In twenty years, this film will be seen just like those. But it's not cool to like this one just yet.Howard the Duck is one of my favorite films. Its vision of the world is unique and sometimes frightening, Lea Thompson is gorgeous, Jeffrey Jones and Tim Robbins are great, and the special effects are so much better than anything made in Hollywood today. If you thought Cloverfield was cool, don't watch this. You have bad taste.If you value originality, or just plain strangeness, you will like this film. This movie is unlike any other film EVER MADE. Can you say that about Star Wars? You couldn't even say that about Star Wars in 1977. This film is about the ruthlessness of men on Earth, and its message is that to find real meaning in life on Earth, you have to be true to yourself, even if you're a three-foot-tall duck from another planet. The new Indiana Jones film was about how cool that bad ass CGI looks. That's garbage, okay? That's bad cinema. If anything deserves an ironic appreciation, it's the latter day work of George Lucas. If you think Steven Spielberg is brilliant, if you liked Independence Day, or if you thought Spiderman was good, don't watch this. You have bad taste.",Howard the Duck
171,khaki_dojo,An interesting movie to say the least.,10,9 February 1999,"I first saw this movie in the mid-eighties when it was new, then again recently when my 12-yr-old son brought it home with him.""Howard the Duck"" may not have been the movie of the century, but it was an interesting adaptation. George Lucas has always impressed me with his choice of projects, because he humanizes each element. ""Howard the Duck"" isn't about a duck who lands on Earth and desires acceptance, but about the people already here who are different in some way. The character of the duck faces a great deal of prejudice from many of the people he meets, rarely finding understanding from anyone. The character of Beverly (Lea Thompson) takes a chance on him.It is by no means the most intelligent movie ever made, but it does have a number of interesting moments. Like the recent smash hit ""Starship Troopers"", this movie is very satirical in nature, and pokes fun at the basest of human instinct and intregrity, but is still simple enough for a pre-teen to understand what's going on. Most importantly, Lucas maintains his high standards of quality with ""Howard the Duck"". There is no nudity (except for an interesting duck shot), little language, and low violence content. This is also an excellent effort from the seldom-seen Willard Huyck and partner Gloria Katz, and the costumes and make-up were very well-done for a mid-eighties movie.",Howard the Duck

I know the film is far from sophisticated and has some very bad lines of dialogue in the script,but it's obviously because it's a tribute to the b. movies of the 1950's.

189,Le-Petit-Antoine,The worst cases of Plot holes and contrivances I've witnessed in a while,1,24 August 2019,"Howard the Duck (1986) - (M)
Tony Saad - Friday, 22 February, 2019NO STARSI honestly don't know how Howard the Duck manages to stuff up enough feathers for the big screen. The film is so devoid of bones and stakes, that I just did not care about the action and emotions. The film presents itself as the new George Lucas blockbuster of the decade, when in fact, it has got less originality and creativity than Ducktales (1987-1990). This is the first Marvel comic to be adapted to the big screen, and it doesn't take off that well. But then again, there is always a first time for everything.The movie is about Howard T. Duck, an anthropomorphic duck who gets teleported from his planet of 'Duckworld' to Earth, and tries to find his way back. You know, like how E.T. gets lost and wants to return home, with some strange Star Wars spices added to it. Here we get a massive 'laser spectroscope' which can teleport people from one place to another. The machine also acts as the portal for the 'Dark Overlord of the Universe' to invade the Earth.Howard the Duck has got some of the worst cases of Plot holes and contrivances I've witnessed in a film. Who is the 'Dark Overlord of the Universe' -quite a fitting antagonistic name considering how cheesy the narrative is-? Why does the Dark Overlord enter the Earth? Why does he disguise himself as an agent? Why does he need Lea Thompson for his race? What is this... Ghostbusters!? Hey, at least the main antagonist in Ghostbusters has got a reason to possess the hot chick. The film lacks bones and stakes that I just could not care less for Howard anymore.And the laser spectroscope, even by 1986 standards, is no marvel of engineering (Pun NOT intended!) It breaks down at the most inconvenient timing. Why is the machine aimed at Duckworld? Why does it teleport Howard? The human character are utterly unconvincing. They clearly appear bored and would rather do something else. The weak script and dialogue only make the most lethal problem in film even worse.I believe our protagonist; Howard T. Duck, must be the lovechild of a Ventriloquist dummy and Donald Duck whom we never met, as he has got trouble showing any facial emotional complexity. The dryness exhibited by the character is awfully obvious whenever he sits at his sofa in front of the TV, and reads the not-playboy magazine in his hands. Oh! and he tries to imitate Donald Duck's voice at one point, coupled with the abhorrent sexual innuendos spattered throughout the film. Those and Howard's lack of feelings for others make him a real lame-duck character (Pun intended). Some critics out there suggest that the film would've been better as an animated movie. Whether a film is animated or live-action, if it has got nothing to tell us, if it fails to make us care for the characters, if it fails to present itself as something, then it has got no right to exist. The lack of inventiveness and originality in this film is obvious. By adding all those George Lucas references like the plot similarities with E.T. and the Star Wars references, Howard the Duck is not allowing itself to be its own film. I am not opposed to pop-culture references in film; in fact, they can be very entertaining depending on the audience and the relevance of the references. But there is nothing concrete to back up the sci-fi in this film, meaning most aspects that rely on pop-culture references in this film are pretty hollow. It takes a lot of effort to go through a terrible film without having your insides throw a tantrum during such a film as Howard the Duck. But when other George Lucas films and Donald Duck find themselves glued together onto bits of 35mm film, I cannot help but to walk out of the film not even an hour into it. Not Good! My advice is to stay clear of that film's path, or you might just get zapped into a painful time with no easy way out.© Howard the Duck Film Review, 2019.

Howard is a great character. He's not only a ""duck out of water"", but also a ""reluctant hero"" that the average person can identify with. It is not boring and combines sci-fi / fantasy with comedy, action and monster elements all rolled into one. As with many 80s movies like Back to the Future, Teen Wolf, Goonies, etc - it is great for kids, but also has jokes or situations that grown-ups can appreciate too. One of the great 80s movies that used lots of ""practical"" special effects.

Why it's great 1/ Most of the effects still stand up today, You can believe there's a talking duck on screen 2/ It's Funny, quite sharp in places, quite bizarre in places. 3/ It's well filmed, just look at the chase scene. 4/ It's a film with a talking duck as it's lead, what's not to like. 5/ The spoof movie posters etc.6/ Eighties clothing, shoulder pads need I say more? 7/ Tim Robbins with a comedy performance par excellence.8/ The theme tune. 9/ The dodgy love scene, even as I kid I knew something wasn't right there.10/ The way it makes me feel like a kid again.

200,Casey999,So Bad it's good.,7,3 December 2003,"Make no mistake, thismovie is bad.  That they spent 30 millin dollars (or something like that) on it is incredible.  The duck doesn't look real, and it doesn't look like they tried to make Howard look real.
All that said, I saw this when i was 20 or so (on video) and thought it was great.  Not great like Schindler's List or even Almost Famous, but great nevertheless.A duke that's in a band called Howie and the Heartbreakers, who's been on the cover of Rolling Duck and a master of Quackfooey.  It is what it is, and I enjoyed it.As I said elsewhere, if I had to rank it out of all of Lucas' films, I'd say the first 2 and 3/4 Star Wars (can't sit through the last 30-45 minutes of jedi..and no it's not the ewoks that bug me), American Grafitti and Tucker are the only films that I think are better...granted the rest are crap, but unlike Howard the Duck, they're unwatchable crap.",Howard the Duck
201,swordfish_man,I LOVE this movie!,8,7 February 2019,"So I grew up watching this and always enjoyed it.
Then, many many years later, I got my hands on it and decided to watch it, expecting it to let me down and be terrible like people say it is. Nope! I totally dig this movie.
Howard looks good considering the technology they had back then. The music is actually pretty great - both songs and theme. And you know Lea Thompson looks so bangin in this movie. The big hair. The voice. Rocking in a band. She was perfect.
Honestly, its time for people to let go of the hate. This movie has gained such a committed following. It's a great movie. Absurd, but in the best way. Honestly, the restaurant scene is such a highlight! I loved that moment.
It goes from being an 80's rom com for the first half, to a full blown monster movie in the second half.
It's a fun movie, and doesn't deserve the hate it gets. Howard rocks!!!",Howard the Duck
202,rydog23,This movie suffers from the self-fulfilling prophecy phenomenon,8,22 February 2013,"We all know there are really good movies and really bad movies. However, there is a small subset of movies that suffer from what I call the self-fulfilling prophecy phenomenon. What this means is if a movie garners enough academic opinion about itself and this opinion is able to snowball it strangely tends to stick even if this original view of the movie is actually misguided or simply incorrect.The most classic example of a positive snowball is Citizen Kane. Most would agree Citizen Kane is a very good movie and a very well made one especially given the time period and technology available. However, even though I'm an extremely well-versed movie buff, I've always had trouble agreeing with the well-established belief that Citizen Kane is considered the best movie ever by most rating systems.What I think happens with Citizen Kane and also Casablanca is that there was that very early belief about this movie that dug-in like a tick and has stuck ever since. So anyone who sees the movie, regardless of how they feel, convince themselves it's a very good movie, in fact the best, after all how could so many people be wrong? They may even hold this belief BEFORE seeing the movie.This is where the self-fulfilling prophecy comes in to play. If that many people continue to auto-agree or refuse to disagree, then the cemented opinion only becomes more permanent. Now was the original opinion of the movie correct during the time it came out? That's most likely believable. But considering the general consensus has been unchanged for nearly 75 years shows there must be other factors affecting its status. Maybe there's a subconscious respecting of elders that helps to keep the snowball rolling forward.Now, as far as Howard the Duck goes, I think it suffers form this same phenomenon in the negative direction. There was most likely a determined core of anti-Howard the Duck critics in the early days of this film who were hell bent on making sure this movie was permanently known as a bad movie. Most of us can agree that this movie certainly isn't the worst movie ever, and a large portion of us really like this movie. So, try to keep an open mind about movie reviews and any possible social phenomenon that might be occurring simultaneously.",Howard the Duck
203,cvandale2001,The Duck ain't so bad,10,14 August 2005,"Howard the Duck is one of the best movies of the eighties. Many people hate this flick, but I feel it has gotten a bad rap. Yes, it was one of the biggest box office disasters - It came in third it's opening weekend, both Aliens and Friday the 13th Part 6 beat it on it's opening weekend (August 1st 1986) - But, many people need to realize that this movies biggest downfall at the time was it's inability to understand it's audience. Howard the Duck had nudity, and for a movie designed for a younger audience, it just didn't fly at the time. However, this movie has some good things going for it - the special effects, the background score, and the ending battle with the dark overlord, makes up for any short comings the movie may have.If you want a real summer movie, check out Howard the Duck. You may be pleasantly surprised.I still believe to this day, that if Howard would have been released on MAY 5th 1986 it would have faired better. George Lucas underestimated his competition that year.",Howard the Duck
204,MovieCriticWeekly,Howard the Duck,1,26 June 2013,"You know most people say there's no good or bad movie? Well I am wrong. One of these ""bad"" movies is Howard the Duck. It is known for it's dumbness of acting and it's comedy is just plain poor. The other thing I hated was that this movie had too much adult material in it. It has drunk scenes, contains perverted innuendos, and somewhat nudity. There is this one sick scene where when Howard is flying through his chair, he flies past another duck that is bathing. It showed the boobs of the duck right while he flew by. Isn't that sick or nasty? The other thing was that Howard's lips were barely moving and he had a very expressionless face. It was like torture watching this movie. And here is a plot hole. Why does a woman fall for a duck?! It makes no sense why those two would even be a couple. Anyways, I rated this movie 1/10. Thanks for reading.",Howard the Duck

This is another movie I do not understand having a low rating. The story is very funny and I can say, after watching it a few months ago, it still holds up. The acting is great. Howard is very funny and the voice acting will have you believing he is a real duck. This is part of my childhood and I will always love it. The story revolves around Howard, a duck from another planet populated by ducks instead of humans. After a long day at work, Howard arrives home to relax and is suddenly sucked out of his apartment by an unknown force and pulled down to our planet. Hilarity ensues as he tries to adapt to living on Earth while trying to find a way home. Give it a watch.",Howard the Duck

210,evilnutta,Howard Don't Suck,6,14 September 2006,"This is a movie that had such a disastrous run at the US box office that it was renamed 'Howard: A New Breed Of Hero' in my native UK, and the poster was changed to disguise the fact that the main character was a duck. At the time, my feelings were that if it was produced by George Lucas, how bad could it be? Fortunately, not THAT bad. While it differs significantly from the tone of the Marvel comic book on which the movie is based, it succeeds in being a daftly entertaining kids film.What elevates the film are the performances by it's human cast. Lea Thompson is spunky as the female lead and Tim Robbins ACTUALLY funny in the comic sidekick role.The crowning glory is Jeffery Jones, hot off the success of Ferris Bueller, in another sidesplitting character part. As the Dark Overlord of the Universe, Jonesgoes into overdrive, provide the movies best lines.In addition, John Barry's grand score (which opens the scale of this mere kids film to more epic proportions) and Phil Tippiitt's magnificent creature effects propel this into cult, entertainment heaven.It's a pity then that while the performance of the Duck himself is acceptable, his realisation as a 'MAN-IN-A-SUIT' abomination is not.Come on George.

In the end I decided to asked the local shop if they would sell it to me, they did and now I have my very own video of Howard the Duck (Howard, a new breed of hero). Anyone who mocks this film, I don't understand. Basically its an easy watching, action comedy which never fails to amuse me. It uses a bunch of brilliant songs to help it along, plus it stars one of the great actors, Tim Robbins. Some of my favourite lines are ""ahh, a typical hairless ape"", or ""thats a duck, thats a duck man!"" I guess you have to watch the film to get the humour of it.

On the one side Scary to death, the other side very funny with the best sarcastic humor I ever saw in a movie.

I have to cut George some slack, I understand he was going through a divorce at the time. I loop this time period of his life in with the lack luster Indiana Jones and The Temple Of Doom.

217,The_Daemon,A classic example of too many ignorant cooks in the kitchen.,5,10 May 2010,"Howard is a duck person from a far flung planet that has been accidentally sucked to earth due to an accident that occurs when the testing of an experimental laser telescope goes awry. Confused and despondent over what has happened to him he grumbles over his sad lot in life until a chance meeting causes him to leap to the defense of a young rocker by the name of Beverly Switzler. Intrigued by Howard she takes him into her life -- and her bed -- and attempts to both acclimate him to life on Earth whilst attempting to help figure out how he came to be here and if it's possible for him to return to his home planet. Through a close friend they do eventually find out how it happened, but before they can attempt to recreate the accident in reverse (yeah that always works) another accident occurs during testing...but this time something far worse and evil has arrived.Considered a MASSIVE misstep by pretty much everyone involved in this project the film was not only a big financial and critical failure, but also the butt of many a joke for quite a while. A classic example of not only too many cooks who don't know what they're doing in the kitchen, but even those at the core of its creation had seemingly no idea of the true nature and spirit of the Howard the Duck comics and hoo brother does it show! Although I suppose to most people it was just a bad movie, but to a long standing comic book fan this was yet another painful representation of a beloved character on the silver screen. Which I suppose sort of makes me have to come clean about something....I am indeed a big comic book nerd and at the time a very big Howard the Duck fan as were many of my friends. Quite routinely this film gets brought up as a very bad movie and although I haven't fully disputed this in the past, I have defended it somewhat as more of a poorly executed mediocre movie with some very nice scenes of Lea Thompson in her underwear as, like many a young man in the '80s, we had quite a crush on the wee lass. So for no particular reason at all I decided to revisit the film and see how much I could still enjoy it.I didn't enjoy it.Yes I do have to admit that the movie is pretty bad and it makes me rather sad looking back wondering what could have been. Obviously when the movie was initially announced my friends and I were pretty happy and pleasantly surprised. Initially we were skeptical but at the time Lucas was coming off of his Star Wars films and still had a good name creatively speaking. He was also revealed to be something of a fan of the Howard comics so we felt that this could be a solid comic book film albeit a slightly odd choice. On hindsight it all makes tons of sense as to why this whole thing was a disaster. I mean, if you told anyone NOW that Lucas was going to make an ""A"" picture involving Howard the Duck your reaction would be ""Nooooooooo!"" much like Vader did resulting in much unintentional humor.It's funny but kind of sad to watch the writers of Howard the Duck these days talk about the movie looking back as they attempt to defend it by making statements about how people just needed to relax and accept the movie for the silly fun ride that it was supposed to be. ""It's not an existential movie"" they would proclaim! ""It's just a fun movie that was probably a bit ahead of its time"". Oy. Let me explain something to the non comic book nerds out there...Howard the Duck was an extremely existential comic book as well as mixing in some rather long bouts of surrealism -- THAT'S why it was funny. The creator Steve Gerber used that template to then poke farcical takes on the ridiculous nature of popular Marvel heroes and villains. But at the core Howard as always just Howard attempting to get by in life no matter what it threw at him and all the while we slowly got to know everything thing about this ""average"" duck both inside and out.But obviously they didn't get it -- not the writers, not the studio, not Lucas...nobody. Again, on hindsight it all seems so obvious, but at the time it seemed like it all might work. To be fair there are some good moments. Lea Thompson, besides being quite fetching in little clothing, is quite fitting as Beverly even though she's obviously not exactly the curvaceous model that she was in the comic. But her attitude and quick acceptance of Howard as a person as well as her interaction with him are actually quite charming. Character actor Jeffrey Jones also delivers a quite amusing performance as an alien possessed scientists slowly devolving/involving into a horrific looking creature. It's kind of funny to note that Vincent D'Onofrio gave a very similar performance as Edgar the Bug in Men in Black.There's also some nice stunt work, excellent puppet work, and some excellent physical performance by Ed Gale who had to do pretty much every scene completely blind as he couldn't see out of the suit. But in the end it's just another bad comic book movie put together by a bunch of people who completely misunderstood the source material. They just thought that it was a silly book about a talking duck and threw a bunch of duck and bird-related puns and jokes in there and that was about it.Really just an awful movie although part of me will always remember it a little fondly due to my love for Howard in general.",Howard the Duck

The story is imaginative and the effects are very impressive. The only problem the public had with this movie is that it starred a talking duck.

I thought the Moster itself was of a pretty cool design and over all really enjoyed the fact they just decided to have fun. You cant expect someone to just be able to produce a star wars hit one after another.

220,vampira_sucks_alot,Thanks Lucas!,10,12 April 2007,"Few things are more imposing than a midget in a duck suit, Lea Thompson with big hair is one of them. Don't get me wrong, pretty girl, she just doesn't look right with Van Halen's hair. Enough about that, we've got a great ducking movie to review! (You saw it coming.) Howard is living happily on his planet when a strange phenomenon sucks him through space, landing the poor waterfowl in Cleveland. Taken in by the talented, but mismanaged rock singer Beverly he begins setting things right. First he gets her out of a dead end record contract, then the drake begins searching for a way home. Constantly forced to defend himself from the evolved apes occupying Ohio's premiere city, Howard resorts to ""Quack-Fu"" or biting sarcasm. Personally, if a three foot duck offers me a banana, I'm punting the quacker. (There's another one! On a roll today.) Through Beverly he meets Phil, who after insulting everyone's intelligence by trying to communicate with our feathered hero by quacking at him actually discovers how the duck came to Earth. A research team led by Doctor Jenning was using a new spectroscope and it created a passageway between worlds! Bad news for mankind though, a second experiment has teleported in one of the Dark Overlords of the Universe. (No, not the people who run NBC.) Using a golf cart packing more firepower than most tanks Howard blasts the stop motion baddie into oblivion. The number of visual duck puns is astounding, Howard reads ""Playduck"" and carries a ""Mallardcard"" in his wallet. In addition we have the possessed Dr. Jenning, who feeds on electricity, plugging his tongue into a truck cigarette lighter and generally being a public nuisance. Jenning cracked me up during his possessed phase, one minute he's exclaiming in a dark voice, ""This will mean the extinction of all existing life forms."" and the next he's sad because the waitress took his ham and eggs. Seeing Lea Thompson, in her bedclothes, getting amorous with Howard was a twist too. (He's hung like an Ostrich!) Most people either hate this film, or love it.

I only stayed that close to the movie because I didn't drive. The bathroom and lobby were more entertaining than the theater. I can't believe you can even buy this movie. Has anyone bought it?

234,tllucero,George Lucas' second-best film,10,26 July 2004,"Yes, I'm bitter. George Lucas single-handedly killed off Howard The Duck (the comic book). On the other hand, the comic-book version of Star Wars is the only version that works for me.A bit about my tastes: I walked out of 'Star Wars' (the movie) because the acting was so bad - much worse than Howard The Duck, by the way. 'American Graffiti' is the only other Lucas film that I find watchable a second time.The good: Jeffrey Jones as the villain. Truly scary in a believable way. Lea Thompson as the Disneyesque punk rocker. She could have been a singer. The first part of the movie, where they, for the most part, follow the comic book. Tim Robbins does good as the heroic janitor.The bad: the special-effects guys. ILM cost millions on this movie, when 'Plan 9' effects would have sufficed. In other words, someone other than George Lucas should have made this movie. At $7 million, it would have been a minor flop. But, at $37 million, with the Lucas name, mega-box-office flop.The ugly: the script-writing. This isn't ""Speed 2', or 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' bad, but it's close. A chase scene is not a script, no matter whether it's box office gold or lead. Not as bad as the first 'Star Trek' movie, where the writer had claimed never to have watched an episode. We think she watched one - the one she cribbed the plot from. But I digress.Overall: I give it a 10 out of 10 - original concept, flawed execution, great acting. Next time, hire Steve Gerber as technical consultant.Lea, how about making a sequel to the greatest science fiction movie of all time?",Howard the Duck
235,tllucero,Lea Thompson's best science fiction movie: why no sequel?,10,6 November 2005,"Lea Thompson's best science-fiction movie ever! Also, George Lucas only made two watchable movies - this and American Graffiti.Howard, as the Duck who fell to Earth, is a bit too kind and optimistic. Lea Thompson, as lead singer of The Cherry Bombs, is awesome as Beverly Switzler. Jeffery Jones is absolutely spot on as the mad scientist/Evil Overlord Dr. Jenning. He owns every scene he's in. Tim Robbins, however, did a poor job as Phil the janitor.THe beginning of the movie, in Duckland, is positively hilarious. Then Howard gets sucked out of his recliner by unknown forces and taken to Earth. Here he meets and defends Beverly against two goons,excellently played. Chip Zien does mighty work as the voice of Howard.Unfortunately, Tim Robbins acts like he punched his scenes in, with no vitality. George Lucas felt obligated to bring in ILM (Industrial Light and Magic), and millions of dollars were spent on an overly log chase scene (which appears to have been copied shot-for-shot by the movie Speed), money which would have been better spent with a better actor than the miscast Time Robbins, and using the talented writing of Steve Gerber more than Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, who, apart from the opening, fell short of the Howard the Duck standard. But that's Hollywood.Excluding the chase scene (yeah, I know it's in there), this movie is better than the first Back to the Future (which is in my top ten movies ever), so I give it a rating of 10. Unfortunately, since the movie cost some $37 million in 1986, there has been no sequel.Put this out on DVD - I wanna see Lucas' director's cut! and then make a sequel, if Chip Zien and Steve Gerber are available.",Howard the Duck
236,nwags,Not As Bad As First Thought,6,4 September 2005,"""Howard The Duck"" rewards repeat viewing, believe it or not. The music score does seem to grow on one, to the point where I went and (with great difficulty) found a copy of the soundtrack, and the acting does appear to be better - I suspect the ""Heaven's Gate"" effect here, where in 1986 we were watching the negative publicity, but now we are just watching the film.The strange nature of the film - half adult/half kid pic - remains, but now seems both endearing and entertaining, rather than irritating. The acting does appear far better than first thought, with Lea Thompson and Jeffrey Jones both giving excellent performances. Certainly, it does not appear so bad today as to deserve to destroy the careers of Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz (which, of course, it did do back in '86). Strange the effect of time on the one piece of celluloid!",Howard the Duck
237,it-34,Watch at the risk of taking heat from your friends,7,15 September 2005,"OK, yes - Howard the Duck caused a cinematic blitzkrieg! Movie critics attacked it without mercy. Movie patrons roasted it in effigy. It's not terribly smart, well acted, or brilliantly conducted, but I loved it! Overacting? Heck yes  think of The 3 Stooges, or Laurel & Hardy, or (respectful pause)Gilligan's Island! It's supposed to be that way. You want originality? Look elsewhere. The dialog is a running gag of film spoofs - (from, On the Waterfront to Spaghetti Westerns). Taken without pretense, they are amusing. You say, what about the talking duck thing? Granted that one is not so hysterical in and of itself, but if you're still with me, here is a little insight that might make a difference if you decide to watch this film or not. Before the movie, Howard the Duck existed as a comic book series. In the comic, Howard was a beer drinking, stogy smoking, chauvinist (ahem) duck! It had funny sexual innuendo (think Conan the Barbarian comics) and a kind of dark comedy anti-hero (Sgt. Rock comics) thing going. I've found that those who have some affinity for action/adventure/dark humor comic books got this film. When the producers finished making this movie, they thought they had a big hit on their hands. Undoubtedly, they read the old comics and were tainted by these. Too bad the film studio did not have some sort of lead-in promotion for the comic books which might have gotten some public buzz before release. Watch at the risk of taking heat from your friends",Howard the Duck

BAH!Now imagine taking your girlfriend back in 1986 to a movie you heard was produced by George Lucas. Imagine also having to argue with the girlfriend about the choice, because she most likely wanted to see something else not duck related and without the visual competition of Lea Thompson. And finally, imagine how smug my girlfriend was when I could not stop screaming what a waste of money we just spent watching Howard the Duck.I just watched Howard the Duck on the Universal Channel here on Russian cable for the first time in decades.

I first saw it in 1986 when I was 8 yrs old and, like the Simpsons, I can watch it now as an adult and still find myself entertained for completely different reasons. I love the whole 80s feel to the film. The 'cherry bombs', the sleazy clubs, the punks which come straight out of 'double dragon', jeffrey jones as the dark overlord, lea thompson, the soundtrack, the total surrealism (the duck reading 'playduck' before crashing through the wall to another lady duck who is topless). In respect of the soundtrack, it rocked, just like Limahl's song in the Never Ending Story always makes me remember seeing that film as a kid. Some 80s films had an ability to set an atmosphere through the soundtrack that you do not get in the same way anymore... the breakfast club (simple minds), the goonies (cyndi lauper), back to the future (huey lewis & the news), pretty in pink etc. I am not a typical sci-fi/comic book hero fan at all, but it is not this aspect which makes the movie great for me. I don't know if the parts I love are the parts which Lucas intended to be great but, unintentional or not, they are great. If you think it is terrible, for the plot or cheesy jokes or whatever, then you are missing the point. Yes it is terrible in parts but for the time the film lasts, I and many others enjoy a pure escapism back to another era that only Howie can bring!!!!",Howard the Duck

256,obiedan,An alternative take,9,11 June 2002,"I just watched the film last night for the first time in ages and came online to see what others thought... 253 people have actually given it ten out of ten so I thought I'd provide a counter argument to help speak for them and to balance things out a little, as I think this film takes a lot of unfair bashing...Well first reactions are that the film actually has a pretty dark humour vibe to it with some quite risque elements, and Howard himself is pretty much in line with his comics persona. There's not a huge attempt to make him cuddly and nice in order to dumb him down to be more acceptable - he's sarcy, pessimistic and a bit nasty at times. All of which makes him an interesting character. Special mention must go to the actors themselves - Thompson, Jones and Robbins all play the action with a knowingness and seemingly genuine affection for the source material. When Bev storms off after an argument with Howard, she does so in a hyper-exaggerated manner that perfectly captures the Marvel Comics feel. There's also a genuine feeling of menace and dread with the arrival of the Dark Overlords, with some great Creature FX. Yes, the presentation of Howard himself may not be everyone's cup of tea, but you should just accept it and buy into the story that's been presented rather than let it ruin the film for you. A lot of people wanted him to be a cartoon a la Roger Rabbit - why? Surely a 2-D cartoon version would have looked a lot more fake (and weird) than the suit / animatronic version - he's meant to be flesh and blood. There's some good animatronic face work, especially on the various duck people at the start.A lot is also made of the fact George Lucas was executive producer. Well all I can say is bravo to him - if people never took risks, never tried different and mad stuff, and yes, sometimes failed, then there would never be all the great original characters and stories that we all love. ""Labyrinth"", another Lucas project, used to be generally panned, but has recently been re-assessed and embraced by a great many people. It too has an offbeat plot and characters and didn't fare too well when first released. But, like Howard, it has a strong and affectionate fanbase of people who appreciate its quirky nature and the obvious care, affection (and talent) that went into it. Who knows, maybe, in time, others too, or a new generation, will grow fond of it also.BTW ""Trapped in a world he never made"" was actually a tag-line from the comic, so the films producers can't be blamed for that - they're actually remaining faithful to the source material. Alpha-4, I'm sorry you didn't enjoy this film - as it was shot and set in your native Ohio I'd have hoped you'd have supported it more! lolAnyway peace everyone and hope I've interested others to give this film a try.Dan",Howard the Duck
257,bgr07,Great film for those growing up in the 80s and most unfairly criticized of all time,10,12 April 2008,"Howard the Duck will go down as one of the greatest films for the youth of the 80s and the most UNFAIRLY panned films of all time. It seems that most people growing up in the 80s simply loved this film and critics expected another Star Wars. Well it's simply not star wars, but that doesn't make it a bad film!This film is actually very funny, exciting, endearing, scary, has an awesome soundtrack performed by the beautiful Lea Thompson, and a wisecracking duck from outer space!

Oh and there's a goofy Tim Robbins as the lab assistant to boot.If you go into watching it expecting a silly kids film from 80s made to simply entertain, you might appreciate it as much as the fans and I do.

259,heinrix-2,Unjustifiably Underrated Movie,10,14 January 2009,"Howard the Duck is one of those movies that get underrated by some and hated by those who have no opinion of their own and repeat after doubtful ""authorities"" whose job is spitting on everything they can because it's their job.Well, I must say that against all better judgement I find this movie to be both original and entertaining, and that's what a decent movie is all about. Beside that, it has many things other (and especially modern) movies don't have: original story (some people call it stupid - seriously, I don't know why. perhaps they're too serious? well, serious people don't waste their time on movies and other insubstantial things); character charisma - you can't help but sympathize with the protagonists you see on screen - almost every one of them is a living individual, not a ""that third guy from the left"" - especially that cynical, sarcastic duck; nice music that is played throughout the movie; decent acting (excellent acting if compared to modern movies); good decorations; nice and very colourful visuals. By the way, this movie won Razzie award for ""worst visual effects"". Hm, if they only knew back in 1990 what visuals we'd have in 21 century... I've seen those modern, cheap, square special effects in Terminator 3 or LotR, and believe me - they were WORST. So why did T3, LotR, RE 2&3 etc. not win any of those humiliating awards? I guess because critics were much softer on them (being representatives of new movie viewer generation that loves pointless all action movies like ""Matrix"" with square visuals and minimum of REAL decorations). What many modern movie makers don't realize is that special effects cannot replace real decorations, and only with decorations being the basics of the view visuals can do some nice job, too. My dreams look more realistic and colourful than the background generated by computers in the movies. Anyway, one can easily explain why decorations are being less used nowadays - they cost millions and require some talents, while special effects cost nothing, take much less time and require someone who has never left his apartment.Now, let's talk about stupid movie stories - have you watched ""Batman Begins"" or ""The Dark Knight""? Execellent movies, you say? Well, make me and yourselves a favour - forget that it's about Batman, forget that the budget was big (or not). Just watch them as if they were independent movies. Can you see through the mist of delusion now? Infantile in its stupidity story, poor acting (actors were disgusted about what they were doing so much they weren't able to show any emotions), histrionic dialogs that never make sense, stupid actions that lack rationalism and logic (like ""why the hell are you shooting with two handguns? buy UZI, you mendicant!""), average music score, artificiality. I don't know what many people find so fine about last Batmans. Boring movies, with characters having no individuality ""they come, they die. who were they? who cares? let's watch those big explosions and stupid matrix-like fights that make no sense!"".What I'm trying to say here is that as some movies are unjustifiably underrated (Lynch's ""Dune"", for example), some are unjustifiably overrated. Regular viewers don't do the ratings - movie critics do. Bad thing is, many regular viewers fall for it and repeat after them, thus pushing ""one star"" button, thinking it's their honest opinion. Those critics are also individuals, with their own taste and desires. And instead of bashing movies like ""Howard the Duck"" only because its badness is a popular belief you'd better watch this movie independently of any alien opinion and decide for yourselves if you liked it or not. And I'm sure, everyone who HAS seen this movie had found something he/she liked in it.All in all, I give ""Howard the Duck"" 10 stars (by modern standards, for I haven't seen a decent American movie for a few years now) for its originality, humour, acting, music scores, decorations, visuals, and most importantly - for being alive. Of course, this movie does have some bad moments, like some scenes I personally would have cut out, but still, they don't ruin the film's inner charm.",Howard the Duck
260,TimeBanditKTS,Go back to the Nexus of Sominus wannabe movie critics ! ! ! !,10,25 February 2009,"Like Vinny said in ""My Blue Heaven"" - """"everyone thinks they have a sense of humor, even when they don't"""" if you didn't think this was one of the funniest movies, then you don't have a sense of humor, Im sorry to be the one to tell you, but your funny bone is broken. This movie has some of the best one liners since Henny Youngman, and is truly one of the best movies to just sit back and laugh. Lea Thompson is wonderful ""so long Ducky"", and Tim Robbins Im sure didn't have so much fun making a movie until 'The Hudsucker proxy', and Jeffrey Jones I bet liked doing this role a lot more than being the Principal in Ferris Bueller. I loved this movie when it came out, and I love it now.As for the critics who say it was poorly done, look again, and keep in mind this was 1986, and Industrial Light and magic was in its beginnings and not the C.G.

The duck suit was amazingly well done, just look around the eyes, at the movement of the beak and the facial expressions, then remember THIS IS NOT done on a computer. If this movie had been done today, they would have digitally added Howard later.So go ahead and hate Howard if you must, if you have no sense of humor, if you don't understand the brilliance of how it was made, and the reason it is such a cult hit, but just know that you will never be half as funny, half as memorable, or half the Duck that Howard is.",Howard the Duck
261,weasil-1,So Glad I Missed the Negative Reviews,8,13 March 2009,"Recently, I had the chance to watch this movie again, and afterward, watched the producer's and actor's comments and was surprised to learn that this movie was based on a comic book.I was 23 when I went to see this film with my husband at the walk-in in Wichita, Kansas. I thoroughly enjoyed Howard the Duck, though I did get a bit uncomfortable during the romantic scene where I thought Beverly and Howard were going to have sex. I found the Duck World reverse planet quite funny, with the movie posters, as it reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode. Back then, the costume for Howard was quite believable and acceptable, and after seeing this film again recently, it still works, amidst being inundated with CGI animation. The voice chosen for Howard really makes the character, as well as Howard's body movements.This film appealed to me musically, as I was a big fan of the 80's New Wave music, and still get a lump in my throat when I hear Thomas Dolby singing, ""Don't Turn Away"", and then another scene when Lea Thompson sings the same song as dejected Howard walks into the club. The Cherry Bombs all-girl band came across very believable, and recently upon viewing the producer's comments, I learned that the actresses used their own vocal chords to sing - no voice-overs with real singers. Wow, Lea Thompson is a pretty good singer! You gotta love the big hair then - what I call, the ""puff head"" look.There was some good laughs in the film, even Howard's interview when he goes to the Cleveland unemployment office was hilarious! You would only find an off-the-wall café in a Lucas film - Joe Roma's Cajun Sushi. The waitress was perfect!Dr. Jenning's (Jeffrey Jones) was a very memorable part of the film, as he did the transition from human to the Dark Overlord very well, and made me feel a bit scared, especially as his facial expressions and voice reminded me of scenes of the demon-possessed girl in, ""The Exorcist"", so, the thrown in lines like, ""If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen"", were comedic relief that added more fun to the movie. Seeing Jennings/The Dark Overlord shut the restaurant door to keep Howard and Beverly from escaping was very realistic and I now know why after seeing the hard effort put into making the scene where the tables and chairs seem to be pushed by some invisible force. The Dark Overlord creature itself was awesome, as it was scorpion-like, and scorpions do scare many people. Seeing this scene today, it looked a bit dated for that era as the creature looks faded compared to the other objects around it, and looks like it was pasted onto the screen. But, back when I saw it, it looked real enough to me. The only drawback to the movie was Tim Robbins part at the beginning. His character wasn't believable, but became more real, especially when he was in the ultra-light with Howard. Then his character didn't seem so forced and silly. He pulled the character off completely with the line, ""Try the seat belt, Howard.""I'm sure all the guys ogled at the scene where Beverly removes her robe and climbs in bed. If only I had legs like that!",Howard the Duck
262,lopan1,funnier that it looks,10,18 March 2003,I personally think that they did a great job on this overlooked movie. expecailly the 2nd half when they have jenning turned into a dark overlord(not to be confused with starcraft) for 1986 the effects of his ablities look rather good. and the voices jones does are rather cool too.,Howard the Duck

And Jeffrey Jones was phenomenal when possessed by the dark lord. He just ran with it and gave one of the best possessed villain performances I have ever seen. By the end I was laughing hysterically. It's certainly not the masterpiece Star Wars is but I think George Lucas got a bad rap. Everyone was expecting another movie like Star Wars but I think he was trying to have a little more fun. Because whatever else Howard the Duck is, it's a fun movie. It zips along at a nice pace and holds your attention. I'm going to have to find this movie and buy it because it really was a good time.",Howard the Duck
264,cgordonwalker,Fave Film,10,30 October 2018,"I had memories of watching this on the old VCR on my 8th birthday for the first time... well I had the memory of Howard anyway.
I remembered loving it as a kid... but fast forward a few years I had no idea what the movie was... just the duck.
Then I found it... sitting on the rack in the shop for $10... and i bought it and it was so good. Memories came flooding back and I still love it 30 years later.
This movie is brilliant. Lots of fun and that is all it was meant to be. Live and laugh a little.
Well done George Lucas... amazing.",Howard the Duck
265,manuel-grotsk,Disaster? What disaster?,8,27 July 2011,"To my french eyes, it seems that in US pop culture when something is considered as a disaster by a majority (mainly because it lost a lot of money, ugh what a crime) you can't really make your own opinion, you have to admit the disaster first (and then if you're a nerd you say ""no, no, it's a CULT gem for us nerds""). Why that permanent ""Disaster"" stamp? Did you personally loose some money in that project? No! So just enjoy that very good movie. I never thought the duck looked bad or inexpressive. The jokes are bad on purpose, because that character is a nihilist 30something: if it was Jack Black or Adam Sandler or Seith Rogan saying those bad jokes in the 2000's, it would fit perfectly as ""fine stupid 2000 humor"". So just forget the Howard problem, there is no Howard problem. And Heaven's Gate is just another great movie.",Howard the Duck
266,Stephsavr,"George, oh George, it went from star wars to this?",1,21 February 2012,"Warning:may contain spoilers.I am sorry if this offends anyone but Howard the Duck is probably the worst movie ever, and if it isn't it sure comes close. This movie is painfully bad and I am guessing that whenever someone brings up Howard the Duck to Lucas he tries to change the subject as quick as he can. I honestly can not see how anyone could possibly like this. I mean come on, a duck from outer space, and dark overlords coming down? And the special effects are the worst. Everyone in the movie acts as if he actually looks like a duck, but come on he is so fake! And when the dark overlords are coming down you can see how fake they look! I just cannot believe how bad this movie is.",Howard the Duck
267,Zuuzzo,A timeless camp classic,7,6 January 2015,"Howard the Duck from 1986 gets often bashed by movie critics all over the world. It's sometimes included in lists like ""The Worst Movies of All Time"" and to be honest it's easy to understand why it has a reputation of a total disaster.Let's face it. Pretty much everything is wrong in this movie if you take it seriously. It has a ridiculous story, more than stupid characters and some really bad acting. And above all the main character just looks freaking ugly. But could this kind of horrible movie be a timeless camp classic? That's definitely the case with Howard the Duck.If you look at this piece of garbage as a real movie you won't get much out from it. But in case you're into camp/cult classics and/or bad movies in general there's no reason for you to skip this one. It's easy to recommend Howard the Duck for those who are seeking for some entertaining bad movies to watch. If I would rate this one as a real movie I would probably give it one or maybe two stars. But as a camp movie this one gets a solid rating of seven stars out of ten.",Howard the Duck
268,sincak2002,C'mon,1,8 August 2004,How can this movie not be on the worst 100 list? Because it's based on a comic book from Marvel? Because it was produced by the Great George Lucas? C'mon! I had the unfortunate luck to be in Cleveland on business and (I thought) this was the only thing worth watching in the hotel. God almighty was I wrong. Not even good as camp. And I can't imagine a bunch of retard sci-fi convention geeks ever making this even a cult classic. But I guess you never know. There are a lot of stupid people in the world. If anyone ever recommends this film cut off your relationship and perhaps have the person committed. They're obviously not in their right mind and have no right out with normal people.,Howard the Duck
269,stuartbennett-online,excellent,10,14 September 2004,"i think this film is awesome, it is one of the best films i have ever seen and certainly the best film of its time. i am a bit disappointed though that there was never a sequel as i think a howard the duck 2 would be really good especially considering the kind of special effects that can be used today.the film is about a duck who gets pulled through space by accident when scientists at the Dynatechnics Lab in Clevland run their first full scale test of the laserspectrascope, later when they try to send Howard back home they accidentally release one of the Dark Overlords Of The Universe from the Nexus of Sominus where they have been exiled for eons. now only Howard can use the Neutron Disintigrator to stop the Dark Overlord from freeing his racing and causing the extinction of all life on earth.a great plot and a fantastic film a must see for all.",Howard the Duck
270,aztek_07,Movie of my Childhood,9,18 August 2019,"I am watching this movie again for the first time in 30 years with my five year olds, still holds a special place in my heart. Why would anybody give this movie a bad rating? It's like the MIB of its time. Didn't pick up on the dirty humor then, but man this is entertaining!",Howard the Duck
271,mccrackan-1,Direction and horrible f/x ruined a great script,6,7 May 2005,"Yes, there were better critter costumes in Flash Gordon movies. Yes, the pace dragged. But if you stop and actually listen to what the characters are saying, it sounds very much like a typical ""Howard the Duck"" comic book. (Or at least the ones written by Steve Gerber, which were the only funny ones.) Bringing comic-book dialog to the big screen is a delicate task--you can either sound campy, like the ""Batman"" TV show, or you digress from the true flavor of the source.Most people who saw this movie never saw a HTD comic in their lives, which made it hard to see beyond the rotting cheesiness. But fans of the comic would love to see Gerber's creation given another shot at movie stardom, especially with a competent director (Joss Whedon? Robert Rodriguez? Woody Allen?!) at the helm.",Howard the Duck
272,Superdude2185,Howard Rocks!!,9,29 December 2004,"I consider ""Howard The Duck"" one of the finest films of there 20th Century. Everything that is needed to make a modern masterpiece is there. From twisting plot to deep characterisation and the understated direction. Huyck's portail of tormented Howard makes a satirical look at 1980's American society and lifestyle and how it would effect you if you were a displaced Mallard.I would recommend this film to any hopeful satirical directors and screenwriters. It is a life affirming film, a ""Shawshank Redemption"" for airborne water dwellers. Tom Robins performance easily surpasses that in the adaptation of King's short story. Lea Thompson gives career best performance as a young punk looking for love that is found in an unlikely place in her feathered friend.A must see.",Howard the Duck
273,bonitajenssen,Hello?!!,7,9 September 2021,"First, this is a 1986 movie! Secondly, it's about a duck !!! Who has ended up on earth against his will .. Thirdly, it is a film that tried to address genres such as comedy, action, sci-fi and romance. It can not be compared to other big movies at the time, such as star wars, alien or scarface .. And if you did not see this movie until recently, you must not put too much emphasis on special effects .. I do not think the movie was super great, but it was far from bad when I first saw it.",Howard the Duck
274,richardish,Watch this film with your children or without!,10,9 May 2005,"""Howard the Duck"" is with out a doubt the most under-rated films of all times. I saw it when it originally was released, and enjoyed it very much then. And I find it equally fun now. If you have not seen this movie see what all the fuss was about. How could this gem ever be considered ""the worst movie of all times""? Just start with the cast, Lea Thomson is at her absolute cutest as the new wave rock star,""Beverly"". Her costumes are worth the price of admission alone. Along with Tim Robbins as the bumbling lab assistant ""Phillsy"" and Jeffery Jones as ""The Dark Over Lord"" the film definitely has star-power. The film also debuted ""Ed Gale"" as the main actor in the ""Howard"" duck suit. Ed has gone on to become just about the premiere ""Little Person"" actors of today.",Howard the Duck
275,valek0021,A movie I will always remember,9,21 November 2009,"I will never understand in a million years why Howard the Duck was considered ""garbage"" to most people. This film is the first film i can remember seeing at the theater and it was really a special film. First off Beverly, played by Lea Thompson was hot!! Especially the scene where she is laying in bed with Howard and he is so intimidated by her. Anyways i thought George Lucas did a great job with this film and even though it was considered a huge flop, it still holds a special place in my heart. From the beginning to the end this film was funny, sad, exciting, adventurous, and amazing entertaining. Look for a young Tim Robbins who was very funny especially when he was trying to escape the police with Howard. Howard was also extremely funny, like when Beverly offered him some milk out of a bowl and he said ""you got a beer?"" If you haven't seen it please give it a chance, you might like it. And please don't listen to the negative people because most of the time they are just looking for something to whine and cry about anyways. Howard the Duck will forever be a classic to me and I assure you my children will see this movie and hopefully love it as much as i did.",Howard the Duck
276,insomnihacker,Fantastic! Should be compulsory viewing!,10,27 May 2005,"This is my first movie review; I haven't really cared about any move enough to comment about it before but this is an all-time classic from the 80's, and indeed the same year as I was born.It's a superb family adventure with all the true essentials. The plot, although a little far-fetched is bubbly and imaginative, not to mention full of duck related puns and gags! This is the first time I have watched the movie since I was 4 years old and I still remember the punch lines and good bits. I enjoy it now as much as I ever did, if not more now that I have a hankering for duck boobies :)I'm not too sure about the mad scientist, turned evil space demon though. Not quite Disney material. There is some cool animation with the dark overlords and some for-the-time excellent special effects. Note also, when Howard is in his lady friend's place, when he is playing the keyboard - Watch his 'feathered' hands very closely. You can actually see the midgets finger-tips poking through the costume. Totally spoils the magic knowing that there is actually no talking duck, just a drunkard, wife-beating, over-worked, white trash, middle class midget.A must watch, and a must have a VHS copy.",Howard the Duck
277,ChrisBergoch,Best Marvel Movie Ever Made,10,26 July 2017,Howard was an inspiration. A hero. Best Marvel film ever. Best film of 1986. Best performance of Tim Robbins' career. Cherry Bomb was the best 80's band of them all. Howard sharing a bed with Lea Thompson's Beverly was more life changing than Slave Leia. '86 Howard (along with Ed Gale's signature voice) should have been there in the stinger for that well-received but lackluster 2014 film. Very dark day for all ducks on all planets.,Howard the Duck
278,Mattwallacebell,Great film,10,13 October 2007,"This was one of my high school favourites, I love the concept of the creation ""Howard the duck"", all the way through the film from the moment we see him on his planet. My opinion does not require the criticism and scrutiny of others, Jeffrey Jones, Tim Robbins, Lea Thompson, and all the cast and crew who made the amazing reality possible within this film deserve great credit. I am surprised that Willard Huyck has not done more similar work. This mythos would definitely do very well to have a remake or a sequel with today's ILM team or some one similar to do it justice. Let's not forget also the great performance of Ed Gale who made Howard the ducks character so enjoyable and funny to watch. Kind regards,Matthew.",Howard the Duck
279,Constantine_IV,It made my worst movie list,1,15 January 2006,"I've seen bad movies before. Even the so terrible that they become funny movies such as Pirahna 2. But this isn't one of them. It just sucks. Good acting, direction, special effects, where were they? Don't even bother watching it. It has now become a quest of mine to sit through the entire movie. I've tried twice and failed. I got about an hour into the movie but just couldn't stand it anymore. Damn you George Lucas!!! This movie joins Jason X, which at least provided a so bad it's good experience and the Hulk, which also just sucked. The costume effects are also lacking, which is important when the main character is in a full costume for the whole movie. I guess the movie's plot is so poor that the rest of the movie just could not succeed.",Howard the Duck

281,hypersipher,The best 2 hours I ever spent watching a motion picture!!!,10,18 June 2005,"Perhaps one of the best movies of all times, it has a childlike simplicity and charm. One thing should be clear though, this movie is meant for children or a very young audience.Many adult/older people will feel their ideals challenged since this movie plays with a variety of themes, settings and characters. This can cause a severe reaction, but the problem does not exist in the movie itself. If you are not an open minded person, do NOT watch this movie.I can relate to this movie since I love ducks, built several airplanes after watching the ultra-light airplane scene and totally love astronomy. It has some nerdy star-trek type words which are so cool!!! And its hilarious because Howard is the evolutionary advanced duck that can't even fly :P",Howard the Duck
282,ceds2003,Another Movie from the 80's Destined for DVD - Gets My Vote!,10,11 July 2005,"Ah, the eighties! What precious movie gems and memories galore! Howard the Duck was by no means the best movie of that era, nor in any era thus far, but it has been on my list of MUST HAVE DVDs and I'm still waiting... patiently. No. Howard's not for everyone, and if you remember him from his Marvel Comics appearances, you may have boycotted the film for lack of vulgarity. Tsk. Tsk... a pity. Nonetheless, Howard the Duck is a classic and, in my opinion, deserves to go on DVD as well as be considered for a remake or even a sequel. Come on! with all of the magic they can do in movies these days with CGI and digital effects, Howard the Duck should be a no-bird-brainer! Note: You don't have to have read the comic magazine to appreciate Howard the Duck. Just get a hold of this movie and watch it to see many of your favorite stars like Lea Thompson, Tim Robbins, Jeffrey Jones, etc. Oh and if you are a Ferris Bueller's Day Off fan, you'll dig the fact that three of that movie's stars appear in this flick too! Okay. Okay. Enough of my praise for this movie. Just go rent it or better yet, buy it and add it to your movie collection, especially if (WHEN) it hits DVD! - 'nuff said.",Howard the Duck
283,BASummers666,My fave film of all time,10,8 March 2007,"I don't' understand why people pan Howard the Duck.I think I first saw this movie when my Nan recorded it off the TV. I was about 10, so I didn't entirely get the more adult jokes, but that didn't matter to me. I thought that this was the best movie in the world ever. It's got action, it's funny, it's got scary bits, it's got a great soundtrack. To a child, this all makes for a good film. I still watch it now I'm an adult and it is still my most favourite film ever.In some of the above reviews, people have attacked the effects. OK, they're not fantastic, but most films of that time had poor effects. Take 'Terminator' for example, the scene where he's fixing his eye. The head was so obviously fake that nowadays it's laughable! I think it's a terrible shame that it's unavailable on DVD. I have the video and the soundtrack on vinyl.",Howard the Duck

Better than ""Short Circuit"" in my opinion but not better than TMNT from early 90's. The excellent cast saved the day in many cases here.Howard is a nice character that should be rebooted as well today and in the best possible ways.How could you feel yourself as immigrant ""alien"", as a stranger between the strangers? Just think about that and move out from Cleveland, then United States, if you dare! ;)",Howard the Duck

It's not a movie to take seriously and if you just sit back and watch it's entertaining. The soundtrack is excellent and Lea Thompson (Beverly in the movie, also the chick in Back to the Future that plays the mom) actually sings some of them. I definitely recommend this movie. The movie progresses quickly which kind of gives you a feeling that it should have been longer and more developed. Also, it's funny that they use some of the popular terms used in the 80's. Many of the lines are really cheesy but they are suppose to be that way. Anyways, I think this movie is great and recommend it.",Howard the Duck
