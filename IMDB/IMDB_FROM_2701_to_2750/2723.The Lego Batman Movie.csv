0,MartinHafer,Quite enjoyable....whether you are a Batmaniac or not.,8,22 November 2017,"My daughter has read a lot of Batman comics and she loved the film...and much of it was because she saw all sorts of inside jokes that the rest of us might miss. Fortunately, you do NOT need to be a Batmaniac in order to enjoy the movie, as a dopey old man like myself still got a lot out of the film. As for me, I was thrilled to see a Batman Lego movie, as in ""The Lego Movie"" this character was my favorite. Here, he's back...as broody and aloof as ever.The plot is pretty simple. The Joker is angry that Batman doesn't care about him nor does he see him as his personal nemesis. So, the Joker is out to hurt Batman by unleashing all sorts of wicked creatures on Gotham City. As for Batman, the self-centered jerk superhero learns to rely on others...starting with Dick Grayson, Barbara Gordon and Alfred.This is pretty much what you'd expect from the film...one that kids will no doubt enjoy and adults will enjoy or at least tolerate. To me, the best kids films are the ones with wide appeal....and it's hard to imagine anyone not liking this cute film.",The Lego Batman Movie
1,TheLittleSongbird,Batman celebrated in Lego,9,8 October 2017,"Was very pleasantly surprised by 'The LEGO Movie'. Initially wasn't sure as to whether a film based on a popular (and timeless) children's toy merchandise would work, but it ended up being one of the best animated films that year and one of the year's most entertaining.'The LEGO Batman Movie' was seen with higher expectations, knowing what to expect and being somebody who likes Batman very much, and was every bit as good if not better. Its only stumbling block is the last half hour or so, which tonally (with things taking a more dramatic and darker tone) felt too far removed from the rest of the film and not only did it lose momentum it also felt somewhat overblown. With that being said, 'The LEGO Batman Movie' was a sheer delight for Batman and superhero fans, anybody who loved 'The LEGO Movie' and wants to see a fresh take on Batman and superheroes will not be disappointed.Like with 'The LEGO Movie', the animation is really first rate, the vibrant yet dynamic colours are remarkably vivid to the extent that it makes the eyes pop, the backgrounds are immaculately designed, the characters look remarkably good in Lego form and a lot of the visuals especially in the action are very inventive. There is a bright and breezy soundtrack that compliments The Lego Movie beautifully, a lot of it is very catchy with a touch of humour while also giving room for a more understated touch.Again, the script bursts with imaginative verbal and visual gags, while there is a sharp wit, snappy dialogue and thick and fast jokes that all hit their mark. A lot of it is hilarious and makes the film one of 2017's most entertaining, but it's more than just comedy. There is a lot of poignant heart, block-busting action and some inspirational messaging. What makes 'The LEGO Batman Movie' especially good is how it feels like a celebration of Batman while mocking previous incarnations and his origins with glee.Story is fast-paced and energetic, with lots of humour and heart. There are a lot of characters here but not too many, the characters (heroes and villains) have their entertaining quirks and personalities yet the film really allows you to properly care for them as well. The voice work is exemplary, with note perfect turns from Will Arnett and Ralph Fiennes and actors who on paper sounded completely wrong for their roles actually nailing them (Zach Galifianakis could easily have been a disaster as Joker but was both entertaining and menacing, Michael Cera is also the most likable he has been in a long time).In summary, wonderful, perfect for kids and adults alike and a delight for Batman/superhero fans. 9/10 Bethany Cox",The Lego Batman Movie
2,SnoopyStyle,even better for Batman fans,8,20 September 2017,"In Gotham City, Batman (Will Arnett) is secretly billionaire Bruce Wayne. After saving the city from The Joker and his cohorts, he goes home alone to eat lobster thermidor and watch Jerry Maguire. The Joker is heartbroken after being rejected by Batman as his nemesis. He shocks everyone by surrendering. Commissioner Gordon retires and his daughter Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson) becomes the new commissioner. Bruce Wayne accidentally adopts Dick Grayson (Michael Cera). Bruce is still haunted by his parents' murder and resists any familial connections. Despite his butler Alfred (Ralph Fiennes), Bruce intends to send The Joker to the Phantom Zone with Grayson's help.This is lots of fun for comic book fans. There are lots of referential jokes. Batman fans will get more from this. I'm sure the Bat Shark Repellent is idiotic fun for the general public but it's super fun for anybody who have seen the 1966 movie. That goes for a lot of inside jokes. They work fine enough but better for a knowing fan. The voice work is generally good. Dick Grayson ripping off his pants is hilarious. I love the phew phew gunshots and the meow meow Catwoman. I would like for ""Bet on Black"" to be ""Bet on Bat"". This is a fun irreverent flick. I also love the Canadian Batman short. There is lots of fun to be had.",The Lego Batman Movie
3,Hitchcoc,A Funny Take on the Batman Story,8,21 October 2018,"I wasn't prepared to like this. Still, all the sight gags, the references to past super-hero characters, grow on you. There are lots of funny lines and Batman is a total, self serving jerk. The business about Robin being adopted is a bit much. But the world created with the popular plastic toys is remarkable. It's almost overkill. I think I may watch it again where I can stop and check out some of what they were doing. I think this franchise is doing much better than I imagined it would.",The Lego Batman Movie
4,Prismark10,Block party,6,12 February 2017,"A spin off from The Lego Movie, This is the heartfelt tale of masked vigilante, the dark brick knight living alone as Bruce Wayne in is own little island with only Alfred the butler as company.The Joker rounds up a pile of bad brick villains to take over Gotham City, the most crime ridden city in America but is dismayed that the clown prince of crime means nothing to Batman. Not even worthy of the term 'archenemy' or even 'I hate you.'.As revenge the Joker plots to unleash all the villains from the Phantom Zone where Superman has locked up General Zod and make Batman pay for his insolence.Meanwhile Bruce Wayne accidentally adopts a local orphan Dick Grayson, falls for new police commissioner Barbara Gordon and together with Alfred teams up to create new force to take on the baddies.The film is about Bruce Wayne learning to love again after losing his parents and embrace his new Bat Family. The film is disposable fun for both kids and adults. There are plenty of sight gags and references to other films and TV shows.The movie makes a nod to the previous Bat films and even the 1960s television show. There are plenty of obscure villains from DC Comics and characters from the LEGO Dimensions video games including Daleks presented here as British Robots and characters from other movies such as King Kong, Jaws, Jurassic Park and Agent Smith from The Matrix.",The Lego Batman Movie
5,nogodnomasters,You complete me.,10,30 April 2018,"I loved it, even if your kid didn't get the Dr. Who joke. Batman (Wiil Arnett) who talks a little like the Michael Keaton Batman, battles against all the super villains of all time including the Eye of Sauron, Lord Voldemort, Wicked Witch of the West, Gremlins, Matrix guy, the Kracken, Dracula, King Kong, Godzilla, and Daleks. Batman must also deal with his loneliness, feelings, and being honest with himself. Ralph Fiennes voices Alfred and not Voldemort...how bad was that for a miscast. I loved how the film satirizes the many aspects of Batman and superhero movies in general. Great script.",The Lego Batman Movie
6,kosmasp,Good Bat performance,8,4 July 2017,"Another hit involving Lego and animated movies. They seem to know their stuff and their audience. This works for kids but also for adults. It's funny as in silly but also has a lot of character moments in it. People who are into Batman will see glimpses of things they like and will understand on a different level than a young kid.The voice acting is as superb as you would expect it to be. The character of Batman leaves a lot of options where the story can go and what adults can take away from it. The mixture of drama and comedy is nicely drawn up and the movie does not stop, but has a nice flow to it. Animation is great as expected and while it may not have the Meta layer the Lego movie had, that actually works in its favor.",The Lego Batman Movie
7,classicsoncall,"""Come on Batman! Let's get groovin'.""",7,18 February 2017,"Visually, the LEGO movies that have recently been released affect me in a similar way that the Claymation films like Gumby and Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer do. I just can't warm up to the artistic style of the films. But with that said, this turned out to be kind of entertaining in it's own way. I guess the biggest kick I got out of the whole thing was the menacing voice of Batman, particularly during the opening sequence. What really surprised me here though were all the references to characters outside of your typical super-hero venue, and there were plenty of those with the figures of Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Green Arrow, Flash, Martian Manhunter and probably even more that I might have missed. But then, characters like King Kong, the Kraken from Clash of the Titans, velociraptors from Jurassic Park, Gremlins and the shark from Jaws all showed up, under the ever watchful Eye of Mordor from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I know those characters crossed studio lines, so however that was accomplished, I'd say it was done in great service to the kids who show up for the movie.As for the story, Batman goes through an introspective period in coming to grips with relying on others and establishing personal relationships with those who would like to consider him a friend. It plays out to a successful conclusion, and that can't be a bad message for the kiddies. Getting there, there's a whole lot of slam bang LEGO action, very colorfully done. Unless possibly, if one were to be a Marvel fan, in which case, you won't want to hear the password, so I won't mention it. Oh all right - 'Iron Man sucks', but you didn't hear it from me.",The Lego Batman Movie
8,gavin6942,Animated Movie of the Year,8,25 June 2017,"A cooler-than-ever Bruce Wayne must deal with the usual suspects as they plan to rule Gotham City, while discovering that he has accidentally adopted a teenage orphan who wishes to become his sidekick.Disney, Pixar, Ghibli, and so on... you can just skip 2017, because ""Lego Batman"" is the animated movie of the year. You cannot make a funnier film, you cannot make one with more action, and you definitely cannot pack more iconic characters and voices into one movie. It just cannot happen.Now, ""Lego Batman"" is not perfect. I found the message to be a little too sappy. But I suppose that was necessary, and actually makes sense along with the original Lego movie, which had a similar important message about the importance of family. (Which, by the way, was my least favorite part of that film.)",The Lego Batman Movie
9,jboothmillard,The Lego Batman Movie,8,11 February 2017,"The Lego Movie was a massive success for brick lovers all over the world, and notable for the scene-stealing moments of the supporting superhero character, so it was almost inevitable he would get his own movie, being a both fan of the world's best-selling toy and the character I was most excited. Basically Batman (Will Arnett) saves Gotham City from another take-over attempt by the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) and a host of other famous and not so well known villains, but the hero hurts his arch-rival's feelings, he does not see him as his greatest enemy, he says it is Superman (Channing Tatum). The next day, as his alter ego Bruce Wayne, Batman attends the retirement celebration for Commissioner Jim Gordon (Hector Elizondo), his daughter Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson) is taking over the Gotham City Police Department, she announces her plans to restructure Gotham Police without the need for Batman, which infuriates him. Joker and all the Gotham City villains crash the party, but not to cause havoc, they surrender, making Batman realise that without crime to fight and villains to catch he is irrelevant. At the same time, Batman discovers he unintentionally adopted orphan Richard ""Dick"" Grayson (Michael Cera), his butler Alfred Pennyworth (Ralph Fiennes) convinces him to take Dick under his wing, after intentionally revealing the Batcave to the youngster. Batman takes Dick, as Robin, with him to find out what the Joker is really up to, he deduces he is plotting in Arkham Asylum, he sees banishing the Joker to the Phantom Zone is the only solution, so Batman and Robin travel to Superman's Fortress of Solitude to steal the Phantom Zone Projector. After taking the device, Batman and Robin rush to the asylum to zap the Joker into the dimensional prison, but Barbara locks them up for Batman's irrational behaviour. In the Phantom Zone, Joker meets a host of the greatest villains who have been banished, including the Lord Voldemort (Eddie Izzard), King Kong (Seth Green), Sauron (Jemaine Clement), Daleks and Gremlins, they are all released when Harley Quinn (Jenny Slate) steals the Phantom Zone Projector. With Gotham City in complete chaos, Batman reluctantly agrees to team up with Barbara, as Batgirl, along with Dick and also disguised Alfred, to stop the Joker and the villains from blowing up the city, with bombs stolen from the Batcave. Arriving at Wayne Island, Batman ditches Robin, Barbara and Alfred to face the Joker alone, but he is zapped into the Phantom Zone himself, there the gatekeeper Phyllis (Ellie Kemper) makes him realises his selfishness and arrogance is villainous behaviour, he makes a deal to bring all the villains back into the Phantom Zone, in exchange for returning to Gotham. Upon returning, Batman and his allies, along with the other Gotham villains who felt neglected by the Joker, battle the other villains and send them back to the Phantom Zone. But the bombs are detonated, causing Gotham City to be split in half by an earthquake, Batman reluctantly tells the Joker he is the most important person in his life, together they, his allies, his rogues gallery and the citizens chain link themselves to pull the city back together. With Gotham City saved, Batman prepares to return to the Phantom Zone as agreed with Phyllis, but he is rejected, Phyllis has seen the good in him, Batman allows the Joker and the others to escape, but Batman is confident they will be no match for the combined team of himself, Robin, Barbara and Alfred. Also starring Siri as 'Puter, Billy Dee Williams as Two-Face, Mariah Carey as Mayor McCaskill, Jonah Hill as Green Lantern, Conan O'Brien as The Riddler, Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman, Adam Devine as The Flash, Jason Mantzoukas as Scarecrow, Doug Benson as Bane, Kate Micucci as Clayface and Riki Lindhome as Poison Ivy. Arnett is a fantastic choice with his gravelly voice to play the egotistical crowd-pleaser, Cera is good as his excitable sidekick, Galifianakis is a perfectly energetic Joker, and the supporting cast including Fiennes and Dawson are great as well. The special effects animation to create the realistic Lego pieces and fast-paced action sequences are brilliant; the references to everything in the Batman world, from the Adam West camp Caped Crusader days to the Dark Knight and Batman v Superman era are fantastic; and the witty script, full of mocking and deliberately obvious puns work really well, there is something for both the kids and the grown-ups in this new spin-off and send up on the comic book based franchise, a most entertaining computer-animated superhero action comedy. Lego was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Toys, and Batman was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",The Lego Batman Movie
10,Tweekums,An animated film that can be enjoyed by just about anybody,9,16 February 2020,"In Gotham one man stands alone against the assorted criminal masterminds; that man is Batman. He works alone and is knows that he is the best. Then a new police commissioner, daughter of the old commissioner, is appointed; she points out that for all his crime fighting Batman never actually captures any of the villains... she says it is time for the police to deal with crime not vigilantes. Then, to make matters worse his old adversary Joker, and the other villains turn themselves in to the police. What will Batman do now? He soon comes up with a plan. Working with his accidentally adopted son he manages to make things worse; unleashing the most evil characters in fiction upon Gotham. If he is to remedy the situation perhaps it is time for him to become a team player.I really enjoyed this film. On the one hand we get a great central story about Batman gaining friends while battling villains which provides plenty of child-friendly excitement and laughs; on the other we get a homage to Batman through the ages with references to previous 'proper' Batman films as well as the camp '60s version, not to mention appearances by obscure characters only a handful of diehard fans are likely to have heard of... I'd certainly not heard of several of them. We are also treated to villains from numerous non-Batman stories which were rather fun... I never thought I'd see Batman battling Daleks or Sauron! Viewers might not get all of the references but it doesn't matter as they are cool even if you don't know their origins. The animation is of a high quality with plenty of movement and the voice cast do an impressive job bringing the characters to life. Overall I'd recommend this to Batman fans of all ages or anybody wanting a fun film that provides laughs and excitement with little that might cause offence.",The Lego Batman Movie
11,tavm,"The LEGO Batman Movie is quite funny and touching, if you can believe that",8,15 February 2017,"Just watched this at the theatre my friend works at. We both seemed to enjoy it. It has many funny lines and scenes and references a certain movie and several other versions of Batman. This version has his sidekick Robin who hadn't been in the previous Batman movies made in the last 20 years. The Joker is the main villain as is expected. Superman also appears as does the Phantom Zone, where Supes' arch enemy General Zod was imprisoned. The LEGO animation is quite entertaining to watch and I thought it would have the same kind of ending as the previous LEGO one but no. Me and my friend really had fun watching this. There are also some touching scenes. Something about how it's important to have friends and a family to depend on. So on that note, I recommend The LEGO Batman Movie.",The Lego Batman Movie

13,grantss,"Okay, but a bit disappointing",6,1 October 2017,"After his appearance in The LEGO Movie, Batman now gets his own movie. We see his background, his alter-ego as Bruce Wayne and his lair. We learn how Robin got to be his sidekick. Most importantly we see his seemingly-interminable struggles with his arch-nemesis, The Joker. I enjoyed the original LEGO Movie: very funny, with snappy dialogue and very original graphics. The best thing about that movie was Batman: dark, intense and very funny and very well played by Will Arnett, who was perfect for the part.The LEGO Batman movie aims to capitalise on the success of that character. Will Arnett is back, and doesn't really put a foot wrong.However, the result is not quite up to what I was expecting. The humour of Batman from the original movie seems difficult to expand into a complete movie. In the original movie, Batman was a secondary character and his darkness and intensity was a great contrast to the general cheerfulness and non-seriousness of the other characters. Here he is required to carry the movie and set the tone, and there is no ability to play him off against a more jocular tone.This said, there are some very funny moments in the movie and the overall result is hardly bad. It just isn't as good as the original LEGO movie, especially tonally, and suffers as a result.",The Lego Batman Movie

Mnuchin . . .",8,22 February 2017,". . . into producing (that is, funding) THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE, which reveals many of the most nefarious attacks Mnuchin's boss Don Juan Trump (played by Batman here) and his Billionaire Scoundrel Squad are plotting against America's True Blue Patriot Normal Loyal Union Card People. ""Who always pays their taxes?"" Batman\Trump asks rhetorically at one point. ""Not Batman!!"" he thunders in answer, though many viewers at my showing shouted ""Not Trump!!"" When Robin questions Batman\Trump about ""Laws, Ethics, and Responsibility"" a little bit later, the man behind the ""Bruce Wayne"" mask grumbles ""I hate everything you just said."" Warner casts The Joker as Trump's Puppetmaster, Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad ""The Mad Russian"" Putin. Together, this pair of miscreants bring ""Gotham City"" (think America) to the brink of destruction by dividing its citizens, just as Trump and Putin are planning to outdo Herbie Hoover--one of Trump's Billionaire Oligarch Party predecessors--in transferring what little ""wealth"" We U.S. 99 Per Centers have left in our coin purses into the swollen coffers of the Fat Cat Job-Killing Corrupt Corporate Capitalists serving as Trump's Loan Sharks, which will rip a page from BATMAN producer Mnuchin's playbook to evict most of us from our homes, forcing us into squalid Trumpville cardboard box cities to perish as our ObamaCare, Medicaid, Planned Parenthood, and Medicare is stolen from us, Warner warns us with THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE.",The Lego Batman Movie
15,neil-476,"Very funny, especialy for comics nerds",8,15 May 2018,"Gotham's saviour, Batman, can triumph against villains galore, but his greatest battle is keeping his distance from those who care about him.
Review: I must confess that I never ""got"" the Lego versions of things. I can understand sets of Lego bricks themed to various trademarked franchises, but computer games and videos? Come on!But on reflection, Lego versions in the audiovisual world enable a property to be treated with humour and a degree of disrespect without denting the original, because the Lego-ising imparts a distance and other-ness which enables (in this case) Batman to be presented as a character who is recognisably derived from his comic-book original, yet has foibles and quirks which present scope for much humour.This is a funny film. The gags come thick and fast from start to finish. If you are a super-hero fan, there is much for you here. A DC fan? Even more. A Batman fan? Gags based on any and all iterations of Batman and his supporting cast, from his 1939 origin to date, and running through all screen versions, too. I was tickled to see the 1943 Lewis Wilson Batman serial referenced in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment. The rewards here for knowledgeable comic fans are huge.So it's a shame that I have to add a couple of criticisms. The voice casting is absolutely stellar - just look at the voice cast! - but, while I loved Will Arnett's Batman and Ralph Fiennes' Alfred, neither Michael Cera's Robin nor Zach Galifianakis' Joker worked for me at all. Worse than this, and a criticism I also felt applied to this film's predecessor The Lego Movie, is that so much of the action is so frenetic that it is really difficult to follow what's going on in front of you. The filmmakers write and storyboard and, because they know in advance what is in a particular sequence, that's what they see, without realising that the viewer might not follow it that easily.I think I must also say that while this is ostensibly a kids' film, there is much here which will soar over their heads - Batman's Batcave password being ""Iron Man Sucks"" being just an example!This is seriously good fun, nonetheless.",The Lego Batman Movie
16,morrison-dylan-fan,Batman's Lego kit.,9,5 June 2017,"Nearing the end of the half term holidays,I started looking for a movie that a friend could watch with her kids. Missing The Lego Movie when it came out,I was happy to hear from a pal that a Batman spin-off had been made,which led to me flying over to the Lego box.The plot:Spending decades fighting him,The Joker asks Batman to call him his arch nemesis. Wanting to remain a loner,Batman tells Joker that he will never say those words,due to not wanting any type of relationship with anyone. Attending Commissioner Gordon's retirement party,Batman finds out that Gordon's daughter is taking over. Shutting down the party,The Joker and all of the baddies in the city appear. Catching them off guard,The Joker reveals that they have all come to give themselves up,which leads to Batman finding himself without a job.View on the film:Given the challenge of handling the DC and Lego franchises,the screenplay by Seth Grahame-Smith/Chris McKenna/Erik Sommers/Jared Stern & John Whittington is incredibly fresh,with the gloomy mood of the live action DC flicks being crushed with a kaleidoscope of monster movies,Comic-Book, (not films) Fantasy flicks and 60's Doctor Who references,which gel thanks to the playfulness of the whole piece. Surrounding Batman with his own merch,the writers pull his wings with cheeky satirical clips,as Batman finds all his weapons skills and brooding one-liners to be hilariously dumped on the unemployment line.Building the blocks of Gotham , director Chris McKay impressively retains the handmade Lego quality,with the Batmobile and all of the characters being made up of separate blocks/pieces. Covering every corner of the screen with sight-gags,McKay makes the action scenes worthy of any ""live action"" flick with whip-smart whip-pans spanning Batman and Joker's exciting fights.Trying to keep up with his hero Batman, Michael Cera gives a snappy performance as Robin,while Rosario Dawson gives Barbara Gordon a toughness that makes her a match for Batman. Mocking the opening credits, Will Arnett gives an amazing performance as Batman,which balances a dry humour for the comedy with a surprisingly brooding psychological side,as Batman frees his wings.",The Lego Batman Movie
17,Mr-Fusion,A whole lotta fun,8,27 February 2017,"""The LEGO Batman Movie"" was a foregone conclusion, mostly because he's such a great character and probably the best thing about the original LEGO movie (as good as that was). And this movie lives up to the promise. It's a good story, with our favorite overconfident man- child forced to learn a life lesson, and Will Arnett returns to the role with gusto. More like owns. I've gotta be honest: even if the story were lacking, I still would've enjoyed this. I think it's because we've come to a point where the character is bankable as a dark and brooding entity but also in a spoofing capacity. The writers run amok with Batman's pop culture history here (to hilarious effect), paying homage to his greatest hits while poking good fun at his weirder phases (as well as the also- rans of his rogues gallery). When done right, the character can also be a lovable goof, and this movie is Exhibit A.8/10",The Lego Batman Movie

I can't say that I didn't like it, but Lego Movie was fresh, innovative and so it had such a much larger impact. Watching the LEGO Batman movie felt like rehashing the same thing to me.Also, while the first movie was about LEGOs, this one is only made with LEGO blocks, having its own independent storyline.

20,Hellmant,Has some great psychology; possibly the best of any 'BATMAN' movie!,10,15 February 2017,"'THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE': Five Stars (Out of Five)A spin-off to 2014's blockbuster computer-animated hit 'THE LEGO MOVIE', focusing solely on the DC comics character Batman (and his world). It was directed and co-written (with 4 other screenwriters) by Chris McKay (a regular director of the animated TV series'ROBOT CHICKEN'), and Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (the directors and co-writers of 'THE LEGO MOVIE') served as producers on this film. The movie stars the voice talents of Will Arnett (reprising his role as Batman, from 'THE LEGO MOVIE'), Michael Cera (Arnett's costar from the popular TV series 'ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT'), Zach Galifianakis, Rosario Dawson, Ralph Fiennes, Jenny Slate, Hector Elizondo, Doug Benson, Zoe Kravitz, Conan O'Brien, Jason Mantzoukas, Billy Dee Williams (reprising his role as Harvey Dent, from the 1989 live action 'BATMAN' movie) and many others. It's produced by Warner Animation Group and DC Entertainment, and it's of course based on the 'Batman' DC comic books and the Lego Construction Toys. The film has received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and it's expected to be a huge hit at the Box Office. I loved it as well. Batman (Arnett) is becoming more and more of a loner; and he fears getting close to anyone, because he doesn't want to lose them (like he did his parents). He accidentally adopts an orphan, named Robin (Cera), and Alfred (Fiennes) encourages him to bond with the boy. At the same time The Joker (Galifianakis) is plotting something, and the new Commissioner, Barbara Gordon (Dawson), wants to work with Batman to stop him. Batman of course rejects her help.The film is once again hilarious, like the original Lego movie, and it also, once again, has some great psychology; possibly the best of any 'BATMAN' movie. The characters are all really well developed, as well, and they're perfectly cast too (especially Arnett, once again). At first the drama feels forced, but it's also always comedic, and by the end of the film, it's also quite touching. The movie pretty much has it all, just like the first one, and it works on every level. It's also a really well made kids' film, that also appeals to adults (equally as well). The movie is definitely a 5 star film (just like the first one is).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc",The Lego Batman Movie
21,FeastMode,my notes,8,24 July 2019,"Hilarious, fun and entertaining movie, and also a very well made movie. so many clever jokes and references. my kind of humor, definitely smart enough for adults. and a good story with good characters and surprisingly emotional at times. visually mesmerizing with a great musical score. i love this movie (2 viewings)",The Lego Batman Movie
22,Pjtaylor-96-138044,An incredibly fun animation with plenty of jokes and visual flair that also has some important themes and a brilliant satirical edge.,9,6 February 2017,"'The LEGO Batman Movie (2017)' is the first spin-off film from the surprisingly excellent 'The Lego Movie (2014)'. It's an animated adventure that focuses on the caped crusader's struggle with both family and some of the greatest villains he's ever faced. I was tentative about the feature, since the first LEGO-based film seemed to be 'lightening in a bottle' and would be hard to match in terms of quality. Thankfully, the flick didn't disappoint and, while I don't think it's quite as good as its aforementioned predecessor, I think that it's one of the best animated films - and best Batman films, for that matter - of recent years.From the very beginning of the film, the witty satire and fast-paced jokes are instantly prevalent - in fact, before a single brick appears on screen, several genuinely funny jokes have been made. The opening sequence is a treat, especially to Batman fans. It immediately pulls you into the tone and style of the piece, effortlessly mixing clever set-up with plenty of visual flair. It made me smile immediately. The flick's break-neck pace keeps up for quite a while, which ensures no time for boredom. For me, the movie is at its funniest when satirising Batman's past appearances and his overall lore; the subtle parody and in-jokes never failed to make me grin. The film as a whole is constantly chuckle-worthy; it's genuinely hilarious, at times, too. It works as an almost parody, with an enormous sense of fun constantly present. I'd say it is the most enjoyable film experience I've had this year. The humour is generally pretty inclusive, so even if you aren't well versed in the lore of the caped crusader you'll find something to laugh at: be it sight gags, wordplay, potty humour or sly self-references. It manages to maintain a joyous tone and is a blast to watch because of it.Thankfully, the film knows when to pull it back a little and focus on character. This leads to several scenes that are actually quite poignant and able to affect you emotionally. The characters are all excellently written, as is the script in general. The writers manage to take pre-established characters and seamlessly integrate them into their own zany, plastic universe. Batman himself is arrogant, stubborn, ignorant and insensitive but still remains likable thanks to some believable motivation. He is different to all the other versions we've seen on screen, the zeitgeist of our cultural reverence for the character personified. He's self-aggrandising because we as fans have elevated him up to incredibly high standards. It's a refreshing and somewhat meta take on the character that works really well. He is also given a meaty character arc that, while a little predictable, successfully develops over the course of the film and culminates in a satisfying emotional conclusion. The other characters are all painted vividly too. Alfred appears as a parent figure for a teen-angst ridden Batman, and also gets more action than he has in his prior incarnations. Robin appears as upbeat and chipper as his 1960s counterpart, but he too is developed well and his almost camp nature provides more than a few laughs. The Joker is here, too, and is much better than Jared Leto's attempt at the character (in 'Suicide Squad (2016)'); he feels almost like Cesear Romaro's version, more mischievous than deadly. He has a unique relationship to Batman which provides another strong arc and also appropriately motivates him. The rogues' gallery of Gotham's super-villains is here in full force with almost every Batman villain appearing at some point. Most of them are just broad spoofs of various incarnations of each character, with several of them poking fun at their individual character's very silly nature (Condiment King, anyone?). Their brief but funny cameos are certainly appreciated, even if they generally have little screen time or impact on the plot.The animation here is excellent. The use of vibrant colours, a stop-motion aesthetic and fluid character animation really helps boost the visual engagement of the film. So much happens on screen at once that it can be, at times, difficult to discern everything that's going on. That said, you can always see the main action and these sequences are engaging throughout. The zany fighting style that has the characters bouncing around the frame really works with the established universe and tone. The voice acting is all great, too, especially that of Will Arnett and Zach Galifianakis. Their turns, as Batman and The Joker respectively, are some of the best incarnations of the characters and their delivery - while sometimes over the top - includes some subtlety that makes their arcs believable. There are also some cameos from famous people as the various villains, which is fun.Overall, 'The LEGO Batman Movie (2016)' is a wonderfully fun and vividly animated feature that rivals most of the other live-action incarnations of the dark knight. I had a blast from start to finish and a smile on my face throughout. The characters are well written and the flick has some genuine emotional impact, too. Besides which, it's really funny. The satire is on point and genuinely rather clever; if you're a Batman fan like I am, you'll have an extra layer of enjoyment. This is perhaps the best big-screen version of Batman we're going to get for quite some time. It's incredibly enjoyable. 9/10.",The Lego Batman Movie
23,ThomasDrufke,Because He's Batman,9,11 February 2017,"Collecting and smashing everything together it can from the Batman mythos, The Lego Batman Movie is exactly what the brand of DC needs. After a rough 2016 filled with endless amounts of unfavorable reviews, directors leaving, and crazy rumors, DC finally has another global hit. Unfortunately, this isn't an entry into the struggling DCEU, instead, it's the next installment into the rapidly popular Lego franchise. Although no Batman film will probably ever come close to the quality of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, The Lego Batman Movie does its very best to pay tribute to everything good and bad within Batman's history. Surprisingly, that approach works to near perfection. Perhaps because of my love for Nolan's Batman, I'll never prefer a comedic take on The Dark Knight, but this is exactly what this character needed. Poking fun at things like Batman's weird and sometimes unethical relationship with Robin, Gotham City's habit of being in peril (yet people still live there), the useless rogues such as Condiment King, Batman's unwillingness to work with others, and of course, the ups and downs of the character's theatrical runs.Just as Rogue One was a Star Wars film for hardcore Star Wars fans, this is a film for people who have loved Batman for years, even decades. There are easter eggs and hidden gems that will make even the harshest critics smile. I hate to keep bringing up DC's troubled live-action run of late, but this is such a pleasant surprise. It's the wake up call that Warner Bros needs to realize fans don't always need everything to be dark. Nor do they need to interfere as much with the director's vision. Chris McKay clearly understood Batman, and he gave us one of the best Batman scripts to date.The film isn't without its flaws, though. At 105 minutes, it definitely feels a little long for an animated feature. I probably could have done with a scene or two cut out as the ending battle did feel it was dragging on a bit. Also, because of the nature of a Lego adventure, the animation tends to feel a little too chaotic and even headache inducing at times. There isn't a frame that looks unfinished or flawed, but sometimes this type of animation is a lot to take in. The story is sweet and touching without being overly emotional (finding that perfect balance of comedy and drama), and manages to fit in so many quotable jokes and memorable moments. I never thought hearing what Batman's password is would make me laugh out loud. Nor did I think I needed to see Robin alongside Batman in a feature film again, but they made it work. That has to be what's most impressive, they made things work that shouldn't work in a Batman film, to extraordinary levels. The Lego Batman Movie is the film we deserved and most certainly needed.+Fits in so many tributes & jokes within Batman mythos+Balance of comedy and drama+Doesn't take itself too seriously (ahem DCEU)-A bit long & chaotic at times9.0/10",The Lego Batman Movie
24,ericstevenson,One of the best Batman movies,9,17 February 2017,"Yeah, I was a tad disappointed that this had little to do with ""The Lego Movie"" other than Batman appearing as a character. Well, there were cameos by other DC superheroes that were also in the movie. I was kind of hoping that they would use the same twist ending in this film as they did the original, but it's still a great movie. The best bits are actually probably at the very beginning where it seems like Batman is literally riffing on the movie in the very beginning, making fun of the logos. That's very clever and it shows that this movie wants to be funny from the get go.There are just so many hilarious lines in this and many scenes that I just couldn't stop laughing at. Unlike the laughtrack of a TV show, it's great to watch this in a theater as the laughter is authentic. It also helps that the animation in this is downright gorgeous. I guess it's not quite on par as the original Lego movie, but it's still beautiful. This is the kind of movie where there's never a dull moment. It's not just something like a Michael Bay film where it's stupid action over and over. Instead, we get observations on what's going on in a satirical way.The voices worked so well in this. I could have sworn that was Patton Oswalt voicing the Joker. I guess I'm just so used to hearing his voice in every cartoon I see. The pacing of the film is great. The final battle sequences are timed so well and we get a lot of action scenes that have great purpose. I didn't understand why there weren't any ""Star Wars"" characters in this, seeing as how the other Lego movie had them. I'd think you'd want to include elements from such a popular series, especially if you have the rights to them. For something with great joke after great joke, check this out! ***1/2",The Lego Batman Movie

26,lesleyharris30,"The Funnest, Zaniest Adaptation of the Batman Franchise we will Ever See,",9,15 March 2017,"The LEGO Batman Movie is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a phenomenal voice cast. The film is ridiculously great fun from start to finish, it takes one of the best parts of the LEGO movie, Will Arnett's Batman, and puts him in the lead role. I never expected so much hilarity in what is essentially a Batman movie. The only real issue I had with this movie is actually the very same one I had with The LEGO Movie, it tries really hard later on to become heartfelt and meaningful. I think the humour is just far too over the top and immature in the best possible way that when they start trying to actually add depth and humanism to their characters, it just comes across as forced. The voice cast is perfect, I would not have casted them any differently. They all stand out as excellent choices for a much more comedic version of these beloved characters. Will Arnett is stellar as Batman, Michael Cera's childlike voice suits Robin perfectly, Ralph Fiennes is well suited for Alfred in either live action or animation, Rosario Dawson adds a lot of purity to the film as Batgirl and Zach Galifanakis shines as a humorous, not so threatening Joker. I feel fans of Batman will be delighted to see an adaptation that does not take itself too seriously for once. Funny, beautifully animated and well casted, The LEGO Batman Movie is worth the watch for anyone looking for a good animation or family film, if you are like me, you will not be able to wipe the smile off your face. Batman must face up against some of his greatest nemesis's, as well as some new ones, while also starting a family.",The Lego Batman Movie
27,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,4 June 2017,"The Lego Batman MovieThe upside to Lego Batman is when he runs out of batarangs he can become a choking hazard.Fortunately, the Caped Crusader in this animated-comedy is well equipped.Batman's (Will Arnett) plan to banish The Joker (Zach Galifianakis) to the Phantom Zone backfires when he escapes - along with an array of other villains - and wreaks havoc on Wayne Manor.To stop him, the notorious loner must rely on his new ward (Michael Cera) and his butler (Ralph Fiennes) for assistance.Meanwhile, the new police commissioner (Rosario Dawson) moves forward with plans to banish Batman.A direct descendant of The Lego Movie, this silly spin-off featuring the Batman character brings levity to the Bat-franchise – especially self-awareness – but not all of the jokes are winners. In fact, this movie's frenzied pace does the comedy a disservice.Incidentally, the Lego Batmobile retails for about the same price as the real one.

28,ironhorse_iv,Everything is Awesome well almost everything.,8,22 February 2017,"When, I first heard that Legos was going to make a new movie that feature 'Batman'; I thought to myself, it must be, yet another mediocre, direct to video, animated movie, featuring the DC Super Heroes, like 2013's ""Lego Batman: The Movie – DC Super Heroes Unite"" or 2015's 'Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League – Attack of the Legion of Doom'. However, after doing some research, I found out this theatrical feature movie is not part of the films based on the video games series, but instead, a spin-off of the 2014's hit film, 'The Lego Movie'. Because of this, I was really excited and wanted to see this movie, as soon as possible. After finally seeing it, I can say, this movie was also awesome, despite the movie kinda go against Lego's founder, Ole Kirk Christiansen's policy of not having violence in a child's playtime. In my opinion, 'The Lego Batman Movie' is very much in the spirit of the first movie, and really build upon the Batman lore. We really do see a different side of him, in this film. Directed by Chris McKay, the film tackles the unique story of what would happen to Bruce Wayne/Batman (Voiced by Will Arnett) if he had no more criminals to fight against, after most of the rogue gallery had surrender to the new police chief, Barbara Gordon (Voiced by Rosario Dawson). Full of loneliness & guilt, Batman hopes to fill the emptiness of not fighting, by taking the responsibility of raising his adopted son, Dick Grayson (Voiced by Michael Cera). However, he cannot stop suspecting that his top arch-rival, Joker (Voiced by Zach Galifianakis) is up to something and try every step to prevent Barbara from doing her job. Can Batman built a family united or will his drive to put his enemies away, and make his community, safer, be his ultimate undoing!? Watch the movie, to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, 'The Lego Batman Movie' is a playful, witty homage to the DC Comics & Cape Crusader's film adventures over the years, while also bringing its own frantic sense of humor with inside jokes, sight gags, innuendos, breaking the fourth wall humors, slapstick, and pop culture references. Added to that, the film has amazing music and action that can appealing to both young and old audiences alike. However, the movie is without a few faults. Since the jokes are so rapid-fire in pace, some of the jokes might not land. While, most of the jokes didn't fall flat to me, I do think, for others, they might be a few that would. Nevertheless, there were a few things that I found jarring. Unlike its predecessor, this movie doesn't really make the ""real"" world a core plot point, and relegates the few moments of live-action to this instead. Said moments include clips of 1996's 'Jerry Maguire', the 1966 Batman TV series, and a brief shot of romantic movie covers. It was a bit weird to see. I thought, it would funnier to see Lego versions of these films, instead. Another thing that was weird was, since, this film takes place in a universe where all the previous incarnations of Batman has happened, in one point or another. How does Batman, not know of his previous relationship with Robin!? After all, during his 1966, 1992, 1995, & 1997 phrase, he kinda did have his dynamo duo, around. Also, how is it, possible that Joker is still around, if he died, during the events of his 1989 phrase? Just saying. Anyways, that brings us to the other fail of the film, the climax. It's really have to believe that Joker and the Rogue Gallery would had a change of heart, after trying to destroy the city, multiply times before, if anything, the film would had been better, if it's establish the connect, Batman has with the Justice League, a little better. I left that connection, was a loose-end that could had solve, with Batman's character development. It was also weird to see, other movie villains in the Phantom Zone, rather than other stronger DC villains. Despite that, the action was alright for the most part. It was nothing too violent for the kids. Yet, the combination of both stop motion and CGI is a bit hard to follow during a few action scenes. There was way too much things on the screen, going so fast that it's hard to figure out, who or what is going on. It's harder, to figure out in 3D. Still, for the most part, the movie's animation is break taking. A vivid display of visual grandeur of what would be done in the Lego Cartoon Universe with its CGI effects. Another great thing about this film is the voice acting. Arnett's gravelly tones and deadpan delivery are perfect for this reclusive, grumpy incarnation of the character. Another standout is Michael Cera's impossibly wide-eyed Robin, whose enthusiasm knows no bounds. It's been a long while, since I like a Michael Cera performance. Ralph Fiennes makes for a superbly dry Alfred, who becomes far more involved in the action than any of his forbears. Just wish, he did the voice for Lord Voldemort as well. That was a bit odd for Warner Bros to do. No matter what happen to that villain, Zach Galifianakis did a great job as the main villain. Far better than 2016's 'Suicide Squad' version of Joker. Also, I did like Rosario Dawson's performance as Barbara Gordon, even if it was a bit weird to see her character, be the love-interest to Batman, seeing how he was mostly a father figure to her in the comics. Overall: While, it might be a little darker/edgier than its predecessor, 'The LEGO Batman Movie' is a family-friendly film that stresses the importance of positive relationships and being part of a family. A great watch. It will have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face.",The Lego Batman Movie
29,Platypuschow,"The LEGO Batman Movie: Like the others Lego DC, but dumber",5,19 January 2018,"After watching all the Lego DC movies I decided to leave this the grand daddy of them all until last, and I'm glad I did. I'm glad I did so that I could see the contrast.You see all the others were lower budget straight to DVD affairs but the entire cast was made up of voice actors, legends within the industry like Troy Baker & Nolan North. This is the Hollywood version and instead is full of traditional actors, and that does the film no favours.Furthermore it's glitzy and colorful and stands out from all the others, you can tell it has money behind it. It does however play to the whole Lego world more so, and therefore the animation is worse and many scenes are stretching the imagination to breaking point.With countless DC villians and a few from other franchises such as King Kong and Voldemort they really went all out here and went with a Batman similiar to what you'd find in HISHE (2005) namely goofy, egotistical and a parody of the Batman we all know.Sadly the movie is inconsistent, one minute I'm enjoying the satire and cleverly integrated adult humour and the next I'm cringing at childish jokes & musical numbers.Credit where credit is due I see what they were doing here but alas this is so Hollywood it made my toenail ingrow.The Good:Looks greatBrilliant soundtrackPlenty of adult humour for the parentsThe Bad:Should have been the proper voice castDespite the budget the animation is worse than the straight to dvd filmsZach Galifianakis is the worst Joker everIncredibly hit and missThings I Learnt From This Movie:DC is the house that Superman made, but Batman has maintainedBatman doesn't pay his taxesIronman sucksLife doesn't give you seatbelts",The Lego Batman Movie
30,The-Sarkologist,Overtly Sentimental,4,1 April 2017,"I should start off by saying that I do feel sorry for the poor guy sitting next to me in the cinema because it seemed, like me, that he came to see this movie basically because it was Batman and it was done using Lego, however it became pretty obvious pretty quickly that his daughter had no interest whatsoever in seeing a Batman movie. I guess it is one of those drawbacks in having a daughter in that they tend not to appreciate things that boys tend to appreciate, namely Batman. Anyway, moving on I am going to say that I really wanted to like this film, it was just, well, overtly sentimental. Look, there were some really cool things about this film, such as having Sauron and other classic bad guys teaming up with the Joker, but in the end the film, to me, really didn't execute all that well – I guess it might have something to do with me expecting much, much more that it eventually delivered.So, as you can guess, the film is about Batman, and it is done (sort of) using Lego. Actually, I should probably suggest that it is an animated film using a Lego style because I suspect that it actually isn't filmed simply using Lego. However, what it does do is that it pays tribute to pretty much all of the batman films going back to the beginning of the franchise, and even has a few references to the current Justice League franchise, which even includes the tension between both Batman and Superman (though I suspect that that may have come from the comics, it is just that I don't particularly read that many comics).The thing with this film is that it plays up Batman's loner characteristic quite a lot, which is something that is heavily played out in the later movies. It seems that this whole Batman and Robin aspect is actually a thing of the past because it seems that many of us who have only grown up with the Christopher Nolan (and current) franchises don't see Batman as being a team player – it appears that Batman and Robin are actually a thing of the past. However, what this film seems to be doing is trying to recreate the Batman that was a team player, and actually had friends. However, it felt as if the moralising of the film – that is that it is better to play together than to play alone – sort of came across a little too heavy handed.What was cute about the film was that it brought out all of the franchise's villains, and even had Harley Quinn, a character that I had no idea existed until Suicide Squad. Sure, like many of the Batman movies, the Joker plays the role of the lead villain, and what is interesting is that all of the other villains are pushed to the back, namely because the Joker is sent to the Phantom Zone where he frees all off the really, really bad villains that end up there (though interestingly Zod isn't among them, despite the fact that Superman made mention of sending Zod there are the beginning of the film, but that doesn't matter because they have some other pretty good baddies). The interesting thing is that what the Joker wants from Batman is a little respect – it seems as if Batman's loneliness goes over to showing a complete lack of respect for his enemies as well (though showing respect for one's enemies is an interesting concept because respect and enemies isn't something that generally goes well together).What makes a good children's film is that it obviously appeals to the children, but also has the chance of appealing to the adults as well. This film actually had quite a lot of potential in that regards, however it didn't quite reach the mark. The concept was really, really good, and in part the film was very entertaining, however what ended up causing it to flop, at least in my opinion, was the rather heavy handed moralising. What would be interesting though is seeing where they take the Lego franchise from here.",The Lego Batman Movie

32,Reno-Rangan,All important movies start with a black screen...,8,14 August 2017,"As the new millennium began, alongside the LEGO films born, but it all started with the song, the breakthrough song 'Everything is Awesome' a couple of years ago. Since then, we all thought LEGO was a new format in 3D animation like Anime in 2D Animation. So I was expecting very eagerly what could be the second LEGO film. When they had announced it was going to be 'Batman', many 'Batman' fans were elated. So here we are.It took a longer time than expected to hit the screen. I'd lost hope in this, because all the sweet memories of the firs LEGO film were fading away from me. So I could not say or think anything about it. That's all changed once I watched it. While watching it, everything was restored like waking up after I was knocked down with a big blow to the head. That reminded how badly I missed it. One of the best animations. It can't be compared to the normal animation. It is more like a jerky type, similar to stop-motion, but done in softwares.Anyway, it was not about the animation. It was the story and dialogues. The best Batman film was a very serious film, but this one was so fun. For all ages, a non stop entertainment guaranteed. The surprise was all the villains coming together in one place. When the Batman ignores his arch-rival, the Joker, he is set to redefine his position to fight the Batman. His comeback endangers the whole Gotham city. Then the black clad, the Batman, with the support of his sidekicks, fights to save the city from devastating. The remaining is how it all ends.The voice-over artists were awesome, but first, my praise goes to the screen and dialogue writers. As I said, nothing was great in animation, especially if you had seen the previous LEGO film. All one can see is LEGOS everywhere, the world, the city, the characters made of LEGOS and then even the explosives and other special effects are kind of LEGO brick style visual. But top to bottom a very enjoyable film. An animation that should not be missed. Probably it could contest in the upcoming Oscars. Now all my eyes are towards 'Ninjago'.

34,tomgillespie2002,A very good Batman movie,7,28 May 2017,"Nobody quite saw 2014's The Lego Movie coming. An animated family film based on a hugely popular range of toys sounds like the stuff of nightmares, and something that could tumble a big studio if it didn't find an audience. However, it was a resounding success, both critically and commercially, managing to deliver an exciting, colourful and hilariously funny adventure movie with a poignant message about corporate takeover and the loss of imagination. One of the most memorable supporting players to emerge from the ensemble of wacky characters was Will Arnett's Batman, who proved so popular that we get his spin-off before we get a sequel to The Lego Movie. But this is no bad thing, as while it may not contain the same element of surprise as its predecessor, The LEGO Batman Movie is a more straight-forward blast.As the song goes, Batman is darkness and has no parents. After saving the city from an attack by the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) and his many cronies, the Dark Knight high-fives his adoring fans but returns to Wayne Island to microwave a lobster thermidor for one. While he may be awesome, he broods over pictures of his dead parents and isolates himself, although his trusted butler Alfred (Ralph Fiennes) is always on hand for advice. Newly-appointed police commissioner Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson) announces that she hopes to restructure the force to handle crime without the assistance of Batman, much to the caped crusader's amusement. Meanwhile, the Joker, locked up in Arkham Asylum, plans to manipulate Batman into sending him into the Phantom Zone, where he will be free to gather an army of mega-villains to launch an attack of Gotham and prove once and for all that he is Batman's greatest nemesis.Lego Batman is arguably a one-joke movie. It takes the character's persona from The Lego Movie - dark, broody and arrogant - and runs with it, building the entire plot around Batman's need to open up and allow other people to enter his life. Yet the film's kinetic energy and gorgeous animation mean that you won't care too much about the lack of a truly engaging story. Director Chris McKay was clearly enjoying himself having Batman's entire rogue gallery at his disposal, as well as members of other Warner Brothers franchises. Familiar villains such as Poison Ivy, Catwoman and Bane (riffing on Tom Hardy's take in The Dark Knight Rises) grace the screen, but we also get appearances from the more obscure Clock King, Kite Man and, most bizarrely, the Condiment King. Batman fans will lap it up, with references to his history in both comic-books and on the big screen, referring to the camp Adam West series from the 60s as ""that weird one"".Although this is Batman's first solo movie in Lego form, this is the opposite of an origin story. We meet him already in a set routine. When he isn't effortlessly kicking the butt of crime, he spends his time jamming on the electric guitar, beat-boxing, pumping iron, chowing down on lobster, and laughing at Jerry Maguire. If anything, Batman is a bit too obnoxious, and Arnett does slightly grate at times, but this is eventually balanced out by the introduction of Dick Grayson (Michael Cera), a highly capable and doe-eyed orphan who will become the scantily-clad Robin. The two gradually form a bond that provides the movie's emotional core, which, after an hour or so of Batman's jock shtick, is most welcome. The frequent references to pop culture, which are both clever and tiresome, often make it feel like an extended episode of Robot Chicken, and I believe this is what will divide most of the audience. It's not perfect, and it certainly isn't at the level of The Lego Movie, but if anything, this is a very good Batman movie. And Lord knows it's been a while since there was one of those.",The Lego Batman Movie
35,cruise01,Batman!!! Is back and being awesome!!!,6,11 February 2017,"Lego Batman is a lot of fun and heart, and Batman is by far the most amusing character in this spin off Lego movie. The Lego Batman Movie is a fair film compared to the fun energetic The Lego movie. The film has plenty of colorful impressive animation and visuals. I feel like the movie is less energetic when it comes to Phil Lord and Chris Miller style with the last installment. There is plenty of humor that adults and kids will enjoy. Even with many new character references that are added, besides the DC characters. The film does well poking fun at Hollywood studios and their way of presenting a movie. Like how Batman commentates about the Warner Bros. logo and how the black and dark style makes it seem cooler. And his comments on the previous Batman films are also hilarious, either poking fun at all the Batman movie titles. And even the newcomer Batman V. Superman. The plot follows Joker (voiced by Zach Galifianakis) who plans on destroying Gotham City. Until Batman (Will Arnett) stops him, and puts him away into Arkham Asylum. Batman's high egocentric personality is only topped off when the villains were loose. Now, that every villain is placed behind bars and Batman is left with nothing to do. Commissioner Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson) has announced that Batman is no longer needed. As Alfred puts it, that Bruce Wayne feeling of loneliness is getting to him. Until, Batman accidentally adopts Dick Grayson/Robin (Michael Cera). Then, Batman's suspicion about Joker's motives of being behind bars drives him to the edge. When he decides that he is going to need Superman's weapon to send the Joker to the Phantom Zone (an alien prison). I am impressed with the visual animation and the colorful direction. The action is entertaining and cute. Plus seeing other Easter egg of characters and references from other Hollywood films which was pretty cool and hilarious. Yes, the film does have a nice soft message about teamwork and having a family. But adding Batman's ego of being awesome is amusing. He was one of the favorite characters and to have his own spin off movie is even better. It could not have been voiced any better than Will Arnett. The film does suffer from being shadowed compared to the Lego movie. Such as the soundtrack was not as memorable nor was the plot. At least, the last film had an entertaining or obnoxious song to some people with its soundtrack of ""Everything is Awesome."" While this film relies on Dick Grayson's/ Robin music playlist of the 80s. Which is not the bad thing, but doesn't make this film memorable on its own. Or just lacking on its interactive energy. The Lego Batman Movie is fun, colorful, has comical characters, and is quite entertaining for kids and adults. I also had higher hopes that it would be better than Lego Movie. The humor and jokes is what made the movie. And I can not wait to see the next spin off Lego film.",The Lego Batman Movie

Batman consistently saves Gotham, has no family or friends and refuses to let the Joker be his greatest enemy. So the Joker decides to ramp up his typical evil schemes by creating an army that consists of cinema's greatest villains. King Kong, Voldemort, Sauron and even Gremlins. It's an exhausting list, which pretty much describes the film. Exhausting. The countless amounts of pop culture references melted my brain. Nearly every line of dialogue is self-referential. Whether it harks back to classic Batman films or shoehorning in Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up""...I just became numb to it all. Yet, somehow...I damn enjoyed this. This iteration of Batman is probably one of the best. Serious whilst hilarious. Cool whilst stupid. Suave whilst badass. Will Arnett's voice work is outstanding. The animation is stupendous and consistent with its predecessor. The plot is lighthearted with a good moral for younger viewers. Remember kids, teamwork saves the day. But it's the smaller finer details that really impressed me. LEGO Bane's voice imitating Tom Hardy. Agent Smiths repeating the same line. Narrating the studio logos. Referencing Adam West's Batman. ""You...complete me!"". It's fun just picking out certain references that make you chuckle. I do hate animations that utilise multiple annoying pop songs, and for some reason Michael Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"" was the most prominent. I get why, but urrrrrgh...why!? The LEGO Batman movie is lighthearted entertainment that everyone will admire, you just might need to take some time to mend you brain afterwards.",The Lego Batman Movie
38,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Endlessly fun, clever and a pretty refreshing take on Batman too",8,25 May 2017,"Who could have imagined that ""The LEGO Batman Movie"" would be the Batman movie we didn't know we needed? At first glance, spinning off ""The LEGO Movie"" take on the popular superhero seemed more like a goofy – but separate – iteration of the Caped Crusader for the family audience. But if Warner Bros. decided this movie and any possible sequels would be the only Batman movies we'd get for the next 5-10 years, you wouldn't find me complaining.From the opening minutes, ""The LEGO Batman"" movie gleefully entertains, making abundantly clear its dedication to silliness and, more importantly, its flippant attitude toward superhero movies. The spirit and humor – in addition to the visual style – of 2014's ""The LEGO Movie"" courses through this movie in abundance. The jokes are rapid-fire, with adult- and kid-geared gags in equal measure. But it's the way the script plays with superhero and ""Batman"" tropes in clever ways that really surprises and elevates the movie to the point that one can talk about it in the context of Batman's cinematic history.""The LEGO Batman Movie"" paints Batman, voiced brilliantly by Will Arnett, as a cocky, brooding, self-aggrandizing cynic who chooses to isolate himself because deep down the death of his parents makes him afraid of ever having a family again. At one point, noticing his master is a little down, Alfred (Ralph Fiennes) notes how Batman has acted this way a lot in the past, rattling off every year a Batman movie has been released including the TV show in the '60s. Story writer Seth Grahame-Smith and the rest of the writers on this film clearly view their plastic version of Batman as part of that long canon, and in many ways a response to it.After Tim Burton gave Batman his Gothic rebirth and Christopher Nolan used The Dark Knight as a way to tell a serious, gritty crime story, Bob Kane and Bill Finger's character had become completely encased in self-seriousness, and director Chris McKay (""Robot Chicken"") plucks him straight out. At the same time, this caricature is built on a foundation of what those iterations gave to the character.The film's main villain is of course Joker (Zach Galfianakis, blending both comic and dark takes on the iconic character), whose scheme Batman foils in a rollicking opening sequence. Yet in a classic superhero moment in which Batman must choose between stopping the bomb and letting Joker get away, they have a heart-to- heart in which Batman refuses to acknowledge their arch nemesis relationship, which brings Joker to tears. This parody of the ""we complete each other theme"" of 2008's ""The Dark Knight"" is spot-on. Heck, it might sound crazy, but LEGO Joker is one of the best superhero movie villains in the last several years given the way Marvel and DC's film studios have struggled mightily to present compelling, multi-dimensional antagonists in their movies. His desire to mean something to Batman humanizes him in this unexpected way. You'd expect a family film to just go for straight black and white, good guys and bad guys stuff.The story presents nice if not overly trodden themes of family and teamwork as the solo artist known as Batman is stuck with an orphan in Dick Grayson/Robin (Michael Cera) that he didn't ask for and a new police commissioner in Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson) whose message to Gotham is that Batman needs to work with the police, not just do things himself.More important than the way it interprets Batman and tells a Batman story for an age-appropriate audience, ""The LEGO Batman Movie"" stays true to the artistic style of ""The LEGO Movie"" by doubling down on the stop-motion look (Batman's scratched up cowl is a nice detail) and making explosions and other effects out of LEGO pieces. The use of voices for lasers and bullets is also a nice touch that evokes what it would sound like if you were make-believe playing with LEGOs. McKay doesn't lose sight of this being a LEGO movie told with LEGOs as the medium, which the boundless LEGO movies to follow this one would do best to mimic if they want to be as great as these first two.""The LEGO Batman Movie"" has a boundless energy that can be tiring and for some will even be grating, but ultimately that's what's so enjoyable about it. The movie takes its time to be clever and focus on the characters (watching Batman watch his lobster thermidor cooking in the microwave) despite all the busy, cool LEGO creations that fill the frame. The commercial pitfalls are there, but so far both LEGO movies have avoided them.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",The Lego Batman Movie
39,RosanaBotafogo,Cool...,7,25 December 2020,"I like these LEGO representations about Batman, because in the end it represents everything I think of him, boring, frowning, if he is egocentric, moody, almost an anti-hero, I love the ironies that could be not so long ... I don't understand why Batman sees Superman as enemy number 1 ...",The Lego Batman Movie
40,subxerogravity,A very Awesome Batman Movie!,8,10 February 2017,"I think the Lego Movie was better overall, but Will Arnett gets credit for being one of the best Batman ever. Even if it is just a parody, it's funny and very memorable. That's why they made an entire movie out of his supporting role in The Lego Movie. That and they could make some money out of releasing another Batman Movie.The animation was really spectacular on this one. Makes you forgive the fact that they don't use real legos. It's all CGI. Some of the cool vehicles they made, makes me want to go out to buy the whole lego collection (Most likely their plan).Great follow up to the Lego Movie. Very funny great animation and super action packed. It doesn't let down. Despite being made to poke fun at the Dark Knight, it's still A perfect Batman flick.http://cinemagardens.com",The Lego Batman Movie
41,jtindahouse,Blew me away,9,5 April 2017,"Back in 2014 when 'The Lego Movie' came out to some of the best reviews all year, I never got around to seeing it. Even though 'Batman', one of my favourite characters of all time, was in it I just couldn't work up the enthusiasm to see it because it seemed like a child's movie to me. But when 'The LEGO Batman Movie' came out I decided there was no way I could skip this one and from the opening seconds (I'm talking about before anything had even entered the screen) I was hooked. What an unbelievably funny, clever and genuinely interesting film. I can tell you one of the next films I'll be seeing will be 'The Lego Movie'.The writing in this movie in incredibly sharp. There was a tough balance to be found between being funny and actually finding a story interesting enough to justify a 'Batman' movie. They nailed it. Firstly, the humour is funnier than most out-and-out comedies manage to be. Every character was brilliantly written and created and added their own brand perfectly. Secondly, the story was actually very clever and surprisingly thoughtful.The only downside was that it ran out of steam a little towards the end. The jokes dried up a touch and it started focusing on its story and the action a little too heavily. Aside from that though it is a very hard film to fault. As we know in modern cinema 'Batman' is a character taken very seriously, so to see him done in this light is refreshing and makes for a very fun watch.",The Lego Batman Movie
42,DarkVulcan29,The Ultimate Batman Movie,9,15 February 2017,"This is a movie for kids and adults, cause kids that love Batman and superheroes in general, also the amazing Lego animation. But it also has adult jokes, that the grown would get, but it would probably go over the kids heads. This is what is missed in a parody film, that goes for gags instead of unfunny shock value that isn't always funny.Will Arnett does a pretty good Christian Bale impression, to the point I thought it was him. Everybody else embodies there roles perfectly with there voices. The animation really becomes a character itself. Takes jabs at every Batman ever done, and it's effective. I hope there will be more superhero parodies done by Lego.",The Lego Batman Movie
43,kevin_robbins,This is a magnificent delivery of the Batman universe and characters,9,14 October 2021,"The Lego Batman (2017) is a movie I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a self absorbed Batman not giving the Joker credit for his hijinks and the Joker using that lack of acknowledgment against the Batman to spawn his next mission to destroy Gotham and fly the coup. Can Batman make any friends to help him). This movie is directed by Chris McKay (The Tomorrow War) and includes the voices of Will Arnett (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), Michael Cera (Super Bad), Rosario Dawson (Deathproof), Ralph Fiennes (Harry Potter), Zach Galifianakis (The Hangover) and Billy Dee Williams (Return of the Jedi). The storyline for this is absolutely outstanding and well written in every way - from dialogue, to every subplot to primary plot. This is a magnificent delivery of the Batman universe and characters. The voices are perfectly selected and the one-liners are hilarious. The animation is wonderful and the action scenes are well delivered. I even love how they showed the extended WB universe including King Kong, Jurassic Park and Lord of the Rings. I would strongly fly recommend seeing this and score it a 9/10.",The Lego Batman Movie
44,stevendbeard,Great Batman Movie,9,10 February 2017,"I saw ""The LEGO Batman Movie"", starring the voices of Will Arnett- Arrested Development_tv, Jonah Hex; Michael Cera-Children's Hospital_tv, Arrested Development_tv; Rosario Dawson-Daredevil_tv, Unstoppable; Ralph Fiennes-Spectre, the Harry Potter movies and Zach Galifianakis- Baskets_tv, Up in the Air.This is a spin-off of the 2014 'The LEGO Movie'. Will once again voices Batman as a dark and relentless vigilante that works alone, and is darn good at it. The movie opens with Will giving his best Mystery Science Theater 3000 reading of what is happening on screen. One of the best things I liked about the movie is that there is plenty of humor along with the battles. There is also a lesson to be learned about needing help in your never ending battles against the forces of evil-it takes a village or in this case, a family. Michael voices Dick Grayson, who becomes Robin. Rosario voices Barbara Gordon, the newly appointed police commissioner-Jim Gordon retired-who also becomes Batgirl. Ralph is Alfred, the butler that basically raised Batman from a boy and Zach is the villainous Joker, who just wants Batman to acknowledge him as his number one arch nemesis. Lots of villains and heroes show up and it is fun trying to recognize the voices-I remember hearing Billy Dee Williams, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Conan O'Brien and even Mariah Carey. I checked in the end credits and there were more that I missed. There are inside jokes for adults and a flashback of some of the other actors who portrayed Batman; they used the actual film instead of the LEGO format and I loved seeing the 1966 Adam West doing the Bat-usi again! Overall, it's a great Batman movie. It's rated ""PG"" for rude humor and action and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",The Lego Batman Movie
45,drqshadow-reviews,"Biting and Satirical, Overstuffed and Scatterbrained",7,27 November 2017,"A sort of remix/spin off of the formula that worked so well in 2014's surprising Lego Movie. Lego Batman hits a number of the same beats, from the abundance of stand-up comics in the cast to the quirky visual stylings and snappy musical numbers, but it also carves out plenty of time to make its own mark. Which, in this case, translates to a whole lot of nudge-grin-wink references to the caped crusader's long cinematic ancestry and some good-natured roasts regarding his cagier moments in other media. Batman as a pop culture icon is ripe for this kind of deconstruction, and the film is often quite ruthless about it, which feels refreshing and leads to some genuinely inspired takes on the character. Occasionally it can get a bit too cute and overreach, but that goes with the territory. Not every shot is going to find its mark. The exceptionally quick tempo can feel overwhelming at times, though, especially when we're jamming a dozen punchlines into the same spot that's been reserved for an important plot point. It functions for a greater purpose in the end, keeping the younger audience entertained with bright flashies while half the jokes sail over their heads, but at some points it felt like I'd just downed a dozen cans of Mountain Dew and my eyeballs were doing cartwheels. Entertaining but a touch on the shallow side, it frequently toes the line between overstuffed fun and downright sensory overload.",The Lego Batman Movie
46,GiraffeDoor,The Dark Knight Satirizes.,8,6 August 2021,"This ticks every box I hoped it would.Well researched intertextual humor, splendid set pieces, vibrant comedic characters that go on an emotional journey and a generally self referential air with an *anything goes* air.The trend of taking notoriously serious characters and just pointing out how goofily serious they are doesn't seem to be losing steam as Batman here gets the same treatment that Robin got in Teen Titans GO!It's fun to see this kind of Batman and they went with a Vince Vaughn style plot i.e. ""I am totally unlovable, I wait...no I'm not!"" Well it's more about him opening HIMSELF up to people but they make engaging and fun, I swear.The plot is actually quite swell as the character development, the villain element and the world building all harmonize excellently.Oh, and they do actually make lego an aspect of it which I admired.",The Lego Batman Movie
47,alindsay-al,A great funny comic book comedy,8,10 February 2017,"So the first comic book movie of 2017 is with us and it comes in Lego form as the spin off to the Lego Movie, it is The Lego Batman movie. The premise of this film sees Batman at a high having to stop The Joker while trying to accept his new allies help. Will Arnett reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and totally owns this role , he knows how to totally make an awesome batman while also making fun of previous batman's as well. I thought he was really funny in this film and totally owns his own movie. Michael Cera plays Dick Grayson/Robin in this film and even though he can be a little annoying, it works well for this film and I ended up liking his character and his relationship with Batman. Ralph Fiennes plays Alfred seamlessly and I really enjoyed his performance, he was a great moral center for the film and I found him incredibly entertaining. Rosario Dawson fresh off her great role as Claire Temple in Marvels Netflix series voices Barbara Gordon in this film and she does a decent job. Her character isn't expanded on too much in this film but Dawson delivers enough for me to buy her as Gordon. Zach Galifinakis plays The Joker in this film and he adds a really fun twist on the character in this film. You see him eating up his relationship with Batman and Galifinakis totally adds lots of humor to his excellent performance. The story of this film has allot of funny moments in it and some quite heartfelt moments in it as well. I really liked how this film dealt with The Joker and Batman's conflict and it felt really new and fresh. However, there are certain story elements in this film involving some other characters that come across as filler and I just felt it hurt the overall plot as it absolutely leads to nothing towards the end of the film. The script has some incredibly funny dialogue in it with awesome references to the other Batman films and just films in general and I loved it. But I don't think the contrast between humor and drama in how the dialogue was treated compared to the situation. Sometimes I wish the film had stuck to its dramatic moments when they were happening instead of just giving it a cheap joke at the end of it. The style of this film looks great, probably even better then the Lego movie. The Lego world and Batman work together flawlessly and I loved the action scenes and how they were constructed in this world. Overall this is an incredibly entertaining film that is a must see film for all Batman fans.",The Lego Batman Movie

About halfway through this I just can't help but feeling like I've got enough LEGO in my life.Again, this movie isn't bad, it's just more of the same. That and while LEGO Batman was hilarious as a side character, he's not really able to pull this one off solo, especially not with the arc they put him on.End of the day, this feels like a decent candidate for background noise.

53,TheOneThatYouWanted,Falls off after the first 20 or so minutes.,4,18 February 2017,"Darn. Just darn. This film started out sooooo great! I was literally thinking while watching, ""Whoa, this is going to be better than the first Lego Movie."" Sadly that is not the case. The film slowly loses its momentum after the first act. The second act drags on. The third act plays out like a scene for a Micheal Bay Transformers movie; in other word the third act is just random CGI-chunks of garbage flying around the screen for 30 minutes. And a minor thing that bugged me was Batman and the Joker's relationship. Ever since the original The Dark Knight Returns comic, people have been overthinking the Batman/Joker set-pieces resulting in a flawed dynamic between the two. Why do you think we haven't had a relatively smart or entertaining original Batman/Joker study since 1995 on paper? Because of the lame stagnation of thought coming for people trying to milk the DKR story to death. And here is an lame and pathetic example of which. That is just my two cents and a bonus tangent. Before anyone points out Nolan's Joker to me, I'll remind you that Nolan's Joker was ripped off the pages of some of the earliest incarnations of the Joker from the comics. But whatever, this film ultimately is a huge letdown and time will come to prove me right, once the hype dies down.I swear. If Batman Forever and Batman and Robin would have been released this year, the majority of people would 'love' them because marketing and hype told them to do so. I'm seriously worried about the future.",The Lego Batman Movie
54,rgkarim,"It's awesome, because you know... he's Batman!",8,11 February 2017,"You can build with them, you can imagine with them, and thanks to technology you can now play games with them. I'm talking about Legos, the lovable building blocks that have spanned across all genres in their themes. Like everything, Hollywood is happy to use it as a medium for pictures and this weekend we get the second adventure in brick land. Will Lego Batman hold the same gusto as its predecessor from years back? Or will it fall and smash into a million pieces? Robbie K is back with yet another review to help with your movie choices. LIKES  Funny  Lots of Movie References  Plenty of Comic References  Action packed, yet not violent  Fun morals built into a decent storySUMMARY: If you remember the first film, you remember that it was not only fun, but funny. The same can be said for the sequel, as Batman and his colleagues lead the charge in another rambunctious adventure. Will Arnett as Batman takes point, delivering hilarious dialogue that we loved in the Lego movie, which is only further amplified by Michael Cera's nasally, high- pitched presentation. Amidst cheesy lines, constant bragging, and fancy one-liners is a comedic goldmine that will have both kids and adults laughing in their seats. Yet, it was the comic and movie reviews that this reviewer loved and how clever their integration into the story was. Gremlins, Lord of the Rings, and ridiculous 1960s Batman references are just a fraction of the nostalgia present in this movie, which will certainly bring back some fond memories for older fans, while hopefully inspiring younger generations to research. But if comedy doesn't keep you entertained, perhaps the exciting, kid-friendly, action will provide the entertainment you need. Batman and his assistants have enough Kung Fu, laser blasting, building destroying moments to keep one hooked into the adventure at hand until you get to the fun moral filled moments. Speaking of which, Lego Batman continues the trend of tying a lesson into overall story, which didn't feel preach at least until the end, then it is super preachy (though funny) delivery of the overall lesson. Overall the adventure remains fun, fast, exciting, and humorous, which is always refreshing to watch. HoweverDISLIKES  Action is short-lived  Comedy sometimes gets stuck in banter  Batman Villains take a bit of back seat  Not the first one quiteSummary: I get it, Lego Batman isn't meant to be the next action, stunt movie of the year, however it still would have been nice to see a little more pizazz to their fights. Batman and company have some cool kung-Fu moves, but the directors simplistic repetition of these moves grew stale without some extra twists. Unlike the Lego movie, Lego batman also didn't use the master builder power quite as uniquely, even though there was so much potential to be had. In addition, the comedy also was a slight step down for me as well. Think about the diversity in Lego Movie, where each character has their own style of making us laugh and how well it mixed together to keep things fresh and fun. Batman's style again was very one dimensional, and while there were a bunch of well-timed one liners, the general theme of ego is the central focus, well that and his stupidity sometimes. For me, it kind of grew stale (again) to be subjected to endless banter and drawn out dialogue. This staleness may have been broken had they integrated the villains into the movie a little more. I don't know about you, but when I think of Batman I also think of, you know, the bad guys that make up his universe too. Unfortunately, Gotham's psychopaths and crime lords take a back seat, (to again an enjoyable twist), and it would have been nice to integrate some of them into the mix a little better. You can see that many of the dislikes come from comparison to the Lego Movie, and while this film is good, for this reviewer it just did not match up to its predecessor. The Verdict:Despite the dislikes though, Lego Batman is an adventure well worth the wait. The movie will deliver the laughs, fun, and comedy promised by the trailers, and will entertain all ages (especially if you get the references). Lego Batman is one of those movies designed to be fun, but hasn't lost the uniqueness or imagination that many films lack. As mentioned earlier, most of the dislikes come from a comparison to the Lego Movie, but if you can separate the two, then one will certainly enjoy the adventure to be had with this film. Is it worth seeing in the theater? Absolutely, and may be one of the few movies where 3-D adds to the experience (note I did not see it in 3-D). Lego batman is a perfect fit for a geek's night out, family outing, or if you are like me going solo for a laugh. My scores are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5",The Lego Batman Movie

My expectations were also still a bit low due to this being a DC movie, but I was still looking forward to seeing this. I saw this movie in theaters, and I had a lot of fun. Plot - This movie is silly and simplistic. There are a few really dumb plot deceives, but most of it is pretty solid. Overall, this movie is very funny and enjoyable. I heard someone call this movie ""the PG DC version of Deadpool."" I wouldn't really say that its on the level of Deadpool, but a lot of the humor is similar (minus the violence).Characters - The voice acting in this movie is fantastic. The characters are all funny and interesting. The character arcs are well-executed. All the performances are great. Animation - The animation is awesome. Overall, this is a very interesting movie.

Chockful of fourth wall humor and tons of brick and mortar action, this movie features an all star cast of superheroes and villains, not to mention cameos from other franchises and classic Lego toys to make up for what's the longest of the Lego movies. There are some moments when the adults laugh a lot and there is kiddie humor as well. I highly recommend seeing this while it lasts in the theaters to get the full experience.

It certainly set itself apart from its predecessors both in tone, story and obviously look. This film may not be very memorable and have direction but it earnt a few laughs. It was a nice touch to include different villains from different comic and film universes. It was also very silly in a positive way. You certainly can't take this film seriously and if Batman were to have a slumber party and have a pillow fight it might as well be a Lego movie. The film adaptations have certainly taken a big turn with this movie. Overall it was easy to watch a silly, absurd film with no concrete story because of the laughs and interesting additions in the film. This film might suit the immature teenager or adult and would be a treat for the kids. While I don't challenge the high reviews it is humorous to see a fair number of viewers and raters of IMDb are kids, immature teens and adults.",The Lego Batman Movie
59,bkrauser-81-311064,Solid Followup,8,10 February 2017,"There is no denying today that The Lego Movie (2014) is an amazing cinematic accomplishment. At the time of its release it had all the irreverence, chirpiness and sly pop culture references audiences didn't even know they wanted yet. In addition, it was endowed with sumptuous animation, excellent voice acting work and a soundtrack that included the year's most infectious ear worm. With a bar set that demonstratively high, the film's inevitable followup simply can't compete, can it? Well no... but I am glad to say that despite being noticeably weaker than its predecessor, The LEGO Batman Movie still sticks the landing with the force and magnitude of a superhero falling with style. Much like the original, this movie is chock-a-block with the same frenetic energy and anarchic spirit. The jokes, in-jokes and meta-jokes flip and somersault across the screen with the voracity of talented gymnast and they simply don't let up until the credits roll. It's actually kind of dizzying at times, like feeling the shaky rambling of a rickety wooden roller coaster or getting hit in the dome with a jai alai ball.The smartest thing about LEGO Batman is it seemingly does more with less, at least in regards to themes. While the first LEGO film used the fever dreams of an imaginative young boy to call attention to everything from existentialism to corporatism, LEGO Batman simply channels its ""victory through teamwork"" epigram and calls it a night. It's a simple message, but its one worth hearing and in this case the whistles and bells are provided freakin' Batman! Batman, you know, him right? He's the DC Comic staple whose last on-screen incarnation had his head so far up his a** he didn't notice Zack Snyder's Superman/Jesus parallels. He's also the guy who in the first LEGO movie was relegated to being a one-joke supporting character. He's just as self-absorbed, self-loathing and self-aggrandizing in this universe as he is in any, only this time those closest to him are actually call him out on his sullen, lone-wolf routine.It's a funny joke though one would wish that it didn't overstay its welcome. Let's face it, dressing down and picking apart the Dark Knight is about as common nowadays as picking one's nose yet LEGO Batman is poised to probe just as many clever observations as obvious ones out of its title character. The most frustrating and repetitive gag in the bunch is Batman (Arnett) and Joker's (Galifianakis) titan-esque battle for the heart of Gotham being reduced to a one way relationship full of Serendipity (2001) quotes.Then of course there's LEGO's wonky product licensing which, granted, provides a killer third act but doesn't shake my dismay that we're currently living in a late-capitalism nightmare. I'll try not spoil it, lest to say its funny how in both LEGO films they've managed to sneak on seemingly every IP from the last quarter century. This time around however, everything having to do with Disney is conspicuously absent.Regardless of how you feel about licensing however, there's no denying The LEGO Batman Movie is a largely successful followup to its wildly popular prequel. What it lacks in originality and spunk it compensates with enough spontaneity to keep families happy while providing enough in-jokes for Batman fans to enjoy. It doesn't hold a torch to The Lego Movie but then again, what does?",The Lego Batman Movie
60,Abdulxoxo,A very different side of Batman,8,27 February 2021,"Parts of the plot are interesting in that there's a side to Batman that hasn't been shown before. The idea that when he's not fighting crime he's just a lonely guy sitting at home watching romantic movies is pretty funny. He's a man who grew up without his parents and deep down wants to be part of a family. That aspect of the film was interesting.We also see a storyline which involves The Joker believes that he's the villain Batman hates most of all, but having an identity crisis when he discovers he's not necessarily Batman's worst enemy. The way that storyline develops was also pretty good.
This movie isn't driven by plot however. What drives this movie is the jokes and the level of detail involved in spoofing all the previous Batman's. The writers have integrated elements of each previous incarnation into this film. Throughout the movie you have to be constantly looking at background and listening to lines of dialogue and it was impressive how much references there were to the old films and TV show. After a while though it was quite a struggle trying to keep up with everything that was going on the screen. They moved so quickly and packed so much in that I felt I was missing a lot, which was a bit annoying. wish they'd slow down. Similarly, with the jokes, there were so many. there were probably at least ten before the film even started. For the first 20-30 mins it was hilarious as there were jokes every few seconds. None of them were laugh-out-loud worthy but they were mostly amusing. That was great for a while, but at some point, there were so many jokes that they were starting to lose their comedy impact. I truly think that if they edited out a lot of the average jokes, but strategically placed the best ones, that would have had a much bigger impact. One of its redeeming features was a great soundtrack. The pop tunes featured throughout the film were used well, comically and dramatically. Overall, There were individually brilliant things all through the film, but they packed too much in, which meant the best parts struggled to shine through all the averageness.",The Lego Batman Movie
61,Terryfan,Holy Lego Batman,10,5 June 2017,The LEGO Batman Movie is one of the most entertaining movies in so long that it is hard not to find any enjoyment from this movie.The movie appeals to fans of Batman and Lego in general. To think that we would have seen an movie based on Batman in Lego form would have never been thought possible.I saw the movie opening day and I can tell you that it was one of the best times I ever had at the movies.Lucky the cast and crew were able to make it a great film for everyone.The animation is very impressive and well timed it shows that the animators wanted the movie to go right and they did.It's clear to hear that the cast was having a lot of fun voicing in this movie because they manage to be funny and serious with their roles at the same time. They pay respect to the roles they are playing along with making the movie work in every way possible in terms of acting with emotion. The Score in the movie really helps make the story work with nods to all generations of Batman.Some of the comedy was some of the funniest I had hear in so long that many in the theater laugh that it was so out of control. They manage to make the jokes work in the movie as a win win though some I felt didn't work as well as the others.It's hard to pin out what didn't make The Lego Batman Movie such a thrill and fun ride trust me if You're a Lego or Batman Fan this will be the movie for you.I give The LEGO Batman Movie an 10 out of 10,The Lego Batman Movie
62,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Lego Batman delivers everything you'd possibly want it to show.,9,1 April 2017,"The Lego Batman Movie is the spin-off of 2014's The Lego Movie, and it uses that movie as a mightier stepping stone and develops its take on Batman as a comically dark and over-serious superhero who is at great odds with himself. Lego Batman is funny, pretty for the viewer to admire, and Chris McKay directs this movie with a wholehearted story that is also a condensed homage to The Dark Knight's 78 years of history.Bats puts on quite a show making himself out to be the best of the best, so much so that he isn't on an equal emotional level with anyone, not even with his greatest enemy: The Joker.Does this little animated film really count as a Batman feature? Yes. It absolutely does count in the Batman film canon. It honors it, yet exploits the inherent silliness The Dark Knight suffered along the way (like Bat-nipples), particularly in the late 90s.This film breaks the fourth wall occasionally, and it's entertaining for both kids and adults. It's a Batman film for fans, and soon-to-be-converted fans.Drop the Bat-mic! This film is an achievement in homage fiction! And gorgeous animation!",The Lego Batman Movie
63,Pumpkin_Man,Quite Possibly the Funniest and Greatest Batman Movie I've Ever Seen!!,10,10 February 2017,"Wow, this movie surprised me. It was a lot better than the original Lego Movie and passed my expectations. It was hilarious in showing how arrogant and stuck-up Batman is and great throwbacks to the previous Batman films and the TV series from the 1960's with Adam West. The last four Batman movies are good, but they're very dark and dreary. This one is just flat-out fun. It spoofs the Batman mythology, but respects it at the same time. So far, this has been my favorite movie of 2017. Batman is the dark vigilante of Gotham City. After defeating the Joker yet again Batman hurts his feelings and tells him he means nothing to him. The Joker soon comes up with a new plan to bring Batman and Gotham to its knees. Batman will need the help of Robin, Alfred, Barbara Gordon and many others to defeat Joker's army of villains. The movie is much better than how I'm describing. It's hard to do so without spoiling all the great surprises and hilarious nods to other great films. If you love Batman, Superman, and the DC universe, you'll love THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE!!!",The Lego Batman Movie
64,Prashast_Singh,"Shows you the completely funny, unseen side of Batman...as great as THE DARK KNIGHT.",10,1 May 2018,"While looking for another Batman movie after watching the epic Dark Knight trilogy, I found this movie on Prime Video. I had heard about it earlier too, but couldn't get to see it. When I finally watched it, I was really impressed, entertained and had a smile on my face.THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE is as funny as THE DARK KNIGHT was dark. In this film, while you get to see the unexplored funny side of Batman, you also get to see the Joker in a kid-friendly way. The film is replete with impressive action and totally hilarious comedy, and the animation is one of the finest I've seen in recent years (I haven't seen any other Lego movie till date). The film's tone is funny but also doesn't forget to deliver some light yet heartwarming emotional scenes.THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE is a film which can be enjoyed by both kids and adults. The film takes you on a fun ride which you would want to be a part of, even more. And of course, apart from all other scenes, just don't miss the climax because it pays a remarkable tribute to the much loved, ""hate"" relationship of Batman and Joker, which is bound to make you smile.",The Lego Batman Movie
65,blott2319-1,Just what Batman always should have been,9,20 May 2020,"I have some fairly radical opinions when it comes to The Lego Batman Movie, and I doubt most people will agree with them. First of all, I didn't particularly like The Lego Movie all that much. The frenetic and wacky humor did little to make me laugh, and I found it kind of obnoxious in parts. However, the one thing I enjoyed more than anything else in that film was Batman. He consistently made me laugh. Which brings me to another one of my controversial opinions, that Batman is an overrated superhero and he works better as a goofy caricature than as a gritty vigilante. As a result, The Lego Batman Movie might just be my favorite of all the Batman movies I've seen. It has a silly irreverence that had me laughing, and it pokes fun at many of the ridiculous tropes that come with the caped crusader. Will Arnett sounds perfect in the lead role, and I adored the stark contrast of Michael Cera playing Robin. His childlike ignorance was adorable, and just what this movie needed to drive home the theme of teamwork and family.For longtime fans of these characters, there were more inside jokes and references than you could possibly count. Even for someone like me, who is more of a casual observer, it was well worth paying close attention to find little Easter Eggs they hid in the movie, even in the voice cast. The visuals were great, because it has the aura of the first Lego Movie, but the world has a distinctive ""Gotham"" feel in the color and lighting. I did find the handful of times they referenced back to the first film to be a bit tedious. We don't need that added layer of Batman being a ""Master Builder"" thrown into this movie at all. I'll also say that the ending, while bombastic and exciting, got a bit muddled in what was happening. I lost track of characters, and then when they started shifting loyalties and goals it became chaos. I didn't mind all that much because I was having so much fun up until that point. The Lego Batman Movie is what I was looking for in a film about the dark knight, and because my opinions on the subject are so weird, it might not be the same for you.",The Lego Batman Movie

What would Batman do then?Where do I start? Lol!! This may be the best Batman movie ever,,,, well, no. However it's definitely one of the best. I loved the entire thing.

67,kz917-1,Entertaining Enough..,6,3 July 2017,I have to admit I laughed a lot while viewing this movie. It did seem to drag a bit in the middle. It is great fun to play name that voice as all the characters roll by.Batman has relationship issues. That is the central theme. His dislike of Superman and really all the other Superheroes is displayed in all facets of his life. The password to the BatCave is Iron Man Sucks. That alone made me laugh every scene it was used.Funny. Something for the whole family. Rental.,The Lego Batman Movie
68,ProjectAnomaly,The Lego Batman Movie,8,2 October 2019,The jokes are all really well timed. I honestly thought it was way funnier than the OG Lego Movie.,The Lego Batman Movie
69,aciessi,Totally Batty,7,23 April 2017,"I never saw The Lego Movie, but from what I saw from little clips, it looks like a thoroughly funny movie. Great especially for little kids. I went to an SU campus screening, followed by a lecture from the producer of all Batman movies and TV shows, Michael Uslan. I really had fun. This is a silly movie, for sure. The jokes come flying at you, like the best of David Zucker. DC fans need to make sure they watch it again to catch all of the comic book references. The cast is huge, and super funny. What more can you say?",The Lego Batman Movie
70,rockman182,The LEGO Batman Movie (2017),6,19 May 2017,"Disclosure. I didn't love The LEGO Movie, everyone else in the world may have though. That being said, I didn't really care to see this film. I like Batman and all the films associated with the Caped Crusader but this LEGO take on him didn't really interest me. I watch everything though so I did check this out with low expectations. While its not as bad as I thought it was, I'm not really sold on the LEGO franchise films and don't really anticipate to enjoy whatever future installments that may be planned for this series.The film is a comedic take on Batman. He fights crime but is actually very lonely. He has no one to really share his life with despite being popular and having a cool mansion and cool gadgets. He adopts Robin (who is actually quite greatly voiced by Michael Cera), falls for Barbara Gordon, and has to face his arch-nemesis, The Joker. You get a bevy of other Batman characters and villains, and oddly enough you also get villains from other franchises like Voldemort and Sauron. If you are a fan of LEGO and the first film, you may feel like you're in heaven watching this.The film is similarly animated to The LEGO Movie and carries on being gag heavy. While I appreciated some of the jokes, there is just too many and they come at you too fast. You have to keep up with everything. I appreciated some of the witty references though. It's a light hearted take on a franchise that is notoriously dark (apart from whatever Schumacher was going for with his films). I did think the relationship and interactions between the Joker and Batman were pretty great.The film runs out of steam about halfway through and its hard to keep reacting to what is going on in the film. Its not a bad film really but I just can't see myself coming back to this film again or being optimistic about any other LEGO based movies (I just know there are many more to come; the LEGO cinematic universe is upon us). I think the film offers a really good voice cast who all shine through in their voice performances. Its just that this wasn't a memorable experience for me. 6.5/10",The Lego Batman Movie

72,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"A fun film filled with flashy action, pop culture references, and dialogue written by a 10-year-old.",7,8 March 2019,"While The LEGO Movie (2014) did a good job of initially not making its universe seem like it was just in the imagination of a 10-year-old child, The LEGO Batman Movie (2017) dispenses with that illusion and goes full-bore into the child-like mind. From the dialogue to the wide variety of licensed characters to the regular ""pew, pew pew"" sounds made when guns and lasers are fired, The LEGO Batman Movie steps right into what you'd expect a movie about a children's building toy would be. Of course, with Batman being one of the best characters from The LEGO Movie, it's no wonder why he was first to get a spinoff film.Regarding plot, it was simplistic. Kids would certainly be able to ""get"" that family matters, even if they aren't biologically related. But fear not adults, there's plenty for you in this film as well. Perhaps the best mark of an animated children's film is the references put in it that make the adults laugh with recognition. The fact that the movie acknowledges and accepts ALL the canon of the Batman universe made me appreciate it just that much more. And yes, I'm talking the 1960's Adam West version of Batman, as well as some of the obscure (and canon) characters like the ""Condiment King"" (yes, he's real).The fact that this broad background of material supports the film's jokes does make it a little alienating for those who are unaware of its lengthy history. Fortunately, there are enough references to the recent material (like Joker's plot in The Dark Knight (2008) and Bane's voice in The Dark Knight Rises (2012)) that will give most adults a ""ha!"" moment or two. Still, there's plenty attributes about the plastic building blocks that are also included in the film, to comic effect as well.A fun film filled with flashy action, pop culture references, and dialogue written by a 10-year-old, I give The LEGO Batman Movie 3.5 stars out of 5.",The Lego Batman Movie
73,RforFilm,NAnaNAnaNAnaNA BATMAN! The Lego Batman Movie is a fun parody and tribute to everyone's caped crusader,9,10 February 2017,"Later this year, we'll be getting the first part of the Justice League movie. With the previous movies of The Man of Steel, Batman V Superman, and Suicide Squad, a lot of major DC fans aren't too sure how the next movie will improve on things. One character that's been getting a lot of talk is Batman. Who can blame them, as Batman seems to have overtaken Superman as the most iconic and loved superhero. I too love the character and I'm always looking forward to the next big thing with the caped crusader. So how strange is it that the latest movie with Batman happens to be a comedy?Speaking of comedies, one of the best in the past few years was The Lego Movie. It was fast, quip, very unique with it's humor, and topped it off with some stellar animation. What was though to be a giant product placement (and probably is) turned into what had to be one of the most libertarian stories of all time. The Lego Movie is something that I've seen several times and I continue to find new things. To expand this universe, their version of Batman now gets his own movie in The Lego Batman Movie. In what has to be a giant tribute to everything fun about Batman, almost every villain he's faced is working with the Joker (played by Zach Galifianakis) to detonate another bomb to destroy Gotham. Of course, Batman (played by Will Arnett) takes everyone down, stops the explosion, and then tells the Joker that he's not his greatest enemy. Hurt knowing that he's not the greatest villain, Joker develops a new plan to show that he is important. Meanwhile at Jim Gordon's retirement party, his daughter Barbara (played by Rosario Dawson) announces that the police would like to work with Batman to finally end the caped crusader's vigilantism. To top things off, the Joker arrives with every other super villain to surrender.This puts Batman in a state of boredom until he decides that Joker must be banished to the Phantom Zone (the place where Superman sends General Zod in the second Superman movie). With help from his accidental adopted son Dick Grayson (played by Michael Cera) who is taking up the mantle of Robin and his butler Alfred (played by Ralph Fiennes), Batman succeeds in his mission, only to find the Joker has a major comeback planned.I cannot spoil what Joker does, but it follows on the continuity of how The Lego Movie is built, but it's crazy and over-the-top. Over the top are the three words to best describe The Lego Batman Movie. I mean that in a good way, as the film works as a major satire and tribute to everything that is Batman. What's stranger is that this is a way better Batman movie then last years Batman V Superman. The people making this clearly understand that character better and even give Batman a better character arc. Will Arnett has to be the perfect choice for this kind of Batman; tough and intimidating, but also full of himself and very selfish. You still sympathize with him as he learns about his various figures of ""family"" and tries to movie forward in his dealings as the crusader. While I can say the everyone else was great, I was surprised by how quick Michael Cera was as a funny Robin.The Lego Batman Movie is another ""joke a minute"" story that's similar to The Lego Movie. If you didn't like that movie, this'll probably not sway you over. What's hard about this movie is that The Lego Movie just seemed like a perfect script. This isn't perfect, even though I laughed a lot. It's just that the original movie set it's standards so high that the expectations are now at an intimidating level. I'll give this nine Lego Batmans out of ten. This should provide a good example on how a parody should be done in Hollywood. It's been a while since we've gotten a good parody like this. Kids and their parents should have a fun time with this Batmanmaybe even more then the live action one. Take your capes, masks, batarangs, and batman shark repellent to the movies and laugh as this caped crusader makes your happy.",The Lego Batman Movie

This one lacks the song and is not a surprise.The movie is an assault on the senses. It is loud, bright and frenetic. There are laughs for people of all ages. Like most Batman movies, it is a tad on the dark side. The fight scenes are a bit redundant. The live action clips are fun.If you can't get enough of Lego action, not to worry, attached was a trailer for another Lego summer release. The movie looks good on the big screen.

75,bankofmarquis,"Fun for BATMAN, LEGO and MOVIE fans alike!",8,11 February 2017,"THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE is my second favorite Batman movie of all time.And it will be yours, too.No matter whether you like the brooding ""Dark Knight"" Christian Bale Batman, the serious Ben Affleck Batman, the less-serious, quirky Michael Keaton Batman, the nipple-suited George Clooney Batman, the self-serious Val Kilmer Batman or even the campy 1960's Adam West Batman, this Batman has something for you that will leave you entertained and glad you re-entered this world.Credit has to go to the creative team behind these Lego Movies led by Director Chris McKay (an Editor of the first LEGO Movie) and a bevy of screenwriters.  They have found the right tone of action, humor, seriousness, fun and pizazz that audiences of this generation are looking for.  These Lego movies are what the Shrek movies were in the 2000s and the Toy Story Movies were in the 1990s - good, wholesome fun films for the whole family that are appropriate for kids but bring enough entertainment - and smart humor - that will keep the parents (or those of us older ""non-kid folks"") smiling and enjoying ourselves throughout.The plot is pretty thin - riffing on the loner, darker Batman who must find some light in working with others and building a family - but it is how this film plays out that makes it fun.Starting with the voice work.  The underrated Wil Arnett is pitch- perfect as the arrogant Dark Knight who bursts onto the scene to save Gotham City - yet again - from a nefarious plot by the Joker (perfectly voiced by Zach Galifinakas, who, surprisingly, reigns himself in for this performance).  Batman is joined in his quest to defeat the Joker - and a new crew of villains - by his faithful butler, Alfred (again, perfectly voiced by Ralph Fiennes).  Complications arise when the new Police Commissioner, Barbara Gordon (a well cast Rosario Dawson) and an Orphan by the name of Richard Grayson (Michael Cera who hits the right notes as well) try to ""work with"" loner Batman.In writing the previous paragraph, I noticed how much I was praising the voice work in this film - and I need to - for there wasn't a false note in the cast.  From the aforementioned performances to the myriad of cameos as some major Super-Villains, this film moves quickly from character to character and sequence to sequence, bringing some heart and humor, but never lingering on any one character or one sequence for too long.  But, whenever a famous voice pops up, they serve this film well.  The fun will be in trying to figure out who is voicing who.  My advice, don't look at a cast list until AFTER the film, the surprise in some of these voice performances is part of the charm of THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE.  This film seemed like a group of friends got together to have a good time - and a good time was had by all - including the audience.As an aside, there is a brief appearance by the LEGO JUSTICE LEAGUE (Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, etc) with Superman voiced, as it was in the LEGO MOVIE, by Channing Tatum.  I gotta admit, I would much rather have a LEGO JUSTICE LEAGUE film than another brooding, dark film which is what the new JUSTICE LEAGUE MOVIE is looking like it is going to be.For fans of the first LEGO MOVIE, you will enjoy this film - though it does not have the emotional punch to the gut that the ending of the LEGO MOVIE did - but that's okay for the creators fall back on good old fashioned fun - and fun you will have - whether you are a fan of LEGOS, a fan of BATMAN or a fan of MOVIES, the LEGO BATMAN MOVIE is for you.Letter Grade A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)fMarquis)",The Lego Batman Movie
76,Anurag-Shetty,One of my all time favorite Batman movies. Right up there with The Dark Knight Trilogy.,10,17 February 2017,"The LEGO Batman Movie is a spin-off of The Lego Movie(2014) & continues with the adventures of the Lego version of Batman/Bruce Wayne(Will Arnett), seen in that film. Batman protects Gotham City from the Joker(Zach Galifianakis) & several other bad guys. He must also take care of Robin/Dick Grayson(Michael Cera), the young boy he adopted. The Joker comes up with his most deadly plan yet. Now, it is up to Batman with the help of his allies, to stop the Joker from executing his dastardly plan. The LEGO Batman Movie is an amazing film. It is on par with The Lego Movie(2014). The animation is unique & flawless. It is fantastic how the animators over at Warner Animation Group, bring these Lego figurines & building blocks to life. The highlight of the movie, is how it references & pokes fun at all the previous big screen incarnations of Batman. The 3D immerses you into the proceedings on screen. This film is hilarious, with the one-liners being delivered by all the characters, non-stop. It also does justice to the sentimental aspects of Batman's story. Director Chris McKay has impeccably brought to life, a totally different kind of Batman. The actors who have lent their voices to the various characters, are spot on. Will Arnett is spectacular as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Michael Cera is adorable as Robin/Dick Grayson. Rosario Dawson is excellent as Batgirl/Barbara Gordon. Ralph Fiennes is superb as Alfred Pennyworth. Zach Galifianakis is outstanding as the Joker. Jenny Slate is awesome as Harley Quinn. Jason Mantzoukas, Conan O'Brien, Doug Benson, Billy Dee Williams, Zoe Kravitz, Kate Micucci, Riki Lindhome, Eddie Izzard, Seth Green, Jemaine Clement, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Adam Devine, Hector Elizondo & Mariah Carey are brilliant in their cameos as Scarecrow, The Riddler, Bane, Two-Face, Catwoman, Clayface, Poison Ivy, Voldemort, King Kong, Sauron, Superman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Jim Gordon & Mayor McCaskill, respectively.

The Lego Batman Movie does the same, but this time limited to the Batman universe. That makes it a little more narrow in how many people who will actually understand every reference there's made through out the movie. But that's actually the only downside to this movie, because even though you don't get every little reference the delivery is still top notch, because we have such good voice actors behind the bricks. The animation is as spectacular as The Lego Movie with beautiful backgrounds and surprisingly detailed character animation applied to what in real life is stiff and very limited regarding movement.

79,dave-mcclain,This Lego movie is even better than the original and leaves me anxious for what's next.,8,12 February 2017,"In 2014, we became acquainted with an ignorant but arrogant billionaire with orange hair who wanted to rule the world. Call him President Business. Well, that's what they called him in ""The Lego Movie"". (What? Who did you think I was talking about?) The process of defeating that cartoonish villain involved joining together a vast array of different characters who had to learn to put aside their differences and work together to wrest power from that evil businessman-turned-politician. (Yes, of course I'm still talking about the first Lego movie.) All this may sound scary, but the animated feature film that I've been describing since the very beginning of this paragraph had some important lessons to teach about teamwork and the specialness of all people – whether they're made out of plastic or just look and act plastic on screen. Ignorant arrogance like this can also be very funny (as long as it's fictional) and ""The Lego Movie"" delivered on that promise. Doubling down on that kind of humor is that movie's 2017 spin-off ""The Lego Batman Movie"" (PG, 1:44), an inspired mashup of Danish toys and American comic books.To simply say that Lego Batman is a loner is like referring to the Unabomber as anti-social. Batman / Bruce Wayne (voiced by Will Arnett) lives in Wayne Manor with his devoted butler and father figure Alfred (Ralph Fiennes), but still chooses to spend all his time alone, watching movies or staring wistfully at a photo of him with his long-dead parents. Even when he's in public (whether as Batman or as Bruce Wayne), he treats the citizens of Gotham as his subjects and only wants their adulation. Batman gives himself full credit for keeping Gotham crime-free and is convinced that he's the only one who can do it – and that he doesn't need help or advice from anyone. This Batman probably thinks that the first film's Oscar-nominated original song ""Everything is Awesome"" was written for and about him and his life. (The character could have also written the film's tagline: ""Always be yourself. Unless you can be Batman."") A high-class gala thrown to honor the retiring Commissioner Gordon turns out to be an extremely consequential gathering. As Bruce Wayne struts through the crowd, the original Commissioner Gordon's daughter, Barbara (Rosario Dawson), who is taking over for her father, begins making a speech in which she calls for the police to work more closely with Batman – as a team (an idea which makes him spit out his drink) – and to limit Batman's autonomy (think, the setup for ""Captain America: Civil War""). Just then, the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) shows up. The day before, as Batman was foiling the Joker's latest plan to take over the city, the two argued about how important they are in each other's lives. When Batman refused to admit that the Joker is his main nemesis (saying, ""I fight with a lot of people. I like to fight around.""), the Joker's feelings were hurt. Now, at the gala, Joker suddenly switches tactics. He surrenders to the new Commissioner Gordon, confesses to his crimes and asks to be sent to prison. Oh, and earlier at this same gala, Wayne accidentally adopts young orphan Dick Grayson (Michael Cera).Batman decides that the Joker is up to something, but he's not sure what it is, so he comes up with a plan to get rid of him for good. Batman includes his new ward Dick Grayson (now called Robin) because he considers Dick expendable. The two of them go to Superman's Fortress of Solitude where they see Superman throwing a party for the rest of the Justice League's super angular superheroes. Nevertheless, Batman takes advantage of his fellow heroes being distracted by the party to steal Superman's Phantom Zone projector so he can send the Joker into the Phantom Zone. The problem with that plan is that it would put the Joker in the company of some of the world's greatest villains, a situation which could end up unleashing untold evil on the world, and forcing Batman to enlist the help of his fellow members of the Justice League (and others) as he confronts his biggest challenge ever. Just don't expect Batman's ego to go quietly into the sunset (or the Bat Signal) – or for the Joker to be so easily defeated.""The Lego Batman"" movie is an inspired and extremely enjoyable crossover between Lego's growing animation efforts and established DC Comics characters plus a long and diverse list of others. The plot makes full use of the potential inherent in combining such diverse and storied properties – and effectively builds upon what made the first Lego movie so popular. The script (which combines the efforts of five different writers), along with Chris McKay's direction is both funny and just plain fun, a lot of that due to the juxtaposition of Batman's self-centered intensity with Robin's innocent earnestness. All of the voice work is top-notch, but Will Arnett's ignorant arrogance as Batman is really what makes the movie. He's as humorous as any of Will Farrell's similarly pompous live action characters (e.g., as Ron Burgundy in the ""Anchorman"" movies or as race car driver Ricky Bobby in ""Talladega Nights"") and –whether intentionally or not – reminds us of the attitudes, words and conduct of some American politicians. This Lego movie is even better than the original and leaves me anxious for what's next. ""A-""",The Lego Batman Movie
80,swilliky,Funny combination of a superhero and animation property,7,11 February 2017,"LEGO takes another step into animated movies with one of Warner Bros. most popular properties. Batman (Will Arnett) is the crime-fighting, cape crusader, but in a cocky, narcissistic billionaire form. He's just defeated the evil plan of his nemesis Joker (Zach Galifianakis) but goes home to a lonely house where the only company is his butler Alfred (Ralph Fiennes). When he attends a party for the naming of the new commissioner Barabara Gordon (Rosario Dawson), he accidentally agrees to adopt the orphan Dick Grayson (Michael Cera). The Joker has come upon an even more diabolical plan by freeing every supervillain from the phantom zone. The Warner Bros. bench of franchises can really be explored in this film as it draws characters from Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, King Kong, Godzilla, and Wizard of Oz. Batman's self-centered nature causes the primary amount of trouble as he continues to try and solve problems because he lacks any other sort of fulfillment in life.

Funny and fresh take on the Batman characters, this film is truly one of a kind. There's a wide variety of cameos and the writing is sharp.

82,brankovranjkovic,The Lego Batman Movie - Awesome again,8,11 February 2017,"This is a spin-off film with lots of tongue in cheek humour, which features a great combination; one of the most popular superheroes with the world's most popular toy. An action packed, high energy, brightly coloured animated film, that is spectacular from the word go. The film kicks off with a cliché black screen where Batman's dramatic voice-over advises of the 'really serious' film to come.Batman works alone and so has a hard time with the adoption of Richard Grayson (Robin) and the relationship that develops with (Miss) Commissioner Gordon, you see Batman doesn't do 'ships'. Batman also has a strange hate / hate relationship with 'The Joker'. Batman breaks the Joker's heart, when telling him he isn't committed to fighting just him, he 'fights around'.There are jokes for kids and innuendos for adults (for instance look out for the Bat-mobile's numberplate). These jokes are rapid and just keep coming from every corner of the screen. The scatter-gun visuals are intensive and just keep hitting you, so much so it was sometimes hard to keep up.Look out for the many cameo appearances from other blockbuster's, it's all nonsense but all seemed to work well.We didn't see in 3D but I suspect that option would work really well. A recommended fun evening at the cinema.",The Lego Batman Movie
83,msbreviews,Rating: B+,7,6 August 2017,"Batman is definitely one of my favorite superheroes and every time I see him on screen, I simply can't get enough of his awesome personality and motivations that drive him ... LEGO or not, he's freaking Batman! So, does The LEGO Batman Movie reaches the level of its predecessor? Well, in some way yes, it's for sure what we would expect from it, but The LEGO Movie it's still superior to me.The comedy and sense of humor are something ""out-of-this-world"" hilarious. I laughed so much (and even dropped a tear or two) during the whole runtime, which gives this film such an absurd replay value that I already see it as a classic of animation. Will Arnett is one of the best on-screen Batman ever, his voice is just perfectly suited for the Gotham's vigilante. The voices from the rest of the cast are also really great, with a special shout-out to Zach Galifianakis that gives a surprisingly amazing performance for The Joker.The story goes from pure comedy and satire to some emotional bits along the way and it's mostly well-balanced. The visuals follow the same unbelievable quality that we've seen in the previous film and the first act is probably one of the most entertaining first acts of all-time ... Not kidding, it's a serious contender for the best initial 30-min of an animation (and maybe even live-action) movie ever.I really enjoyed this film, but it isn't perfect. The super fast pacing abruptly drops after that exhilarating first act and it briefly becomes slow and a bit boring and dull. In addition to this, the jokes are so many and so quick that it's impossible to follow and understand them all ... Sometimes, I'm still laughing from the last joke and they're already making another, other times they simply don't make sense. Honestly, I think that there's a little bit of too much comedy or maybe it's just the balance of the time between jokes that's sometimes off.All in all, The LEGO Batman Movie is a blast! Its incredible comedy and sense of humor elevate the movie to a super entertaining satire on superheroes and DC Comics has a lot to make fun at (to be clear, I'm not hating ... they just have a lot of material to through jokes at). Will Arnett has a perfect Batman's voice, the story is funny yet emotional, the visuals are amazing and the first act is one of the most entertaining 30-min ... ever in the cinema's history! An abrupt drop in its pacing midway through the film and a time between jokes off-balanced bring the movie down, but its replay value is still huge!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",The Lego Batman Movie

85,MrDHWong,The best post-Nolan Batman film yet,8,30 March 2017,"The LEGO Batman Movie is the spin-off to the 2014 animated hit The LEGO Movie. While not quite as enjoyable as the original from which it was spun-off, this film is still a funny and quirky take on the story of the caped crusader. So far, I'd say it's the best post-Nolan Batman film yet.In LEGO Gotham City, Batman (voiced by Will Arnett) cleans the streets of its usual criminal scum. Over time, all of the fame and recognition Batman has achieved goes to his head, and he becomes arrogant and single minded in his crime fighting endeavours and as a result, he refuses any outside help from others. However, all of this changes when one day he accidentally adopts a teenage orphan named Dick Grayson (voiced by Michael Cera) who wants to join him in his fight against crime.The film is full of inside jokes and self-references to other forms of Batman media, from as recent as the Christopher Nolan films to as far back as the old 1960s Adam West TV series. Will Arnett is hilarious as the Dark Knight, his Batman voice is perfect for the role and Michael Cera is his usual geeky self as Dick Grayson/Robin. What was most surprising to me was how well developed the characters were, from the Joker (voiced by Zach Galifianakis) to even Alfred Pennyworth (voiced by Ralph Fiennes), who is usually just there to spout exposition to the audience. I found more enjoyment in watching these characters interact with Batman in this film than I did in last year's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad. Like with The LEGO Movie, whether you played with LEGO as a kid or still nostalgically builds things with it well into adulthood, this film has something for just about everyone.I rate it 8/10",The Lego Batman Movie
86,CANpatbuck3664,The LEGO Batman Movie Parodies Batman Mercilessly and Provides Lots of Laughs For Kids and Adults Alike,9,11 February 2017,"The Lego movie was one of my favourite movies of 2014. It created this beautiful world around the beloved kids toy, provided some really funny characters (including Batman) and it had a sense of comedy that bordered on self awareness. It worked so well that it left me in tears from laughing so hard. It seemed like lightening in the bottle and when I heard they were making a LEGO Batman movie, I felt like the studio was just trying to cash in on the success of that movie. I was able to catch this with a friend and while I still think the original was the better of the two movies, the LEGO Batman movie still does a great job providing some kid-friendly entertainment and it actually functions as a better Batman movie than what we've gotten over the past couple of years.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The movie begins with Batman (Will Arnett) narrating the opening credits, including the Warner Bros. and Ratpak logos (we also get a quote from Michael Jackson that Batman claims he wrote). Then a plane flies into Gotham City airspace. Nothing seems out of the ordinary until a team boards the plane in midair. They break into the plane and their leader reveals himself as the Joker (Zach Galifianakis). The pilot doesn't take him very seriously until Joker explains his plan to destroy Gotham City by releasing most of Gotham's super villains (e.g. Two-Face, Penguin, Bane etc.) to distract Batman while he plants a bomb. Commissioner Jim Gordon warns the mayor of Gotham not to go into the building and negotiate with the Joker but without the ability to signal Batman, she insists on doing it. After she gets in, she attempts to negotiate until she rips off her disguise and reveals herself to be Batman. Batman begins to battle the villains in an attempt to save the city and defeat his ""greatest enemy"" (who he barely acknowledges).I don't know whether to be happy or sad that this is the best Batman movie we've had since Nolan was running the Batman franchise. I'm mostly serious about that too, this movie has enough understanding of the characters that is way beyond what you would expect. They poke fun at just about everything associated with Batman and they hit the more basic stuff for the kids (Batman's love of rapping and his silly costumes) to the subject matter only adults could appreciate (there's a lot of throwbacks to the Adam West era Batman). I was constantly smiling not only because the movie would fly from funny joke to funny joke but because there were so many Easter eggs related to so many different things. They did some top notch work with the dialogue, I think the original Lego movie was even funnier but they continue with that sense of non-stop comedy. Great animated movies are able to appeal across the age spectrum and as long as you're relatively open-minded to this kind of humour, you'll be laughing throughout The LEGO Batman Movie.I talked in the opening paragraph about how beautiful the first Lego movie was, this movie is every bit as impressive when it comes to the visuals. They improve upon the animation in the action bits and the character design was excellent. I loved how the characters looked and how they would interact with each other in their own unique ways was cool. I don't want to spoil the other cameos in the movie but what they decided to include from other franchises not only looked interesting but it showed a lot of creativity. Warner Bros. really seemed to throw the book at this movie with all the different franchises that get mixed in and just like the original Lego movie, if you blink you'll miss some subtle visual gag that would make you laugh.The voice cast of this movie is huge so I'll only be able to cover the bigger parts. Will Arnett was an excellent pick as Batman. He's got the perfect voice to mock Bruce Wayne's growling as Batman. Michael Cera was perfectly cast as Robin, he ended up stealing a lot of the scenes and Robin's interactions with Batman were not only funny but strangely emotional. Ralph Fiennes was a good pick as Alfred, this is lighter stuff than you usually see him in but he's game for it. Rosario Dawson was also great as Barbara Gordon. Barbara is given more development than you would expect as Jim is largely portrayed as a numbskull. Zach Galifianakis turned out to be an excellent Joker. He's in the movie a lot more than I expected him to be but he nailed it.I have almost no complaints about this movie. I really think they did a good job of expanding on the LEGO movie and they showed that this isn't just some throwaway project for the studio. This movie really isn't afraid to skewer Batman with some crazy funny jokes and yet it still touches on the stuff you need to see in a kids movie (the message of family isn't new but they work it in and they sell it by the end). I'm giving this movie an 8.5/10 but I'll round up to a 9/10.",The Lego Batman Movie

It would seem that every joke and reference are teed up for you (not to mention a seemingly unlimited special effects budget). But this story actually would have benefited by being a bit more constrained. They did not need every WB villain of all time. They did not need to try SOOO hard. They did not need to undercut the suspense by making it clear Batman always wins. A simple Batman story would have worked. Anyway, I still laughed, but when the funniest lines are in the trailers...",The Lego Batman Movie
88,SquigglyCrunch,A Fun First Act That Falters Towards the End,6,21 April 2017,"The LEGO Batman Movie follows Batman as he accidentally adopts a child, meanwhile the Joker plots to take over Gotham City...again. The movie starts out really good. The humor is spot on, the directing is solid, it was setting up to be a lot of fun, at the very least. And while it was fun, the plot wavers as it reaches it's climax. It switches from the goofy, fun, and over-the-top tone that it'd been building up for it's entirety into an awfully serious, almost depressing movie. And while that isn't exactly a problem, the movie did a good enough job developing the characters through comedy and the like, it still had an atmosphere of seriousness, so a lot of the comedy was lost in that. I found it hard to laugh at a joke when the tone was constantly conflicting. Furthermore, the movie is, like I said, fun, but also reasonably original. Or at least, it's not horribly formulaic. It follows a character with actual problems that people have, and it manages to have this all encompassing tone that is, while realistic, hilarious in how over-the-top it can be at the same time. But by the end it divulges into a formula-driven kids' movie. Characters make decisions that may not always make the most sense, and events take place that are just way out there. It becomes hard to enjoy towards the end, and even though there are a few tear-jerking moments, it still feels just a little off. Probably the biggest disappointment was the animation. Yes, it's still LEGO, and yes it still looks great. But part of what made 'The LEGO Movie' so charming was the fact that it was made to look like stop motion (the frame rate was lowered). With this one that isn't the case. Everything is so smoothly animated that it almost doesn't matter that everything's made from LEGO bricks. I have no idea why this change was made, but it wasn't a welcome one. Overall The LEGO Batman Movie is, while a lot of fun particularly at the beginning, it falters towards the end when it comes to conflicting tones and formulaic events. It wasn't a bad time at the movies, but the last act was a lot of flip-flopping. Sometimes it was really good, while other times it was hard to sit through. In the end I'd still recommend this movie, but by the standard that 'The LEGO Movie' set, it's not nearly as good as it could have been.",The Lego Batman Movie

90,PyroSikTh,Maybe a Little Too Self-Aware?,8,15 February 2017,"The Lego Movie was one of those movies that could've been completely terrible, but somehow actually managed to be a fantastic film full of fun and deeper complexity. It was a no-brainer that the Lego Batman of that movie would get his own spin-off. Previews promised the same charm of the original Lego Movie, but focused entirely on Batman, his Bat-family, and his rogues gallery, and it delivers.Batman is the same egotistical Bat-jerk he was, and the movie uses that to look at his loneliness and isolation, utilising some of his long list of legacy characters to build him a family, comprising of Alfred, Robin, and Barbara Gordon. Joker is on the loose in a bid to prove to Batman that he is his arch-enemy, assembling the largest team of rogues ever seen on screen. Honestly story-wise there isn't a whole lot to say, which is hardly surprising. It's a comical Batman v Joker movie in essence, using Lego techniques and comedy beats.Talking of, Lego Batman is a very funny movie for both kids and adults. However the vast majority of the jokes are Batman in-jokes, pertaining to his long history across movies, TV shows and comic books. If this is your first foray into the world of Batman (how?), then most of it would go completely over the top of your head. These references range from the obvious to the obscure, from poking fun at the bat-nipples of George Clooney, to Adam West's shark repellent (I seemed to be the only one in my screen who laughed at that last one, case in point).Lego Batman is a very meta movie, in the same way Deadpool was this time last year. It knows it's a movie and uses this knowledge to poke fun at itself, the world around it, and the audience's knowledge of other movies. The amount of references to other movie properties (not just Batman) is unfathomable. Joker eventually assembles a team of villains who are not borne of Batman's rogue gallery, but from other movies entirely. I won't say who so as not to spoil it, but they range from recent villains to classic villains, and timeless villains in between, from fantasies to sci-fis. There's also little nods to other random movies like Jerry Maguire, Pulp Fiction, Fifty Shades of Grey, and somehow even Iron Man, each ranging from the obvious to the obscure (again I think I was the only one who picked up on the Pulp Fiction reference).While I did have a fantastic time spotting all the references and parodies, they do literally make up most of the comedy in the movie. There are bits of slapstick and in- built character comedy too, such as Joker's incessant need to be treated in a reversal of a romantic comedy, and Batman's constant egotistical, loner visage, but if your knowledge of movies or Batman is limited in anyway, most of the jokes will go over the top of your head, and if you're as in-tune with movies and Batman as I am, you'll be distracted by trying to figure out where everything is from. Case in point, one of the classic villains Joker assembles is a 6-legged, giant, aquatic lizard who was definitely not Godzilla, so I spent the entire time trying to figure out where this guy was actually from, because I knew there was no way he was an original creation. It took me out of the whole experience.Lego Batman was a little too meta, unrelenting in it's constant need to look elsewhere, and often relying on the same property to deliver multiple jokes. Adam West's Batman is poked fun at constantly, from the shark repellent, to the costume, to the onomatopoeic action words, to the theme tune, and even in the representation of some of his rogues gallery, but all on separate occasions throughout the movie's runtime. It started to get a little old as the movie went on.Finally the animation is unsurprisingly on-point. It uses the same faux stop-motion animation as the Lego Movie, and it still looks great. If it wasn't for a handful of unnatural movements, I would have thought it was genuinely stop-motion. All the minifigures and lego bricks look so real, like I could reach out and play with them myself. The set-pieces and vehicles all look great, showing a huge amount of imagination comparable to the imagination Lego has displayed in their own sets for decades. The use of - and exaggeration of - facial expressions also lends hugely to the film's comedic value as well. One hilarious scene early on involves Joker being emotionally crushed as he flies away, and his facial expression is comedy gold; simple yet hilarious.Lego Batman was certainly a very enjoyable movie. It's very funny from the moment it starts with Batman narrating the studio logos to the moment it ends with outtakes and extra little scenes during the credits. It's very self-aware, very meta, and uses references and parodies to make most of it's jokes, which are great, but can wear a little thin as the movie goes on. I got a huge kick out of it, but it lacked the deeper subtext of the original Lego Movie that was responsible for making it so great. Of course they can't use the same tricks twice, so that's not really a criticism as such, just a note. I give Lego Batman a thoroughly enjoyable, if not slightly over-exuberant 8/10.",The Lego Batman Movie

In essence it's a lighthearted take on the character and while incorporating very different parts of him, is most reminiscent of the '60s Adam West version!

92,estreet-eva,Worth it for the Gymkata reference alone,8,6 March 2017,"Seriously when Dick Grayson references the 80's Kurt Thomas vehicle to nowhere ""Gymkata"" the rest of the film could have been deeply mediocre and still be totally worth the price of admission. However, Chris McKay and 9 other writers load this fourth wall exploding reference machine with every conceivable Easter egg back to The Batman's first appearance in ""The Detectives"" comic books in the 1930's. Highlights include recent references to the idiotic ""Suicide Squad"" and moldy references to the departed Prince's 1989 ""Batdance"". McKay's true genius will turn out to be crafting a movie that all but requires multiple viewings to get the most out of the dense but fast moving jokes. As a motion picture, it's also not bad. It doesn't fully have the heart of ""The Lego Movie"" and you can see the ending coming as far away as Arkham Asylum but the plot is a serviceable enough platform from which to launch more quips and 4th wall breaks than ""Deadpool"". The script also offers eminent quotability and you'll be sharing your favorites with your friends until people unfamiliar with the film tell you to shut up.

93,stevenrotherforth,Why not so serious?,8,26 December 2017,"Lego Batman movie.Probably the biggest joke of all regarding Batman is that it has taken a spoof animation to give us a good movie.
Not since Christopher Nolan's epic trilogy has the man in the black cowl delivered.
Batman Vs Superman was very average until the Ultimate edition elevated it slightly to pretty good and The Justice Leagues best bits are most likely left on the cutting room floor.
However Lego Batman is a hoot right from the opening credits.
The film makers even manage to inject a little comedy into the opening logos.
Yes this is predominantly a kids film but there's so much more depth to the comedy here that is wasted on the very young.
If you're a fan of the Batman universe then you'll need to watch this a dozen times to catch all the jokes that reference Batman's cinematic past.
Like the Lego movie that went before it, this movie is a colourful fast paced fun ride that will wash over you leaving you feeling much better inside for watching it.
I really can't be negative about this movie.
If it isn't your cup of tea then don't watch it. 
Don't watch a movie you know you won't enjoy and then bitch about it later.

94,avik-basu1889,21st Century Batman !!!,8,6 June 2017,"Apart from being extremely funny, 'The Lego Batman Movie' also succeeds in being a touching exploration of the cerebral workings of Batman/Bruce Wayne. It touches upon the now renowned elements of the Batman character and uses them to explore the reasons behind Batman's tendency to push everyone away and remain a loner for life. The film advocates a newer Batman for a newer era by poking holes in the 'individualism' of Frank Miller's Batman and thereby endorsing a Batman who believes in togetherness and collaboration. The jokes come at a rapid pace just like the case was with 'The Lego Movie'. The film respectfully pokes fun at previous cinematic interpretations of Batman and the jokes regarding the mutual- indispensability of the relationship dynamics between Batman and the Joker are laugh out loud funny.So not only does 'The Lego Batman Movie' manage to be entertaining and genuinely funny, it also manages to be a proper Batman film with something to say about the character.

Would Definitely Recommend,",9,13 April 2017,"​Plot Overview: After Joker(Zach Galifinakis) unleashes the most evil villains from the Phantom Zone it's up to Batman(Will Arnet) to face his fears and stop the Joker.Directed by Chris McKayStarring Will Arnet, Zach Galifinakis and Michael Cera# NO SPOILERS!Overall: This should have been just a simple standalone to 'The LEGO Movie's most popular character. It's not. It's something so much better and I would argue it rivals 'The LEGO Movie' which is NOT an easy thing to do. A new, fun take on some of the most popular characters ever made is something we needed in the current climate of superhero movies and this film delivers that and so much more.The type of people who like this movie will be those who liked 'The LEGO Movie', those who like the more self aware comedy and those who feel nostalgic for the older Batman movies and 'other' films.Would Recommend.# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Will Arnet is awesome as this version of the famous character and provided a much needed dose of humour in the more diverse times that the DC movies have been confronted by. Zach Galifinakis was superb as The Joker and, once again, provided a fresh take on the character, kind of similar to Hamill's interpretation. The relationship between Batman and The Joker is expertly done and feels genuine, which is rare in the movies and TV shows alike. Michael Cera was quite good as the enthusiastic Dick Grayson and provided a good energy to combat Batman's dark, brooding nature. Rosario Dawson was a good Barbra Gordon. Ralph Fiennes was a good Alfred and I think it was kind of funny that Fiennes was in the same movie as Lord Voldermort(whom he also played but in this iteration was played by a separate actor). Regardless, Fiennes played a good Alfred and made him memorable. Villains other than The Joker(ie Voldermort and Sauron) were stupid and didn't need to be in the movie, and just existed to please as many corners of the nerd galaxy as possible. I would have liked to see some more Commissioner Gordon as well because I think he was in the movie too little.The story was simple, served its purpose and had a beautiful message of family. Nothing more really needs to be said because it worked well and concluded in a great way. The animation was, like 'The LEGO Movie' gorgeous and, like 'The LEGO Movie', had a great, unique aesthetic and was, like 'The LEGO Movie', crammed to the brim with detail.I would like to say the ratio of laugh-cringe for the jokes is 7:3. About 70% of the jokes worked and were hilarious whereas the remained were childish toilet humour and was just to satisfy the younger children. Most of the humour relied on references, which I didn't mind but some people, especially children which will be this movie's main demographic, won't understand them or not find them funny. I was laughing hysterically at jokes about 'Shark Repellent' while some kids were looking at me with a blank face so some of the main demographic won't get the references and not enjoy a huge chunk of the humour. The action was really cool and was enjoyable. The music was positively flawless and Batman rapping about how awesome he is is probably the greatest thing ever put to screen. There were a few pacing issues and the way they sticked to the 'villain change of heart' trope from the first movie annoyed me, and I hope it doesn't become a recurring theme. Personally, I really enjoyed this movie, perhaps ever more than 'The LEGO Movie'9/10",The Lego Batman Movie

97,James_De_Bello,7.5/10,7,11 February 2017,"There are big changes brewing in Gotham City, and if he wants to save the city from The Joker's (Zack Galifianakis) hostile takeover, Batman (Will Arnett) may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others and maybe, just maybe, learn to lighten up.Two years after its release ""The LEGO Movie"" still resonates with us both in its quality as a film, which stands as one of the best animated features of the last few years, both in the way it shook the business and showed you can make great movies out of toys. Still that hasn't meant quality films in this department, in the last two years no one has reached the standard of brilliance, wit, comedy and heart that made ""The LEGO Movie"" the beauty it is. That, until now, from the same creative team behind the first film comes another wildly funny film which almost serves as a further reinvention of the spoof/parody genre.Director Chris McKay demonstrates a deep understanding of the character, its fascination and its mythology. Because of that we get a film that is chop full of references, easter eggs and running gags that incredibly does not call attention to itself. He has struck the perfect tone, the same one that made ""The Naked Gun"" so special, everything is done with homage to the material, there are no cheap jokes or overused gags, there is always novelty in the comedy, a film that starts being funny from literally frame one and doesn't stop even with the credits.As in all good comedies the filmmakers have found a balance of very different acts and we get to enjoy all of them, from the pop culture references, the non sense humor, the visual gags to smart dialogue and, to a length, witty black humor, it has them all and it excels at all of them. Of course one should also mention just how visually interesting these LEGO animation is. Other than giving us constantly rich and incredibly busy frames, they establish a tone in the film that helps incredibly its sense of flow and comedy. One could almost say that the LEGO animation is just an art-form into itself, the uniqueness of it, the very dry sense of humor that naturally emerges from it is wildly fascinating.And then, somehow, the filmmakers manage to even get into some emotional territory, ridiculously, in a parody film about Batman they manage to pull off a good story about the iconic character. One that takes into consideration the deeper aspects of Batman's legacy and plays around with characters in ways that we haven't seen before and that touch really interesting point on his figure. It seems really strange to point out, but I have to insist that in some insane way this film also ends up being a very well told tale about The Dark Knight, one that touches high emotional beats and that explores the character and their relevance still today really deeply.If something should be pointed out it is that the film does carry itself on a little too long. Some of the set-pieces don't quite flow story wise as they do with comedy. Their are some gags and situation that are stretched just a little and I think that cutting about 20 minutes the film could have had a much, much better shape overall and wouldn't have left the focus of what it was doing at brief moments.I am so happy to seen the genre of the spoof done so well again after all these years, it reminds us of how kinetically funny these films can be and how beautiful well structured humor is.",The Lego Batman Movie
98,coreyjdenford,Saving Blocky Gotham,8,10 February 2017,"This review of The LEGO Batman Movie is spoiler free**** (4/5)OVER THE YEARS, when it comes to cinema there is always a sense of joy when we can watch something from a comic book emerge onto the big screen in full likeness of their powers. Whether it's the DCEU's oppressive darkness or the brimming with colour and sometimes dark Marvel Cinematic Universe, these have turned this generation of Hollywood into superhero land. But who would have thought that these superheroes would emerge onto the big-screen in the shape of LEGO bricks? The LEGO Batman Movie brings this unlikely premise to life to all the powers Batman has or the hilarity of The Joker with an odd vampire-esque teeth and it's an absolute delight. Every moment is bright, colourful and brimming with life it's endlessly funny with laugh-a-minute type material, there is no end to the jokes, unfortunately when you start to laugh at them the laughter doesn't get chance as another joke will be delivered it's a constant gag-fest, but the result is on an epic (to say it in the right way) scale. There are even many references to chart-topping songs and an endless stream of references to other Batman movies, or as Bruce Wayne's pompous Butler – Alfred (Ralph Fiennes) puts it he went through different changes through the years. This of course takes place at the start of the film, but also there is a voice over on a dark screen it's constantly on edge. Now we all know the brooding story of DC's second oldest caped crusader, he lost his family when he was a child, this left him under the care of his family butler, when he got older he became the owner of his father's company Wayne Enterprises etc. In, The LEGO Batman Movie it's a little different to his natural guise, here Batman (Will Arnett) is feeling lonely after the death of his family he constantly tries to deny, the way he does this is by fighting crime against blocky Gotham's greatest super villains including trying to end his feud with The Joker (Zach Galifianakis), whom he says is Batman's greatest enemy but he doesn't see this he only enjoys time by his self. Alfred tries to convince him that he needs a family in order to be happy, but he claims he's happy without a family, his 'happiness' is soon ended with the entry of the high-spirited hyperactive Richard 'Dick' Grayson (Michael Cera) an orphan from the Gotham orphanage, he too lost his family as a child. Already the likeness between the young Richard and Bruce Wayne is indefinable. At first he doesn't like the fact that his home life has been taken over by a child, he tries so hard to get rid of him but can't quite get to grips of how he can do that. When disaster strikes, Batman and Richard (now the alias Robin) must work together to defeat the oppressive force of the joker, but it's not his natural battle, this is different. Joker gives himself up, it's clear though that whenever Joker does this he's planning something it hints at that sense here. Along with him and the other super villains of the city he surrenders. But Batman as we all know isn't easily fooled; this feeling goes through the police commissioner (Rosario Dawson) too. As she too senses The Joker is up to something. At this point Batman thinks of a plan to get rid of Joker, who here forms an alliance with other super villains hinting at other movies such as The Lord of the Rings, The Harry Potter franchise and King Kong to name a few these people take over the city to form a super group of villains. Batman must then join forces with Commissioner Barbara Gordon, Robin and finally Alfred – who dresses up for the occasion. This is the biggest battle will ever have, as he flies, swoops, and grapples through the LEGO block bricks of Gotham city to defeat this super group., the message through this fight is family Batman learns that these people are really close to him but he as he's said before he doesn't want family. Granted, it sounds like a deeply, darkly ominous story of a natural Batman movie but it's a loose form of it, there are many moments of this that could take place in a future DCEU film but with the added hilarity which the DCEU having been struggling with lately (not naming people), this is possibly the best DCEU film in four years. There here is plenty here for all the family to enjoy, it's a funny, referency, and endlessly enjoyable Batman movie. Sure it's not as funny 2014s The LEGO Movie, and this doesn't riff the Everything is Awesome soundtrack but there are brilliant moments here, especially Arnett's, scene stealing Christian Bale's Batman voice, as he raps, sings and even changes into various costumes he has brilliant with this. We never thought we'd say this but what other LEGO movies will there be?VERDICT: Rapping, singing, running through a blocky Gotham city mixed with Great LEGO fun makes this the most hilarious animation of 2017; Batman has been translated well into the blocky formation along with Arnett's cool Bale-esque Bats.",The Lego Batman Movie
99,tankace,Unexpected but well earned! Also a moment for the first Caped Crusader.,8,2 August 2017,"I would never believe that the animated superhero movies would return to the big screen but after Big Hero Six and now this film I will say that ,they have returned and they are in a rolling!So in this film we see a great and needed satire for the Caped Crusader, which in a very clever way shows us what would do years of continuous work and isolation to psychology of a man. At the same time we have every time of joke imaginable from references to cameos to four wall ones as well.In general everyone did a fantastic work in the voice acting and in the animation department. To add there another thing that I must address, this film is in fact the acceptance of the now late Adam West version of Batman, the so-called Bright Crusader, to the general culture as a great chapter in the history of Batman like the 1989 film, the Animated series and the Nolan trilogy . In short we can now safely say that the 1966 Batman is good. To be honest this light-heartiness was necessary after the BvS extreme bruiting and overly dramatic attempt which missed the real reason why Batman and Superman are so loved. Is this movie perfect? To me now the third act is a bit lacking, however this is my only complain and you should definitely watch it.",The Lego Batman Movie
100,asb_deutsch,"A one-time watch. If you watch it again, it means you are obsessed with your toys!",5,23 February 2017,"The Lego Movie was probably the best animated film of 2014- certainly for animation- and as such the idea of a spin off is very innovating.Will Arnett does an excellent job of Batman again. Zach Galifianakis also did a good job as the Joker. Those two really stood out in terms of voice acting. There are laughs for kids especially. Like most Batman movies, it is a tad on the dark side. The fight scenes are too quick, but the live action clips are fun. The graphics are dazzling but the script should also be three dimensional like the movie. Also, there should be a lot of 3D pop-ups. In www.cinemablend.com (please check for 3D Ratings), they mentioned the the 3D is the best you had ever seen, which wasn't the case, only the brightness issue was dealt nicely.The area this film disappointed me was its lack of story. The film mostly revolves around Batman's loneliness. And why make the Joker a sympathetic character? It's one thing to make him interesting and funny, like in The Dark Knight, but why portray him like he isn't a psychopath or a mass murderer, even in a PG movie? Is that why it is 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes? Overall, this does fall short of the original Lego Movie, it remains watchable with enough funny moments to pass the time. And if you walk into The LEGO Batman Movie expecting a serious toned town character study, look elsewhere.",The Lego Batman Movie
101,DeBBss,Super underrated...,10,27 June 2017,"The Lego Batman movie isn't really popular among adults or people that think this movie is childish, but it really isn't, it's more of a parody of Batman and the Batman movies, and that's why it's a 10/10 for me.Story: 9/10In the first act Joker has an ultimate plan to destroy Gotham, while Batman is saving Gotham he tell's Joker that he isn't his greatest villain, then Joker has a better plan to prove that he really is Batman's greatest enemy, by unleashing the baddest villain's from other Warner Bros movies to destroy Gotham.Characters: 10/10Batman: In this movie Batman is a parody, so he's not that serious. He's more of a man child then an actual crime fighter.Robin: Robin was accidentally adopted by Batman, and I think this is a good team seeing them work together father and, son.Barbara Gordon: Barbara is James Gordon's daughter, she replaced him, and now she want's to work with Batman, but Batman works alone, but he later lets her into the team, now she is known as Batgirl.Alfred Pennyworth: Alfred was done so well, he's so good that I can relate him to Michael Caine's Alfred, their pretty much identical.Joker: In this movie, the joker isn't as psychotic as Heath Ledger's version of the joker, if you think about it, the Joker is pretty stupid and silly. It's pretty refreshing having a Joker like this.Action/Comedy: 10/10The action was really good, the movie was really colorful, and the visual effects were great, if the movie was bland, and had terrible effects it would seriously pull back the action. The comedy was funny too, it's not the type of comedy you see in other movies, it's more of a goofy type of comedy, but that doesn't make it a kids movie, the comedy is for kids, teens, and adults.This movie is possibly the best movie you can watch with your family. Just because it has Lego in the title doesn't make it a movie for kids, I seriously recommend this movie.",The Lego Batman Movie
102,Donatien3,A Bat-load of Fun,9,1 July 2017,"As the surprise star of ""The Lego Movie"", it was inevitable that Will Arnett's Lego Batman got a solo movie. ""The Lego Batman"" movie lives up the all the hype, with plenty of love for the old Batman movies (explicitly referenced by Alfred) and almost every Batman villain included (from Zach Galifianakis' Joker to obscure enemies like Egghead and Condiment King). The plot is simple: with The Joker taking over Gotham again, Batman has to put aside his loner status and work with Robin (Michael Cera) and Batgirl / Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson, who's been a big part of the Marvel Netflix universe).The film does suffer from overload, though the high volume of jokes and steady pace makes it worth it. There's plenty of digs at the ridiculous moments of previous Batman films.It's easily the best Batman since ""The Dark Knight"" and Arnett's gravelly-voiced Batman is far less ridiculous than Christian Bale's.",The Lego Batman Movie
103,kermitkid,Robbed at Oscars!,10,30 March 2020,"It's only February, but I think it's safe to say this is one of the best movies of 2017. Academy, if you don't nominate this for Best Animated Film in 2018, I will be so angry and annoyed. You already snubbed ""The Lego Movie"" and I don't want to get hurt twice. This movie is awesome because it feels like parody, while still honoring the source material lovingly. It's a satire on DC comics and Lego as a whole. I'm not going to spoil the 3rd act, but I will say that if you're a fan of classic 80s movies or British TV, you will love it. I'm thoroughly excited for ""The Lego Ninjago Movie"" later this year. If they can keep the winning formula they've done for the past two Lego movies, we may have some clear winners on our hands. The film has subtle moments in the background and blink-and-you'll-miss-it jokes that make this worth several repeated viewings. The comedic timing and humor are absolutely perfect. It's been 30 minutes since the film ended and my face still hurts from smiling and laughing so hard, and probably will hurt all night. Definetly a winner for kids and adults. Although it helps to be a comic book fan, you won't feel left out or not in on the joke if you're not. This is a film for everyone. Its meta, and sometimes self-deprecating jokes make it one of this year's most perfect films. There's also some ""We're sorry"" moments for some of the weaker Batman films like Batman and Robin, and even the days of the Adam West 60s tv show. It's not afraid to make fun of itself and just about everything about Batman. I can't think of anything about this movie that I didn't like. It's definetly worth seeing.

104,monstermayhem32,animated movie for all ages,7,13 February 2017,"Even though the movie is labeled as a kids movie, but the tone and feel for it feels like it is more for adults that understand the humor of it. I will say one of the things that I loved about it was how it was somewhat of a parody of itself and even referencing the previous batman movies and the campy 1966 TV series with Adam West. I will say that even though I personally am not a big lego fan, but it is still enjoyable since Will Arnett is hilarious as Batman and Michael Cera being the lovable yet dimwitted Dick Grayson while Rosario Dawson is awesome as Barbara Gordon and Ralph Fiennes who provides the humor as Alfred Pennyworth.",The Lego Batman Movie
105,nicolechan916,"Great pool of characters and witty screenplay, but not my thing.",6,12 March 2017,"While I would consider myself a fan of superhero shows and some of the comics, I am not a fan of these Lego movies. Perhaps it is the fact that they are Lego- something that is associated with my childhood, that I feel like I have grown out of. Plus, I find it hard to relate with Lego characters on screen as they have jerky movements, and very unreal expressions. Mostly over the top and exaggerated. It might also be the fact that Lego movies are made with a certain type of humor in mind, one that comments on material outside of the narrative, and which make me feel disconnected from the narrative. Essentially, this movie was a parody of everything Batman. I appreciate that the animations are not easy to do, and admit that the visuals are very detailed and precise. The colors are vibrant and sharp, making the Lego pieces stand out. As it is an animated film, every little detail had to be designed, and so I give props to the editing theme. The unique movements of Lego pieces are also captured nicely. This type of film is done just for fun, and to, literally, entertain. There is not much substance to the narrative, and the plots are pretty straight forward. The movie is basically a big joke, in a good way. But also, can be in a bad way, if you're not one for, some would call it, 'stupid-comedy'. I enjoy some stupid comedy - mostly the ones with Melissa McCarthy in them; but, stupid-comedy in animation isn't my cup of tea. I admit, some scenes are funny and did make me laugh, but overall, I was a little bored and got tired of watching. I even actually, slept for a few minutes while a fighting scene was going on. It just seemed very childish to me. Also, since all the characters in the movie are well established, the movie doesn't spend time introducing them, or going into their background etc. Which is fine, but then, there isn't any depth to the movie. At least a focus on a few characters might have helped to give some substance. But then again, that's not the purpose of the movie. Moving on, Arnett does a tremendous job as the voice of Batman. He really captured that throaty voice and delivered his lines perfectly. His persona is basically the one who sets the comedic mood of the movie. A serious looking, but also not so serious, Batman. Other voice actors and actresses did their parts well, and their voices matched nicely with their respective characters.Overall, just a fun movie for those who like cartoons and the DC comics.",The Lego Batman Movie
106,shobanchittuprolu,The Lego Batman Movie is one of the best animated movies of all time and one of the best movies of 2017.A great fun..,9,2 July 2017,"The Lego Batman Movie (2017):""Clickety Clak Clak Clickety Clak""..Any review must start with this interesting sound whenever typed using a keyboard.""Hmm..""..Any reviewer will give a ""Hmm"" sound whenever he thinks about what he should write.Lot of movies make me laugh out loud and a whole lot of movies can't even bring a giggle out of me.But the The Lego Movie achieved a rare feat by making me laugh from 00:00:02 seconds to the whole movie.No movie could make us laugh from the opening credits with logos itself.Even I started writing this review in the same way of the opening of film.So what else did The Lego Batman had done?Plot:A proud loner, Batman (Will Arnett) repeatedly risks life and limb to save Gotham from the invading forces of Bane (Doug Benson), Two Face (Billy Dee Williams), Catwoman (Zoe Kravitz), Harley Quinn (Jenny Slate) and, of course, The Joker (Zach Galifianakis). But the Clown Prince is bothered because, despite the fact that they have been quarreling for decades, Batman still won't recognize The Joker as his arch enemy.Meanwhile, back home on Bat Island, Alfred (Ralph Fiennes) worries that his charge is too focused on being The Bat, and encourages Bruce Wayne to ditch the cowl and possibly assume a sidekick. Enter Robin (Michael Cera), an orphan mistakenly adopted by Wayne who, of course, becomes the first member of a growing Bat family that eventually includes Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson) and Alfred, as well.Plus Points: 1 )Humor: The Lego Batman Movie is consistently funny. The jokes start immediately -- like, during the logos that precede the opening credits. At worst, the movie's sarcastically self-aware, skewering long-time Bat-clichés about the moody and broody superhero preferring to work alone as he fights criminals and mourns his family. At best, though, The Lego Batman Movie is screamingly hilarious, ladling pop-culture references and comic-book punchlines with blistering speed and pinpoint accuracy. One joke, involving a pivotal scene from Cameron Crowe's Jerry Maguire, made me cackle until I cried. So yeah, this movie worked very well for me.Most importantly the sounds they make imitating various machines are hilarious.Pew Pew Pew,Doop Doop Dopp Drrp Drrp..Hahahahaha2)Screenplay and Direction: When The Lego Movie has all the unrelated superheroes are gathered as a team,this movie gathered all the unrelated super villains like Voldemort (Who calls himself Voldy!!),Sauron(Who when loses his eye shouts ""My Eye""),King Kong,Medusa,T-Rex,Gremlins,Godzilla and lot others.(Even The Matrix one too).The Lego Batman is the much needed refreshment from a stale year of nothing interesting going on.Why can't non-Lego movies be as funny, exciting and weirdly moving as this?3)Animation: Perfect...................4)Music: Rocking..........and funny at times.5)3D Brilliant.So,The Lego Batman Movie is one of the best animated movies of all time and one of the best movies of 2017.A great fun..My rating 8.5/10",The Lego Batman Movie
107,mistoppi,"I usually hate Batman, but...",10,16 February 2017,"I love the Lego Batman! And I love this movie! It is so good! The LEGO Movie is one of my favourite films, and The LEGO Batman Movie is just as good! Of course the universes are a bit different. The LEGO Movie is a mix of, well, every possible universe, while The LEGO Batman movie is mostly DC universe - with a mixture of different villains released by Joker. Also that certain meta feeling is not there, that was in The LEGO Movie, but that might've been good. The difference between the two is that The LEGO Movie was, in a way, about Legos. Now the characters in The LEGO Batman Movie are made of legos, sure, so are buildings and all that, but it's not addressed so much. We don't have to think about it. It could be just another superhero movie, apart from few jokes that require Legos. This was so much fun! Since I obviously went to see this in English (and since the subtitles didn't work), the audience was mostly grown ups, and every one of us was laughing. And there were so many kind of jokes. One of my favourites is Batman saying it would be stupid to have villains fight villains.And of course The LEGO Batman Movie isn't just action and fun, even though that would've worked too. There's some pretty deep and important stuff about Bruce getting over his fear of intimacy and all that. Of course all that is kind of sappy, but hey, when isn't stuff like that sappy? It's still really nice to see Bruce Wayne / Batman actually have more character development in The LEGO Batman Movie than in the whole Nolan trilogy. Also there are probably a lot of adults out there who might actually see their own issues in Bruce Wayne, who is not going to just be dark brooding Batman and never let anyone close. And also I mean it gives children a nice lesson about family as well. Altogether all the life lessons in The LEGO Batman Movie were so nice, and even if they were sappy, even someone with cynic's traits might melt a bit. I know I did.Right now I can't think of anything wrong with this movie. It was a great experience! It has the best parts of a children's movie and a superhero movie. It's an excellent movie, better than any other Batman movie, and the only Batman movie I've given a full 10/10.",The Lego Batman Movie
108,FelipeCarrillo,DC Extended Universe & Batman's Highly-Polished Ascension.,8,25 February 2017,"The Bat-Man/Bruce Wayne—created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, DC Comics member, and regular sentinel of Gotham City—, the esoteric nocturnal hero and philanthropist multimillionaire, has appropriated immeasurable designs, natures, dimensions and idiosyncrasies, from his roots in «The Case of the Chemical Syndicate» of Detective Comics #27 (1939) to his neo-appearance in Batman V Superman.Despite his initial salutations to the small or big screen were not entirely effective, his eruptive pinnacle ran from the pencil and the paper, comics which years later serve as required look for any tiny brilliant mind that longs to represent in a celluloid to the bleak superman without superpowers.Finite have been those who have portrayed his being truthfully, some with more artistic fate than others, with the general objective that the dark knight is globally singled out by his impenetrably complex and individualist moral, a man darkly martyred as a result of a fateful infancy.Nevertheless, LEGO, Danish line of plastic construction toys, which ventured into the cinematic market a few years ago, elaborated a subversive and radically antithetical transformation of that guy from Gotham contused of pompous manner; its version is critically fun, erratic and empathic, causing a partially unused aspect in the world of superhero movies. First, we are going to contextualize. It all started in 2014, the period in which Warner Bros. —it has Detective Comics's audiovisual rights—commended in the hands of, at that time, newcomers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, an avid and daring ambition focused on LEGO playful construction toys, company known worldwide. Luckily, it proved to be an unsuspected and festive strangeness, encountering us in front of an animation vehemently divergent from Pixar's or Dreamworks' works and a jaunty exclusive nature, which allowed our star character, his pertinent and unprecedented spin-off. So once again, they have hit the nail on the head, considering that the filmmakers do not enclose their aspirations within the vast editorial catalog of characters which they treasure, but that they redouble the desires doing to parade characters from other franchises such as ""Harry Potter"" (Voldemort), ""The Lord of the Rings"" (Sauron) or even apocalyptic primate ""King Kong"".The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, The World's Greatest Detective, Bats, The Bat or simply Batman is an individual who works and lives alone on the basis of his preconceived general statutes. He coexists behind the shadows of his alter ego: Bruce Wayne, who, rationally, also saves the world on an individual basis and without any vestige of changing his ways of thinking or acting. However, when he circumstantially adopts Dick Grayson, a sweet orphan boy, will be faced to forsake his existential ideologies and aphorisms in order to take it upon himself to bring him up, instruct him and convert him into his personal co-worker Robin. On the way, only a few are designated for adorning and supplying personality to the story-line; Barbara Gordon and his conservative butler Alfred Pennyworth will have to overcome the dodge manufactured by the fateful Clown Prince and all his clan of subordinates, which commonly threaten to the full extinction of the human race, nevertheless, this time goes much beyond.It's difficult to believe that the singular motion picture comes out minutely unscathed, having in its writing the bizarre amount of ten screenwriters, and though four of them set up Batman's (Will Arnett) and Superman's (Channing Tatum) brand new identities, that mishmash of ideas could have developed a creative incontinence which would finish with the absolute collapse of the product, but nonetheless, here, ten heads think better than one, and in a fabulous way.Although visual gags (slapstick), jokes and self-references are quite and even excessive, exactly that is what it is all about, presenting a fable with atypical and self-parodic touches exhorting contemporary society from macabre politicians, self-centered celebrities and barbarian conflagrations, a world where good and evil are so laughable to provoke a reaction and an understanding of our existential one-sided basis: love.Hence the script of these men is utterly about human affections; accepting that each human must open its heart understanding that each of them reason singly, assimilating their reasonings, respect and go forward, and support each other. It's more than a concomitant pop-culture product, is an evident social criticism requiring of compression within every child and adult who attend a movie theater. Pushing into the background a prudent analysis about soundtracks, dubbing or ideal characters, ethics and human morality are what take precedence; and although this specific vision will be merely appreciably for those who generate an abstract reading of the film, Hollywood, the fabulous cinematic monster, did not provide a work of such high-minded dimensions in a long time. This is the film we need, it's a must-see animated motion picture.",The Lego Batman Movie
109,PetarNeo,"Batman really loves Joker, but who doesn't?",8,16 March 2017,"After first LEGO movie was a great success there was no doubt about next movies and first of the to come is LEGO Batman and it was a wild experience. Considering how Batman is always a tough-smart-alone type of person now Seth Grahame-Smith, a man who designed story and wrote screenplay tries different approach to Batman and it was a quite interesting to watch with so much comedy that fills movie. There is way too many characters set into LEGO Batman universe but Joker and Batman seem to drag themselves closer and closer as the movie goes, also there are Alfred which is often being left over but constantly keeps fighting to be in front with Robin and Batgirl. After being defeated Joker comes with plan so he could finally end Batman and destroy Gotham but of course not everything goes by plan. It was a very interesting movie with many many comedy and it was quite entertaining seeing things in different way. Batman (voice of Will Arnett) showed us different sides of him and also his power and vulnerabilities. Joker (Zach Galifianakis) was refreshing and quite funny and entertaining but also great character. Alfred Pennyworth (Ralph Fiennes) despite his age managed to keep up with them and offered a new insight into himself. What a bummer to have Fiennes giving voice to Alfred when there is Voldemort inside story. Oh, yes, they managed to put a whole lot of villains into universe so witness a Sauron's Eye, agent Smith, Voldemort and many others as they join Joker in fight against Batman and rest of bad guys that were betrayed by Joker.It's obvious movie steals ideas form other movies but it was well fitted and somehow worked fine also many references are placed which gave a sense of humor to story.

The story is overly formulaic and cluttered with bizarre cameos from different franchises. Yes, The LEGO Movie had numerous cameos and it worked then, but this is LEGO BATMAN. I don't expect Voldemort, the Gremlins, and Sauron lumbering about. I may be a minority on this but they were extremely out of place and took me out of the story. What the film severely lacks is the emotional touch The LEGO Movie had. While it has its share of dramatic moments, there isn't a worthwhile message to follow it.

Batman had me dying laughing most of the movie. Any fan of DC will get a kick out of the tongue in cheek nature of the storytelling. Similar to the first Lego movie the film is all around solid for all ages. Plus the edition of a bunch of Lego villains was awesome. A 8 out of 10 overall.,The Lego Batman Movie
112,ctowyi,"Everything is awesome, again!",8,9 February 2017,"How The LEGO Movie (2014) didn't get a nomination for Best Animated Feature Film continues to be a cruel mystery. Brick by brick, the execution was such a riot with a final arc of pathos that punches way above its weight. Until the sequel in 2019, we have Batman in his own movie. The short of it is that everything in The LEGO Batman Movie is indeed awesome, again.There is a new police commissioner in town. The first order of business by Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson) is to stop Batman's (Will Arnett) lone vigilante acts because frankly they aren't working. Meanwhile, the Joker (Zack Galifianakis) has hatched a devious plan to unleash a plethora of notorious villains and monsters on Gotham City. The only way to defeat them is for Batman to do something not in his DNA - work with others, including Robin (Michael Cera), Barbara Gordon and his butler Alfred Pennyworth (Ralph Fiennes).Like its predecessor, this is jam-packed with irrelevant wisecracks, clever digs and pop- culture references. Right from the get-go, we get Batman doing a commentary of the opening logos that had me in stitches, and the jokes just kept on coming. Nothing is safe from film-makers who are riding on a rich vein of self-awareness as they take aim at not just their own DC universe but that of Marvel and all manners of corporate branding, even Adam West gets gleefully skewered. The rogue gallery is such a dazzling hoot - Voldemort from the Harry Potter films, The Eye of Sauron from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, flying monkeys from The Wizard of Oz, King Kong and even the Gremlins. For Batman fans, this fits right into the film franchise and it does peel an interesting layer off the superhero. 'One' is definitely the loneliest number as we see Batman returning to an empty bat cave after his city-saving exploit and watching a rom-com in a posh home theatre all alone. The poor dude is even shunned by the Justice League in a sequence that had me laughing the hardest.Arnett reprises his role in The LEGO Movie with his deadpan gravelly voice and his delivery is pitch-perfect. The cast also has Cera with his spot-on cheery disposition and Galifianakis as Batman's ultimate nemesis with an identity crisis. The rest of the cast are just as buoyant. The novelty from the first movie has unfortunately lost its sheen but I wouldn't say it is to its detriment. Some of the wild spectacles feel a little tiresome after a while and one or two could have been jettisoned without leaving much of a dent in the story. This entry is also missing the huge wallop of pathos in the final arc of the original. But for all it is worth, The LEGO Batman Movie manages to shine a new light on our overly familiar superhero and asks some great pointed questions - what is a superhero without his arch-enemy? If Batman has been doing his crime fighting for years, why is Gotham City still riddled with crime? This is a superb send-up of the over-stuffed superhero genre flicks and it wisely never takes itself seriously. The vibrant colours and non-stop shenanigans will be a hoot for children (judging from the hearty laughter of two kids seated behind me) but I feel it is made more for the Batman fans with its witty digs.",The Lego Batman Movie
113,Padreviews,6.5/10 We built this city out of LEGO,6,22 February 2017,"Saw this by pure accident due to lack of time , had hoped to see Hidden Figures but needed to see a shorter film , yes I know that sounds mad but bare with me ! Fortunately I saw this in an almost empty cinema only 3 other people in there , so not hundreds of kids , thank god half term is over ! It was actually quite fun , great humour throughout with the simpson's trick of appealing to children and adults alike as well as the inner child within . It's hard to see how this cost $80m to make as the animation is fairly basic in comparison to other blockbuster animated films , albeit this is due to the lego pieces but gives you the impression it's stop/go physical animation as opposed to truly digital . Great emotional script , a journey of a solo creature trying to fight his inner desire for love and hate with great use of the Michael Jackson 'Man in the mirror' classic It's great family entertainment , go see it",The Lego Batman Movie
114,havoke-74121,They really nailed the Visual style in this one.,6,18 December 2020,"Everything about the animation is so gorgeous to look at, but the storyline becomes so slow paced, that its hard to not nod off even when the action spectacles are on screen with sophistication.",The Lego Batman Movie
115,Semisonic,More of 'Big Hero 6' than of 'The Lego Movie',6,10 June 2017,"The original The Lego Movie was visually novel and conceptually appealing, combining the in-movie world's ""power of the small people"" agenda with the 'outer' world's ""power of the unregulated creativity"" one. Combined with a grand dose of sheer humor, entertaining action, witty parody and versatile characters, that film was a pure joy to watch.The LEGO Batman Movie spin-off tries to capitalize on the universe created, taking the visuals, parody and the humor from its predecessor and riding on the ever-fruitful theme of family values. And all these aspects are carried out pretty well. Then what's the problem? The problem is that the movie, in all its attempt to be witty and ironic, sort of forgets to be sincere. Yes, the love-hate relationship between Batman and Joker is a refreshing take on the lore, and the suppressed craving for company and appreciation is there for the movie psychology lovers, but the main characters feel too cartoonish and infantile, as if they embody the way nursery school kids view the world. Combined with the never-stopping slapstick action and puns, TLBM is the ""strictly for kids"" kind of entertainment, which puts it on par with the recent box-office triumph Big Hero 6.That may be a paradigm shift in the animation production business. Since Toy Story and Shrek, the animation studios were trying to create films that could draw both the kids and their parents into the movie theaters. However, maybe these days the adults have too much entertainment catering specifically for their needs, and there's no point in making a complex multi-targeted product anymore. So while The LEGO Batman Movie is certainly a great entertainment flick for kids, the more grown-up people are bound to yawn and doze off while watching it.",The Lego Batman Movie
116,AnishMisra,The Lego Batman Movie review,9,6 July 2017,"The Lego Batman Movie is a film directed by Chris McKay. I had seen the trailers of the film and was quite excited about the film. I loved The Logo Movie and Batman's character in it too. And man, I was overjoyed with the final movie.Plot: Batman has a hard time admitting to care for people because of which Joker decides to teach him a lesson.Story and direction: The story has a very sarcastic tone to it. Which I loved. All the references made to films (of Batman and some Marvel one's too) was great and hilarious. I had laughed my guts out in this film. Joker was there for a longer time too (FYI Joker was just in a special appearance in Suicide Squad!!!!) The use of other DC characters were great too. The only issue I had with the film was it being nothing unique. I mean not being different than the Lego Movie. The climax was not good to be honest. But That's me.Favorite Scene: I guess it would be where Batman becomes emotional seeing his family photo and Alfred jokes that he feels the same way all the years (referncing all Batman films that have appeared in the past). That was very funny.Verdict: I had a good time watching this film. This film had a very different (comic) take on Batman which made it watchable. I am hoping from some other good movies from the Lego franchise.I am going with a 9/10.",The Lego Batman Movie
117,iguth,Crazy fun,8,11 May 2019,"This may be one of the funniest batmans of all time. For an animated Lego film the cinematography and sound design is surprisingly well done. It utilizes the Lego style of The Lego Movie which in itself is beautiful. It holds a very cliche lesson that works very well here. There is not much to say other than that it is really really fun. It is funny, satirical, and pokes fun at the old batman. The whole movie is very spontaneous and fast paced (probably thanks to its target audience) which keeps you engaged. The Joker's character really accentuates his funny loving personality as opposed to the evil side to make the villain just as fun as the rest of the characters. So much fun.",The Lego Batman Movie
118,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,8,7 April 2017,"With the wide success of The Lego Movie, Warner Bros decided to not only make a sequel but create spin offs of other popular franchises featured under the Lego label. Lego Batman (having been a favourite with the public) gets his own film and this adaptation is pure fun and a break from the darker toned versions of The Dark Knight and the current take by Ben Affleck in the DC Extended Universe.The story follows Batman and his ever going crusade to protect the city of Gotham, though acting alone and a bit of a jerk at times. However, when his nemesis The Joker hatches a plan that will not only consist of many of Batman's rivals but literally but Gotham in pieces, Batman must learn to work as part of a team with his newly sidekick Robin and allies and save the day. In terms of story, it is simple and fun enough to follow with themes of teamwork, acceptance and being a true hero. The casting is on point, Will Arnett is great once again as Batman, Michael Cera is hilarious as Robin and so was Ralph Fiennes as Alfred the butler (arguably the best choice of actor). The supporting cast as well are worth in their game and give life to the story's supporting characters and humour.The standout key point of the film is it's incredibly beautiful, visually appealing and yet stunning animation, combing the same efforts used in The Lego Movie (which is stop-motion animation and CGI). The effort of Australian visual animation team Animal Logic is given full praise once again, showing that animation does have to be all CGI and shows that even eye detail, production value and even scale cannot be limited.To score the final verdict, The Lego Batman Movie is a visually appealing and hilariously fun for young and old. There's not much to say on the negatives but it does overall keep up the heart and tone of the Lego universe. Great voice acting, epic animation and a great story make this worth seeing, with or without children or you're an adult who's a child at heart.4/5 Check us out on facebook and Instagram!

119,danielharden,Darkness!!! No Parents!!!,9,22 February 2017,"An intro. Every important review begins with an intro, and a star rating, 7 or more stars out of 10, or in this case 9 out of 10 because the Lego Batman Movie is awesome. After the success of the Lego Movie and of Will Arnett's portrayal of the Dark Knight within it, this butt kicking movie has come our way and it does not disappoint. This film will please fans of Lego, Batman, Lego batman, movies and all out pop culture.What makes this film so great and so satisfying to me, is how surprisingly epic and meta this film is. This is not just a Batman movie it is much, much more. This is the crossover movie everybody has been waiting to see. I attribute the critical failure of the DC universe to studio interference, so this film is made that much more satisfying as it is obvious that the studios loosened their grip for this film, and said yes to certain things they would have said no to with DC's other films. For example; the opening titles are the greatest opening titles to a film I have ever seen, period! Please go see for yourself.As I said this isn't just any old Batman movie. This is a Batman timeline homage and Superhero and Supervillain crossover animated movie. The intertextuality in this film is off the charts and will leave almost every fandom gasping, perspiring and losing their mind in their seat. This film has decades of Batman material to reference and it does that and then some. Remember Warner Bros owns much more than just Batman. This is an epic movie done right and I would argue is one of the greatest superhero films ever made. Yeah I said it. Superman come fight me bro.The voice acting in this film is fantastic. Will Arnett is hilarious as Batman and Zach Galifianakis, Michael Cera and Ralph Fiennes do decent jobs as The Joker, Robin and Alfred. Batman and Joker's relationship is dealt with in a very unique way, and the two are hilarious together. Coming back to Will Arnett, like Gob Bluth in Arrested Development, he was born to play this role. His voice acting is both funny and doesn't make Batman sound like a chain smoker... *cough* Christian Bale *cough*.The animation in these Lego movie's are phenomenal. There is so much happening on screen, but not to the point where it becomes overwhelmingly cluttered. The animation style is beautiful and made all the more so with the gorgeous orange tints throughout the film. I really hope that award panel's such as the academy awards look at this animation the same way they would look at Pixar or Dreamworks (same animation style but different standalone movie), and not look at this like they did with The Adventures of TinTin or the Lego Movie (not classifying for whatever reason). This movie deserves an Oscar. It is beautiful.There really isn't a whole lot bad to say about this film, the only thing I can think of is the jokes are told at a speed which is a little too fast. This is a fast paced film and the jokes are told at a very fast pace, to a point where it is hard to keep up, or the order of jokes doesn't quite make sense. Because there are so many jokes in this film, there are quite a bit that don't work, but there are also quite a lot that do work and boy are they good.A conclusion, every important review concludes with a conclusion of the writer's overall thoughts of the film. So without further ado, I conclude that the Lego Batman Movie is absolutely breathtaking. It's a hugely enjoyable movie that will satisfy fans of everything Warner Bros and DC. As a fan of Lego, Batman, films and other pop culture, this film is like a dream come true. I give this film 1 star for every ab Batman has. Please see this film. Batman Out.",The Lego Batman Movie
120,hjalsayegh,A Celebration of everything Batman!,10,14 February 2017,"It's odd that this would be the movie that takes a look back at 78 years of batman and says... yeah it's silly, LET'S CELEBRATE IT ALL!!!I actually thought some of the characters in this movie were just a joke but nope, there really was a condiment king in the batman comics that walked around with a ketchup and mustard guns, there was a character called ""the Eraser"" that looked like a pencil!Best of all was the most iconic villain from batman, the Joker! Just replace the word ""hate"" with ""love"" and it's a rom-com between the two with batman refusing to commit and Joker feeling like his ""hate"" was only one sided and he deserves better, Hilarious!!!They actually reference all of batman from the silly TV show of the 60's, the bam and kapow that pop up in the comics when he hits someone, his dark night trilogy, you name it it's there... and sometimes they'd even play some footage!If you know anything, really anything at all about batman then I'd recommend you watch this movie. age doesn't matter. The one flaw I could think of was how fast this was going with the jokes, at times I wish it would slow down because another one comes in before I was even done laughing at the previous joke.10/10 and yay for parody not being dead!",The Lego Batman Movie
121,samyoung-82648,This is the batman movie you're looking for,8,21 February 2017,"As far as popcorn flicks go, I thoroughly enjoyed the original Lego movie and this movie is definitely a decent sequel (thanks Chris McKay). The humour is along the same lines as it was in the previous movie. However, the jokes don't come quite as fast and they aren't quite as funny.Will Arnett does an excellent job as batman. He's a great combination of cocky, arrogant and vulnerable. The writers have done an excellent job in defining a caricature that is largely believable and relatable.Rosario Dawson does a better than average job with Commissioner Barbara (Barbs) Gordon. Like all modern movies, she (ie. female) is flawless (a modern gender issue in all modern movies). However, at one point, she depends on Batman (very rare in movies today as a woman needing help is deemed sexist). However, she is not over the top. Her advice is wise and it's good to finally see a female character who isn't hyper violent. Compared to other modern movies, I can only think of Lego Batman and Star Wars: Rogue One that have good female leads in an action movie in the last few years.Zach Galifinakis does a good job of the joker. His bromance with Batman is well played and lampooned accordingly. At times, it was hard to know how to take the joker. He was missing malice and he needed a little more edginess. I was disappointed Zach didn't bring more conflict and ambiguity to the joker role.Michael Cera does an OK job of Robin. His skills don't match his experience in that he is naturally talented without any experience. However, Cera and Arnett have a good rapport which adds credibility to the movie.Ralph Fiennes does an OK job of Alfred, however, it's a huge step down from his exceptional performances.Some critics commented on the ending not matching the rest of the movie. I believe that batman doesn't change throughout the movie. His fears remain the same as does his limitations. However, by the end of the movie, he understands himself better. I consider that an excellent story arc.If you're looking for a great popcorn flick to entertain kids and parents, this film is highly recommended. This is as close as you're going to get to a kids' movie with a male lead this year, so, make the most of it. However, if you're hypersensitive about a female character who is saved by a male character's advice, you may find yourself enraged at this movie.",The Lego Batman Movie
122,justinwfirestone,A dizzying flash of light,7,24 February 2017,"Everything is still awesome, all the time, forever and ever, and always so. The LEGO movies have spectacular animation and stunning detail. You can see all the pieces, maybe, but the result is that the entire movie feels like a virtual Easter egg hunt for people who fall somewhere on the Autism spectrum.The movie has plenty of fun call-backs to other Batmans (Batmens?) and pokes fun at the DC universe. There are enough characters to fill a toy chest, but the main villain is once again Joker, voiced by Zach Galifianakis, who seems horribly miscast for this role. The Batman and the Joker play a ""we're not gay, we just love each other a lot"" game that seems equally creepy and meta-heteronormative.As we have learned from other Batmans, it takes a sociopathic billionaire to save the city from crime, because the totalitarian police state just can't seem to squeeze its grip hard enough. And the ultimate lesson, that we have to work together in order to be a family and survive this world hell-bent on destruction, seems to fall flat when you live with a billionaire who can afford anything he wants.",The Lego Batman Movie
123,joshbarton15,"Funny and wonderfully animated, just tried to cram so much in",6,13 February 2017,"Due to the fact that The Lego Movie back in 2014 was an absolute blast and Will Arnett's Batman was one of the film's major highlights, I was really looking forward to seeing how his own spin-off would turn out with The Lego Batman Movie. Could they capture the lightning in a bottle once again and have similar success with this adventure?Having made it abundantly clear that he prefers to work alone, Batman (Will Arnett) faces off against a string of Gotham City's most notorious villains, led by the Joker (Zach Galifianakis), who won't be fulfilled with his villainous role until Batman admits they make each other who they are.With a new police commissioner in the form of Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson) wanting Batman to work together with the police force and his adopted son, Dick Grayson (Michael Cera), wanting to become his sidekick, Batman faces the task of adjusting the way he goes about fighting crime.Where do I even begin with this film? I mean, both visually and joke wise, The Lego Batman Movie is an all out assault on the senses, with so much to take in and delivered at such a blistering pace. I know that there are things I missed this time that I will perhaps pick up on when I watch it again but it just felt like they tried to cram too much into this film. It's a shame because I really wanted to enjoy this as much as The Lego Movie.It's still a hell of an entertaining film, full of laugh out loud moments and brilliant nods to Batman's past in popular culture, all put together through the same wonderful animation that amazed audiences in The Lego Movie. The film comes with a touching message about the importance of relationships however, it's lacking in the creativity that made the message in The Lego Movie resonate more with me.One thing I can't fault the film for is the vocal performances given by the cast, all fitting so well with their characters. Arnett is hilarious again as Batman but the spotlight is nearly stolen by the inspired casting of Michael Cera as Robin, who absolutely nails the innocence and campness of the character with his voice.The Lego Cinematic Universe is now in full flow and with three more films confirmed for release, I just hope they don't reach a point of overkill. It's something this film was a bit guilty of having tried to cram so much in however, I can't deny that I had fun with The Lego Batman Movie, and I'm sure you will too.",The Lego Batman Movie
124,barbagvido,"Hilarious, fun and batsh!t crazy!",10,14 June 2017,"The Lego Batman Movie. I can't really explain it. It's a sort of a spin-off of 2014's The Lego Movie and also a kind of a new comic book adaption, and it's a parody at the same time, and not just Batman, but today's blockbusters in general, overall it's an odd beast. But it's awesome.It does so many things at once yet it manages to balance all those things so well into a coherent story. It's hilarious from start to finish (with occasional outbursts of emotion). It's so, so fun, you won't be bored for a second. There are also plenty of references for the fans. There are also characters from other movies with surprisingly big parts. That made the movie even crazier than it already was. And it's kinda self-aware, I'd even go as far to call it 2017's PG rated version of Deadpool. I may even like it just as much. It was all very surprising for me, I didn't expect to like it this much since I found 2014's The Lego Movie a bit disappointing. I liked it, but I thought it was just alright. After all the praise it got, I guess I just expected more. But I will definitely be coming back to this one.It's so much craziness packed into one, but if you're willing to just go with it, you will have an amazing time.",The Lego Batman Movie
125,themovieparadise,The Batman Movie We Need Right Now,9,12 February 2017,"This film's strongest aspect is its comedy. It had me laughing from start to finish. It's smart, it's witty, and it's just plain hilarious! The writers understand the character of Batman. They understand his inner drive to fight crime because of the loss of his parents. They understand his morality and convictions, and it allows for them to exaggerate and amplify parts of his character. In this movie, Batman is entirely narcissistic. He thinks he is the greatest person ever. The comic book character of Batman does have some narcissistic elements to him, but this movie completely exaggerates it. And that's what this film does so well. And what was surprising to me was that, if you boil the plot down to its bare minimum, it's a classic Batman storyline from the comics. The Joker is making a point about how Batman needs him as much as he needs Batman. That's a story coming straight from Batman: The Killing Joke, and even The Dark Knight. We also see Batman wrestling with his fear of abandonment and being alone, and pushing people away because he fears losing them. That's classic Batman! Now, it's all done with LEGOs, and it is filled with jokes and is very light-hearted, but it's under all of that it's classic Batman...",The Lego Batman Movie

He is making jokes every time, he is breaking 4th wall, his normal acts are so funny, he is so egotistic and alone but his relationship with other characters is just great anyway. He is making references to anywhere, especially to other Batman movies. And everywhere is made by Lego. But places still looks so beautiful and realistic.

127,datautisticgamer-74853,A commercial done absolutely right,9,12 February 2017,"I should begin my review of this film by stating that I have vague memories of watching The LEGO Movie back at a summer camp I went to around 2 years ago. I remember it being a particularly creative movie with good concepts. Now that I have seen this, I would even say that this is an improvement over The LEGO Movie. It doesn't necessarily have the innovation of its predecessor, but it makes up for it with the advancements made to the ""special effects"" as well as the humor. The latter was especially nailed, as there were many times where I cracked a smile and a few times I chuckled out loud. It does sometimes not take itself as seriously as what we'd want from action movies, but unlike other films of its type it gets a pass for this since LEGOs are designed to be objects of creativity, as explained in the ""first"" movie with the child character. The morals in the story were pretty nice as well, with promoting social attitudes and also exposing Batman for being more of an anti-hero. Whether it's shrugging off what the other characters attempt to persuade him to do or even rejecting them, it places Batman in a new light where instead of being b*d*ss, he needs to be seen as the hero of Gotham City and have the characteristics of one. The ""animation"" is what we'd expect from a LEGO movie, having the large scale, the pixelated streams to represent what would be special effects, and various heads of LEGO figures placed on the characters to represent mouth movements. As I said, it's not creative like before, but I found that it has a more interesting premise to it. If you are a fan of DC materials, LEGOs, Batman, or animation, then I give nothing short of a green light to view it. As for everyone else, just note that I consider it the funniest film of the year so far.",The Lego Batman Movie
128,T-ZER0,As annoying as The Lego Movie,1,18 June 2020,"Of course, since Batman was such a big deal in the original Lego Movie. He needs a spin-off to sell a lot of toys for mindless children. If you're a die-hard Batman can you mind subject yourself to this torture, but I wouldn't recommend it.The movie starts with the most annoying opening in history with Batman dissing on Superman. Superman is my favorite hero, to have that annoying Will Arnett talk about him like that just pisses me off. I wanted to stop the movie after that opening, but I pressed on.When I mentioned Batman references earlier, I meant that this Batman adapts the timeline of all Batmen. From Adam West to Christian Bale. Which is good, if this was a fan-film rather than a big budget movie. They even take Michael Keaton's quote: ""Let's get nuts!"" But let's be honest. Keaton was a far better Batman than you could ever hope to be Will Arnett!Besides the fact of all those references and a ton of stuffed product placement. Batman and Joker's romance is interesting. I'll give them a pass on that. But I can't give them a pass for messing up Superman again! Here's what they do: Batman is feeling bad about his archenemy Joker, but he watches a news report about Superman talking about his archenemy. Zod. What the heck? ZOD IS NOT SUPERMAN'S ARCHENEMY! His archenemy is Lex Luthor?! You've probably heard of him? The greatest criminal mind of our time??I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 13, but if you do watch it. Be careful. It hurts.",The Lego Batman Movie
129,CowherPowerForever,Iron Man Sucks,8,9 February 2017,"After a long hiatus of not reviewing movies, I am back, and it feels great. I will start things back up first with The Lego Batman movie, then tomorrow with John Wick: Chapter 2. So without further delaying, here is my review of The Lego Batman Movie.2014 bought us one of the best animated films to date, The Lego Movie, and riding the success of that film comes this movie. To be honest The Lego Movie is one of my favorite films period in this decade. In comparison The Lego Batman movie is a well written movie in terms of comedy and action, but the story is not as well developed as the previous Lego movie. The other film was able to interject many adult points into the plot without overcomplicating things. The Lego Batman film is without a doubt a fantastic movie to watch with the entire family. It has nonstop laughs, pokes fun at comic book movies in general, and is never boring. This is surely a must watch movie.Chris McKay is the director of this movie. McKay is known for having directed many episodes of the adult animated show, Robot Chicken. For a director on a show like that to make the big transition in terms of the extreme level of comedy from Robot Chicken to this film is very impressive. Some of the jokes do get close to raunchy, but never actually cross that line. There are a few actions scenes that are really impressive to watch, especially if you get to see this movie in IMAX. McKay as the director really delivers in this aspect. This is truly one of the best elements of the film, and director Chris McKay deserves credit here.Probably my favorite part of the movie besides the fun actions scenes and the jokes was the amazing score from composer Lorne Balfe. Balfe is known for working on movies such as Iron Man, The Dark Knight, and Inception. While you can easily say the score here is more of another joke towards the comic book genre in general, it certainly fits this movie. As someone who really enjoys scores, I will be listening to this again and again.In closing, this is truly the first great movie of the year, while the plot is thin compared to the previous Lego movie, it is well worth the price of admission. The extra money for IMAX is also worth it in my opinion, especially if you have the option of IMAX 3D. Animated movies seem to be the best bang for your buck for the 3D movies. This film is also great fun for the entire family, so taking your kids to this movie is certainly a must.8/10",The Lego Batman Movie

There were quite a few gags for long time Batman fans, and as per usual the nods to any adult that may be watching... but I must say I didn't enjoy this as much as the Lego Movie. It was just full of explosions and Lego bricks flying everywhere and didn't really ground itself at any point. Perhaps I'm too used to miserable gritty Batman films, but this just didn't quite hook me in...",The Lego Batman Movie

132,Brevin_Campbell,A fun joy to watch despite its flaws,8,13 February 2017,"The Lego Batman movie is a whole lot of fun to watch. The world that was created her is creative and imaginative and the writers on this project truly understand the Batman character and all of his different dimensions. There is also plenty of Easter eggs all throughout this movie too. If your a Batman fan you will enjoy this film. One of my favorite aspects of this movies is the way everything looks. No it not as good looking as Lego Movie was, but it still feels like that world and it is defiantly a world I feel like playing in. It is just sooo much fun to be in this world. Every thing that was built is amazing and just a whole lot of fun to see it all come to life. I also loved the idea of family that was threaded throughout this movie. I have always been a fan of the Batfmaily in DC Comics. It is in my opinion the best part of the Batman mythos. I have always loved Dick Grayson, Barbara Gordon and the rest of the family. And this movie understands why there such a big part of the Batman mythos and a needed part of the rest of the movie. I also loved seeing the rest of the Justice League in this film tooo. Though I do wish they had larger roles. And there is a issue I have with this film. You have the Justice League in this world and yet there never used when the action comes up. All of Gotham is about to be destroyed and there was no Superman or Green Lantern anywhere. It was like the movie forgot they were in this universe. and instead we get all these WB knockoffs like Voldermort and Godzilla. It was just so bad. There is also a part of the movie that plays like every other action film ever and it drags the story out for longer than needed. I hated it. I also don't like this Barbara Gordon and Batman relationship that DC keeps pushing. Throw that bull out of here and keep it locked up if your not Bruce Timm. That is not there relationship!!!Overall though there is still a lot to like about this film and I really had fun with it.",The Lego Batman Movie
133,ryanjmorris,"Lego Batman is as fun, funny, inventive and touching as you'd want it to be",9,6 February 2017,"Let's be honest for a second and agree that The Lego Movie should never have worked. On paper, it's a horrible idea. Yet, Phil Lord and Chris Miller did what they always do - take a strange and unwieldy idea and turn it into something great. Including Batman in The Lego Movie seemed a bizarre choice, but the Will Arnett voiced character was a highlight for pretty much everyone who watched it and it didn't take long until a spin off was announced. With Lord and Miller only serving as producers this time, the satisfaction of The Lego Movie wore off and we were all sceptical about whether the spin off was a good idea. It turns out that, just like last time, we never needed to worry at all.When he isn't fighting crime as masked vigilante Batman, Bruce Wayne (Arnett) lives in recluse in his mansion with his butler Alfred (Ralph Fiennes). His arch nemesis, the Joker (Zach Galifianakis), rallies together an endless group of villains to attempt to rid Gotham City of the Batman, all while new Police Chief Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson) proposes that Batman abandon his solo nature and work alongside the law enforcement. After a misunderstanding, Wayne also accidentally adopts local orphan Dick Grayson (Michael Cera), who he reluctantly takes on as a protégé. Eventually, it is down to Batman, Grayson, Gordon and Alfred to battle the Joker and save Gotham City.If it sounds kind of mental, it's because it is. If you thought The Lego Movie was high octane and relied on energy, it pales in comparison to The Lego Batman Movie. But, once again, here we have a film that is not only zany and energetic but also consistently funny, mindbogglingly inventive, nimbly structured and genuinely touching. While it loses the surprise effect that made The Lego Movie such a treat and its conclusion doesn't rival the sudden foray into live action that made its parent film so poignant, Lego Batman remains a highly enjoyable film that puts a smile on your face from beginning to end.I would comfortably say that this is a funnier film than The Lego Movie. The jokes come thick and fast, a large percentage of the film is more than prepared to drop at least three jokes per minute and they all land. There are digs at other recent Batman stories - most notably Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman, obviously - and multiple other references to other films, but Lego Batman even finds room for more adult humour (how the number plate on Bruce Wayne's car made it into the final cut is hilariously baffling to me) and countless sight gags. The faux stop motion animation style carves the way for some brilliant little visual flourishes that add depth to the film's comedy - it isn't just content to run one joke into the ground, rather it consistently finds new comedic territory and makes every joke its own.The way Lego Batman even lands on something genuinely moving in its finale is even more impressive. You could make a case for the film's central theme being a bit obvious when it comes to Batman - the whole film is pegged around isolation and loneliness and how you combat that to form a human relationship of any kind - but it handles it excellently. It's written smartly enough to simultaneously act as a life lesson for small kids as well as a powerful sentiment to older viewers. The fact that it has a better grasp of Batman as a character than Batman v Superman did isn't exactly surprising, but what is surprising is just how committed to this theme the film really is.It doesn't just form it around Batman. Young Dick Grayson feels the same emotional distance, Barbara Gordon only wants to do well in her first challenge as the new Police Chief, Alfred wants to help his adoptive son refocus his life and even the Joker just wants to comfortably know that he really is Batman's arch nemesis. It all sounds silly, and of course it is, but Lego Batman excels whenever it combines the silly and the thoughtful. Thankfully, that's most of its run time. The voice acting is faultless all round, too. Arnett remains the obvious highlight for too many reasons than can be explained, but Michael Cera, Ralph Fiennes, Rosario Dawson, Jenny Slate, and Channing Tatum are all delightful as well.Lego Batman's biggest triumph, though? It perfectly reminds us that the concept of a Lego Movie shouldn't put us off anymore. There have been weirder franchises in cinematic history, and while this sounded like one big cash grab from the word go, everything we have seen in this Universe so far has been terrific. Lego Batman loses that surprise element because about ten minutes into the film you stop worrying, you just know you're going to have a blast. I mean, how could you not? The less said about a plethora of other characters who appear in the film's second half, the better - but it's hilarious and unique and wonderful all at once. If just one film drops in 2017 that's more fun than this, what a year it will be.TO SUMMARISE: Dazzlingly inventive and unrelentingly funny, The Lego Batman Movie adds another enjoyable and surprisingly moving entry to the ever impressive Lego Movie franchise.www.morrismovies.co.uk",The Lego Batman Movie
134,byson5186,Better Than Lego Movie,8,13 February 2017,"First off, I played with Legos as a kid. I played them with a friend up until 8th Grade. Rather then do the building, I would mostly just play with them as toys coming up with my own fictional world with stories. I wouldn't be so entertained playing with Legos now, but awe the good old days!!I saw the first Lego Movie 2 times. I'll admit that it was clever, but I wouldn't say it was well done. That movie reminded me of the fictional Lego world I could imagine as a kid. I even watched it with my Dad and he was amazed at how somebody could come up with such imaginative things. The first Lego Movie seemed to focus more on the Lego World, but I don't think it had a very good plot. The plot seemed too jumbled up with just the imaginations and cheesiness that it felt like it was mostly for kids no older than 10. It also seemed to mostly be focusing on ""Everything Is Awesome"" and ""Believe I Know That Sounds Like A Cat Poster, But It's True."" My favorite scene in the first Lego Movie would be that brief live action scene.Anyway, this second movie doesn't even seem like a sequel to the first. We do not have Emmett or Lord Business. The only character that seems to be the same is Batman, but in the first movie we see him as a Lego that happens to be Batman, not really a Super Hero. This Lego Movie seems all about him and it seems like a different movie than the first that I even wonder if it's supposed to be the same Batman Lego from the first?I was entertained by this movie more so than the first, because I thought it was more entertaining seeing Super Hero action, while the action in the first movie seemed to be fictitious Lego action. This movie feels like a G rated Batman movie in Legos, even though it's not rated G. The people that made this seemed to know a lot about Batman. But, what I really thought is this movie showed Batman's point of view more than the live action Batman movies we see. I mean we get the feelings of Batman, along with his enemy Joker. We also view Robin differently than any other Batman storyline I've seen. You'll think differently about Batman's sidekick, Robin after seeing this movie.I was entertained by the action in this movie that it thoroughly entertained me. I enjoyed seeing Batman's life in an animated Lego world, it was just too clever. This Lego Movie takes us more to the real fictional Lego universe we want to see, at least for a movie. I didn't think it would be any better than the first one, but I was thoroughly entertained unlike the first. The message in this movie also feels like it's presented more strongly than the first. That song ""Everything Is Awesome"" gets annoying. In this movie the main song is Michael Jackson's song, Man In The Mirror.I enjoyed it, and I'd recommend it. This review might mostly be a comparison between the two movies, but I felt like this is the best review I can write.",The Lego Batman Movie
135,alexscott-35299,One of the best and funniest animated movies ever made!,10,21 August 2021,"This film is honestly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, it's great for the kids and also amazing for the adults/Batman fans. It's a great Batman movie, loads of Batman jokes and Easter eggs with nods to some of his unknown villains and jokes about his other super hero friends. This film is just stupid, it breaks the fourth wall and is so self aware all the time and I absolutely love it. Will Arnet as Batman might be up there with Kevin Conroy in terms of voice acting, he's amazing in this and he delivers a perfect balance between comedy and actually being Batman, he's brilliant and I'm so glad he returned for this after the Lego movie. The cast is very good aswell, some amazing casting, I really like Micheal Cera as robin, he does a really good job.

136,mjplysaght,Pleasantly surprising,9,14 February 2017,"When people first saw posters and trailers for The Lego Movie, the instant reaction was that it would suck. Little did people know that it would blow them out of the water. The same applies to this film. I wasn't expecting to laugh as much as I did from moments in this film.Will Arnett is a well cast voice for Batman, although I'd be lying if I said I wasn't picturing Bojack Horseman under the mask. The film is a lot of fun overall. Laugh-a-minute fun, with a bunch of references to previous Batman films.Also, the animation is incredible. The blending of stop-motion and CGI is captured so well and adds a lot of atmosphere to the film. The main characters and villains as well, were a lot of fun. Yes, it could be argued that this is just an elaborate marketing stunt by Lego to showcase every variety of their products and this film takes full advantage of that, with cameos from various Lego versions of popular media.All that aside, this is ultimately geared towards kids, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Although when certain scenes have impromptu beatboxing for no reason, I can't help but cringe just a little bit. Also, the particular screening I went to had the loudest kids in the auditorium which got kinda wearing after a while.Otherwise, this film has my recommendation.",The Lego Batman Movie
137,Animated_Antic,"A funny, clever animated parody of Batman.",8,18 February 2017,"To Zach Snyder,I know you will never read this review considering that you're directing whatever movie you're making. But here's the thing, I watched The Lego Batman Movie today. And to be completely honest, I had no interest in seeing it originally. I never really got into the first Lego Movie nor superhero movies. But, I had to watch it as I am a critic on animated movies and I've got to admit, it was actually pretty funny and clever.Taking place in Gotham City, the egotistical Batman (Will Arnett) continues to fights crime and stop villains ultimate plans, well, mainly the Jokers plans. (Zach Galifianakis). However, after the Dark Knight reveals to the Joker that he has no feelings toward him, the Clown Prince of Crime begins plotting his ultimate revenge involving releasing all kinds of movie baddies from the Phantom Zone. Meanwhile, Alfred (Ralph Fiennes) disappointed in Master Wayne's attitude decides that he should spend more time with his newly adopted son (Michael Cera). And in order to find out what happens after that, you'll have to watch the movie because I can't say anything else.The movie treats itself not as an animated classic, but rather a parody. A parody of superhero movies. Every incarnation of Batman to be precise. The Adam West show, the Burton films, the Nolan films, the pretty bad DC Extended Universe, and yes, even the infamous Schumacher movies. I was really not going to expect much from the movie (considering one of the writers wrote ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombie"" *shudders*), but I really enjoyed it. Not because it was goofy fun (although it is), but rather it actually had a decent moral that kids will really enjoy. I'm sure that little kids will gobble this movie up, and to be honest, they should. They really should. My only concern with this movie is the fact that it could have been slightly less childish. It's not very childish, but it could have had slightly more stuff for adults.If there's anything this movie taught me, it taught me that I can look at movies a whole new way. It shows that superhero movies can be pretty funny and lighthearted unlike your current movies. So take note on this, Mr. Snyder. If you want people to like Justice League, don't make the movie all dark and complex. People are sick of that stuff.Sincerely, Animated AnticP.S. Tell the idiots who make ""Teen Titans Go!"" that this is how a superhero parody is done.",The Lego Batman Movie

There are many funny moments, even if some smack of a certain brand of counter-culture.But geez Louise, I completely lost track of the number of times we were hit with the ""you need friends/you can't do it alone"" message. And who exactly is that message aimed at? Everyone who doesn't want or think they need friends? How many of us fit that description? I began to wonder if the writers hadn't all just come out of rehab.At any rate, there are worse messages for the kids, though I'm pretty sure that even they will tire of being hit repeatedly in the face with it like this movie does.

139,eparazak,Everything is still awesome in this Lego Movie spin-off.,9,11 February 2017,"Will Arnett's Batman makes a return in The Lego Batman Movie, a spin- off of the massive hit The Lego Movie. I personally loved The Lego Movie, it was very innovative, had a gripping story with a heartwarming message and clever jokes. Thankfully, this movie doesn't lack the qualities of that movie.One of my favorite things about this movie is the chemistry between Batman and the main characters, especially between him and the Joker. It's clever, interesting and is looked back upon to help Batman develop as a character. The movie particularly looks into his character and emotions which also helps set him up for development as a character. I liked a lot of the jokes in the film and many had me laughing. Although if there's one thing I don't like about the humor, it's that it feels like it's moving too fast and is often too frequent.Animal Logic does a great job with the animation once again. It uses the same stop motion/CGI technique that Lego Movie used, and it still works. Heck, it may even look better than Lego Movie, and that's saying a lot since that had fantastic looking animation, to the point where I wondered if the Legos featured were actual Legos.The story has a lot to offer. The story itself has a lot of energy, which makes it down-to-earth with its main target audience of young children. Even despite its target audience, I think even the adults will enjoy the movie alongside them. I already mentioned the fact that Batman goes through some great character development. Another aspect of the story that I liked was the fact that it reaches towards even the outskirts of the DC universe, especially when it comes to looking for more villains. If there is one criticism I would have to give the story, it's that while it is fast paced, it can be a bit too fast paced. Thankfully, the pacing does improve over The Lego Movie as it does stop to breathe for a few moments on more occasions.Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie with a gripping story, fantastic animation that tops its predecessor and clever humor. I definitely recommend giving this a watch if you're a fan of The Lego Movie.",The Lego Batman Movie

Uncomplicated, wild, with action and nice visuals. And my expectations have been met gloriously.LEGO Batman uses the best ideas/styles from previous Batmans (i.e. geekiness from 60's, Burton's comics style, Schumacher's craziness, Nolan's psychology and Snyder's epicness) and better than ever before it shows the loneliness and emptiness of Batman's life.The amount of references to other Batman movies and pop-culture in general, together with joke frequency make this really, really funny. Kids, parents, nerds - everyone will find something enjoyable in this movie. Soundtrack and voice acting were also really, really great.I can't find anything really wrong about this movie. For me personally LEGO Batman is the best comics picture of 2017 that leaves other similar genre titles (Thor: Ragnarok, Guardian of the Galaxy) few steps behind.",The Lego Batman Movie
143,ddelhuerto,"Look at that, another good Lego Movie.",10,22 March 2017,"I didn't know what to expect about the Lego Batman Movie, but because I am a fan of DC Comics and the Lego Movie, I was actually very excited. The story focusing on the DC Comics character Batman as he attempts to overcome his greatest fear to stop the Joker's latest plan. I have seen this movie at a Regal IMAX theatre. Basically, I originally had NEVER seen an animated movie before in an IMAX theatre, but this film is the first animated film I ever saw in an IMAX screen. I know it also plays in RealD 3D, but I wanted to see it in IMAX, and I did. What do I think of the movie? I have to say this right now. I really like this movie. I think it's a really awesome movie. The movie even had cameos from other franchises like the Wizard of Oz, King Kong, other DC comics brands, Harry Potter, and so many more. I really love Will Arnett's performance as Batman. And I do like the movie's version of Batgirl. I love Michael Cera as Robin, he's hilarious. The movie is a combination between comedy and drama, and is something Teen Titans Go! FAILS at doing. I personally love both DC Comics, and I love the Lego Movie. Batman was one of my favorite characters in the Lego Movie. So, the idea of giving Lego Batman a movie of his own for theaters would make genius, right? It surprisingly did. The Lego Batman Movie is one of my new favorite movies, and I salute it. I really love the character of the Joker. My favorite part about the movie is the scene where Batman was kicking villain butt, while the song ""Who's the (Bat)Man?"" by Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy plays. I really love that song, and I love that scene.",The Lego Batman Movie
144,trevor-82944,A True Plasticy Hero!,6,11 February 2017,"It happened last year in Deadpool, and now The LEGO Batman Movie does the same basic shindig: as the opening credits come up, Will Arnett speaks in his bat-voice, mocking the clichés utilized by the logo format. Then once the official story starts, the title character introduces himself in LEGO form! Looks like we're in for yet another wild mockery of heroism!Robot Chicken regular Chris McKay recreates the classic bat fun from both yesterday and today with explosively wild fight sequences and its own vocabulary of slang. Best of all, you don't have to follow the bat-franchise to pick up the laughs aplenty; many jokes stem off ""first world problems"" such as waiting for food to heat up. Past the big bad bat's self-absorbed nature, his little ""irks"" are hilariously relatable.All the caped crusader's misadventures are guaranteed to trigger cheers from fans of the franchise as well as newcomers. Right from the first several minutes he takes on his baddest foe forever, (no not Superman) the Joker. He basically breaks the clown's heart by telling him their enemy-ship means nothing to him, and he then goes straight to basking in the praise of Gotham. Everything else afterward both pokes fun at Batman's old days and brings in every- literally every baddie he has ever had to fight (including the Condiment King!) over his near- eighty year existence.This new type of Batman behaves differently from the interpretations by West, Keaton, Kilmer, Clooney, Bale, and Affleck. He spends his free time eating microwaved lobster in the middle of a swimming pool and laughing at emotional scenes in romantic comedies including Jerry Maguire. (Yes, there are live-action films in the LEGO world; it makes no sense but who cares?) Then while out in the crowd under his cowl, he gloats about his abdominal ""nine-pack"". While out of the suit as Bruce Wayne, anyone ought to feel stupid for not recognizing his egocentric personality. Normally, nobody would want to know him personally, but Will Arnett's vocal performance as the Dark Knight is easy to love!The LEGO Movie was a big, unexpected surprise three years ago, and now the same LEGO universe gets an expansion with the same style of humor, except with Gotham now in the mix—a nine-year-old's dream come true! The creative world designed off real LEGO bricks still brings out the same feel of playing with LEGO bricks at a young age, but now, not nearly enough creativity plays off the first movie's celebrated concept. Heck, several of the smoke clouds and water floods are not even made of LEGO bricks! Bummer!Although the familiar joke a millisecond style of humor remains unscathed, which could turn away those who didn't enjoy the first movie for that very reason. If you are overwhelmed by briskly paced dialogue and complementing loud colors, then don't bother with such a franchise.At least it means The LEGO Batman Movie tries to be as far away from the overly serious character we've seen in the last few movies, and the given circumstances fit the cheesy nonsensical nature, more so than what Schumacher succumbed us to. The tiny LEGO universe stands out from all recreations of the famous crime fighter with its traditionally altered set of role models: the publicly praised heroes are actually bad guys in another way, and the publicly condemned villains have a means of becoming heroes in their own right. I mean, it makes the shoe fit, right? With his black, scary cowl, large cape, hoarse voice, and habit of bullying others, shouldn't we consider Batman a villain? Maybe his new burden *ahem* responsibility of taking custody of orphan Dick Grayson to help stop the Joker's evil plan will change things.Sure enough, LEGO Batman has no choice other than let his new adoptive son don a racially offensive Rastafari costume, name himself ""Robin,"" and fight against all the great pop culture baddies including Voldemort and Sauron. Against his wishes, Batman cannot fight alone: he needs all the help he can get to send these villains back to the ""Phantom Zone"" (which is an extra-dimensional prison for bad guys) they came from, or else risk Gotham splitting in half, exposing the bottomless abyss underneath.Overall, if you walk into The LEGO Batman Movie expecting a serious toned town character study, look elsewhere. If you go in expecting a smartly written love letter to the Dark Knight, one to tug on your heartstrings and bring back your inner child, tears of amazement are a guarantee.",The Lego Batman Movie

I was right, not only It was better then the LEGO Movie and Batman V Superman but I think It did so much more then what those movies did, this movie have the most original, creative, funniest material that you can do with for a Batman movie, sure the Dark Knight Is considered the best Batman film of all time, this movie might close second and for good reason, It makes fun of the character of Batman and It makes It smart and funny at times, the characters are all funny and they have a part In the film, well, most of them, the soundtrack Is mostly Batman rapping, licensed songs and even made up songs, all of them really fit In this movie and none of them don't feel out of place.

This is a smartly written comedy that will leave younger audiences laughing at the more physical comedic gags. Everyone else will appreciate the fourth wall breaks and obvious nods to earlier DC films and characters.Since this is a faster pace movie all of Batman's rogues gallery is included. They definitely go deep; I personally wasn't expecting Polka Dot Man or Egghead getting a significant amount of screen time. If you have played the Lego Batman 3 video game expect that kind of lineup in the movie. With this full slate of characters you would expect the story to be lacking but it was not. The main villains got their moment and it was enough to keep the flow moving perfectly. The only real thing that was well I guess the word to pick is ""weird"" as some of the voices just felt odd to me. I get the decision as this is a kids movie so the Joker shouldn't come off as scary but that is something I identify with the character. Some of the other voices come off as odd but that is just my personal preference. Jokes aside, this movie has a great message which is good to see in a movie that will be influential to kids you know since it is Batman after all.I would recommend this movie to all DC fans even if you don't like kiddy movies. This movie is jam packed with references and the movie almost comes off as a homage to Batman at times. If you are not a big fan of DC then you should still give this a try as the jokes alone are worth the price...well unless you couldn't appreciate the humor in the Lego Movie then this movie is probably not for you.",The Lego Batman Movie

This time, though, it's all about Batman! I didn't know what to expect when I heard this was being made but when those trailers arrived I knew I was in. I enjoyed The LEGO Batman Movie a lot more than I thought I would; it's full of so many things I wasn't expecting that I just couldn't help but love it. I wouldn't say the cast is as stellar as it's predecessor but the script certainly carries it along with joke after joke, and references and easter eggs that you're probably not going to pick up all of them upon first viewing. Not to say the cast is bad in any way; Will Arnett as Batman and Zac Galifianakis as the Joker are genius casting; the lines these two come out with are amazing and I just loved when each of them were on screen.And although a movie called ""The LEGO Batman Movie"" sounds like it's for kids, I think the older ones will certainly get a kick out of this like I did, especially if you're a film buff or a Batman fan. As I said before, the mentions and appearances you get in this are fantastic. But of course no film can carry itself on quips alone, The LEGO Batman Movie does have a story and although it's quite a familiar one and perhaps even similar in ways to The LEGO Movie, I still enjoyed seeing all the LEGO visuals and the top-notch animation that still looks like they filmed real LEGO pieces. There were some heartfelt drama in there too and I think it sends a good message which is what these type of films should do anyway.So all-in-all, I really enjoyed The LEGO Batman Movie, from literally the opening logos to the brilliant soundtrack, for me, it gets an 8/10.",The Lego Batman Movie
149,johnplocar,"""The Lego Batman Movie"" is fine, nowhere near as great as it could have been.",7,19 May 2017,"""The Lego Batman Movie"" is the spin-off/sequel to 2014's ""The Lego Movie"". Starring Will Arnett as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Zach Galifianakis as the Joker, in a story about their rivalry with one another. Along the way Dick Grayson, a.k.a. Robin, is taken under Batman's wing as well as Barbara Gordon and they help Batman discover the importance of family. Joker and his large villainous gang have some fiendish plans to destroy Gotham City in an attempt to make Batman realize that Joker is his greatest foe; which the movie is comedically showing the feud between Batman and the Joker in a way that parallels a 'relationship'.This movie was cute. I thought it was fine. I chuckled a number of times. The story and characters are charming enough, while also supplying a sweet message by the end of the movie. It's jam-packed with an ungodly amount of references and Easter-Eggs littered all throughout; not only directed in the 'Batman' lore, but a lot of Warner Bros. related films and history as well. And the animation is absolutely gorgeous eye candy. But...and I hate that I'm putting in a ""but""...I didn't love this movie. I didn't think it was as funny or close to being as strong of a film as ""The Lego Movie"". In terms of kids' flicks, in my opinion, ""The Lego Movie"" is practically a masterpiece. In its writing of comedy, characters, story, songs, while throwing in great animation, voice work, and heartfelt morals; ""The Lego Movie"" nails it all perfectly. It is not only one of the best films of 2014, but easily one of the best kids' films around. Period. So from my point of view, ""Lego Batman"" had a lot to live up to. Granted, I understand that's pretty unfair to ""Lego Batman"" to hold such high standards and I probably shouldn't have carried my feelings of the previous movie as much as I did, but even as it is I think that ""Lego Batman"" is just 'okay'. It's not great, I never really laughed out loud or all that much; with a comedy, which this essentially is, when the jokes aren't landing well it can become a bit tedious to sit through. Which from the lack of really funny jokes I did feel that there were some lulls in the story that kept me checking the clock a bunch. Unfortunately I never got all that invested in anything that was going on. I pretty much knew where everything was going from beginning to end and that didn't help too much in engaging me either. I think about 15-20 minutes could have, and probably should have, been cut from this movie to help its inconsistent pacing. Lastly, the movie had some real missed opportunities that it could have went with but quickly glossed over which was a shame.That being said, I still don't think it's a bad movie at all. Like I said before, it surely has its moments and overall I do recommend it. Plus, it is the type of movie that is so lighthearted and genuine in its motives and characters that I can't help but be charmed by it to an extent. It's kind of like the Muppets' movies, even in the lesser installments I can never find myself hating the Muppets, they're just that lovable. If you have children or are a huge Batman fan then there will be plenty to like about this movie. I liked it just fine, but I don't think I'll ever watch it again. If I want an awesome Lego movie to watch then I'll watch ""The Lego Movie"". If I want a funny and clever Batman movie to watch then I'll pop in ""Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders"". There are just more options that I think are better and funnier than ""Lego Batman"". If someone really wants to see it, I'm positive they'll get a kick out of it and that's fine. For me, I just need a little more than wall- to-wall references.",The Lego Batman Movie
150,BillSims28,"Hilarious, Jubilantly Frenetic, Perfectly Voiced",8,12 February 2017,"A spin off from the wildly entertaining and surprisingly well-made Lego Movie, the imaginatively titled Lego Batman Movie centres on Will Arnett's brooding vigilante superhero, his burgeoning family, large list of enemies, and perpetually crime-ridden city of Gotham. The film is a riotous explosion of colour and gleeful mayhem, poking fun at every Batman film and revelling in its references to all the clichés, plots, and inadvertently funny elements of the franchise. It's important to be prepared when going in to this film, and to expect an ADD-level of hyperactive flashiness, topping even the madcap nature of The Lego Movie. This will inevitably infuriate some but if you enjoyed the original 2014 film you will most likely enjoy this too, though it really is funny enough to warrant viewing regardless of that. Phil Lord and Chris Miller, though they are just producers on this film, showed with The Lego Movie and the Jump Street films that they are fantastic directors capable of making very funny films, and it will therefore be interesting to see how they do the Han Solo film in 2018. It is in fact the very definition of gag-a-minute, with constant clever visual gags, hilarious and clever Lego-Movie-style jokes, and plain silly hilarity that you just can't resist. I found myself chuckling almost non-stop throughout the entire film - it's just incredibly funny, especially for anyone who knows Batman or is feeling a little worn out by the superhero genre. The cast is magnificent, with Lego-Movie-scene-stealer Arnett excelling as the lead where his dark angst can be psychoanalysed in a manner appropriate for a U-rated film. Michael Cera is note-perfect as earnest and relentlessly peppy sidekick Robin, taken straight from a 1960s TV episode, and his character is often reminiscent of an orphan version of George Michael Bluth, his character in Arrested Development. Rounding out the cast are Zach Galifanakis as an insecure, very self-aware Joker (playing it as differently from Ledger/Leto as humanly possible), and Ralph Fiennes, voicing butler Alfred with uber-British sensibility and aloofness. Rosario Dawson is very funny, as is the unexpected appearance of Jemaine Clement. Overall The Lego Batman Movie is unrelentingly kinetic and just great fun. The never- ending slew of humour does not ever cease to entertain, and it's actually funnier than The Lego Movie which I thought at the time was one of the best gag-a-minute films I'd ever seen. Lego Batman may not have as much heart or Toy-Story-esque depth to it, but it's fast, funny, delectably animated, and consistently entertaining. 81/100.",The Lego Batman Movie

From its homages and mockery of the Batman franchise and it's great animation to its stellar voice acting, The Lego Batman Movie is everything most of the current DCEU movies wished they could be.The film opens with The Joker commandeering a plane as part of his plan to destroy Gotham City with the help of various other Batman villains. Batman then produces to crash the Joker's plans and goes on to completely defeat all of the villains but before the Joker can escape, Batman stops him only to hurt Joker's feelings by telling him that he means nothing to Batman, leading the Joker to seek vengeance on him. The next day, Bruce Wayne attends a retirement party for Commissioner Gordon while his daughter, Barbra Gordon ascends to the role of police commissioner. While there, Bruce meets a young orphan named Dick Grayson and unintentionally adopts him. When Barbra Gordon unveils her new plan to have the police force to operate without Batman's help, Bryce is furious but suddenly, The Joker crashes the party and surrenders to the police. Believing his arch-rival to be up to something, Batman stars to plan a hast mission but before he can set his plan into motion, Alfred demands that he take responsibility for Dick Grayson. Reluctantly, Batman agrees to take the boy under his wing. Now, Batman must learn what it means to be a team player as well as what it means to have a family and friends.In regards to Bruce Wayne saying that he has aged remarkably, he's not wrong in that aspect. The Lego Batman Movie is in a lot of ways an undisguised celebration of the most recognizable and beloved superhero the world has come to know over the previous 79 years and a pop culture icon who remains one of the most noticeable media idols in the history of entertainment. Frequently throughout the movie, the characters continually mention Batman's rich history in both comics and movies, from the Joker's statement that the two of them haven't gotten to really know each other in the 78 years they've been together or Alfred's remark about Batman's various phases in film from Batman V. Superman all the way back the Adam West show in the '60s. Even the slideshow that Barbra Gordon shows is a reference to Batman's first even comic appearance as well as the film series from the 1940s.The foundation of the Lego Batman Movie gives the characters as well as the script to remark on the vastness of Batman's lore. The movie is jam-packed full of references to the amount and span of Batman's history in comics, TV shows, and movies. From the shark repellent from the 60s Batman movie to the certain costume styles of the various villains to musical hints from previous movies to numerous fourth-wall mentions of other media that has influenced countless versions of The Dark Knight. All of this allows The Lego Batman Movie to be clear about the titular hero in a way only the Dark Knight was able to do. As such, The Lego Batman Movie gives the viewer an incredibly vast outline of the Batman mythos and it's characters, evaluating decades of comics and films in order to cut down Batman to his most basic and fundamental assists. The movie shows us a captivating presentation of The Dark Knight as a man so scared by the event of his parent's deaths that he has never permitted himself to grow up, while by some means unintentionally planting a family around him. For all of his celebrated darkness, The Lego Batman Movie honors that hope that is still at the heart of Batman's mythos even more so then what Nolan did with his Batman movies. To be fair, however, that isn't a very challenging or intelligent conclusion of who Batman is as a character. This is characteristic of the source material, in which Batman has built an entire Batfamily around him that is made up of different characters who carry the mantle of protecting Gotham at some point or another. Over the course of Batman's history, there have been at least 5 different Robins, 4 different Batgirls and a few Batwomen to fill up the roster and that's nothing compared to the amount of supporting characters like Jim Gordon, Alfred Pennyworth, Two-Face, Bane or even Superman.The conception of Batman building a family in this movie is nothing new as it's flowed over into other Batman-related media as well. The 60s Batman show centered on the concept of Batman and Robin working together as The Dynamic Duo while also bringing in the image of Batgirl. Batman: The Animated Series did a beautiful job showing us the Batfamily working together across the show's entire run while Batman: The Brave and The Bold is a TV series that quite simply shows Batman being awesome and how many friends he's had over the years from Aquaman and Superman to Green Arrow. Anyone with even the slightest knowledge of who Batman is will understand just how important family is to The Caped Crusader. However, there is a motive for this aspect of The Dark Knight that has been minimized in recent years. Ever since the 80s', there has been this perception of Batman as a bit of a lone wolf as Frank Miller started this trend when The Dark Knight Returns was released even though Frank did take the time to introduce a new Robin.Now, with that being said, The Caped Crusader's big-screen debut played a much larger role in this changing awareness of the character. When Tim Burton released his Batman movies, he notably smoothed out The Caped Crusader to take him away from the colorful campiness of the 60s TV show and also made an effort to make Bruce Wayne a character cut off and detached, an outsider living in a large mansion with his butler who is ineffective at living a regular life due to the pain he still carries inside him so there was a meaning behind why Robin and Batgirl weren't in Burton's movies because they weren't needed for the story Burton wanted to tell. It also didn't help the later movies by trying to bring in Robin and Batgirl as both attempts to introduce them in Batman Forever and Batman And Robin failed miserably and ended up killing the momentum that the franchise had been building up until then and made Batman out to be a cinematic punching bag for the next 8 years. Of course, the horridness of Batman and Robin and to a lesser degree, Batman Forever had little to do with the introductions of these characters but their existence in those films served to prove that the audience preferred the idea of an isolated and confined take on Batman. In parallel, the comics in the 80s' and 90s' were also pushing The Dark Knight away from his supporting teammates and his friends as Batgirl was crippled by The Joker in The Killing Joke and Jason Todd was murdered in the Death in the Family storyline. Hell, in the Tower of Babel comics, Batman distances himself from the Justice League making it all the more clear Batman as a loner was the way to go. Following the massive box-office and critical success of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight films, the idea of Batman being a lone wolf was only boosted further and while Bruce Wayne does build up a substitute family in all three movies, it's very minimal at best. More than that, Nolan has implied that Batman is a burden to Bruce ever having a working family as he drives Alfred away and doesn't find true happiness until he meets Selina and truly accepts John Blake after falsifying his own death.All of this is one of the reasons why The Lego Batman Movie is such a breath of fresh air in the larger background of cinematic Batman films. At its core, the movie is more about Robin than it is about The Caped Crusade, just that alone is actually a high excuse for Robin's existence in the film and for the family theme to kick in. The movie is basically a lengthy study on what Robin along with other members of the Bat-family brings to the mythology of Batman in terms of creating a family around Bruce Wayne. At the end of the day, Bruce is also a wandering child who creates a fantasy around himself. Much like The Lego Movie before it, The Lego Batman Movie builds upon the idea of Batman being a jackass and a cold loner who has no emotional contact with anybody. In a few ways, this is an addition of the kind of Batman refined by Burton and Nolan as well as several comic book writers. The main plot at the center of the movie is your standard family movie fare. You have the lead character who is a jerk to everyone but eventually comes to appreciate the people in his life and realize that he can't work without them but nevertheless, the story flows so nicely and the characters are so likable and well-written that even the most pretentious filmgoer will at least find something to like about the movie. One of the most touching moments in the film is where Batman comes to understand just how much the Joker means to him.And, to be honest, The Lego Batman Movie is intelligent enough and self-alert enough that it's able to work on those circumstances by itself. As a typical yet satisfying family movie about the ethics of family, working together and friendship, The Lego Batman Movie still works incredibly well. It's comical without the need to be scathing and it's clever without the need to seem disjointed. It balances a fine line between being too childish and undermining the shared quality of its main moral. It's an excellent family film in the same vein as Toy Story, The Iron Giant and many of the animated Disney movies even if its points of view are a little less refined than those movies but unlike films like The Emoji Movie and Minions, The Lego Batman Movie never talks down to its audience nor insults their intelligence as it's a film both kids and adults can watch and enjoy.Nonetheless, it's still an excellent homage to The D",The Lego Batman Movie
153,audrablum,"Geared for kids, good for laughs",8,11 November 2018,"This week I watched the animation-action-comedy The Lego Batman Movie (2017). The logline reads ""A cooler-than-ever Bruce Wayne must deal with the usual suspects as they plan to rule Gotham City, while discovering that he has accidentally adopted a teenage orphan who wishes to become his sidekick."" It was an exciting moment when I first learned that The Lego Batman Movie would be produced., since Lego Batman was my favorite character in The Lego Movie (2014). I felt like the writing was just as fun and whimsical as the The Lego Movie (2014), but was definitely geared more for children. However, the plot dialogue between Lego Batman and Lego Joker was hysterical. Albeit more of a child's film, there is much to be respected about this movie. There is a lot that goes into this film from all sides of production and it shows. For one, Lego Batman's house outdoes anything that we see in any other Bat-production to date. The house alone seems like it took a lot of work from the writer's and director's vision to the execution of the set designer and animators. The actors did a fantastic job on their voice performances and the casting for the roles was on point. At first I wasn't crazy about the Joker being voiced by Zach Galifianakis, but it grew on me through the movie. All in all, I found this to be a well produced movie and I would watch it again.",The Lego Batman Movie

155,tommystans,Better than Superman II featuring Batman (BM V SM) and Suicide (Avengers) Squad,10,13 April 2017,"After watching the Lego Movie when it first came out, I thought it was fun, memorable and colourful. Despite the whole 'chosen one' story line. When they announced that a Batman movie was coming out all Lego style I was pretty much looking forward to it and after seeing it, it was fun! The story is not dark and gloomy like the 2016 trash film known as 'Batman Vs. Superman' and the bland but OK Suicide Squad. The movie had a nice tribute to the other Batman films and even the campy 1960's TV show, which was hilarious that they showed actual footage from the show. The Joker was great and had some good development much better than his appearance in SS, in which he BARELY had any enough screen time because they stupidly cut his scenes out for no rhyme or reason. If I digress, I like the joke when Batman said that having a band of super villains versing another batch is just stupid, one of the best jokes from this movie.Heck Batman and Superman's rivalry is just hilarious when you make them egotistical. Because that's how I picture them and the crossover of the Joker with villains like Lord Voldermort, Kong and the Daleks was just funny as well. The story is good, the characters are funny and it's worth checking out!",The Lego Batman Movie
156,RLTerry1,"Nonstop antics, action, and thrills!",10,10 February 2017,"Warner Bros. and Ratpac Dune present a movie that is equally one-hundred percent Batman whilst still completely LEGO. From the moment the opening title sequence of logos appears under the voice-over of a self-aware Batman, this brilliant animated film will take captive your attention and draw you in with a batarang of perfectly choreographed fight scenes and incredibly well timed self- reflexive humor. The LEGO Batman Movie is a brilliant combination of a contemporary story on the backdrop of Batman nostalgia. Whether you are a fan of the show from the 1960s, the Burton universe (as I am), the dark world of Nolan, or Snyder's, you will find strategically placed references that fit exceptionally well into this LEGO universe. While the film is aimed at a younger audience, there are humor, easter eggs, and allusions to the various Batman shows and movies for adults to appreciate. Underscoring the over-the-top high concept plot, is a heartwarming story of love, family, and friends. This Batman movie pulls out all the stops as most, if not all, Batman's villains receive screen time as well as other members of the Justice League with Batgirl and Robin. Oh yeah, the Joker IS actually in this Batman movie! With a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes and an 8.1 on IMDb, this film is sure to be a huge success this weekend.When after a failed attempt at a takeover of Gotham by the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) and his henchmen, Batman (Will Arnett) is all too happy to accept all the credit for stopping the squad of villains. However, this time is different. The Joker and his henchmen give themselves up to the new Commissioner Gordon (Rosario Dawson). When the law enforcement and people of Gotham conclude that there is no longer a need for a masked vigilante, Batman finds himself having an identity crisis. Meanwhile, at a party, Bruce Wayne accidentally adopts young Richard Greyson (Michael Cera), and now is faced with the challenge of balancing his newfound role as a parent with Batman's penchant for crime fighting. With pressures from Alfred (Ralph Fiennes) and Barbara Gordon mourning in Batman's personal and professional lives, he must work through these challenges in order to save the city. Only this time, he may not be able to do it on his own.What's not to like??? The LEGO Batman Movie is one of those animated films that is perfect for (1) the whole family and groups of friends, as well as (2) legacy and new Batman fans. Just the animation and production design are positively mind blowing. With few exceptions, every design in the film from people to buildings and vehicles can be created with those iconic plastic building blocks. Much like with the previous LEGO movie, other LEGO universes get screen time as well (some of which are mentioned by name and others are implied), such as Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, King Kong and more. With all the characters in the film, the focus is never shifted from Batman and Joker. There are many rabbit trails the film could have gone down, but it always stays true to the central characters. Overstimulation is another risk in a film like this one; but, for all the action sequences and ensemble casts, never once does the film feel that it is way too much to take in and enjoy. On top of the brilliant animation and design, is solid writing with excellent character development. Crafting the vision is director Chris McKay. Selecting the right director to handle all the elements of a LEGO movie is no short order. And Warner Bros and Ratpac Dune made a killer choice in McKay who brought us Robot Chicken: Star Wars: Episode III.One of my personal favorite elements from the movie is the nostalgia meticulously and strategically woven into the plot. If you grew up watching the show from the 1960s or even reruns with your parents, you will be surprised with the echoes of the past and how they fit in perfectly with this Batman world written by Seth Grahame-Smith et al. Even the pow, bam, zap sound effect bubbles make a cameo appearance. The LEGO Batman Movie offers the best of all the Batman stories over the years. As I am not familiar with the Batman comics, I imagine that there are comic book references in the film for the enjoyment of that audience as well. Not as self-aware as Deadpool, this film does contain a hint of self-awareness, but never takes the place of the foreground action; however, it supports the main story nicely. Even the costumes are representative of many Batman universes. For the most part, Batman's costume is rooted in the one worn by Michael Keaton in Batman and Batman Returns, but Batgirl and Robin's costumes, respectively, are more reminiscent of the show from the 1960s. Joker is an excellent combination of the, in my opinion, definitive Joker: Jack Nicholson but hints of the more recent Jared Leto and Heath Ledger Jokers are in his costume, makeup, and behavior. We even get a more accurate representation of Harley Quinn in this film. There is quite literally something for everyone in LEGO Batman.Looking for a great film to watch this weekend that doesn't involve some sappy victimized Stockholm Syndrome-esque warped love story? Then head to your local theatre to catch The LEGO Batman Movie on the big screen! What better way to spend the weekend leading up to Valentine's Day than laughing with your date??? Even if you're spending Valentine's Batman style-- flying solo--you will still have a great time at this movie.",The Lego Batman Movie
157,Molongirl,Explains why Batman is always so miserable,7,19 April 2017,"I think the makers missed the mark for kids on this one. I loved the 2014 Lego movie, it had an appropriate story-line for kids and was such a hoot for those of us who grew up with and still love Lego. This one had a story-line that I suspect left younger ones feeling a bit flat; Batman is grumpy because he hasn't got a family, psychological stuff for kids, what's wrong with straight forward adventure, fighting the baddies etc. Batman's grumpy voice and inward looking angst was a bit hard for me to take let alone a kid looking for laughs and fun. The music was also a bit of a miss - after the success of ""Everything is Awesome"" this one had shrieking guitar riffs - not exactly catchy for kids. The standout moment for me was a brief glimpse of Adam West as Batman doing a crazy Egyptian dance - do google it, no wonder us survivors from the 60s are so messed up. The range of villains was great and there were some good action scenes but this just didn't hit the mark somehow. I hope the producers concentrate on a really good story for the younger audience next time and they may end up with a winner.",The Lego Batman Movie
158,Thekeybaldemasterrises,"It's not just a great kids movie, it's a great Batman movie!!!",9,10 February 2017,"This is the best theatrical film based on DC property that WB has put out in years. Sorry fans but this blew all 3 of the cinematic universe movies out of the freaking water. Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.",The Lego Batman Movie

Just watch it.It tells the story of a troubled Batman who is trying to escape from responsibilities and family because he doesn't want to lose his family again. The story is very entertaining and it can be both funny and emotional, just from one scene to another. It is able to take itself in a parody but also very serious when necessary. And also it has thousand of references to all the Batman & DC Comics Universe, and not just this universes, but I won't spoil anything.Will Arnett will surely become one of the favourite Batman of all time with his awesome voice work in here. Also a very special mention to the other three main characters, Michael Cera as Robin, Rosario Dawson as Barbara Gordon, and Ralph Fiennes as the British ""kick-butler"", Alfred. All the characters are very great and you have here thousands of characters that if you're familiar with this world, you will recognize.The visuals are amazing. The way the LEGO figures move from one place to another and the way all the characters are created implies a very hard work from the filmmakers. Also a special mention to the magnificent score created by Lorne Balfe which reminded me like a mix of all the previous Batman scores in an epic and heroic way.

162,hou-3,Totally lacks the fun of the first lego movie,5,16 February 2017,"My wife and I loved the first lego movie for its kick-ass humour, wonderful animation and terrific sense of fun. This movie still has the animation but has much less of the humour and little if any of the fun. It was bound to suffer to some extent from the loss of novelty but what really spoiled it for us was the horribly dour way Batman was presented, as a deeply misanthropic individual. Even the voice given to him was grim, very low pitched, depressing to listen to. The constant parades of heroes and villains constituted shameless marketing. The plot line was vacuous, it seemed to have been put together with the sole intention of maximising, on the one hand, the chance to promote lego products, and on the other, the display of nonstop scenes of destruction and chaos. The 'moral' of the movie was ridiculous, even for a film aimed at a youthful audience. Thoroughly trite. Overall, a great disappointment. Five for the sheer skill of the technique.",The Lego Batman Movie
163,cschultz-2,Enjoy the Ride!,8,14 February 2017,"Children are capable of creating enormously complex and detailed games and role-playing activities which can reside on the most unlikely frontiers of possibility and logic. If the odds are a million-to-one against the success of an idea or probability of an event, the child's mind will be naturally drawn to the one instead of the one-million, and insist the idea is well worth a try, or patiently await the event.This boldness of reasoning must also drive the creative people behind The Lego Batman Movie, the new release from a conglomerate of companies including Warner Brothers Pictures, Lego, and DC Entertainment. The Lego Batman Movie is both a spin off and a continuation of The Lego Movie, a surprisingly successful animated feature from 2014.The opening song which defined The Lego Movie declared with pointed optimism and infinite cleverness, ""Everything is Awesome!"" And in The Lego Batman Movie, everything still is, but the filmmakers have amped up the awesomeness by about a million percent, and produced a movie which just might cause parents to drag their children off to the theater instead of the other way around.Dozens of movies over the last two decades or so have examined with grave countenance and somber demeanor the mythos of comic book literature—the duality, the psychology, and emotional complexity, the inherent isolation of the superhero. The Lego Batman Movie is among a very few to examine the plain silliness of the entire notion of superheroes, and in the process unleash the funny bone of the genre for a tap dance or two.And it's richly appropriate that the foundation and artistic medium for all the merriment is the palette of Lego, the line of shiny and seemingly indestructible interlocking building blocks manufactured in brilliant and durable primary colors. You won't really need 3D glasses to enhance the The Lego Batman Movie's visual appeal, but certain scenes might require sunglasses to mute the vivid colors.Lego building blocks, of course, can be used by children, and sometimes adults, in an infinite variety of ways to construct objects, and then be deconstructed and used again and again and again. Most of the objects, vehicles, buildings, and even some characters used in The Lego Batman Movie, although computer-generated and enhanced, could at least in theory be constructed from the interlocking Lego building blocks.The will to believe—or to disbelieve, as needed—is strong. And possibly a number of us have at one time or another have been persuaded to acknowledge in comic books and motion pictures the need for a dual identity, a secret persona which is instantly obvious to any sane and rational person in the real world. And this type of absurdly illogical logic is the bedrock of the picture.At one point in the movie, a character discovers the location of the Batcave, Batman's secret hideaway beneath Stately Wayne Manor—located, as a child would imagine, on Wayne Island, off the coast of Gotham City. That character with supreme incredulity asks, ""You mean, Batman lives in Bruce Wayne's basement?"" And Batman replies with perfect logic, ""NoBruce Wayne lives in Batman's attic."" It's the ultimate disconnect from reality—the character's massive ego actually requires competition with the other part of his own personality.The Canadian actor Will Arnett, supplying the voice of Batman, is hilarious in his gravity and cluelessness, and simultaneously in both his conceit and ultra-seriousness. The voice Arnett uses in the dual characterization of Batman and his secret counterpart, gazillionaire playboy Bruce Wayne is a combination of the husky, rasping whispers used in previous Batman incarnations by Christian Bale and Michael Keaton, with a hint of Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry thrown in for good measure.The genius of the movie is that it contains the sort of undiluted imagination and goodhearted fun which might've been created in the mind of a sugar-enhanced seven-year-old. And supplying the voices for Lego Batman roles along with Arnett are Michael Cera as Batman's reluctantly-adopted son Dick Grayson, the British actor Ralph Fiennes as Batman's indefatigably understanding but increasingly exasperated butler Alfred Pennyworth, and Rosario Dawson as Police Commissioner Barbara Gordonwho received her education, by the way, at Harvard for Police.Also along for the ride are the voices of Jenny Slade, Conan O'Brien, Billy Dee Williams, the always-dependable character actor Hector Elizondo, Zoe Kravitz, Eddie Izzard, sportscaster Brent Musburger, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill as Superman and Green Lantern, Mariah Carey as Gotham City's mayor, and a properly unhinged Zach Galifianakis as The Joker. The list of popular culture icons making cameo appearances in the picture is seemingly endless, but includes King Kong, the Wicked Witch of the West and the Flying Monkeys from The Wizard of Oz, the Daleks from Doctor Who, and the entirety of DC Comics' Justice League of America.Director Chris McKay keeps the picture moving along at such a breakneck speed that the viewer doesn't have a chance to linger too long of the absence of continuity in the script, credited to Seth Grahame-Smith, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Jared Stern, and John Whittington. Presumably the high number of writers were required to pack the movie's 104 minutes with so many jokes and pop culture references that likely two or more viewings will be required to catch all themparticularly since the audience laughter is so strong throughout the movie that much of the dialogue goes unheard.There's too much plot going on in The Lego Batman Movie to detail much, other than Arnett's Batman strenuously resists and sometimes even physically rejects the notion that while solitary vigilante crime-fighting might be a blast, other priorities—such as friends, family, feelings, loyalty, and responsibility—are even better. And even The Joker needs a hug once in a while.That's not a bad message for a children's movieor an adult's either. Rated PG, The Lego Batman Movie is highly recommended for children, or anyone who yearns to remember what it's like to be one.",The Lego Batman Movie

This movie is not short of epicness and never goes through a slow pacing throughout its runtime .It does justice to batman fans with numerous references, and then they bring in the eye of mordor and Voldemort - well i'll come to that later. A little background before I get to this movie, Basically batman is a 75 year old character and there are references to pretty much most of the pivotal stunts batman and his gang pulled up all these years including the shark repellent. Also I haven't played LEGO's Batman Video game so am not really sure if the humor or references have been reused in this movie, so please excuse me if I am not able to call that out here in this review. LEGO pretty much owns licenses to all franchises the younger generation crowd has started to bet their money on;DC, marvel, LOTR, HP, STAR WARS to name a few. So they are now free to set the password to batcave as ""Iron man sucks"" or let godzilla and king kong run around Gotham. The fun in this movie is unlimited but my only qualm is the story was unoriginal and something which doesn't give reasons to be cherished. The film makers could have been bold and spinned off in a new direction but decided to bet on the good old superhero movie formula.

167,ReelLifeReviews,Surprisingly enjoyable,8,16 February 2017,"No, YOU teared up at a movie filled with cartoon legos! We went back and forth whether we'd see this one, and had even officially removed it from our movie list for the year. But a random Thursday night and a movie voucher changed that. There are some hilarious moments in this movie. I expected to like some jokes, but I didn't think I would be laughing out loud. There were some definite misses peppered in where no one in any of the age groups laughed that were present. There were more of these instances than I would have liked. Another question mark for me was, well, the fact that they're legos. But I never really gave it another thought after the first couple scenes. They were pretty clever in how they incorporated it. There is an excellent message about the importance of family and friends in this movie. And did I mention the 80's music?? I think the use of that upped the score another half a point for me. Overall this movie was a great surprise and should appeal to all ages. 8/10.",The Lego Batman Movie
168,jakebirkel,Surprise! It's good!,9,13 August 2018,"As someone who's childhood was quite literally LEGOs, I knew going in that I would laugh and say ""cute"" to this movie. No way did I expect it to be this good though.This film isn't just a kids movie about realizing how important your friends are to your life, it's also somehow the best character study into Batman. This film really puts the dark knight under a microscope and brings a whole new meaning to the way he's acted in every film since the Tim Burton Batmans.Voice performances were great, as expected. Will Arnett was hilariously gruff, as needed. Michael Cera continues to show Hollywood his childish side and shines. Ralph Fiennes and Rosario Dawson definitely earned their parts. Zach G obviously can't live up to Mark Hamill, but plays the Joker decently.The LEGO Gotham world is beautifully constructed and animated, and keeps tradition with the previous all-awesome LEGO movie by keeping some things in-universe. Props to Chris McKay.It's something young and old fans alike will enjoy, 9/10.",The Lego Batman Movie
169,wackywhovian11,Lego Friends Unite,8,27 July 2017,"My review of The Lego Batman Movie Who didn't play with Legos when they were a child? I know I did. Making things from a house for my lego puppy or a car for my lego kitty cat to drive around town in. Now The Lego Batman Movie is like playing with your lego blocks but on the sliver screen.Bruce Wayne big shocker is Batman, if you didn't know that, umm where have you been? Sorry hope that wasn't a spoiler because it's second nature that Bruce Wayne is the Dark Knight. Anyway Bruce feels he's life is incomplete because he's the hero of Gotham but no one knows it. He has no one to share this information with except Alfred his butler who basically his only family since Bruce's family was killed. Family is the main theme of this film. Bruce is lonely and wants a family BUT he doesn't want to let anyone get close to him or seek help but he'll learn that seeking help isn't a bad thing.One night after rescuing Gotham for the millions time at a fundraiser Dick Grayson aka Robin meets Bruce and thought he'd be a great father figure and ends up helping Batman defending the city against criminals like The Joker, Harley Quinn, Bane and Dalek. Yep you read that right. Daleks from Doctor Who is in the movie which is a treat for me who is a huge Doctor Who fan.Batman greatest enemy The Joker wants to take over the city, big surprise but in Lego form it's hilarious. Batman will need to learn to put his pride aside to defeat his enemies and not be afraid to ask for help from Robin, Barbara Gordon aka Batgirl and even his trusty butler.Should you watch this film? If you love Legos and Batman this is a great combination of them both. So yes buy it and add it to your collection.",The Lego Batman Movie

This film feels like a spin-off, in that it has no consequences and feels somehow small scale, which is fine. The movie is very fun and more child friendly than the previous Lego film. The voice acting is great, and it's a fun movie, it just feels like it lacks some heart, and just feels like a Lego movie put out there for the sake of merchandising.",The Lego Batman Movie

174,ChrisinDesMoines,"I'm biased, so keep that in mind while reading my review",10,24 January 2021,"Batman has always been one of my favorite comic book hero's and many fond memories of me as a kid revolve around watching Adam West and Burt Ward beating up the villains with the graphic ""Pow"", ""Crash"" and other graphics that they put on the screen.My first watching of this movie was taking my (then) five year old nephew to see it in the park a couple of years ago who has been brainwashed into believing that Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book hero (a source of family friction) so I wanted to introduce him to Batman that would be age friendly to him.Watching a movie in a park with a group of kids probably isn't the best way to keep track of the dialogue and plot, but I did catch many of the references and in jokes that your die hard Batman fan would get a kick out of, even if the kids wouldn't catch them, so I was intrigued enough to purchase it to watch with him again (That's my story and I'm sticking to it!)The plot is great, Joker is obsessed with getting Batman to chase after him more than he is in taking over Gotham City, but Batman is a loner who doesn't care about anyone at all, even Joker, which hurts Joker's feelings. But circumstances forces Batman to depend upon the orphan boy who weaseled his way into Bruce Wayne's home (and heart) and become Batman's sidekick Robin. He also finds himself getting some unwanted aid from the Mayor, Barbara Gordon/Batgirl.They crack jokes about every single Batman movie/TV show ever made as well as redo some of the iconic Batman/Detective Comic covers in Lego format so if you're a Batman fan, you will get a chuckle from the in jokes and references. The movie promotes some fantastic family values about how you need to depend upon friends and family (and the occasional bad guy when you're both trying to save people that you care about).Because of this movie I have started collecting the Lego DC Comic lineup of movies, all of which I highly recommend to anyone to watch with their kids. Lots of subtle jokes and cracks to keep adults entertained, especially parents, without falling into the innuendo category. I don't get tired of watching these with my nephews at all and hopefully they are left with the same fond memories that I had watching Adam West with my dad and uncle when I was a kid.",The Lego Batman Movie

Anyone who likes a laugh should watch this as good as The Lego Movie in my Opinion",The Lego Batman Movie
176,roblesar99,Lighthearted Superhero Fun,8,6 February 2017,"""Deadpool for kids."" That's how my roommate described The Lego Batman Movie upon exiting our advance screening of the spin-off to 2014's The Lego Movie. Upon further reflection, I realized that his description held some merit, for the film was crammed with subversive superhero humor, pop culture references, and a great teenage sidekick. However, The Lego Batman Movie proves endearingly entertaining, honoring Batman's 80-year legacy while also managing to deliver laughs by the bat-load. Director Chris McKay's feature might not be on par with the film that inspired it, but it sure comes close.Perhaps the film's biggest asset is its cast, with Will Arnett continuing his parody of Christian Bale's Batman. Arnett voices Batman with a delightful degree of self-awareness, oftentimes breaking the fourth wall to great comedic effect. Meanwhile, Michael Cera proves perfect as Dick Grayson/Robin, imbuing the character with a charming awkwardness that makes him the perfect foil for Batman. Ralph Fiennes proves an inspired choice for the role of Alfred Pennyworth, bringing his talents to animation with ease, while Rosario Dawson makes for a great Barbara Gordon/Batgirl, capable of standing on equal footing with Batman himself.The film also benefits from Zach Galifianakis' spin on The Joker, who not only makes him a compelling villain, but also manages to thankfully wash away the taste of Jared Leto's Joker. Galifianakis makes The Joker a more emotional character than I expected, but in a clever way that highlights the long-running animosity between him and Batman. While his plans to destroy Gotham aren't entirely original, the execution of the animation and his motivation serve as enough compensation.The animation is simply breathtaking, incredibly detailed and faithful to old Lego stop-motion videos. For an animated film, I was impressed with the angles chosen, as well as the cinematography, with several shots standing out throughout the course of the feature. Everything felt seamless and organic, despite the nature of Legos themselves, which merely serve as building blocks. The animators deserve credit for giving these figures such a nuanced range of emotion, able to convey a variety of feelings despite the inherent difficulties that accompany the source material. The majority of these characters spend significant time wearing a mask or simply being Lego figurines, and yet the audience can still sympathize with them because of the stunning animation.Additionally, the film contains some fantastic action sequences that make clever use of Batman's vast arsenal of vehicles and gadgets. I won't spoil the litany of adversaries that Batman faces off against during the course of the film, but many of the cameos left me in stitches, for they were not only brilliantly implemented, but completely unexpected. Go in with as little information as possible and the film's surprises will prove much more hilarious. And it would not be an understatement to say that the feature elevates the bar in regards to just how meta entertainment can be. Referencing everything in the Batman canon from the 1966 Adam West feature to Tom Hardy's portrayal of Bane, audiences will be satisfied no matter the level of knowledge they possess.But like any animated feature, The Lego Batman Movie touches on some important themes, albeit, without the nuance of The Lego Movie. With a penchant for working alone, Batman learns about the importance of teamwork and confronts his own fears about family. While the film's themes sometimes take a backseat to the story, which moves at near- breakneck pace, their inclusion nonetheless merits mention and elevates the film from appearing as an animated marketing tool specifically targeting children. McKay ensures that the film appeals to a wide audience, allowing it to serve as a great introduction to the character for young children and another worthy addition to Batman's ever-growing catalog of features for older generations.In the end, I left my advance screening of The Lego Batman Movie with a grin on my face. While the film might not be as consistently hilarious as its predecessor, it still makes for worthwhile entertainment, while managing to bring both Batman and The Joker back from the brink after a less-than-stellar 2016.Viewed at an advance screening on February 4, 2017 in Dartmouth College's Loew Auditorium.Rating: 8/10 (Great)",The Lego Batman Movie

178,cosmicfish14,Another Fun Lego Film,8,14 February 2017,"Its kind of funny to think that this was probably the best film associated with DC in almost a decade.Anyways, The Lego Batman Movie was an absolute blast of an animated film with a bit more depth and character than I was expecting. I was expecting a few jabs at the Batman franchise and not much else, but there were more than a few clever easter eggs and references while still being faithful to the character (even if it is a complete parody of it). With that said, it does discuss some interesting aspects of Batman's character and uses it to create some genuine humor and emotion.The animation in this and The Lego Movie has some of the most creative uses of CG animation I've seen out of any animated film. The way they implement lens flares, depth of field, and distinct lighting that makes the film look absolutely beautiful.So this weekend was pretty great, considering its February. Also I'm glad that this beat out Fifty Shades Darker in the box office.88/100",The Lego Batman Movie
179,MaxHaydon1994,7/10,7,18 July 2017,"I was hesitant to watch the Lego Batman Movie just as I was the first Lego Movie.On both occasions I've been pleasantly surprised by the films wit and charm. The musical numbers play a huge part in the theme of the film as it did for its predecessor and there are so many reference points it's almost an over load of batman history.That however doesn't take away from the fact this film breaks the fourth wall with great confidence. Including other franchises such as Doctor Who and Harry Potter only add's to the wacky world created within the film.But it's not all cheap jokes and resorting to reference points. The plot for this film is actually pretty solid. Batman must face the Joker, the Ridler, Bane and all his others Gotham based enemy's on top of the Dalek's, King Kong and Voldermort. Whilst facing all these bad guys he must also face a bigger fear, accepting help from others and being surrounded by family again.For a solid plot and making me laugh shamefully, I give the Lego Batman Movie a 7/10.",The Lego Batman Movie

183,michaeltong-29180,Like Playing Batman With Your Un-Cool Mom,5,1 June 2017,"If the first Lego movie was about a son messing around with his father's Lego and the two eventually finding common ground, then Lego Batman is what it's like to play Batman with your annoying nagging mother in the form of Bat Girl.The film opens with a similar energy as The Lego Movie, but it falls apart very quickly and the story becomes mired in the very clichés it's attempting to poke fun at.Batman isn't good at working with others. It's a theme that has been explored countless times. Yet despite the self-awareness of Lego Batman it still manages to drag on and get annoying as hell. It's the same theme that made Batman & Robin so obnoxious.Pretty much every time Bat Girl opens her mouth it's like listening to a lecture from your mother about playing well with others and obeying the rules. Here you are just trying to role-play as The Dark Knight and you have to listen to someone talk about the virtues of teamwork. Many if not most animated kids films tend to incorporate some kind of moral or message (which I don't have a problem with), but this is way too in your face and heavy handed it sucks the fun right out of the film.Another problem is that Lego Batman doesn't give you much reason to care. The Lego Movie succeeds in this by having an average Joe character as well as the sub-plot of the son and his father, and you can clearly distinguish the dramatic and comedic moments. In Lego Batman the tone is incredibly muddled, shifting from manic to dramatic in an instant while it tries to shoehorn in character development.For Lego Batman they took what was basically a good gag in the Lego Movie and tried to stretch it out for an hour and forty minutes. It doesn't work unless you think Big Bang Theory is funny and that references to nerdy things are jokes in and of themselves. Granted there are some pretty funny moments scattered throughout the film, mainly in the first two thirds. By the last third of the film they've exhausted pretty much all the jokes.On the technical side it looks just as good as the first film and the realism of the Lego textures is something to admire. However, I did notice a lot more cheating this time around. In The Lego Movie everything was made out of Lego, even smoke and water. Here, smoke is just obvious CGI and so is the water. The characters also stretch and extend in ways that Lego pieces can't, which was done in Lego Movie but concealed much better.After being blown away by the brilliance of Lego Movie I was very disappointed by Lego Batman which couldn't live up to the very high bar its predecessor set. Lego Movie was full of heart whereas Lego Batman felt like an attempt by DC to damage control a lot of the negative attention they've received for their handling of Justice League. Lego Batman relies entirely on references and fails to create a unique or compelling story, as such I can only give it 5/10.",The Lego Batman Movie

185,nickscheetz,It definitely has hilarious jokes and a good message but there are some complaints I have,7,10 June 2018,"While I did definitely have a great time watching this there are 2 major things about this film that really bother me, with that said let's talk about the awesome stuff. This is obviously made by the creators of The Lego Movie therefore we have really cool animation, creative designs for all the beloved characters of the DC universe as well as the unknowns, and a very clever childish tone. The voice acting really works to, consisting of Rosario Dawson as Batgirl, Zach Galifianakis as the Joker, Ralph Fiennes as Alfred, Michael Cera as Robin, and of course the best casting choice of them all, Will Arnett as Batman (I'll talk about him more in a moment), there are even tones of cameos from other celebrities and it's impossible to name them all. The hate-relationship between Batman and the Joker is a very unique and clever concept that's never been done before in a Batman movie alluding to the self-awareness that the film loves to poke fun at which can result in a lot of funny break-up and get-back-together moments. Robin's adorable innocence is always a welcoming highlight whenever he's onscreen making it very obvious that he's a child who can do literally anything you tell him, even in reverse. The film is also filled with lots of references to other DC properties, such examples include Alfred discussing the different phases Batman went through for the past 50 decades while shots from different movies that came each decade made with Legos appear (as shown in the trailer) which is talked about again by Batgirl showing the other famous shots from the previous media Batman has been in, the collection of Batmobiles Batman has in the Batcave, Billy Dee Williams voicing Two-Face after only being able to play Harvey Dent in Tim Burton's Batman, mentioning the Suicide Squad, and of course Batman having the famous Shark-Repellent Spray. Batman's portrayal in this film is one of my all-time favorite portrayals of him thus far, the writers are basically making fun of him by having him as a greedy, egotistical, narcissist who can't handle anybody but himself winning in everything which is exactly how I see him, I dare say he's making all other famous and beloved franchises out there look bad because it doesn't seem like anybody cares about anything other than him, and this film almost perfectly represents that. But if I were to say what the best part of the film is, it has got to be none other than the opening, the film opens up with Batman narrating and addressing lots of cliches we get in all movies such as company logos appearing, dramatic music, and films opening with a black screen, then it builds up a scheme all Batman's villains are plotting, while quoting and mentioning scenes from The Dark Knight and Tim Burton's Batman, Batman arrives in a disguise and as soon as he reveals himself he ends up defeating every single one of his villains all at the exact same time while singing a song he wrote that talks about how awesome he is, this scene is a perfect way to represent how much you love a certain property or character, sometimes I imagine watching this but with Spider-Man beating up his villains, I dare say that this scene almost as good as the opening title sequence of X-Men: The Animated Series. Although now it's time for me to address what ruins the movie for me which are 2 different things, 1. Batgirl, she's so unlikable and such a Debbie-Downer in this, constantly getting after Batman for every little thing he does, talking about being supervised and following the law, and complaining, this is the exact same reason why I hate Lois Griffin and Donna Tubbs. 2. The constant insults thrown at Superman in this, Superman is my favorite DC superhero and I even say he's the best superhero in the world and yet hardly anybody else in the world seems to agree with me, people seem to have forgotten that Superman was the first superhero ever created in history thus he pioneered the trend of superheroes, and yet in this film he's constantly made to look bad in this, aside from Batman making jokes about how he can beat Superman, saying he's better than him, and blowing a raspberry at him when he sees him on the news, what happens is Batman breaks into the Fortress of Solitude and destroys the crystals containing memories of Superman's family on Krypton as a means to steal the Phantom Zone Projector to prove to Batgirl he can put his villains away for good, and when he learns his lesson in the end, he doesn't bother returning it to him, it gets destroyed and he doesn't even care, WHAT A JERK! He destroyed the only remaining memories of Superman's beloved parents Jor-El and Lara, stole a dangerous device Superman couldn't allow to get into the wrong hands and got away with it, that is one of the coldest thing I've ever seen Batman do. So overall this film does a fantastic job parodying some of many of our fond memories of what we grew up with, is able to reference stuff we love to talk about in a very clever and enjoyable way, have very cool visuals and animation, great voice acting, hilarious jokes, and one of the best openings to a film ever, but Batgirl's constant nagging and buzzkilling and the insults toward Superman make it impossible for me to say this is a ""great film"" or anywhere near as good as The Lego Movie.",The Lego Batman Movie

Which brings me to my next point Will Arnett is one of the worst actors to portray batman, he doesn't sound sincere and his growl makes batman sound like he has down syndrome that and the bad jokes he makes batman say in this movie, like he's heavy metal rapping machine or whatever making batman seem like a mentally deficient nu metal fan (because rap and metal don't go together (Like the saying goes music is like candy so throw the rappers away). Zach Galfinakas (or however you spell his name) is a terrible Joker with awful jokes like the butt- mobile because he wiped his butt on it, funny right? Wrong! The Joker looks like a snake monster but is also a timid brat who get's his feelings hurt when Batman says he not as important as superman in his life which makes it seem like joker wanted to have sex with batman which is stupid. Anyone who likes Batman as a campy idiot is not a real batman fan just and twit who has never read a comic or watched Batman the Animated Series. Adam West sucked he was a bad actor and ruined Batman for almost 30's years in the public eye.You know what the first live action performance of Batman was? It was dark and brooding not campy and stupid, Lewis Wilson was the first live action performer to get batman right dark brooding and solemn. Batman and Robin (1997) sucked because it was stupid and campy and tried to recreate the Adam West era which also sucked and ruined batman for years. You know who's lighthearted and cheesy? Superman, but no they made him dark and brooding so he'd be more like batman, which doesn't work because Superman is not Batman his costume is bright his villains are campy and he has incredible superpowers. They made this movie because they know idiots will go and see it just because it has Batman in it.For people who may say they like to see Batman be funny and they don't like normal batman because they think he's an ""emo"", Batman is not an emo, he's solemn and brooding he's a detective and a cold calculating vigilante who rarely shows his emotional side, and when he does it means something. Bruce Timm and Paul Dini saved Batman from being a cartoony idiot in the 90's when people still thought of Batman as stupid and campy. Now idiots like Chris McKay who have only done a few bad shows adult swim want to make batman a moronic bumbling clown again, well I say no to that this movie sucks.

The movie starts with such a high note and stay on that path the entire movie.This movie flows with such a fast pace that when this movie comes to slow part it feels slow but that's really a small part of the movie and serves the story also so that was needed. If anyone knows Batman and a true Batman nerd they are love this movie to g=heart because it has such elements. The Joker voice by Zach Galifianakis is awesome.The only problem this movie has that it has so many jokes and comes one after another with almost every dialogues that's hard to keep up with and you could miss some because you are still laughing from the last line.

You should like it I feel you don't you don't it's not for everyone I would say. Their are scenes that I thought could have been better made but overall it's fine. If you hate batman should you see it probably not but this is for batman fans and maybe Lego fans because it s not as good as the lego movie in my opinion but it's fun and funny. So I recommend watching it to just have a good time at the theatres. So I give it a good 8/10,The Lego Batman Movie
192,sara2520,Pretty Awesome movie,10,17 February 2017,"I'm a Batman fan and this movie is enjoyable even I'd you're not a fan of Batman. This movie is like a bunch of fifth graders explaining the history of Batman and creating their own plot that is much better and easier to follow than the atrocious catastrophe of Batman vs. Superman. This is like watching the roast of Batman and Batman doing an hilarious honest trailer or cinemasins' everything wrong with Batman of himself. One of my favorite moments was Alfred reminding Bruce of his continuous flashbacks/similar episodes of his parents' death that occurred in 2016, 2008, 2005,1997,1995,1992,1989, and in the 1960s There are a lot of insider jokes in this movie about the Batman universe. I hate to admit this since I love Jared Leto,but Lego Joker kicked Suicide Squad Jokers butt. This movie was awesome. You can tell the creators of this movie had fun making it and decided to go completely opposite of the dark and gloomy DC universe Zack Synder is creating. The movie has heart and a good message. It's like a Batman comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously like the dark knight trilogy or batman vs. Superman. It's fun and lighthearted. And most importantly,it has rewatchability. You're going to have to watch it again to catch all the jokes and zingers you missed the first time around. Great for the entire family.",The Lego Batman Movie
193,gmwatling,Hahahaha,8,20 September 2017,"Normally Lego movies are ones you see on TV and they are for little kids who are obsessed with the product. However, The Lego Batman Movie was nothing like it, it was suitable for all ages. It is relatable to all ages as they include scenes where Batman is literally stood in front of a microwave waiting for his lobster thermidor to heat up. It's little scenes like that all the way through the film that make it a joy to watch as you can relate on a personal level. It is a non-stop comedy that will have your jaw aching after it is finished, I think I've watched it about 3 or 4 times now, it's one of those films that just doesn't get old no matter how many time you watch it. Although it would not be my first choice of film to recommend to friends and family I would recommend. If you have a slightly childish sense of humour then your going to love this film, if you are more sophisticated in your humour and you are watching for the action packed fight scenes. Then your in luck because it is littered with them!! Follow me on Instagram @gabewatling and Twitter @gmwatling",The Lego Batman Movie
194,alex-klein2424,A Great Movie: Brick by Brick,8,20 February 2017,"Going into this movie I had high hopes since I had loved the prior Lego movie and the trailers made this seem just as quirky and fun and it delivered. The movie centers around the caped crusader as he fights villains ranging from Condiment Man to the Joker. As the movie roles along, though, the true villain ends up being Batman himself on his never ending quest for family and not being alone as he attempts to foil a plot by the Joker. The best part about this movie is that it seems every minute there are jokes after jokes that are more funny than not. The entire crux of Batman and the Joker is a joke about them being in an evil relationship and most of what Joker does in the movie has to do with him trying to prove to Batman that he is his greatest enemy. The voice acting was awesome with so many great people lending their hands to the various characters in the bat universe and also the wider DC comics and Lego universe. This includes plenty of amazing callbacks to prior Batman movies no matter how old. Michael Cera does a fantastic job as Robin and Will Arnett has the perfect Batman voice. The same stop motion for the first Lego movie was used and it was just as cool seeing the explosions and vehicle building as before. The soundtrack is also catchy and fun with a joke throughout the movie of references to ""Man in the Mirror"". At almost two hours of run time, the movie was brisk and exciting constantly keeping my eyes full with visual delight. It was also a nerd dream to see all the Lego references to prior Batman movies and to see some Lego characters from Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.Overall this is a great movie for the entire family, kids and adults alike. A perfect addition to the Lego franchise and also the Batman franchise. Take your young son or daughter and buy a nice big tub of popcorn and just munch on that while you spill most of it chortling at the jokes and spoofs throughout. You could also go by yourself or with a loved one or maybe just an acquaintance or that one relative who says ""uncle"" instead of ""ankle"".",The Lego Batman Movie

The Lego Batman movie is a fun movie to watch and hilarious at times. There is so many Batman references throughout the film that it feels like a love letter to Batman fans. watching this movie, not only did I find it to be the best Batman movie in the post-Nolan era of Batman, but it's also better than the Lego Movie. My only problem with the movie is Batman having a crush on Barbara Gordon.

196,gricey_sandgrounder,So much fun!,8,6 February 2017,"It has been almost three years since The Lego Movie surprised us all.Since then, the sky is the limit for many spin-off films, and we already have one with The Lego Movie's most memorable character.Also the directors of The Lego Movie, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are back. This time as producers. Instead, we have renowned animation comedy director Chris McKay, who is know for the Robot Chicken TV series.There are always nerves with a comedy sequel. Will the jokes work again?Thankfully, that is not the case at all. I had a complete blast with this. There's lots of high energy throughout this fun and exciting flick. From the start, you can dropped right into the action and it just does not stop. It does follow a similar structure and tone to The Lego Movie, and I am completely fine with that as I am still riding the coat tails of the 2014 feature. So that mean that as expected, the visuals are fantastic, the sharp colour scheme makes the film look gorgeous and the movement of the characters look stop-motion even though you know it's CGI.It's biggest strengths is the comedy. The amount of references, self-referential jokes, sarcastic and ironic humor is ridiculous. Everything seems packed with so many jokes a minute. However, I must mention that it's greatest success, can also be its weakness at times. It does get a little frenetic at times, and it is hard to keep up with the gags. There are moments, where you feel so exhausted that you can't laugh at all of them. That is a very minor criticism, as you can't really put that down as a real negative.I also really enjoyed the cameos by other characters that have been turned into Lego form. The amount is off the scale. Seeing the different franchises involved really opens the door to an infinite amount of Lego movies that have been to been made.Will Arnett continues to be brilliant as the voice of Batman. He has really made it his own, and it is certainly one of the most memorable animated characters in the last 10 years. Zach Galifiniakis did a great job as the voice of The Joker, and like Arnett, he is a welcomed addition to the list of other iconic performances of this character. I also have to credit to Michael Cera (which is not often), Rosario Dawson and Ralph Fiennes. The notable voice performances from the cameos are Mariah Carey, Billy Dee Williams, Conan O'Brien, Zoe Kravitz, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Eddie Izzard and Seth Green.The only other negative that I care to mention apart from the gag over-usage, is the one slow moment. It completely changes the pacing, felt out of place and felt more like a time for you to rest and get ready for the rest of the remaining gags.Apart from that, I had a great time. I don't think it's as clever as The Lego Movie. But I think it's consistently more fun. Huge props to the great talents of director Chris McKay and producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. This Lego movie franchise could be our best chance for a series of really good spoof movies. I don't think I could ever get tired of the tone that these films are going for. The film- makers knew what to make fun from previous Batman features and what to exploit. It came out great. It's constantly witty and sharp both in its visuals and writing. If they just harnessed the jokes and made the structure a little bit more free-flowing, this could have been something special. Also, it would be interesting to see if kids will like this as much as the adults, as the jokes may not get much of a reaction from the younger viewers.I wasn't expecting this, but there was a Lego short before the film. It was rather funny and it is a nice teaser before Lego's next feature later this year.",The Lego Batman Movie
197,gunmasterg9,Kids movie that Parents and Adults will enjoy,10,6 February 2017,My 5 year old son had been bugging me wanting to watch this since he first saw the trailers. Skeptically I booked tickets for a preview and went along thinking I would let him enjoy this whilst i got an hour or so to have a nice nap :-). From the word go this movie is hilarious with a lot of jokes that older kids/adults will find. in certain aspects i enjoyed this more than my kid lol. Sont of the one liners are brilliant - especially the password that Batman has set for his computer which is not the one he says in the trailer. A great fun movie which took the Batman from the LEgo Movie and made it even more awesome. A top rated movie from me.,The Lego Batman Movie

But this movie wasn't all that great, the Lego movie had a lot of humor attached to peril, where you thought this plastic guy might not make it, it also had humor attached to the inability to build things out of Lego's. This movie didn't have either of those two, never thought anything was in peril and all things Lego just seemed to build themselves out of nothing. I didn't enjoy it.",The Lego Batman Movie
200,showmethemoviescontact,The Lego Batman Movies,9,10 February 2017,"What at first glance appeared to me a money-grabbing spin-off of 2014's The LEGO Movie, riding the waves of last years' Batman vs Superman and Suicide Squad adult flicks, I do not joke when I say this movie gave me faith in kids movies again.When I say that The LEGO Batman Movie is incredible, I am not being ironic; I wholeheartedly believe this movie is near-perfect. This movie should set an example as to how kids' movies should be made, unlike the recently-released Sing, which is the perfect example of how animated films for children can be churned out and swallowed up by an unsuspecting audience. Of course, partial enjoyment of this movie comes down to callbacks and references of the series of Batman films that have come before this, and while these throwbacks are not subtle, they also don't impose on the story-line that The LEGO Batman Movie provides; equating to an excellent balance. I was laughing throughout the majority of this film - the humour is designed for both adults and children; the perfect family movie, rather than restricting to just one generation. The performance of Batman by Will Arnett is the best thing he's ever done; Robin (Michael Cera) is spot on, and the Joker (Zach Galifiankis) is wonderful to watch on-screen.Animation of the LEGO characters is top notch; I often didn't notice I was watching a LEGO-themed film and only saw the actual characters being portrayed in front of me. The film was, at times, a pleasure to watch in all its' animated action glory, and there was no ambiguity as to who the characters were meant to represent, despite being in their 'LEGO forms'.My only criticisms are that the Phantom Zone included in the film is completely inaccurate to its previous portrayals, and that Harley Quinn's (Jenny Slate) voice doesn't sound very Harley-esque at all. I literally can't think of anything else worth complaining about.Most amazing of all, the references to past Batman movies and comics add to the plot in such a wonderful way - inclusion of the Condiment King (rarely-heard-of, useless DC comic book villain), Batman poking fun at Suicide Squad, and even Bane (Doug Benson) having his accurate voice from The Dark Knight Rises! The film is not afraid to laugh at itself, and this makes the viewer laugh with it more.Because LEGO have so many different franchises at their disposal, it means that they also manage to include characters from multiple different sources, such as Lord Voldemort, The Daleks and even Godzilla. Including these characters made for an oddly-amusing twist.This movie is wonderful - it's the highest rating I've given to a movie so far and with good reason. For those of you doubting giving up your movie-watching time to a kids movie, I urge you to give The LEGO Batman Movie a chance and go and see it - you won't be disappointed.",The Lego Batman Movie

Yet while doing that, they still manage to not removing some of the aspects that makes Batman special. I like how they pay homage to previous Batman adaptation from '60s Batman to BvS.The opening scene was so awesome for me. It's establishing Batman's role for Gotham City that is a hero.As a fan of Batfamily, at first I actually like to see Barbara Gordon being in this movie. But the more she appear in the movie, the more I don't see the importance of her being in it. They don't make Barbara a likeable character.Overall, this movie is so funny and had a great life lesson.

The pace is relentless – as are the sheer rate of jokes, quips and audience winks – covering an astonishing amount of ground both in terms of breadth and much more specific analysis and dissection of Batman's canonical past.The filmmakers' expertise is clearly on display throughout; as they surgically dissect and hilariously re-assemble the pieces in sequences which vary from in-your-face spoof to cheeky, fourth-wall-breaking, blink-and-you'll-miss-it lines.

There was good bit of Lego movie stuff, like master-builder references and the same vibe. At the same time this is totally unrelated to the original one. Good bit of fun, clever story and gives more gossip about the Batman/Joker relationship. Also all the other villans was a fun addition and worked well in this sort of movie.

Lego is about building something creative, which this movie was not. Felt more to me like they were trying to use as many Batman plot gimmicks as they could, only this time they're in the 'Lego world' and used cheaply.Also, could barely tell that Arnett, Cera and Galifianakis were in the movie with the voice dubs, didnt seem like the writing suited them.

Despite Batman normally having dark theme, his character flexibility is displayed as this movie makes him seem like the centre of comedy. The movie makes a lot of references to old Batman movies, and makes it's comedic version of Batman. What gives Batman the ability to be funny in this movie, is his LEGO form, and the LEGO world around him, along with Will Arnett's perfect Batman voice. As Batman's appearance in the previous LEGO movie was the same comedic version of him, this movie is centred in a LEGO version of the DC universe. This movie also makes no reference to Batman's presence in the previous LEGO movie, as if that movie wasn't part of this universe. (It likely wasn't) The movie places Batman against his swore arch- nemesis The Joker, who is accompanied by his soul mate, Harley Quinn. The Joker also appears around a group of DC villains who've appeared in previous movies. The movie approaches Batman and Joker's obsessive rivalry very well, almost making it seem like a friendly joke. Overall, the movie is a meteor shower of jokes and funny scenes. It's packed with cameos of DC characters, and has something for everyone. If you're a DC fan, you'll adore this movie for it's references and character roster, and because it's brilliant in general.

OK there are some rather nerdy references to Old British Robots http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059126, that only old farts like me at 50+ remembers, and numerous other references. But they aren't used constructively. It seems more like stealing ideas was easier than getting them... The 'morale' is so thick and sticky that you choke on it, and they hammer it in all the way along, from about the first to the last scene, as this morale is the only thing this film has to 'offer'...

I really had no plans to see an animated movie in theaters in 2017 (with the exception of Cars 3 because of the teaser trailer). Within the logos alone I knew that this would be a great time. You can tell a movie is awesome when you are laughing before any part of the plot has even been shown. This movie is a humorous, emotional, sad, joyful movie that you will want to cheer at. This was my first Batman movie I had ever seen, and yet I understood all of the references. The Joker is one of the best characters I have seen in a while. His relationship with Batman is a comical and sad. I relate to him, which I would never have guessed. He just wants to hear Batman admit that they have something special. Robin is a hilarious little kid with a heart of gold who just wants to live up to the expectations of his surrogate father. He listens to everything Batman says and takes it to heart. Batman's stern demeanor makes him cold, but he never comes off as a bad guy. He has just built up a wall around his heart, and when he opens it up, he is afraid to lose the people he learned to love. His advances are wrong, and you know it, but you can tell he just can't experience any more heartbreak. Alfred is a funny and lovable butler with some of the funniest parts of the movie. When Michael Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"" song is used, it melted my heart. This movie is one of the fondest memories of going to the movie theater with my dad I have had in recent memory. It is a blast.This is the best animated movie (in my mind) of 2017 (which includes Coco). It was truly a shame when Boss Baby and Ferdinand were nominated for the Oscar in place of this.

Loved the introduction of villains in fast paced action. Loved the line about ""spontaneously arising"" of words after punches like *Kapow* and *Bang* but......it is supposed to be a frikkin movie. Not a frikkin 2 hour sermon or a lecture or a filibuster.I don't go to watch movie to have a schooling on ethics and s***. I go there to be entertained. They just magnified on Batman's ego issue and zoomed in it and blew it out of proportion and constantly nagged about it non-stop for 2 hours as if the producers got an agenda or some ***.Here is a preachy advice: Please leave the patronizing sermon at the doorstep.Not every personality is same. Many like to be loner and aloof and many like to be cringyly social. Just because you view the world in a way doesn't mean it has to be the same for hoi polloi. I actually had to listen to some Eminem afterwards to clean my palate. So disgusting was the patronizing sermon.And the animation was blah at best. It is LEGO ffs. Not a big ol hunka clunker. It looked like Transformer animated. Where is the nuance? Where is subtlety? Where is the Lego universe?I hate being negative. But sometimes, suppressing negativity for positivity can be entirely negative. It is about expressing your true self... which somehow the big ol kumbaya loving producers somehow misses the point entirely trying to fit in with society's image.Heck...

The plot in here is about Alfred thinking that Bruce should learn how to live in a family again, but he doesn't want to, and then he goes in sort of a party, and he accidentally, adopts an orphan named ""Dick"", while this is going on, The Joker wants Batman's hate, because Batman said that he isn't his greatest enemy, and after Batman throws him in the Phantom Zone, he meets villains from other movies and they made a team, so he can be Batman's greatest enemy again, now Batman and he's family of friends had to defeat this evil group of villains while also learning the meaning of unity. Now let's get to the Pros: Batman's plot is pretty good, not only that, but it's emotional, plus, the humor in here is also good, i like how Batman says about his six pack stomach (in the beginning) while arguing about the companies who made this movie, also, i like the google references, the Batman movie references and the part where Robin takes his pants off, and also, the ending, i will admit, the ending was way better than The LEGO Movie's ending, where you know, they just reveal the villains for the next movie. Now there where a few cons: Joker's plot in here is pretty weird for a Batman movie, don't get me wrong, i like crossovers, but a subplot like this is just weird, and another con in here is the relationship with the Joker and Batman, i mean, telling someone that this person isn't your greatest enemy won't hurt anybody's feelings, and i get it, this villain does everything to be hated by the hero, but making a cry face and feeling a bit empty is just stupid and taking this sentence to serious, come on dude, when i saw this in the trailer, i though it was just for comedy purpose, but no, it's a scene used to create the Joker plot, seriously, that scene is just stupid. Overall, this movie (aside from the cons) was pretty good, it was funny, it was emotional, and has great references, now a lot of people seems to call this movie their favorite DC movie, and i don't agree with this, don't get me wrong, i enjoyed this movie, but is not my favorite DC or LEGO movie ever, so yeah, good movie, i recommend this movie to families, Batman fans, DC fans, LEGO Movie fans and Superhero fans, trust me, you won't be disappointed.",The Lego Batman Movie
216,christianrmaxwell,The Batman Movie we Needed,10,13 December 2018,"After all of the mixed reception from Ben Affleck's take on Batman, it was time for a different take on the Caped Crusader. I think this was the perfect route to go, not only an animated movie, but a LEGO one. Some may say that this LEGO schtick was just a cash grab after the monumental success of the LEGO movie, and I have to agree that this is at the very least partly true. However, I am fine with a studio performing a ""cash grab"" if it is done well. And MY GOD, this movie is done well. Holy cow, I had never expected to be floored by a LEGO movie, but this one left me speechless. Everything about the movie is masterclass. From the amazing humor poking fun at Batman and other superheros, as well as the fantastic voice acting, as well as the animation of course. A really great aspect of the movie for me also was the heart behind it. Rather than depicting the Joker as a maniacal freak as all the other Batman stories do, this one depicts him as a lonely guy who just wants attention and a friend. I also thought the dynamic relationship between Robin and Batman was very heartwarming and led to some really amazing scenes between them. This movie has stuff for kids as well as adults, it's fast paced enough that the kids won't get bored, and has enough adult humor and references to enthrall both age groups. I think this movie should definitely be considered a classic in the animation realm for years to come.

Kids movies can be enjoyed by adults, most films by Pixar being examples of that. Yet Lego Batman, to me, is solely for children. The over 90 rating on Rotten Tomatoes changed my mind. It made me think I was missing something. I bought a ticket, sat in the theater, and for the next 90 minutes I was truly disappointed I didn't follow my instincts.Why make the Joker a sympathetic character? It's one thing to make him interesting and funny, like in The Dark Knight, but why portray him like he isn't a crazy mass murderer, even in a PG movie?",The Lego Batman Movie

And if you haven't watched it yet, you should. Especially for Batman fans.I'm Batman Movie is collection of jokes and satire not only on Batman franchise, but on all genre of superheroes. Don't think about script or logic - you should enjoy it! This movie is nuclear mixture of good humor, the Lego style (from children's games) and directness of action, action without masks. Sometimes it seemed to me that movie is serious drama with non-serious characters. But if we imagine that all superheroes battles have personal reasons, than movie is right!But there are Joker Well, I can't without any criticism. First of all, its script. I'm not talking about logic. The script is serious. Filmmakers hide it behind humor, but you feel it almost all the time. You can take the script, take any drama and... he will fit! Miracle! Of course, the script is full of plot stamps. Second - this is ""adult"" movie with processing for children. Or children's film with processing for adults. Don't know.

222,crazybilby,Endlessly Hilarious,8,14 January 2018,"This movie is fun. It's just ridiculously fun. There are so many jokes crammed in one after the other that people of all ages will enjoy. That's the great things about family movies is their layers of jokes. There are so many moments where it makes fun of the source material throughout the ages and creates this self reflective jaunt through nostalgia and pop culture. The film has taken the increasingly dim, dark, and serious figure of Batman and flipped the gritty in reverse for a chance of some comics related media that children can consume without being horrified at the violence or the boring plot (sorry DC but your movies suuuuuuccckk).It tackles something other Batman films are Too Serious to tackle and that's Batman's isolationist attitudes, cold heart, and inability to reach out and trust others. It's really refreshing to see someone tackle toxic masculinity and unhealthy coping mechanisms - and even stranger to see it in a light hearted children's movie. Batman spends most of the movie resisting the idea that others are people he can let into his heart instead of obstacles or (at best) tools for his own purposes. His ego prevents him from helping himself. It's a good message and a central flaw of the Batman mythos we've all seemed to embrace (and spun as a heroic feature?).The movie is both absurd and moving. Two tonally different things that are difficult to mesh together but it manages it. There's so much in it to love and the Lego franchise is an unexpected gem in contemporary cinema. Just like the building blocks the movie takes inspiration from this will capture all the joy and imagination of childhood and creating a magical silly world where silly things happen, the stakes are ridiculous, the characters are all hyper and over saturated, and it's a nonstop rollercoaster of laughter.Great for all ages, even the bitter old fan boy who has been reading gritty Batman comics for decades.",The Lego Batman Movie

The entire crowd in the cinema was laughing out loud the whole duration of the movie, it felt just like Deadpool, but better. Jesus! How i loved that movie! It even made me log in my facebook account just to write this review. You just gotta see it for yourself, probably the best comedy of the year of 2017, even though there tons of movies still coming out it will be hard to beat this.

225,Fedoics,The best Batman has been since Christian Bale.,7,10 February 2017,"The Lego Batman Movie brings something different to the table, providing a fun, witty, smart, and hilarious time for kids and adults alike. Lets start with the positives.From the moment you sit down to the moment you get up, the film has you laughing. The humor in this movie is great. It's for both children and adults, providing smart and sarcastic humor that my prominently child free theater enjoyed. This film is gorgeous, each shot looking beautiful. The style that The Lego Movie brought onto the big screen is enhanced in this film. The scale of everything and the lighting created a world that these characters could interact and live in. The animation style is what I adore most, each shot looking as if it was animated using stop motion.The voice acting is amazing in this film as well, Will Arnett coming back to play the caped crusader and Michael Cera playing Robin. The two had a lot of chemistry thanks to the voice acting, bringing these characters to life. Zach Galifianakis was a surprisingly great Joker, adding an interpretation of the clown prince of crime that we haven't seen before.The story in this movie is very interesting, following Batman and his struggle to be a part of a family ever since the murder of his parents. The film really humanizes Batman, something we don't see a lot of in other Batman movies, while at the same time spoofing the character itself. The story between Batman and the Joker is very interesting and funny, creating great moments between the two.There are very few negatives I have with this movie. Going back to what I said earlier, this movie keeps you laughing throughout, which got a bit tiring at times. When the movie has you laughing at one thing then says another joke 2 seconds later, this can be annoying at times. Let the joke sink in, let a character react, everything doesn't have to be a joke all the time. Some of the jokes fell flat some of the times, but that's expected considering everyone has their own taste in comedy.Overall, the Lego Batman Movie is a great time for everyone, proving an entertaining experience throughout. The film has many surprises that I think everyone will love. The story is interesting and full of heart while creating a beautiful and vast world. While some of the jokes may fall flat, it is still a very fun time. Maybe Zack Snyder can take a few notes from this movie.",The Lego Batman Movie
226,bigman13-803-859961,A great comedic Batman movie anyone can enjoy,7,3 March 2018,"The LEGO Batman movie is geared towards kids, but adults can get great mileage out of this movie, too. It mixes the spirit of Batman with with the childhood memory creator that is LEGO. In the movie, Batman finds out that Gotham City doesn't need him anymore, citing the lack of capture of Gotham's baddest villains. The new Commissioner Gordon takes over all crime fighting. Batman then unawaringly adopts somebody from the orphanage, one of his biggest fans who later becomes his sidekick, Robin. The Joker thinks Batman doesn't think he's his greatest enemy, so he sets out to prove that by releasing monsters from the Phantom Zone. Near the end, when the city separates, Batman convinces Joker to help him save the city, and the city of Gotham helps out as well.The movie has the allure of colors of LEGO for the kids, while older adults will appreciate the adult references and callbacks to prior Batman movies. The LEGO Batman Movie is something all ages can enjoy.",The Lego Batman Movie

228,dmartinez-52655,Entertaining!,9,3 March 2017,"Phil Lord and Chris Miller the directors of ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" and ""21 Jump Street"" brought us the 2014 comedic animated film ""The Lego Movie."" It is called one of the best animated movies of the 2010 decade era, which is the truth. One of the characters is a Lego Batman (Will Arnett) and he has that outstanding performance that leads to him having his own spin-off movie directed by Miller and Lord.Bruce Wayne is a big time Billionaire that is struggling with his secret identity, Batman, and is forced to take care of his adopted son which he hardly notices. The child ends up finding out his identity which leads to Batman making him his new sidekick, Robin, and while Gotham is going through trouble. Villains are wrecking havoc across the city and the Bat has to attempt to save his city while protecting Robin from his arch enemies.The movie is truly great, the animation is still the same with it's realistic look making it seem like realistic Lego Bricks. the performances by Will Arnett as Batman again, Michael Cera as his adopted son and sidekick Robin, and Zach Galifianakis as the Joker. The story reminds me of a sitcom meets Gotham, Lego, and more entertaining for a younger audience. The comedy is impressive and creative as usual but still having it's flaws i found a bit annoying. Sometimes the characters will say or do something funny than another, another, and another, and it's hard to understand while laughing. The jokes can be funny but too much can be annoying or distracting, and that doesn't mean it isn't funny but too rushing for audiences including myself.Overall, ""The Lego Batman Movie"" was truly amazing with it's animation, characters, story, and humor. Despite too much comedy thrown at us, it still makes it entertaining to watch I will admit. I will recommend this movie and let you watch it for being for the family and friends for bringing the Bat in a whole new world of Lego and a new light! A-",The Lego Batman Movie

232,sarah_mccully,Good family fun!,8,8 February 2017,"On Monday night we were given tickets for an advanced screening of The Lego Batman Movie which releases in the theaters to the general public on Friday. My son was absolutely dying to go which is a funny thing, because he has been rather anti-superhero his whole life. The movie opens with the Joker trying to take over the city. He has teamed up with all of the villains from the Batman series and they have planted a bomb on one of the reactors at the power plant. The movie starts off with lots of action as Batman saves the day (it would be a short movie if he didn't). He is loving his life, being a hero, doing what he wants, and avoiding any kind of ""ship""....aka relationship. It seems his deep rooted broodiness and loaner attitude stems from losing his parents so many years ago and has resulted in his fears of losing more loved ones. The story brings more people into his life, and begrudgingly he starts to accept them. Robin steals the show and adds such fun comic relief and touching moments. Meanwhile, the Joker really wants a ""relationship"" with Batman and this is leading him to go to extremes to become Batman's true ""arch nemesis"". He is teaming up with even more ""Baddies"" - characters from other fantasy and Sci-fly shows and movies including Harry Potter, Dr. Who, King Kong and many more make appearances. This is not your typical Batman movie!The tremendous comedy is suitable for both kids and adults. Lots of things will go right over their heads while adults will get a chuckle (I had to explain a couple of things). I didn't see anything there that made me rethink taking my 9-year old. In fact he said, ""one thing I really loved about that movie is there was no kissing!"" The ""butt"" jokes are plentiful, so that is the only thing that might come back to haunt parents. I thought the graphics were wonderful and there was tons to keep you interested. I bet I will see all new things each time I watch the movie. The story keeps moving but felt a little thin in some places. More than anything though, it was just plain funny - we laughed a lot. I loved the throw backs to the previous 60 years of Batman which took us all the way back to the old TV show from the 60s. That was really fun to see, although it left me feeling a bit old!Kid's review is 5 out of 5 starsMom's review is 4 out of 5 starsWe recommend the movie to anyone looking for a good laugh!

234,godhatesharper,"Funny, if predictable, family movie",8,10 June 2017,"This movie is absolutely adorable and hilarious for Batfans and people who have never consumed any sort of Batman media alike. The plot and theme is fairly simple and generic kids movie stuff, but this movie is so funny and creative that it's impossible to rag on it too hard. (also, it's you know, a kids' movie. And a pretty darn good one too.) The animation is simply brilliant, filled with colors and exhilarating action. The humor is quite funny and mature, and it was really exciting to see all of the characters we know and love on the big screen, like Barbara Gordon (much better Batgirl story than the Killing Joke movie, I can assure you). But, the most undeniably spectacular, wonderful, amazing part of this movie was...ROBIN! I seriously cannot exclaim enough how much I loved him with all of my heart. This movie wouldn't be half as good without him. He is so sweet, adorable, and hilarious, and completely makes this whole movie. Michael Cera was a perfect choice for him, as was Will Arnett for Batman. I've also grown on Zach Galifianakis' Joker, although it's nowhere near Hamill's clown prince of crime. Batgirl was serviceable, and Alfred; well, it's hard to mess up ""British guy"" if you are indeed a British guy. This film has loads of villains from the rogues gallery show up, but sadly, they are all very brief cameos, and none besides Joker are very prominent. And though I usually love Jenny Slate, her Harley was pretty subpar here. Overall though, this movie is a cute, fun little kids movie that will have everyone in the audience rolling, and it's definitely a worthy addition to the Batman universe. pros: Great animation. expressive voice acting from Cera, Arnett, and galifianakis. Clever and witty humor, and the Justice League cameo itself was better than the entire DCU so far (to the angry fanboys: just kidding). Also: ROBIN! Cons: took a bit long to get past the exposition; sometimes jokes have ""Family Guy"" syndrome and go on a bit long; underdeveloped villains. Conclusion: Go see this movie for some light-hearted and fun laughs with your family, or if you're a die-hard Batman fanatic just watch it for all of the references, since you cherish them so much. If you're a huge Dick Grayson fan you must see this film! If you were like me and expecting awesome Lego Selina, Pamela, and Harley moments, you'll probably be disappointed.",The Lego Batman Movie

Like its trailers, it promises to deliver fun and entertaining action, comedy and drama for everyone. STORY: Gotham City is controlled by Batman and his 'saving the day' from the Joker and his crew. This is until a new officer pleads the idea of the police and Batman joining hands together in work. A battle between himself ad his ego starts and he must learn to work as a team to avoid inevitable danger to Gotham City.The film starts intensely and maintains its course throughout the movie. There are many funny moments that get the whole audience laughing. It is thoroughly entertaining throughout! Unlike the LEGO Movie, this is also for adults, as the movie contains hidden references that will certainly get you chuckling. In my opinion, this is a great Batman movie. One thing I will say is that there is a lot of action going on in most of the scenes, but whatever! I'm sure everyone likes a bit of action.One thing I do not get though is that Warner Bros have randomly thrown it many DC characters in the movie without any sole purpose of them being in it. However they won't get marked down for this. The reason this DOES get marked down one mark is because it doesn't quite meet the same standards as the first film and isn't able to match up with the LEGO Movie compared to its comedy and epicness. I would still recommend this movie.To conclude, GO WATCH THIS FILM if you need time or space to fill up, or if you need some entertainment in your life.",The Lego Batman Movie

Have I already said that? Erm, what else? OK, I stayed dry and warm as I was inside the Odeon, oh, and my friends and I had a lovely catch up. The film forewarned of rude language, so I expected some clever, subdued adult humour, but either it was so high level or so low level, it bypassed me completely, and left me wondering how best to regain my time on earth back. I also wondered throughout how much longer was left, and can I go home now, as expressed by a four-ish year old sat in the row in front, plus I couldn't help but wonder if the arrogant narcissistic Batman character, was really based on another satirically obnoxious character called Trump. However, Batman saw the error of his ways in the end, which Trump never will. Best part of the film, if I can say there was any best part, is the referencing to the classic TV Batman series 'Kerpow', 'Splat', 'Wham', etc, that and the moment we realised the film had finally ended. If anyone's got children and is a die hard Batman fan, you might like to go see, if not, go and jump around, paint walls, look in a mirror at yourself, learn the alphabet backwards, almost anything really, which will probably entertain you more than this film!

241,animausimages,Bat Fun for everyone.,7,24 June 2017,"2017's ""The Lego Batman Movie"", directed by Chris McKay. Starring Will Arnett, Michael Cera, Rosario Dawson, Ralph Fiennes, Zach Galifianakis, Conan O' Brien, Doug Benson, Billy Dee Williiams, Zoe Kravitz, Eddie Izard, Channing Tatum, Jenny Slate, Hector Elizondo, and Jonah Hill. 2014's ""Lego Movie"" was a lot of fun, featuring catchy songs and zippy characters not afraid to make fun of themselves and their respective universes. Prominently featured in the supporting cast, was Batman (Arnett), angry enough to growl along the soundtrack, but never dark enough to dampen the saturation of the brightly coloured brick world. Immediately, as we watch the various logos of ""LBM"" emerge, along with Batman's narration of his thoughts on the Warner Brothers studios, we know we're back for a mildly irreverent romp poking fun at this immersive comic book universe. We see Batman and his shredded abs, alone kicking the butts of the criminals of Gotham, as always. However, with the help of Alfred the Butler (Fiennes), Batman is forced to evaluate his lone wolf family-less ways. We're introduced to the witless Dick Grayson (Cera), adopted by Alfred, who we're not sure could be helpful to Batman. Forcing the action, is the Joker (Galifianakis), who as always gets inside Batman's head and enlists the help of a variety of super villains from other classic pop culture franchises to storm the city of Gotham. With the Lego attack on, Batman has to accept help from others in order to save the hard plastics city.""LBM"" looks fantastic and has plenty of chuckle worthy moments, both in the foreground and background (the shout out to 1992's ""Passenger 57"" is a nice one). It can be a little chaotically over the top and swings on a well worn path at times, as well as bafflingly not letting Ralph Fiennes voice the Voldemort character. Despite that, ""LBM"" is a welcome addition to the family friendly entertainment canon. As the movie teaches, no (bat)man is a (bat)island, and it's no fun to laugh at the cloyingly bad end scenes of 1996's ""Jerry Maguire"" by yourself.3.5/5For more reviews by moi, check out: http://animausimages.blogspot.ca/",The Lego Batman Movie
242,hahnpaul-63454,Almost as good and funny as the original Lego Movie!,8,3 February 2019,"The story is similar to other superhero stories with a little twist. Joker tries to destroy or rule over Gotham City while Batman tries to protect it. Joker also tries to get admiration for his evil plans and wants Batman to admit that he himself is Batman's nemesis. Batman on the other hand feels lonely but doesn't want to concede it to himself and others. In its heart, The Lego Batman Movie's story is not about protecting the world from an evil villain, it's about friendship.The story is weird, sometimes it doesn't even make sense and occasionally there are just too many characters to follow. But the movie doesn't even try to make a 'good' story. It's a satire of every superhero movie but at the same time it's an acknowledgement to the genre.What the movie tries to do and in what it succeeds, is that it is incredibly funny. There are a lot of wonderful jokes, admittedly some bad ones and a ton of self-humour. The Lego Batman Movie is funny but it has some lengths and it wouldn't have hurt to cut a few minutes, especially in the middle of the film.""The Lego Batman Movie"" is a wonderfully charming addition to the Lego universe not taking itself too seriously.

You don't get time to appreciate them and quite frankly, for a movie with so much action I was shocked to find I was bored.ANYONE can throw everything at a movie and hope something sticks, its not clever or interesting and feels like it lacks any structure.Its such a shame, as the underlying ideas aren't bad, its just so poorly executed. It tries to make itself unique by throwing a ton of different franchise bad guys together, but in a way that totally betrays their characters so it just doesn't fit. The fact its part of the LEGO franchise to me does not excuse this lazy plot, it just feels like a huge missed opportunity for a more cohesive story where it at least makes a tiny bit of sense for these bad guys to be working together.If you love this movie, then great, but I honestly think its the most overrated movie of all time.",The Lego Batman Movie

The movie is incredibly funny and almost never falls short. The relationship between Batman and The Joker is almost the funniest thing I have ever seen, and the same goes for Batman and Robin as well as Batman and Alfred.

While on some part it fails to achieve this, the film excels when it follows its own path; creating brilliant humour at expense of the batman franchise as a whole and offering unique action and world building only the Lego franchise could possibly hope to achieve.Self-aware from the very first frame, The Lego Batman Movie finds humour in every aspect of the sprawling Batman universe; from the seriousness of the Nolan Universe to the already campy nature of the 60s series, complete with POWs, BAMs and BIFFs. Any fan of the mythos will instantly be drawn into this world and appreciate the clear time and effort put in to both tribute and parody Batman but thankfully director Chris McKay also ties the films narrative to universally recognisable themes and ensures to create humour at more than simply the franchises expense; making the film compelling to even the most unfamiliar of viewers. This humour is the films greatest strength and it excels when allowed to breath but far too often the film shifts tone with emotional scenes that break the momentum of the plot and ludicrousness of the characters. While it is well intentioned and works fine for younger viewers, the message of family in the film just feels tired compared to that of The Lego Movie.Returning to the cowl, Will Arnett leads the voice cast brilliantly and brings the perfect balance of arrogance and absurdity to the role. Supporting him is an energetic Michael Cera and surprisingly emotional Zach Galifianakis as Robin and Joker respectively. The rest of the expansive cast is performed equally well, giving every line from even the most minor of characters a memorable quality. Perhaps the one element that exceeds the original Lego Movie is the action; taking the same beautifully detailed animation that gives the illusion of stop motion and applying it to several memorable set pieces made possible only by Legos massive collection of properties – where else can we see Batman battling the Eye of Sauron using the power of the Kraken!A strong film for children and nerds alike, The Lego Batman Movie is let down only by the shadow of its predecessor as a landmark in animation and family entertainment. However, it is still far better than a lot of the competition and, as a Lego film, is worth seeing for the surreal visuals alone.SWEEThttps://sweetorsaltedmoviereviews.com/2017/02/20/the-lego-batman- movie/",The Lego Batman Movie
248,zhaolong-soul,First Lego Movie for Me,8,18 February 2017,"The LEGO Batman Movie is my first Lego movie, and I am fascinated. It is much better than the recent Batman or Superman movie! There are lots of hilarious scenes, and I can't let go some music songs. The plot is a little jumpy. I don't understand why some guys change their stands so quickly. However, it doesn't matter too much because kids can understand the story line quite well.Then ending is very weird! I didn't realize that this is a Lego movie during most of the film, while the ending is, for sure, an exception.",The Lego Batman Movie

250,bxuzabc,Great overall,8,15 February 2017,Good for the kids. A great storyline in which adults and kids will enjoy. Plenty of references only adults would understand. Also great adult jokes too. plenty for the kids and every one. Funny. With the time to go see in theaters. Voice a haters played very well. Good stop motion animation. No real villain though in the plot. And plot could have been done better. Some small Easter eggs too.,The Lego Batman Movie
251,cedricmapa-96108,The Lego Era,9,17 February 2017,If you loved the first lego movie then you are going to love this movie just as much! This film takes the awesome wittiness of lego batman from the lego movie and gives us a a side of batman we probably have never seen which is this awesome animated film that is fantastic for the whole family. Children will love all the jokes clearly made for kids but it also has what i like to call nerd humor. There are so many omages and jokes to basically all batmans that have ever been made and also just all pop culture in general. Plenty of jokes for kids and adults alike.If you are looking for a blast of a movie with a rapping super hero in a black suit then this is the movie for you. Non stop laughs from the moment the logos go on the screen to when the final credits hit. I can definitely see the lego franchise taking off and blasting us with nonstop humor. Also i really enjoyed all the voice actors for the movie immensely from arnetts dark raspy batman to zach galifianakis's awesome joker voice. This movie is fantiastic. Go see it,The Lego Batman Movie
252,redxction,Decent,6,6 February 2017,"the film ultimately is your above-average funny film that does provide a few laugh out loud moments but ultimately the film flat out disregards the script and what jokes and how many they are putting in the film e.g you could be coming off one joke then they there's another one, another one until it becomes boring and you're thinking to yourself 'hey that was funny.' the jokes also conflict themselves specially for that suicide squad one. The ending was also very generic, but what do you expect? It's a family film. the positives The animation - was excellent, visually pleasing. The humour - was funny until it became repetitive, generic. Was a decent film.",The Lego Batman Movie

254,MrPyroGuy,"Everything is still awesome (video review on my YT channel ""Rami The Critic"")",9,14 February 2017,"Video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFnX1_XAi-wI'm going to level with you, back in 2014 when ""The Lego Movie"" first came into theaters I was skeptical. I was worried that the film would simply be a promotional gimmick for Lego. My big mouth was clamped shut as the film sucker punched me with a tightly woven, ever-so-pleasant amalgam of consummate creativity, shrewdness, comedy, and visual splendor of the highest order. Now three years later ""The Lego Batman Movie"" has hit the silver screen that I like to call my second home and holy shitballs Batman, I think they're really onto something with this Lego thing.The film starts off with all guns and jokes blazing. Batman (voiced by Will Arnett) once again foils a plan by the Joker (voiced by Zach Galifianakis) to blow up Gotham City. Cue the celebrations and fanfare. Then our caped crusader makes his way to an orphanage to give some merchandise, then he heads back home to the Bat-Cave where he sits all alone watching romantic comedies and eating his favorite microwaved lobster meals. It's over here and in Barman's earlier confrontation with the Joker that we find out just how reserved this guy is when it comes to relationships. I mean, Batman told the Joker to his face that he means absolutely nothing to him after foiling his plan (it's also those words that cause the Joker to devise a whole new scheme to prove to Batman that the two are truly worst enemies). Subsequently Barbara Gordon (voiced by Rosario Dawson) takes the reins as Gotham City's new police commissioner. Her new plan to alleviate crime with actual results is to have Batman work in conjunction with the law instead of him being a vigilante. Batman doesn't like the idea as it means working with others. Batman is also inconvenienced when he finds out that he mistakenly adopted Dick Grayson (voiced by Michael Cera) from the orphanage.From the very get-go, like, not even a second into the film when Batman gives some hilarious remarks regarding logos and music, ""The Lego Batman Movie"" wastes no time in tastefully having a laugh at the tropes of superhero flicks and shooting laugh- out-loud jokes at the audience like an M-134 machinegun. Additionally, this film did a stellar job at reeling me in with the kind of exhilarating action and virtuoso visuals that, in my honest opinion, reign supreme over the majority of modern action films. By the 15-minute mark or so a grin adorned my countenance; a grin similar to the time I witnessed my inaugural heavy metal concert about ten years ago (Apocalyptica live in Beirut, 2006). By that point I was also curious as to what direction the film would head in once the plot kicked in. Gladly, it was the right one. I was thoroughly impressed at how the savvy screenplay treated Batman's psychological and emotional issues. The overall plot, while having an exterior conflict of its own, actually served as a conduit for Batman's character development from an arrogant, manipulative narcissist who hides his emotions to a man who understands the true meaning of family, friendship, teamwork, and the true definition of a good person. As the original film's song says, ""everything is cool when you're part of a team"", right? The film manages to do that without coming off as clumsy or maudlin. How so? Through clever, hilarious, smartly placed witticisms referring to the Batman canon and the geek universe as a whole, topped with a genuine desire to look into the constituents that make Batman the man he is. Moreover, an impressive facet of the script is its ability to keep the audience guessing. Though I had an idea of how things would end up, I was curious as to how things would play out to get to that point. The perpetual barrage of witty self-referential humor always caught me off guard and the earnest desire to humanize Batman purveyed an emotional heft. The careful balance of the two brought originality into the conventionally set up story, and that is where the genius lies. Bravo!With an outstanding troupe of voice actors, stunning visuals, non-stop humor, a cleverly concocted script, and most importantly heart, ""The Lego Batman Movie"" keeps the hot streak of this Lego series burning bright. I can't wait to see what it has in store for me next because this is a fine example of competent filmmaking.My score: 9/10. Fantastic!",The Lego Batman Movie

258,ZapJ,"Overall Fun, But a Missed Opportunity",6,12 February 2017,"I expect anyone who sees this movie will have a good time, but it's so insanely frenetic that you'd need freeze frame superpowers to actually see what's going on. Mostly wasted are the rogues gallery of bat-villains. Several dozens appear for only a second and about a dozen get name-checked. None of them add anything to the story. Penguin drove by in a vehicle but I'd be hard pressed to tell you what he looked like. Billy Dee Williams was famously cast as Two-Face, but only gets one or two lines. (Poison Ivy does get a funny moment, but that's it.) Instead we're treated to a cast of villains from other genres who, while funny, take center stage and erase Batman's true heritage. Just awful. Lego Batman is one huge missed opportunity to play with the real Batmans legacy.",The Lego Batman Movie

This film touched me on a deep emotional level, was I already hurting, yes, but this movie still messed me up. What exactly did this? Well this movie has an underlining theme of family but throughout the entire film Batman pushes away all of his friends and everyone he's close to. Oh my god I literally almost cried and I still intend on watching this film again. The quality of the animation felt as if I was playing with Lego myself. There was more character development in this movie than there was a change in Amy Schumer comedic themes. The only thing about this film that is mediocre is its cinematography but it is an animated Lego movie and anything astonishing would be out of place. This movie, while at face value, could be a children's movie its dark themes (mentioned in the first paragraph.) show how this can be an interesting experience for all ages.",The Lego Batman Movie

As you know like all movies the sequels don't really markup the expectations line but this time i wasn't making the same mistake again so i gave it a chance, It was worth every penny and a good decision to watch in cinema. The movie was full of sarcastic jokes and fun but don't think just because it is a Lego Animated movie it wont have a story line. the movie had a really well built script and a good message emphasizing on Family Values which is a good thing to display and give a good message to all youngsters and adults like us. I would highly recommend everyone to watch this fun filled entertainment go and enjoy it with your family i am confident you wont be disappointed i wasn't and i would definitely say it was really good sequel more good than my expectations.",The Lego Batman Movie

265,iaintemperley,Holy Lego bricks! A ridiculously fun Batman movie.,8,12 February 2017,"It would be fair to say that film/TV adaptations of the Dark Knight have been mixed; from the deadpan campiness of the 60s show to the deadly seriousness of his most recent outings is there anything new and entertaining that can be brought to the table? As it turns out: yes there is. How? By satirising everything about him.While mocking his super serious persona is nothing new here the writers go out to deconstruct the character to the nth degree with spot-on surgical precision and such insanely meta levels it sometimes make Deadpool look like amateur hour. There are so many references and Easter eggs, from recent films (""Get criminals to fight criminals? That's a stupid idea!"") to the most obscure names in the Rogues Gallery (who remembers Calendar Man or Gentleman Ghost?) that it will make both casual and hardcore fans giddy with delight. But that is just half the fun as there is plenty of other gags to please the audience plus the visuals are great with well-executed action scenes and impeccable animation just bursting with colour and creativity.It holds up pretty well on the story front also with the aforementioned deconstructing allows for an in-depth examination of Caped Crusader that touches dealing with grief and recognising the value of teamwork, which are nice messages for children. This is thanks in no smart part to Will Arnett, successfully maintaining the macho facade while also effectively conveying the fears and insecurities underneath the cowl. In terms of the negatives: the ""throw everything at the wall and see what sticks"" mentality does mean that you get the odd dud gag while our hero's ultimate realisation is predictable. Really though these are only nit picks in an otherwise smart, entertaining picture. The genius of the film is how effectively it balances all these elements, mixing nostalgia with a contemporary mindset to build something that is new yet familiar, intelligent but at times suitable farcical. There's much more I could say but I'm afraid I might spoil people discovering the superlatives for themselves. Check it out and perhaps washout some of the recent mediocre DC aftertaste.",The Lego Batman Movie

268,contact-445,The best batman movie in years,9,8 February 2017,"This says a lot about the sorry state of the live action DC Cinematic Universe, that this Lego Batman movie is actually the best Batman movie in years. The Lego Batman movie aces the lego part, using the constraints of the lego bricks to very creatively frame the movie's universe and the story, like its predecessor, the Lego movie.On top of that, this batman movie is actually about Batman, its story has surprising depth, and while it unrolls at a super-frenetic pace, we never lose track of what is going on, and why characters do what they do. The villains are compelling and the story is better than any recent live-action superhero movie I can think of.The writers also show both real love and real respect for the history of Batman, found a way to make the main villain (the Joker) really interesting, especially in his relationship with Batman, and is the first Batman movie to actually address the question of whether Batman is really a blessing for Gotham city or not, and what to do about it. Again it says quite a lot about the DC cinematic universe that a LEGO movie of all things would nail this.Finally, the movie is also both funny and clever. The movie unrolls as a spastic pace from the very beginning, and never lets up, same with the jokes, so I probably missed some, but the lampshading and send- up of Batman within the lego universe was really well done, while treating the subject very seriously and respectfullyI saw the movie with my family in IMAX Laser, and it's one of the very few movies I've seen that really uses the format. Again I don't know if that says more about this movie or the live action ones.Everyone had a great time and liked the movie on different levels. Warmly recommended",The Lego Batman Movie

As to the comparison with the later ""Batman"" and ""Batman vs. Superman"", this movie had humor, and lived in Gotham. One could identify with the characters, who all acted with humor and joy about existence. Not the dark, moody and frankly boring attitudes of the Batman vs. Superman movie.

However I must say as the movie went on, I felt the momentum was lost and it slowly became a very serious film and then continued to the last act where it was a bunch of LEGO flying about.

Not terribly many movies seem to have fun with the telling of their stories anymore, way too much dark, emo and brooding. However, Lego Batman was fun, energetic and creative, blending the Batman from the Lego movie and putting him in his own Lego Batman story and it turned out wonderfully. I tend to rate movies that I see into 2 categories, do I like it enough that I'd buy it? Or not. I would happily buy this one.

It did what a good family movie should, and it had enjoyable humor for everyone and it wasn't too ""goofy"" or ""silly"". All the actors in the film did a great job voicing some of DC's favorite characters. I was personally surprised to see that Zach Galifianakis did an impressive job as the joker. He caught the same wit, likability, and overall character very well. Although, he wasn't as good as Mark Hamill, Heath Ledger, or Jack Nicholson, he still redeemed the character after Jared Leto's cringey performance in Suicide Squad. This film is spectacularly animated, somewhat well written, funny, and an enjoyable film overall.There are a few issues that I saw with this movie,. It had a really cliché and predictable climax.

Not only does it appear to be another shameless product placement, it just looks...bad.Holy s@$t we were wrong.This movie is just like the first in that it was an amazing surprise, and was more than a dumb family movie. But it was also different in that the main protagonists are the complete opposite. Emmet is this basic, suck-up loser nobody knows or likes. But Batman is a guy everyone wants to know, and is someone they like. But he's also, like emmet, alone in this world, with his only companion being Alfred the cool kid. But through a touching tale of heroes, villains, and the most ambitious crossover in any (animated) film ever, he gains friends, and chooses to live a more happy life. 9/10, pretty darn good, and a pretty big snub.",The Lego Batman Movie

291,haifisch2010,i just think it's neat,8,28 February 2019,"I honestly didn't expect it to be that good just as a I didnt expect original lego movie to be good, but here we are in the world where this is one of the best batman films.What I appreciate about this movie is that it opens up about more vulnerable side of batman unlike vast majority of media about him and is not afraid to call him out on his shortcomings and also explores his relationship with his friends and family all the while being jampacked with action scenes which also utilize the ""lego"" aspect of the world (which i find really cool since sometimes animated movies tend to choose a setting for the story ""just cause"" and here lego aspect is really important to the story)movie has negatives as well, although i don't want to dwell on them much. one of the biggest draws for me were long ass touching scenes right in the middle of some action a la ""characters are in huge hurry but they suddenly stop and have 5 min monologue about their emotional insecurity"" which i feel like kinda break the pace in some parts of the movieoverall i think it's a good movie with positive messages in it which will be interesting for both kids and adults",The Lego Batman Movie

Will Arnett always makes me laugh, and here is no exception.It occurred to me as I left the cinema, that the Joker in this film (Yes, an animated Lego Joker in a children's flick) was more menacing, charismatic and memorable than what we were ""treated"" to in last Summer's Suicide Squad. My word that was an awful Joker in that Squad film.If you enjoyed the Lego Movie, this one is certainly worth a look.",The Lego Batman Movie

Id rate this better than the Lego movie.I expected the story to be about Lego batman in the Lego universe but i was pleasantly surprised to see that it was basically all DC universe characters and settings, apart from a few villains which worked well anyway. Master building was only mentioned once, which was nice. Strangely enough, this movie had better character development that the last batman film we saw. This needs to be rated AT LEAST an 8 because i loved it. highly, highly recommend. try and get later times to avoid the annoying children narrating the entire thing",The Lego Batman Movie

It makes fun of how many times batman has been rebooted and how the hero always wins all the time. There are so many cameos I can't list all of them. Will Arnet brings a dark yet funny batman voice. The batman in this movie is a lot like the HISHE (How it should have ended) batman. He says because I'm batman many times and he never wants to take off his mask. It seems like the Lego version of HISHE to be honest. Don't take that as a negative comment. It's supposed to be nice. It is hilarious for everybody. Go see it. It's the light side of Batman.",The Lego Batman Movie
296,ChannelFAB,LEGO Batman Movie is just as fun as the toy it comes from!,10,22 February 2017,"The LEGO Batman is an all round, family fun movie which is a perfect spin off to its previous film, 'The LEGO Movie'. The LEGO Batman Movie has a steady amount of jokes keeping you laughing all the way throughout. The only time your not really laughing is when the movie moves into its more serious side developing a relation between Bruce Wanye and his 'Bat Family'. What the LEGO Batman Movie does right is that it shows off DC's villains for what they really are instead of trying to change them into more dark, serious characters. Like seriously, Imagine Condiment King in the next Batman Movie! You can't do it! Another thing the movie does really well, as did the LEGO Movie, was bringing together other brands in which leave a wider variety of characters to play with. Having the Joker be sent to the Phantom Zone and meeting all these other villains like King Kong, Voldermort, the Daleks... it wasn't expected and they did a really good job of keeping this aspect of the story a secret in the trailers. Overall the LEGO Batman Movie was a great movie and would recommend to anyone. Even if they have no interest with Superheroes.",The Lego Batman Movie
297,Hyker,Great movie with great references,8,15 February 2017,"A must see movie for every Batman and/or LEGO Fan. There were so many references about older Batman movies or other movies in general I can't even count them. You can also see various characters from other franchises like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings or King Kong. LEGO Batman has a lot of characters to offer, which may seem boring at some point, but it's not. The movie is somewhat predictable but I would watch the movie again just because of all the references I haven't seen yet.There's really nothing to complain about this movie and I recommend it to everyone who liked the Lego Movie (2014).",The Lego Batman Movie

The movie is extremely comical, and some parts made me genuinely laugh. That's quite a rare feat. One of the highlights would have to be the hilariously meta nature of it. It really poked fun at itself, which is something I enjoy in a comedy movie.The lovable, winsome nature of the characters was so easy to fall in love with, and it was a really refreshing to see a turn from the usual grim status quo of the Batman franchise. All jokes aside, the movie did have a momentous, thought-provoking message of the importance of family and rapport. The film had a few issues, as most do, but it's overall a great movie for kids and adults alike. Would definitely recommend it to anyone, even if you're not a Batman fan.",The Lego Batman Movie
299,sublimebrushwork,"It's good, but not THAT good",7,5 January 2018,"Lego Batman is getting some really rave reviews and, while entertaining on many levels, it is not without its flaws that, to me, make some of those reviews seem a little OTT.
The design and animation is top-notch with a great deal of attention to detail being put into the presentation. The way the movie looks cannot be faulted. The storyline is basic, but entertaining enough in what is, after all, a kids film and the voice acting is spot-on, with everyone getting into character and obviously having a lot of fun with their performances.
There is something here for all ages. Kids will love the premise, the characters and the bright, colourful animation and adults will get all the slightly risque jokes and sight gags that pay homage to dozens of other films, tv and books. 
Where the movie falls down for me is the sheer level of action. There is so much going on all the time that it makes it difficult to follow at times and it never lets up. There is barely a moment to breath from one action sequence to another and, even in the quieter moments things seem to be happening at an overly rushed pace. It made the experience difficult to concentrate on for the whole runtime and I'll admit that, by the end, I was glad it was all over, if only to catch my breath.
Don't think that I didn't enjoy it, I did, but I don't think it really deserved the huge praise that it's getting. A little more restraint would have made it a better movie.",The Lego Batman Movie
300,k_olsen,Absolute trash!,1,30 July 2018,"This movie shoots straight up to the top of my list of most hated movies. It was an hour and 45 minutes of having obvious left wing political agenda shoved in your face. What happened to being able to attend a movie and enjoy a nice story and great characters? Tired of being preached at during every film I watch of late. It felt at times like it was written by a child. Lets stop ruining movies with political agenda and go back to creating good storylines. I used to go to movies to escape the regular world....
Took the kids to this one and was disappointed by it in more ways than I can count, including the inappropriate jokes and humor being directed at my children...who did pick up on some of them. Wanted to rip my hair out by the end. 
If you want a good family movie to take the kids to, this is not the one. Steer clear. It was incredibly painful and I have not stopped seething even several days later.",The Lego Batman Movie

I guess some people who give this movie high praise enjoy the feeling of getting their eyes and ears relentlessly assaulted by rainbow explosions strung together by a dumb paint-by-numbers plot. This is especially confusing watching this mess considering the brilliant cast that was involved, Will Arnett, Michael Cera, Zach Galifianakis.The joke writing is at times very sharp and laugh out loud hilarious, but it's nearly impossible to enjoy becausing the pacing of the entire film is like one never-ending action scene from Transformers: The Last Knight.

The morals, the humor, the visuals, the music, the characters, the multiple different motives and subplots perfectly come together like pieces of a divine puzzle to form the most brilliant picture: this film. Not only does Batman defeat the villains of Gotham, he defeats toxic masculinity and the allure of deprecating independence.

Guys, at least watch the damn movie before writing stuff like ""Best Batman movie so far, up there with the Dark Knight Trilogy"". 
It's a silly, super - long toy commercial... I haven't heard anyone saying Space Balls is the best Star Wars movie so far, but now i won't be surprised if i do...
Unfortunatelly i don't have any kids, but if i did, i'm not sure i would present this to a kid over Lion King, Toy Story or even other merchantise-related kids movies like He-Man etc. It's too obvious a cash - grab, at least back then tried hard to turn it into something more than a toy ad, and managed to build up from there...

315,sjplovett,Mediocre at best.,3,20 April 2017,"How best to summarise this boring movie? tough one. The only jokes that worked were the references to older, better movies, including the 1966 film. Despite being prominently featured in the advertising Harley Quinn has about 2 minutes of total screen time, which is mostly just her either introducing the Joker or handing him an item. DC is still trying to push a Batman-Batgirl romance upon us despite it being incredibly creepy both because she is at least 20 years younger than him and because she used to date his adoptive son. Speaking of Dick Greyson, gone is the circus background, instead we get a ""geek"" from an orphanage complete with glasses, perfect for fighting crime. As for Batman himself... sigh, its just sad. This entire movie is nothing but an insult to the Dark Knight and his crew. Still, the kids will love it.",The Lego Batman Movie
316,lhhzebra,Best Batman film for many years,9,24 February 2017,"I've not enjoyed watching a Batman adaptation so much since the 1960s TV series! The whole film contains lots of humour, sight gags, digs at other superheroes and is stuffed full of fantastic Batman and DC comics references. The rich history of Batman is explored, parodied and used in the film's plot and gives a great character story of Batman's life as a caped crusader and explores how his life can be one of a lonely crime fighter. This possibly making the film's portrayal of Batamn to be the best and most well rounded incarnation of Batman on screen to date.The talented cast of voice actors really bring the characters to life with great voice acting across the board, particularly from Batman, Alfred and Barbara Gordon. The film has super pacing, plenty of fight and action scenes, and solid story telling throughout. The music and original songs are very catchy too! The Lego Batman Movie is definitely a worthy sequel to the original Lego Movie.",The Lego Batman Movie

It is nothing but references on top of references with even more references packed in a box of references. It feels the writing staff spent so much of their time coming up with the most obscure references that they forgot to put in stuff like character development or an actual story. Talking about the story, it is nonsensical at best and atrocious at worst. Stuff happens that you have no investment in and you're just waiting for the next gag or obscure reference to pop up.

Extremely satisfied and a must watch for all audiences,9,17 February 2017,"✨ Friday Review✨ The Lego Batman Movie is a superhero English anime based on DC Comics character Batman.✅ CAST & TEAM: 💸Produced and Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, 📄the story is penned by Seth Grahame-Smith(based on DC Comics and Lego Construction Toys), movie is directed 📝 by Chris McKay , the 🎶music by Lorne Balfe and 🎞editing by David Burrows, Matt Villa, John Venzon. 😍😍The cast includes Will Arnett(Bruce Wayne/Batman), Zach Galifianakis(Joker), Michael Cera (Dick Grayson/Robin), Rosario Dawson (Barbara Gordon / Batgirl), Ralph Fiennes (Alfred Pennyworth). 😇 With a budget of $80Million💰 and a run-time of 104 minutes , ⏳ the movie released on 10th Feb in US and on 17th in India .👏✅ PLOT: This Lego movie starts with Batman saving Gotham🏬 from Joker and during the fight he hurts Joker's feeling that he is not an important person in Batman's life😎. This ignites Joker's ego for an ultimate revenge plan☠. On another track, we have Batman battling his own fears- leaving out his stubbornness, asking for help and most of all - LOVE and CARE😍, his relation with his adopted son Robin and the reluctance to join hands with the new city commissioner Barbara Gordon.🤗🤗✅ PLUS: Remember those childhood days when we will have a toy scooter🏍 in hand and go shouting a running commentatory ourselves. "" The racer starts his bike...vrooooom.... he rides it along the floor and slowly moves across the walls...vroom vroooom... ... he is riding on the balcony rail and doing a big flip and the racer ends the race first.... Yippee... Applause to Gilbert😂😂😂""That's Lego Batman we are introduced to. He is full of the feeling 'I', a self praising commentary machine 😜. Everything seemed to be a plus in this anime. Of which expressions and dialogues elevate the comedy element to a different planet 👏👏💪💪.Best expression was of joker😘😘. Poor papa expression😢 when Batman denies him his importance😘😘. Will Arnett easily carries the attitude and proud voice of Batman but you got to give it to Robin's voice through Michael Cera🤗🤗- Such an innocence masterpiece👏👏.Dialogues: Solid one liners "" Batman doesn't do 'ships...as in relationships ""😎... And proudness even while appreciating the team: "" You were good, you were good, you were good and I was awesome "" 😂 😂to his extreme difficult areas of emotions: Batman: "" I am really... really really really... really really... Ssss... Ssssssss Sorrrrrrrrrrr (497r's) 😓 Barbara : Are you trying to be sorry. Batman : Oh yeah we did it , we are family🤗🤗And not to forget a sea of villains Joker brings on😎😎..We have 💀 Voldemort casting Wingardium Leviosa, Agent Smith(Matrix), KingKong, Godzilla, T-Rex , wicked witch, ""Eye of Sauron"" (Lord of the rings) and every villain you can name of😍😍💥💥.The makers have enjoyed every bit while making. Even IPhone Siri makes it to end credits for Bat-computer's voice😜😜. And a mention to 20- 25 songs with mostly Batman's goofed up lyrics 😂😂.☢ MINUS : I couldn't find any flaw in this 104 minutes. Two points can be mentioned though. The screenplay was packed with content and other was the unavoidable comparison to the first LEGO movie.🙈🙈✅ VERDICT: Batman makes us cry out with laughter😍. Extremely satisfied and a must watch for all audiences.💪( for those who skip animation :Please do not sideline it as just an anime)✅ RATED: 9/10 🌟🌟🌟 🌟 ⚡*Do not judge a movie by its rating 🙌 *Friday reviews are non- patented views of GilbertRam alone for the ticket(120)+Tax(30)+3d glass(30)+Parking(0) amount spent and not to hurt the sentiments of like-minded movie-buffs.",The Lego Batman Movie

The content is horrible, it is almost offensive how poor the content is when compared to ""The Lego Movie"" which came first. Don't waste your time on this silly flick. It's pointless, and even has content that has some seemingly homosexual references, which shouldn't be in a movie like that. Although it is getting a good name, from the average person who enjoyed the original, IT REALLY STINKS!!! I would even say that it is a disgrace to its predecessor.

The kids see Lego's with colors, action and subtle lines they understand, but children are more focused on the action and not dialogue. For adults, it is full of Innuendos that keep you laughing non stop. I literally cried from laughing so hard. So if a movie for a family is entertaining for the kids and makes adults laugh and not look at watch to see ""when this is over"", then that's a 10. No kids here. And my fiancée was like omg, what!

323,babar-93680,"The long advert before the movie, is actually the movie.",1,12 February 2017,"There is no way to escape taking the kids to watch this, I mean what are you, a monster?!?? They've been waiting for this for three years! And you're having second thoughts now? You are thinking the trailer was difficult enough to watch with that indescribably irritating deeply whispered Batman voice, and that possibly all the best jokes were used already, and it still wasn't particularly funny...Well, I very much lowered my expectations and was still disappointed.In this film the 'Legoness' is just an animation style, just like Aardman, Disney or Manga. There is no real reference made by the characters about the fact that they live in a Lego world. Consequently, when Batman suggests in the end that in order to stick together he should attach his foot onto somebody's head it just comes across as totally random. This literally took me through a very tedious realisation, such as, ahaa, of course, because you guys are made of Lego!!Of course, there was a message, in fact for me, there were two. The moral lesson is that it's best to stay in a dysfunctional relationship even if it poses constant risk to everybody around you because like that you can still hang onto that laboured, pathetic, worn out identity, that everybody, including yourself, recognises you by. The other lesson, or promise or threat, depending on what you like, is that sooner or later anything that makes or ever made a substantial amount of money will be stuffed into the big Lego brand mincer and come out as plastic figures at the other end. Some titles I'm already very much looking forward to include: Rocky, The Exorcist, The Passion of the Christ, and Forest Gump. It is actually possible to buy Lego Hitler on Ebay. It even has two faces, an angry face, obviously, and on the other side he has a cheeky little smile under his moustache. It's clearly stated in the advert that this is a custom-made version. The official Lego Hitler minifigure is expected to be released the same time as The Lego Schindler's list Movie.In the meantime if you wanted to have a Lego-animated insight to a supervillain's complex personality, then watch Eddie Izzard's Death Star Canteen on YouTube instead.",The Lego Batman Movie

The movie's theme portrays a good overall message of staying loyal with your family and the responsibilities of raising one. The movie had many jokes which made the entire theater roar with laughter! Some jokes were overused, but still made it very funny! Will Arnett playing Batman is a very good choice! Will Arnett (Batman) works alone as a hero, however trying to hide is own identity as the richest man alive, Bruce Wayne. The movie has all the vilians, like, Bane, Poison Ivy, and much more! The Joker has evil plans set for the entire city. The Joke however has one mission the entire film, make Batman admit he is his favorite enemy.

The Lego Batman movie had a lot of laughs in the beginning of the movie, in a rapid fire type way, and every single joke worked. However, for as good as it was, there was definitely a negative that needs to be mentioned. As I said in the beginning of the review, the movie had a lot of laughs in the beginning and you get a feel of what the movie is going, and then at a point, it just halts and really focuses on more character than trying to be funny. Keep in mind I like that the movie focuses on the character of Batman, but it really came out of left field and was really jarring. They could have transitioned it much better. Besides that, I really liked the movie. The voice actors were amazing. Will Arnett does an excellent job of Lego Batman again. Zach Galifianakis did a great job as the joker. Those two really stood out for me. It was a great all around movie and I would definitely recommend this to anyone of any age. It's definitely worth your money.",The Lego Batman Movie
326,iluvsports-18027,Not your typical kids movie..,9,15 February 2017,I absolutely loved this movie!!! I cant understand people who say they love the Lego movie and batman is actually how he was in that movie. It had funny jokes and Micheal Cera had me laughing at his voice and silly jokes. The voice characters fit well expect Harley i felt she could've been more of a whinny type like she is in the cartoon. I cant really complain about anything in this movie. Id watch it again and i cant wait looking forward to the blue ray movie release date. Will does a great job making the voice as funny as he could just like in the original. I don't recommend bringing children under 13 due to some of the adult hidden jokes. So if your movie vision is narrow and silly don't see this you probably wont enjoy but if you go in with a broaden view you'll love it.,The Lego Batman Movie
327,doorman-95033,Starts out with a POW but ends with Zzz,6,22 February 2017,"The movie starts full of great jokes and wit, referencing past interpretations as well as throwing in easter eggs for true fans. It pokes fun at Batman in all the right ways and seems like it will be one of the best Batman movies until it gets to the actual plot of the movie. The hilarity in the beginning of the movie comes down from 11 and provides laughs very sparingly for the second half. The tone shifts mid movie and it just seems to drag on. I found myself in the theater wondering when it was going to end and if I could stay awake. Even the kid sitting next to me said he was bored to his mom, a kid! The target audience!Being a huge Batman fan, I was super disappointed in the end product especially with all of the hype the movie is getting. I thought Batman stole every scene in the Lego Movie, but this movie just does not hold up. A stand alone Lego Batman would have fit better as a short film.",The Lego Batman Movie

The movie has incredible has voice acting all around. It is a visually vibrant film with beautiful colours and and animation. It is able a deeper psycho-analysis than most Batman films without being utterly blatant. The jokes are hilarious and will be able to bring out a laugh from all age groups. It might even require repeat viewings to get to understand or pick up all the jokes. They mercilessly make fun of Batman's history in film or otherwise and it is fun to watch. It made me realise about some of the lesser known or downright villains Batman has faced over the years. The only problems I personally had were with the fact that some of the jokes more often than or not were for the child demographic. It had less of an emotional pull than ""The Lego Movie"" and made less of a political commentary, which I guess is a personal preference. Inspite of the minor problems, it is still a film I would recommend to Batman fans, fans of comedic genre and to people who just want to have a good time watching quality cinema.",The Lego Batman Movie
330,pilgrimk-40454,You have to watch Lego Batman!,10,13 March 2017,"I personally thought that the Lego Batman movie was very comical and excellent for all ages. Batman, or Will Arnett, was very comical in the movie along with his other colleagues. I went to see this movie with both my brother and my dad. The kids get to enjoy a hilarious movie about batman and adults understand all the innuendos that are put in the script. I can assure all my family was laughing very hard throughout the whole movie, as well as everyone else in the movie theater. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a good laugh.",The Lego Batman Movie
331,willblack-01111,Awesome movie,10,17 March 2017,"I watched this with my friend in the theater and it is one of my favorite movies. I love the setting of the scenes. If someone was to watch this, then they should. I have good feelings about this movie and I would like to see it again. I have no other favorite movies but this. I want to watch this with my family so bad. I want to watch it every day because of it is amazing.",The Lego Batman Movie
332,Alex_Buxton_Wilmott,Best Movie Ever,10,13 April 2017,"This movie is excellent for adults and kids! I watched this movie with my parents and they enjoyed the jokes. I enjoyed everything as I love Batman. The graphics were cool and the lego pieces really come to life, the storyline was also fun enough to keep us kids entertained. If you haven't already seen it make sure you do.",The Lego Batman Movie
333,lwchris-83602,"Good, but not as good as ""The LEGO Movie""",8,7 May 2017,"This movie is quite a lot of fun to watch, not only for lovers of LEGO. If you liked The LEGO Movie, you'll most likely dig this one, too. The humour is alright for any age, and there are lots of references to older Batman movies and other super heroes. The story is maybe a little short and shallow, the ending and most story lines are foreseeable, but all that is quite alright for a movie of this format.Of course, as it is a LEGO movie after all, it will not get away without a comparison of those two movies quality-wise. And I have to say, there is one thing I thought was a little sad about the scenery: far less special effects were rendered to look like LEGO bricks; especially many flames and the ocean are just normal fire/water effects, and thus do not quite fit in the overall picture of the very detailed and lovingly designed LEGO universe. Nevertheless a passionate viewer and LEGO player will still be astonished by the amount of detail the creators have implemented into the scenery, and everything looks like regular LEGO bricks.Unless you do dislike LEGO and Batman, watching this movie is absolutely worthwhile.",The Lego Batman Movie
334,hmibr-97076,Iron man Sucks!!!!,10,5 June 2017,"no compared to the fun i had watching this movie,he really does suck.the start was funny the end was epic the history was thought out.the plot was set.every seen is great its like a roller-coaster of well,every nice feeling u can have in a movie.LEGO movie and its team is officially my favorites.then again WB sucks for live action and after this they sucks even more.i have got one question where did they get rights to all the characters they used!!!!",The Lego Batman Movie
335,nicolaifflaten,Lovable Comedy,8,30 June 2017,"This movie made me laugh my ass off. As a Batman fan, and especially a Joker fan, The Lego Batman movie was right up my alley. Zach Galifianakis did a great job as a more lovable Joker, and Will Arnett did the same for Batman, giving us a great duo.The comedy of the movie was very fun for kids, teenagers and adults, but where the movie faulted was in the references to previous Batman works. Some of the references will only be understood by the hardcore fans. I'm a more casual fan so I got a lot of the references, but not all. All in all it's a great animated movie that fits nicely in with the Lego Movie.",The Lego Batman Movie

This movie really had no decent humor, it was all cheesy and very juvenile. Not really sure why people liked this movie so much, there wasn't really anything special about it.",The Lego Batman Movie
338,msngiatofb,Must watch if you are a fan of superheroes and good humor,10,7 October 2017,The movie had so good sound effects (even the sound effects was hilarious) and many funny lines and puns about 95% of the movie. An excellent movie to see especially if you like superheroes movies. Well set with good story and very known actors as voices. If you are not a happy person or dead inside and the most important you don't know anything about superheroes or any fictional/fantasy movies and series there is no need for you to watch it.,The Lego Batman Movie
