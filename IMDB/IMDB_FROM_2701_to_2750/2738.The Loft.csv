0,SnoopyStyle,unappealing characters,3,6 August 2016,"Architect Vincent Stevens (Karl Urban) is being interrogated by the police as he recounts what happened. Luke Seacord (Wentworth Miller) had discovered a dead girl handcuffed to the bed in the loft. He called Vincent, psychiatrist Chris Vanowen (James Marsden), fellow real estate agent Marty Landry (Eric Stonestreet), and Chris' half brother Philip Williams (Matthias Schoenaerts). Vincent had organized a shared secret love nest for the five married friends. Chris is married to Allison (Rhona Mitra) and had an affair with Ann Morris (Rachael Taylor), the sister of a patient who committed suicide. Vincent is married to Barbara (Valerie Cruz) and slept with Sarah Deakins (Isabel Lucas).None of the characters are appealing and therefore none of it matters to me. By following a scattering of characters, none of them become big enough to be compelling. It becomes an endurance contest of waiting for the reveal. Since nobody is the hero of the piece, anybody could be the killer and no twist or reveal is truly shocking. I had hopes of a Hitchcockian thriller but it's all very flat.",The Loft
1,Horst_In_Translation,"Not too much depth, but an entertaining watch",6,21 December 2014,"""The Loft"" is Erik van Looy's first film as a director since 2008. This film may stay his most known work for many years to come as this is already the third version of it. Van Looy directed the Belgian original in 2008 and there was even a Dutch version not much later with another director though. It would certainly very interesting to compare these movies and look for similarities and differences. A third remake is not common at all. He has worked on several Belgian movies and the most famous actor he directed so far is probably Oscar nominee Mickey Rourke. The story is fairly simple initially. Five males rent a loft, which they use to cheat on their wives. One day, a dead woman is found in the apartment and it has to be one of them who killed her as nobody has a key except the five and there are no traces of a breaking and entering.Quite a simple premise and I think if they had kept it more simple towards the end, it could have been a really great film. In my opinion, it was just one final twist too many at the end. It wasn't so bad that it would destroy the entire film. The big advantage for me here was that I was familiar with the whole quintet. I knew all of them at least a bit from the name or from previous projects and Eric Stonestreet I even knew very well being an avid ""Modern Family"" viewer. A bit strange to see him as such an extremely heterosexual character. Apart from him, I watched some ""Prison Break"", ""Rust and Bone"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""30 Rock"" in the past, which helped me associate with the other actors. Urban I was not too familiar with, but I saw him in ""RED"" not too long ago and managed to make a connection here as well. The only other I knew in here was Rhona Mitra, not a particularly versatile actress in my opinion, but she has great screen presence in pretty much everything she is in, even if she doesn't talk much.Except the criticism about the ending (it felt like a series of ""Pretty Little Liars"" packed into half an hour, framing, suicide, murder, pills...) , I am mostly fine with the script. I think they could have made it more efficient by keeping the film at 80 minutes and having the audience guess until the final sequence who killed the girl and made it very clear with one of them being the killer, maybe even letting him get away at the end. Unfortunately they did not. However, there are some nice details in the movie that I enjoyed. For example, due to the central characters' involvement with several blondes it is initially not safe to say who is the actual victim. I liked that. Guessing is always good. What I did not entirely understand was why most of the other men would rent the loft if it was almost exclusively only one of them who would use it to cheat on his wife. The whole surveillance plot could have been a bit more clever too. As I said earlier, it was almost too much drama packed into 20 minutes and it would have been too much for 2 hours, everything that happened in the end.All in all, I would slightly recommend this movie. Even if it is not entirely convincing, it certainly has its strengths and you could give it a chance, especially if you like thrillers revolving around murder.",The Loft

Vincent proposes his friends to share a wonderful penthouse loft in a brand new building designed by him to become their rendezvous instead of using their credit cards for love affairs and one night stands in hotels. When they discover the body of a beautiful woman cuffed on the bed in the loft, they have argument to find who is the responsible and secrets are disclosed affecting their friendship.""The Loft"" is an engaging thriller with a good story with many twists despite of the flaws and the weak conclusion. It is not easy to write a complex screenplay developing many characters with twists without plot holes. The greatest one is how a high-standard building in the present days does not have security cameras and guards to show that the alibis are not consistent? Chris is a psychiatrist and does not identify that Sarah Deakins is not dead? The conclusion is also unconvincing. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Prazeres Mortais"" (""Deadly Pleasures"")",The Loft
3,nogodnomasters,YOUR LITTLE SISTER IS SERIOUSLY HOT,8,23 September 2018,"The movie starts off with a murdered blond whose face we don't get to see for quite a while. The film is told with select flashbacks to the guys discovering the corpse and the formation of the Loft and before and not always in chronological order so not to reveal the whole story until the end.Five professionals decide to share a loft in order to bring women there where their always suspecting wives won't be able to follow any money trail. The blond appears to be a woman introduced as a politician's aide whose boss is possessive. We also have 5 wives as suspects too. As the film goes on the plot reveals more of itself. It is made to seem complex due to the nature on how we are given clues.The film leaves clues, but there is no way to tie them into anything. And PLOT SPOILER we don't always see what actually happened and have no way of knowing that until the end. It is a mystery that tries to be clever, but not good.Guide: F-bomb, sex.

4,kosmasp,Lofty,6,9 June 2015,"If you haven't seen the original movie (this is based on), you probably will add a couple of points to your summary. That is if you like suspenseful movies. And while this is a nice remake, it does feel forced in what it tries to tell us and thus remaking what some might have seen. On the other hand, foreign movies do not get watched a lot in America, so they tend to surprise the viewers when they remake a really good movie, as was the original ""Loft"".The movie will start off with a ""bang"", something you will be able to figure out, that it's going to happen later in the movie. The acting is solid throughout, most of the actors are known. The relationships seem awkward to say the least, with one of our characters not seeming to fit at all. But it all boils down to this feeling forced and not as suave as the original. I can only point out to that movie again and recommend you'd rather watch that",The Loft

Events that transpired during the last year were brought back into flashback scenes as the viewer gets know what led to this murder and gets into the puzzle of figuring out who among the five friends was responsible for the crime.This has a lot of tension-filled moments with regards to the puzzle of the murder committed considering the complications involved and the ultimate solution to the guilty one.Despite of it,the film is not free of flaws as the performances of the main cast is far from compelling and somewhat lacking as a character-driven film as the viewer would least likely care about them.But despite of it,it still manages to be a satisfying whodunnit film.",The Loft

THE LOFT is bound to do even better business internationally than in the domestic market, since it confirms what the World has long suspected. Big Money people--such as real estate moguls, their bribed government lackeys, their corrupt builders, sleazy architects, Dr. Feel Good psychiatrists, and Big League hookers pictured here--squander the life blood cash that they've stolen from we ""Little People"" (through their fraudulent tax schemes, price-fixing, and exorbitant fees) so that they can lead hedonistic lives featuring every sort of debauchery known to Satan's minions. THE LOFT captures it all: deviant sex, prescription drug abuse, perverse spouse swapping, Big Brother spy cameras, cocaine by the pound, and kinky back-stabbing ""friendships"" (since the Rich are incapable of basic human virtues such as loyalty, benevolence, and trust). THE LOFT proves that the One Per Cent's bonfire of vanities will consume any moth drawn too close to their flame. THE LOFT could be subtitled DEMONS AMONG US.",The Loft
8,phd_travel,Stylish but over written,4,1 March 2016,"The Loft is stylish, the wives are unhappily attractive, the prostitutes are beautiful. The loft is a pad shared by a bunch of friends to use for affairs.Among the cast Rachael Taylor stands out as a pretty call girl and Rhona Mitra and Margarita Levieva are the wives.

9,deloudelouvain,The original Belgian version was better but this one is also fine.,7,13 February 2017,"I have a couple of questions after watching The Loft. The first one is why some people don't like this movie? If you wanted to watch a mystery thriller then this is what you got. There's no way in hell you could see the end coming. That's what makes a mystery thriller standing out from the rest. A good story with some twists you don't see coming. My second question is why do we need to remake a movie that has been made before and even better? I saw the Belgian version of 2008 before and even if it is the exact copy of this version the original was even better. So why spending all that money on a movie that already exists? Just put some subtitles under the Belgian version and you got an even better movie. Saves you money and time. And if you watched this version of The Loft to see Matthias Schoenaerts play in it than you could have watched the original version as well because he plays in both movies. That must be a premiere I think. Anyways, even though I preferred the original version I still think this one was also good. Good story with good twists and with a good cast. What else do you want on a movie night?",The Loft
10,StevePulaski,Unworry of an international incident,5,25 June 2015,"We have five men, all approaching middle-age and hungering for their inconsequential days of drinking and screwing anything in sight. They are Vince (Karl Urban), a married architect, Luke (Wentworth Miller), a married diabetic who finds himself going along with his friends more often than not, Chris (James Marsden), a married psychiatrist, Marty (Eric Stonestreet), a married, loudmouth alcoholic, and Phillip (Matthias Schoenaerts), Chris's married half-brother. In efforts to try and replicate those days, Vince gives each of his pals a key to a loft in a building he designed. There are only five keys made for this particular room, which mimics the design of a lavish presidential suite. Here, the men can unleash their wildest fantasies and never worry about getting caught. It isn't until Luke ventures up to the loft to find a nude woman murdered and handcuffed to the bed of the loft that things begin to unravel. With this, the men begin to reveal to each other, and their spouses, their intentions and their ugly path of adultery.I'm always up for a good erotic thriller and Erik Van Looy's The Loft is serviceable genre-fare, by that standard. Van Looy apparently felt the story was significant enough to warrant a Dutch-language, Belgian adaptation in 2008 before working on this American version in 2011. Despite being shot in the summer of 2011, the film went through a shift in distributors when the head of Dark Castle Entertainment at Warner Bros. moved offices to Universal. After that, he sat on the film, choosing to release other projects and keep The Loft on the shelf until releasing it with minimal promotion during the dumping ground month of January 2015 in America.On that basis alone, in addition to being an erotic thriller, a generally tough sell, the American version of The Loft is destined to bear some obscurity in future years. However, what makes this genre work is the elements of sexiness and contempt, which this film has in mass amounts. The erotic flare in Nicolas Karakatsanis's cinematography, heavy on the lavish details and the red textures, and John Frizzell's equal parts sensual and ominous score really make The Loft work for its genre. The contempt element comes in when we realize just how unlikable all of the characters are here. When we are lead down a path of twists and turns, most of which clearly written by the writing team of Bart De Pauw and Wesley Strick, it's clear we cannot trust any of these characters and that makes the experience that much more intriguing.The Loft, however, has its own share of shortcomings, most of which come in the acting department. Without a doubt, for a mainstream release, this has some of the shakiest acting I have seen in quite sometime. James Marsden constantly feels awkward, giving a deer-in-headlights-esque performance throughout the entire film. His lines delivery carries a certain wooden quality, and isn't assisted by the likes of Urban or Miller, both of whom have their own share of overacting as well. Probably the film's most animated is Stonestreet, given his roly-poly nature, but the acting here brings the film down significant notches, especially in the more climactic sequences.Furthermore, the downside of there being no likable characters makes it inevitably difficult to care what happens to anyone by the end of the film. While the element of distrust works wonders for the ability to resonate with characters in a film, it makes the outcome less impacting because you find yourself not rooting for anyone in the long run - not even an antihero but a series of unreliable, contemptible souls.The Loft takes an underrated territory that finds itself charted less and less in the current day and tries to invoke it with some sort of life and substance. While it succeeds aesthetically, it's disappointing on a character level and on an acting level as well. The efforts to get this film a release in America likely wasn't worth the laborious process and the agonizing wait for a release.Starring: James Marsden, Karl Urban, Wentworth Miller, Eric Stonestreet, Matthias Schoenaerts, Isabel Lucas, Rhona Mitra, and Rachael Taylor.",The Loft
11,KineticSeoul,A passable mystery thriller that doesn't have much thrills,6,25 June 2015,"This is one of those mystery movie that tries to go in a realistic tone but ends up being over the top and ridiculous. It's not a bad mystery thriller but isn't one of the really good ones either. It actually had my attention at least from beginning to end. Although I wasn't highly entertained or found this flick to be thrilling or impactful. But it has some hot girls and a decent but a bit of a far-fetched climax that makes it worth a watch with a couple of friends. The ending is pretty generic though and doesn't give off a lasting impression. As a matter of fact this is a mystery movie that will be forgotten in just few days. Overall it's a mystery thriller without much thrills, it's a who done it flick that is just passable.6/10",The Loft
12,Hellmant,"A pretty poorly made, and trashy, erotic thriller.",5,6 May 2015,"'THE LOFT': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An English language remake of the 2008 Belgian thriller, called 'LOFT', directed by Erik Van Looy (who also directed the remake). It tells the story of five married guys who share a loft together, to use for secret affairs, and then find the body of a dead woman in it. It was originally written by Bart De Pauw, and adapted by Wesley Strick. The film stars Karl Urban, James Marsden, Wentworth Miller, Eric Stonestreet, Matthias Schoenaerts (who also costarred in the original movie, playing the same part), Isabel Lucas, Rachel Taylor and Rhona Mitra. The movie is pretty slow paced, at first, but it does get a lot more involving, and interesting, towards the end. Still it's a pretty poorly made, and trashy, erotic thriller.Five good friends, who are all married, agree to share a penthouse loft together; where they can take their mistresses to have affairs. When they find a dead woman in the loft, that none of them claim to recognize, they all freak out. The men begin frantically questioning each other; of being involved in the grisly murder (since they're the only five people with keys to the premises). We begin to learn more and more details about their pasts, and the death of the woman, through flashbacks. The film took a long time for me to get really interested in; I'd even call it dull, at first; especially for an erotic thriller. I do like the cast though, and the ending does get really involving; in a really dark and disturbing way. It's just a little, too little, too late, though. The directing is mediocre, at best, and none of the characters are likable, or very believable. The women are hot in it though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/ke2k3oL5gSI",The Loft
13,Buddy-51,"Tolerable, though often overwrought, whodunit",5,22 August 2015,"A cautionary tale for all the would-be lotharios among us, ""The Loft"" features Karl Urban as a renowned architect who entices his four married buddies (Wentworth Miller, James Marsden, Eric Stonestreet, Mathias Schoenaerts) into becoming co-owners of a luxury high-rise condo where they can carry on their marital infidelities free from the prying eyes of their unsuspecting spouses. Trouble starts when, one fine morning, a beautiful young woman is found murdered there, killed possibly by an intruder but more likely by one of the five.Though the movie becomes a bit undisciplined and even overwrought over the course of its running time (and that includes some of the performances), ""The Loft"" scores as a fairly engaging and effective whodunit, one that manages to incorporate some relevant and timely reflections on how the over-privileged 1% spend their time and money. The surprise twist ending goes a long way towards mitigating some of the sturm-un-drang excesses that have come before it, though the denouement is a bit flat-footed and heavy-handed when it finally arrives. All in all, a mixed bag when it comes to storytelling and acting, ""The Loft"" is, nonetheless, good for a relaxing, two-hour-long escape - if you're in the market for that sort of thing, that is.",The Loft

15,bowmanblue,A hard film to like too much,7,10 July 2015,"I say that 'The Loft' is a hard film to like, but, in some ways, I did enjoy it. It was a decent enough thriller with a fair few twists and turns in it. However, what I felt let it down was the characters – nothing wrong with the acting; it was just that all the characters were just so fundamentally unlikeable.It's about five well-to-do men, who chip in and buy themselves a swanky 'loft' apartment. Nothing wrong with that, apart from the fact that the aim of this purchase is to have a pad that's away from their wives when they want to bring other women back late at night.However, their little 'love nest' takes on a more sinister ambiance when a naked woman is found naked and handcuffed to the bed. Now they must figure out which one of them did the deed and, if possible, how to cover it up. Therefore, we – the audience – are expected to root for a bunch of adulterous men who are hoping to cover up the death of an innocent woman in order to keep their infidelities from their wives.Then there's the flashbacks. Much of the story is told with the help of flashbacks, all of which designed to show the back story concerning the central characters and their possible motivations for doing – or not doing – the killer deed. Personally, I'm never a fan of flashbacks (I gave up on watching 'Lost' because of them) and long for the story to move on, rather than tell us information we can pretty much work out for ourselves. It just seems like too much padding.However, for all its faults, I did sit through it and I'd probably watch it again. As I briefly alluded to at the beginning of my review, there are some twists and turns that you probably won't see coming. I'd like to watch The Loft again and see if I can pick up on the clues a second time around. It's the type of film that's definitely more worth watching on TV (i.e. when you don't have to pay too much to watch it) if you're in the mood for a twisty little thriller. Just don't expect to care much about anyone involved. They should probably all be locked up really.",The Loft
16,dromasca,a confusing remake,5,14 August 2021,"'The Loft' could have been a special remake. Director Erik Van Looy crossed the ocean with the idea of his successful film 'Loft' made in Belgium in 2008 and directed the American version himself, which was released in 2014. I did not see the original film, but the IMDB reviews and user comments indicate that this is another Americanized adaptation that fails to reconstruct the qualities of the production that inspired it. The film looks like a combination of a Hitchcock-like 'whodunit' with an erotic thriller, not completely devoid of cinematic qualities, but without enough emotion and suspense to justify the crossing of the ocean.The starting point of the story is the same as in a few other European movies - a group of men, friends, all married in this case, lead libertine lives, sprinkled with extra-marital adventures. In this case, they buy a downtown apartment to bring here their casual relationships away from the eyes of the world and especially of their wives. Vice is to be paid for sooner or later, and the punishment appears in the form of the corpse of a murdered woman. As only the five of them know the secret of the apartment and as each of them has a key, the culprit is one of them. So we are in a version of the mysteries 'whodunit' in a closed room, like Agatha Christie, where everybody suspects everybody else, but the social ambiance is middle class plus and the setting is one of the large American cities.The police intrigue is quite complicated, and it is revealed to us through the police investigation, the discussions between the five men and the flashbacks all these trigger. This could have been quite interesting, but here is the main problem of this production, in my opinion. There are too many characters, and the cast and interpretations do not differentiate them in many cases. It may be that the fact that director Erik Van Looy knows his characters so well has been an obstacle in clarifying them for viewers. As the film looks, I lost interest in the story, and worse, was confused as I had the feeling that many characters have at least one double (the immoral husbands, their mistresses, their wives, the corrupt businessmen, etc.). 'The Loft' is well filmed, but despite the visual qualities it failed to engage or interest me.",The Loft

The Loft offers much suspense and it works what it is trying to accomplish. The characters are not too likable in a sense but it works out well, and the film would have a different story had the characters been slightly different. Filled with several clues along the way, the audience job is to watch and pay close attention and find out who the lead culprit of the crime is. This is a film which would be beneficial on several more viewers, as I am a little surprised by the low critics reviews. I had no expectations, and the film delivered more than what I was expected. One would advice not to watch the trailer before watching the film as there could be subtle clues and give-a-ways. ==================================================================== ====== After a rewatch (04/04/17') the Loft still stands up and is a great suspense thriller. Much criticism has to do with the lead characters of the five men being bad people, but if they were supposedly good and honest men, the film would not have worked as much. The point in them being lazy and despicable works in their favor.

20,eddie_baggins,B grade all the way. Stick to the original,4,14 December 2015,"A film you just wish someone like David Fincher tackled, The Loft is a B grade movie through and through and a movie that makes no illusions to what it is and Erik Van Looy's English language remake of his original foreign thriller of the same name is a movie that despite its quite obvious flaws and sometimes downright weird acting turns is an enjoyable guilty pleasure that for all sakes and purposes shouldn't be as watchable as it is.This above statement is by no means a glowing recommendation however, as The Loft is quite frequently a terrible movie that is saved by a plot line so unbelievable yet bewilderingly intriguing that you can't help but watch and try figure out who's done what, who's betrayed who and who can be a bigger bigot than the next guy. It's clear that this material was enough for Van Looy's original film to be well regarded and without having seen it, it was likely less sowed into B grade fodder than this long shelved Hollywood remake that was filmed in 2011 yet only released this year and perhaps the companies behind this redoing clued onto the films biggest flaw, the un-likability of EVERY single character in the film.This above statement is supposed to be taken literally as all jokes aside, The Loft just might well be the most terrible ensemble committed to screen in many moons. When reading through the name cast of Karl Urban, James Marsden and yes Modern Family's lovable blob Eric Stonestreet you may think this is a strange statement to make and the actors aren't movie ruining horrible (even though Prison Break's Wentworth Miller try's his hardest to be) but there characters sure are.How much can we really relate to a bunch of guys that get together to co-own a seedy city loft apartment where they're free to do anything to anyone at any time and when this crew of calculating derelicts share screen time the cringe factor goes up to almost unbearable levels and by the film's final act you'll soon come to realise that the films reveal isn't all it was cracked up to be from such a loaded plot driver.For all intents and purposes The Loft is a lot more entertaining than it has any right to be but that is almost entirely due to its mysterious lifeless body that puts our creepy bunch of males into a sticky predicament and take away that and concentration towards the films ""twist"", script and characters unearths a film that should be a whole new league of worse than it actually is.

21,jtindahouse,Effective thriller that achieves what it sets out to,8,8 March 2015,"From the opening moments of 'The Loft' you can guess pretty much exactly what you're in for. A ""whodunnit"" mystery with plentiful twists, where not everything is as it seems. Knowing that much doesn't hurt a film at all. In fact it makes the next couple of hours something to be very much looked forward to - or at least for me it does. You could say the format of the genre is lacking in originality, but you could rarely say two films are the same and anyone who says they saw the ending coming is almost always lying or exaggerating a fleeting suspicious they had. This is why I love mystery-thrillers.'The Loft' is a fun watch - nothing more, nothing less. It achieves exactly what it sets out to. The 5 lead actors were all pretty solid and gave credible performances. I think I will always see Eric Stonestreet as his brilliant character from 'Modern Family', so I struggled a bit at first to take him seriously in his role here, but he's good enough of an actor to get past that. The dialogue was tightly written and every detail that could otherwise have been questioned was covered well. The only fault I could find was the score sometimes drowning out the dialogue which can be annoying in a film like this where you are trying to catch every spoken detail. Altogether though a fine movie.",The Loft

I have to say that most of this 1.5 h or so film felt intriguing - the benchmark of events was thrilling, the leading performances were at least good (I found James Marsden and Wentworth Miller more versatile than others), but then a kind of over- sophistication started to prevail and their solutions did not seem realistic any more - in view of modern applications the police have today, or the doubtfulness of motives behind.

23,stevendbeard,Thriller With Good Twists,7,30 January 2015,"I saw ""The Loft"", starring Karl Urban-Bones in the new Star Trek movies, Xena:Warrior Princess_tv; James Marsden-Cyclops in the X-Men movies, The Notebook; Wentworth Miller-Resident Evil:Afterlife, Prison Break_tv; Eric Stonestreet-Modern Family_tv, Identity Thief and Rachael Taylor-666 Park Avenue_tv, Transformers.This is a pretty good thriller that is a remake of a 2008 Belgian movie, which was then remade in 2010 by the Dutch. Karl plays an architect that makes his best buddies an offer they find hard to resist. He gives each of them a special key to a penthouse loft-aka an apartment-that they may use anytime they feel the need for an extramarital affair or if they just want some quiet time away from their wife or boss. James is a psychiatrist, Wentworth is a shy and quiet one and Eric is a womanizing flirt. All are also married, but with different degrees of happiness. James and Wentworth resist, at first, but soon find a reason to use the loft. One day, Wentworth drops by and finds a dead body in the loft, so he calls everyone and they all put their heads together to figure out exactly what happened. The keys are electronic and need a master key to make a duplicate, which is under lock in Karl's safe-someone had to have gotten in with a key to commit the crime. Did anyone loose their key? Or lend it to someone? Did one or more of the wives discover what the boys are doing at the loft and seek some kind of revenge? Rachael plays a woman that James falls in love with, after meeting her at a party, and no, she is not the victim. It has a lot of good twists and turns in it and I really enjoyed it. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, sexual content-including nudity- and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes. I would buy this on Blu-Ray.",The Loft

One morning, a bloodied dead woman is found in the bedroom and the arguing and finger-pointing begins. This seemingly has all the ingredients for a great small-scale tension cranker, but ambition gets the best of it, it tries to go large, and the whole thing blows to bits on the launchpad. It's terribly acted, for one, which is something of a surprise given the healthy careers enjoyed by its stars. Karl Urban and James Marsden are well-seasoned, even if they aren't exactly leading men, and Eric Stonestreet - while miscast in a very adult role - should at least know how to carry himself on the screen. Instead it's amateur hour, where limp first-takes abound, and the finished product is something I would expect from a bit of Cinemax softcore, not a polished big-budget production. I don't care about, or even remotely like, a single one of the characters, the writing goes around in circles seeking every possible twist, and the ending really doesn't even make any sense.

25,drownnnsoda,Like a cheap Rubik's cube,5,3 February 2015,"""The Loft"" is a remake of a Belgian film, and focuses on five married men who go in on a ritzy high rise loft for the purposes of pursuing their affairs and sexual escapades. When a girl winds up dead in a pool of blood in the loft, the five men panic as they attempt to unravel who she is and where she came from.Taking some cues from Hitchcock (and not exactly with a fraction of Hitch's poise), ""The Loft"" is an overall entertaining film, but the script at times is the equivalent of a cheap Rubik's cube— it looks fine, it's a fun puzzle, I guess, but it's really just not that impressive overall.The film shifts between past and present, unraveling the narrative through flashbacks which are sandwiched between the current dilemma of the four men arguing in the loft over the corpse of the dead blonde. The pacing is a bit choppy, and the transitions rather abrupt. James Marsden and Wentworth Miller are among the film's greatest star power here, but the cast overall is really underwhelming, and the performances are at times borderline campy as the men play up their roles as buffoonish plutocratic mattress hounds.The finale cements my feelings of the film as an underwhelming thriller that seems more suited for television than the silver screen, but I still can't say it was totally not worth the time. In spite of the hammy performances, the disjointed narrative, and the overall sensibility of utter lifelessness that the film has, it is still by and large an entertaining flick. Nearly impossible to take seriously, but for entertainment's sake, it's passable. 5/10.",The Loft
26,davispittman,Thriller with a twist,7,17 January 2017,"The loft is a mind boggling thriller about five men who share a loft, where they will sometimes take women up there and cheat on their wives. One thing I'd like to say is that I got angry a lot throughout this movie just because of the animal like behavior of the sick men in this movie. There are like 2 characters in this movie that are clean and not adulterous, lying, cheating filthy people. Having that said, I liked the casting and I thought that every actor did their best to represent their role. James Marsden, Wentworth Miller, Karl urban, and Eric stonestreet all did a pretty good job. This thriller does have a somewhat surprising twist ending, which I always love and then just when you think you have everything all figured out, something else surprising occurs. I also don't think the movie was too short or too long, I think it had a suitable runtime. If you like entertaining mind boggling thrillers, then the loft is for you. It certainly could've been better, but I don't think it deserves all the hate that it's gotten. 7/10 for The Loft.",The Loft

I generally really like Karl Urban and I think he and James Marsden are often underrated in Hollywood but this was such a waste of them both. There's a murder, interchangeable blondes and a lot of overtly sexual conduct. Lower the production values and shuffle a couple things and shift the focus of the movie and it's basically your standard Lifetiime nonsense.Not worth your time.

Their arrangement seems to be working just fine until they discover a dead woman in the loft and the group must then figure out which one of them is a murderer. It's not a bad set-up, but the film is all clichés and has so many twists and turns that the story goes well beyond stretching credulity. The film was written by Wesley Strick, who has a couple good films under his belt with the ""Cape Fear"" remake and ""Final Analysis,"" although I believe those films were good based upon the strength of their directors, Martin Scorsese and Phil Joanou respectively. The film is actually a remake of a film out of Belgium and this film's director, Erik Van Looy, directed both. Overall, the film is slickly made, has a solid cast, but falls apart as a result of the weak script.",The Loft

I must say that the character development, the relationship focus and the story flow choice are done very well. The movie was able to take me guessing on each of the five characters and potential motives as revelations and surprises appear one by one. The twists and turns are done very much greatly though a very seasoned mystery crime viewer would have a good guess after all those subtle details thrown in. Even after what seems to be the biggest turning point and revelation this movie still nicely surprises with one final twist to the plot and then leave the audience with a hanging ending that keeps the question mark in the viewers' minds. The acting overall is a good one. I really like how Karl Urban, Scott Marsden, and Wentworth Miller handled their characters and managed the story's focus on and off their roles according to how the story emphasizes at times.",The Loft

The trailer looked intriguing to me, but the film is filled with repulsive characters (one is a coked-out rapist, another is a slimeball who makes it public that he wants to bang his ""friend""'s kid sister, another is a closet homosexual who secretly films his ""friend"" banging random girls in the loft - why would any of these people associate with each other in the first place?) and a screenplay with a new twist in nearly every scene, which merely becomes over complicated and far too confusing after the second twist. After that, I didn't even care who the killer was, or why.There is absolutely no structure to this film, it's not told in even remotely linear fashion, and the first scene gives away parts of the ending, making the climax partially predictable. Not even good in a turn-your-mind-off-and-enjoy-it type of way, just over-plotted and sleazy. And do any of these guys ever shave? Not every guy can pull off the five o'clock shadow look.Filmmakers tried for a deep and meaningful, profound closing scene, and failed miserably.",The Loft

Boasting good cast and decent drama thriller, the film has pretty interesting twists and turns. However, the use of multi-perspective in varied timelines is occasionally as messy as the portrayed adulterous acts.One woman is found dead in an apartment which turns out to be clandestine rendezvous point for five married men. The resulting roller-coaster ride takes the plot shifting constantly between past and present. It also chains together the individual story of each men, as well as their confessions with the police, resulting in many subplots. It's an ambitious undertaking, which the film is barely able to pull off.The film method of transition is choppy. Not to mention it needs to reveal important information just at the right time, so expect backtrack aplenty. With many characters to portray, the movie sometimes veers from the mystery and rehearses overly dramatic secret lovers or scheming friends premise. Fortunately, its layered narrative pays off with good plot twists along the way, even though the journey there can be exhausting.With good line up consisting Karl Urban, Wentworth Miller and James Marsden, the acting is decent. They do their best despite the characters beings sociopaths, pathological liars or immoral jerks at best. It's very hard to identify with them as they can be ridiculously conniving, near the level of obsession. Emotionally detached is an understatement.The Loft does have good cinematography and crisp design, so its visual matches the big screen, although somehow it reminds me of TV crime drama series. It offers a degree of entertainment with adequate suspense and thrill.A word to the wise: Best friends should never move in together, or share one apartment for promiscuous purpose.",The Loft
33,Screen_Blitz,Agonizingly dull and unpleasant experience,3,6 November 2015,"The Loft is a remake of the 2008 Dutch Belgian-language thriller Loft, starring James Marsden, Karl Urban, Wentworth Miller, Eric Stonestreet, and Matthias Schoenaerts as five married friends who rent out a high quality penthouse where they each secretly meet their lover and engage in their most desired sexual fantasies. Things quickly get ugly when they make a grisly discovery of a woman named Sarah (played by Isabel Lucas) gruesomely murdered in the bed in the penthouse. The five friends grow increasingly suspicious of each other and began questioning their friendships and loyalties as they struggle to solve the mystery behind this gruesome scene. The film partially follows the events leading up to the moment of the blonde woman's murder.The film introduces us with a truly captivating premise during its first ten minutes when Isabel Lucas's character is discovered naked, face down in a bloodbath. From there on out, the movie quickly drives straight off the mountain. The five main characters remain one-dimensional and dully written for the majority of the time, thus making it difficult to care for any of them. There are plenty of plot holes to keep viewers asking countless questions, and the plot itself never becomes interesting or inspiring. The film spends its time dragging through a story of ""who did it"" and it fails to come up with any real suspense and surprises. What it does instead it moves through an incoherent mess and leaves many things unanswered. There is much to say about the performances, but they certainly can't save this movie from the disaster it is.The Loft is was one of the worst movies I have seen this year and left me in sheer disappointment. If there is anyone I could possibly recommend this film to, it would the least demanding suspense- thriller that do not care about dull characters and a plot that makes very little sense.",The Loft

38,t-dooley-69-386916,Intrigue Aplenty in this stylish thriller from the US.,6,6 October 2015,"The plot of this thriller is pretty simple – on first glance that is. In that five friends – all of whom are married – all get together and buy a loft apartment. This is to be used as a 'passion pad' or any other term less 'poetically inspired', if you follow and here they can bring back partners for sexual congress and indulge their wildest fantasies – etc.Now all is well and good but then one of them arrives there and finds a woman handcuffed to the bed and dead. It is clear she did not do it herself and there are only five keys to the loft and only they all know the entry code. It is not long before they are all thinking the same thing – and that is one of them must know more than he is letting on.Now this is stylish and very well acted by all players. Nice to see Matthias Schoenaerts getting a break in a non European film, but this is hardly a stretch for him after the likes of 'Bullhead' or 'Rust and Bone'. The real attraction is that this seems to be fairly simple and then the Machiavellian twists start to turn up and it gets very interesting very quickly.It is a good watch and there is not a single lack lustre performance, but like so many films it trades on its twists, and as such will not be one that you will probably want to see more than once, and so a rental option, methinks, may be best, but it is still very much worth seeing - even if it is just the once.",The Loft
39,jrarichards,"Likeably unlikeable piece of slick cinema, with many a twist to its thriller story",8,30 August 2015,"""Loft"" is an effective, twist-filled, sting-in-the tail thriller with the worthwhile main message that ostensibly-normal (mostly also ""beautiful"") professional people capable of being ""pillars of society"" can get pretty unlikeable pretty quickly, most especially when they have the means, motive and opportunity to start playing dirty games. Indeed, this morality tale goes further in reminding us that, when we begin to remove any of those old-fashioned limiting factors in society and family that are designed to keep our base side in check, it is only a question of weeks or months before all the barriers go down and we are mired in sleaze to the point where only huge further doses of sleaze can suffice to keep the whole rickety ship afloat. Then the final sinking can only be a little further ahead on the journey. I say ""we"" here, because watching the main characters mess up, panic, then mess up yet more is an uncomfortably shareable experience which inner mutterings to the effect that: ""I don't live in a big American city and don't mix in such de luxe top-professional circles, so I'm OK, aren't I?"" fail to fully soften. Objectively, there seems no other obvious reason why to watch this convincing film - which is well done and superficially ""good-looking"", but in no way uplifting or inspiring or moving. But perhaps that reason is a more than good enough one. As a final thought, we can note how much more effective this cautionary tale (first made as a Belgian film in 2008) is, when pushed along by Karl Urban not being Bones McCoy and Eric Stonestreet not being Cameron Tucker!",The Loft

You have to look at the big picture, and if you do you'll see that the actions that led them to where they ended up doesn't make sense.Like I said it has some qualities to it but really in the end not a very good movie and I won't watch this again cause I know it still won't make any sense the second time.",The Loft

Well acted this time around, I mean I haven't seen the other 2 movies. I used a number to save space. The premise is good, five mutual friends use a loft to cheat discretely. For this version the execution leaves much to be desired. More morality play than erotic thriller. If the plot is the same for all 3 movies, then it's a great big bore and you're better off renting a video game if that's a thing anymore. I don't know, obviously.

The Loft is a twisting thriller that is never predictable. The film uses flashbacks to piece together the story. The set up is fast and the story is fast paced. Although a bit far fetched it's always entertaining as you try and figure out who is responsible for the death of the woman. The strong cast cast all put in good performances this despite the fact that it's hard to feel any sympathy with any of the main characters. The film builds up a great air of tension as the situation escalates towards it's conclusion.

44,dfa120374,A Mediocre Thriller,5,6 July 2015,"I never really fancied seeing The Loft because from what I saw on the trailers it didn't really look to be anything that good. It was my wife who wanted to see it, so I thought I'd give it a try, and I was quite surprised as it ended up being a decent enough thriller. I mean it wasn't anything spectacular, but it was worth watching.The story is quite basic on the surface...a group of married guys buy a loft apartment to use for their, shall we say, intimate adventures with other women, but when one of the men finds a woman dead handcuffed to the bed things start to go downhill quickly.Is it an amazing story? Not in the slightest, but what keeps it interesting are all the wee twists and turns the story has with the main one at the end. Is it a gripping story? No, but it still does enough to keep your interest.I'm also surprised to see other reviewers mention that the film was very slow paced as I didn't find that at all. It moves along at a steady enough pace without ever getting boring, so where the ""very slow movie"" part comes into it I'm not sure.The cast is pretty decent, and I'm glad to say that Wentworth Miller was at least MUCH better here than when I saw him last which was in Resident Evil: Afterlife. Even though his facial expression always stayed the same with that permanent frown (I think he's incapable of any other expression when acting in all honesty) at least his acting was better this time around. As for the characters they all play, well, apart from one or two, none are really all that likable, including the female roles, so you kind of end up not caring what happens to any of them.Anyway, The Loft does have it's moments, and overall it is a watchable thriller, but it's really nothing to get too excited about.",The Loft

I watched this with my brother and we spent the entire time guessing who could have done it? And giving out conspiracies as to who killed this woman. It kept you in suspense the entire time as it literally could have been anyone. The ending also did not disappoint.

The movie was just okay for me. There were a few intense moments as the men attempt to figure out what to do with a dead body so as not to ruin their perfect getaway. Each man had something worth hiding that could make them the suspect to the murder. It was fun at first watching them unravel, but their were too many twist and turns for me this time that I didn't really care for.Dude from Modern Family was my fav. He had Good comedic timing and his character was believable.In that since the movie makes a great attempt to find a well rounded room of cheating husbands. Karl Urban played the alpha male who saw nothing wrong with his womanizing. James Marsden plays Chris, a man who finds a woman that makes him think twice about his marriage. Chris has a brother Phill, who's trapped cause he married his wife for all the wrong reason. The Guy who plays Cam on Family Guy was just joking around until an opportunity came that allowed him to prove he still got it, and the guy from the show Prison Break Is just trying to be a good husband until temptation came knocking.So I'll give the movie that. It has some interesting characters whose worth goes beyond the actors playing them, but I'm so-so about how this thriller was laid out. Some of the twist and turns lost my interest.",The Loft

But when a young woman if found murdered on the property, and the only five keys belong to each of the five men, the suspicions turns on each other.Just when I thought I had a lucky escape from January with the movies that came out, so far February has been a hard month for me, not because of home problems or other such dramas, no it's just bad movies after bad movies that came out and bite me on the ass. The Loft is nothing different, it sucks like the month of January and February dose.Now let's talk about the good things in this movie: If you and your friends where drunk one night and you all want a good time destroying and movie this is the one.Now for the bad and these a lot of bad: Every character in this movie is A: Unlikable. or B: A peace of sh't to the human race, and I think it's both. Who got great actors here who in the past pulled off great performances, but in this movie they where truly awful in this movie. I bet right now they regret being in this movie, because this film makes them look bad has actors and character's.The writing has well is probably the worst I've seen so far this year. I mean my god nobody talks like this in real life. Aliens from out of space can write pretty dialogue than this if aliens ever came out in pace and joined a movie business.. if that ever happens. So overall the writing in this was pathetically bad and I hope the writers never write anything else after seeing this.The movie drags on and on as well. I couple of times I kept guessing that the movie will end here or here or here, until at one point I already checked out before it finally reached to the end, that's how bored I was. Now in this worse than Mortdecai or Fifty Shades of Abuse? I can say no, those two films to me are much worse-er than The Loft.

But the screenplay written for feature film becomes illogical as the film goes by.When nearly 3/4th of the film is done, it is clear that everything could have been out in the very first sequence if not the very first scene itself. The writer(s) just wanted to make it a thriller and hence did not disclose moments that would have been disclosed if the death of the woman happened in real life. While writing a thriller or a suspense drama one not only needs to know what to hold back and what not to, but also if that would make sense or not to the story.It's definitely worth a watch but doesn't live up to good writing.

52,Mehki_Girl,Just Awful - Let Me Count the Way....,1,2 January 2018,"All of the characters are sleezebags and/or stupid. The hooker with the heart of gold, the five cheating frenemies, the stupid, clingy, unhappy wives, the dumb sleezy pickup artist who was stupid enough to think some rich guy was going to leave his wife for her.Dumb, dumb, dumb...let me count the ways...1. You don't try to stage a dead body after 10 hours or so...there's something called lividity, which means the blood has pooled, so when you find a body lying on its back and you turn it over on its stomach, the coroner, unless, he or she is as stupid as you are, is going to figure out this dead body, which when it was alive supposedly committed suicide, didn't.2. See above. this also goes along with cutting it's wrist after the fact. The body was already dead, dummy, just leave it as it was. Don't cut it's wrists and hack it up. Again, forensics will determine the blood flow, that the heart wasn't pumping, that the blood is old, blood splatter, etc. Remember you are trying to make this a suicide - not a murder by a butcher who hung around to do more damage to a dead body long after the fact.3. She was dead and left a suicide note, why did you have to do anything with the body???4. If you are going to kill someone with an injection, don't do it in their arm, put a spot where the sun don't shine and hope a thorough examination doesn't find the injection spot.5. After moving a dead body after it's been dead for hour, sob all over it and leave your freaking DNA, skin, and haircells, why don't you . We already know your stupid. 6. How do you still have a key to a crime scene, where you and the actual murderer could get in? Wouldn't the cops change the locks and secure it would more than tape, confiscate the keys???7. A murderer decides to explain everything to a guy wearing a coat, has a cellphone and possibly a wire??? Really bad film-making and writing.8. Why trust a coke-head, out of control moron to cover up the crime? What did you expect a nut-job like him would do? Why didn't you recognize the problem after the fact either? Isn't one of you idiots supposed to be a doctor, haven't you watched The Forensic Files, Law & Order, any cop show??? Ever heard of DNA??? See #1 and 2 above9. You're all liars and cheaters, why would *any* of you trust the other guy???10. The character with the supposed moral compass (he's shtupping the hooker) is as sleazy as the rest of them. Please don't attempt to make it the good guy. He's cheating on his wife and kids. Really? Did he think he was just going to have a cup of coffee with a woman who told him she wasn't wearing a panties in public? He resisted her ""charms"" for, what, like 10 seconds?11. The hooker with the heart of gold...really?12. Is that ending supposed to be upbeat? Get her tested for STDs man. Millions of women in the world, you're bored with your wife, and you pick a hooker?13. Why aren't they all going on trial or in jail for obstruction of justice and abuse of a corpse, lying to the police, and any number of broken laws?Stupid writing, stupid direction, stupid acting. Bad, just really bad, so bad, I had to sign in just to write how bad.And everyone looked unshaven, greasy, smelly, and like they needed a good bath. How anyone wanted to sleep with any of them for money or not is beyond me. Ewww...",The Loft

I was looking for some horror movie and the title suggested one, but it turned out it was a thriller.I enjoyed this movie very much. The story is simple but full of suspense. The complexity of relationships between the five men and their wives gives a puzzling story. Add the lovers and some family issues and you have many 'potential' killers who can be blamed for the body in the loft.I must say that five guys did a great job. It is kinda funny to me that they made Wentworth Miller be a suspected hidden gay and that he was in love with his best friend.All in all, quite enjoyable. 8 from me.",The Loft
56,troyputland,An objective 'who done it' film with plenty of suspense.,8,29 July 2015,"The Loft didn't make it to the theatres in the UK. No surprise when it's a remake. Big surprise when you hear what names are attached to it. The film contains the highest level of suspense, which kick starts instantly. It's a game of guess who, keeping us in the backseat until the bitter end. Five married men share a penthouse loft, to cheat on their wives without their knowhow. They find a dead woman in the bed. They all suspect each other. The story unravels through flashbacks, but it's not a simple 'who done it' endeavour because they all have secrets to hide. The five friends aren't terrific people to relate to. It wouldn't be a huge loss if they all got their comeuppance. The acting keeps it ticking over, with Urban, Marsden and Miller standing out the most. The twist at the end isn't clear until it's staring us in the face. The Loft's objective, wanting us to make out own minds up. This should not be missed.",The Loft

Pretty girls too & without uncomfortable sex scenes & nudity. I believe this movie could've even been better somehow with the ending being played out differently. It felt so rushed at the end. It was too much information to process. Instead of it all rushing to a revealed conclusion by the one guy who taped everyone, why couldn't it of been revealed differently. Maybe someone finds a tape? I don't know but when he took everyone back & played the tapes it didn't work well for me because it was so rushed & my brain couldn't process it that fast.

59,trublu215,The first guilty pleasure of 2015,7,30 January 2015,"The Loft centers on five married men as they share a loft for their various extramarital affairs. But when a body is found in a pool of blood on the bed, the five friends must band together and figure out which one of them is the killer. Directed by Eric Von Looy, The Loft is a sleazy and, at times, incoherent mystery thriller that is paced very well and stands out as one of the first possible guilty pleasures of 2015. To start off, this is a movie that has very little substance, gives just enough to keep you interested and captivates you by making you ask yourself, just how ridiculous can this film get? The answer, very. But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it for what it is. Starring Karl Urban, James Marsden, Wentworth Miller, Mathias Schoenaerts, and Eric Stonestreet, the cast has very little to work with here in regards of a script but manage to pull off some decent performances considering the circumstances. The real standout here is Schoenaerts who plays the volatile Philip, younger brother to Marsden's Chris. While the rest of the cast seems to sleepwalk through roles each have played dozens of times, Schoenaerts' performance seems to be the strongest and most passionate. He makes for a very electrifying watch whenever he's on screen. The screenplay, adapted from the original Belgium film, also done by Looy, is a mess. It has terrible dialog, to which the actors actually make sound not half bad but when you break it down, it is nowhere near as strong as it should be. Another thing that is just as weak are the characters, while some are well rounded and thought provoking, some just seem like stand ins. When a film like The Loft comes around, characters should be the most important aspect of it. But, as it turns out, The Loft isn't as strong as it should be and it really hampers some of the better plot vehicles that are devised here. The direction from Looy is efficient and very well done in regards to delivering a Hitchcock inspired film like this, the angles are out of the box and that really makes for an intoxicating watch. While Looy may show his maverick style visually, conceptually, the film feels more on the level of a midnight feature which is probably where it will end up. Overall, The Loft isn't a bad way to spend a rainy day but for those looking for something more than your average thriller will walk away disappointed.",The Loft

62,CleveMan66,"""The Loft"" mixes Hitchcockian and European influences into a first class thriller.",8,8 February 2015,"Boys will be boys. And men will be dogs – all men. That seems to be the presumption in ""The Loft"" (R, 1:48). It's hard to find anyone to like when all the men are lusty louts, all their wives are killjoys and all the single women in the movie are whores – but the combination makes for a pretty nifty thriller. There may not be a lot to like in the characters, but there is a lot to like in this movie. One big reason for that is its unique combination of creative influences. The plot, the dialog and the camera work feel very Hitchcockian, as does the movie poster, which brings to mind the poster for 1958's ""Vertigo"". In fact, the entire film feels fresh and creative, thanks to its European roots. This is the American version of the 2008 Dutch-Belgian film of the same title (the highest grossing Flemish film in history) and with the same director (Erik Van Looy) at the helm. The result is a film that functions like a breath of fresh air, even while we feel somewhat claustrophobic as the walls close in on the main characters.At the opening of a new building designed by up-and-coming architect Vincent Stevens (Karl Urban), we learn that Vince has reserved a prime loft apartment as a safe zone for the extramarital activities of himself and his other four married friends. Besides our amoral instigator, we get to know the quiet and indecipherable Luke (Wentworth Miller), the lusty alcoholic and sometime comic relief Marty (Eric Stonestreet), the unhappy but smart and sometimes honorable Chris (James Marsden) and Chris' volatile half-brother Philip (Matthias Schoenaerts, who is reprising his role from the 2008 version). Each of these five guys treats his female conquests like pieces of meat (see what I did there?) and his wife like a literal ball and chain. For their part, each of the wives manages to live down to her husband's expectations, which doesn't excuse the men cheating, but keeps us from hating them completely. Soon we're completely caught up in the unraveling mystery of something that went terribly wrong in that loft.After about a year of unencumbered sexual adventures, Luke comes up to the loft one morning to restock the bar and he sees the naked body of a woman lying lifeless on her stomach, with one of her wrists slashed and the other handcuffed to the bed. Luke calls his partners in deception to the loft. When they all arrive, there are accusations and recriminations aplenty. There are only five keys to the loft and only these five guys know the door's security code, so the assumption is that one of them must be responsible for the horror scene on the far end of the loft. As the conversation and the action progresses in the loft that morning, the background of the story is told through flashbacks and the results through flash-forwards of the interrogation of the five men at the police station. As the story unfolds, as we would want in any good thriller, the red herrings emerge, the surprise reveals shock and the twists, well thrill.""The Loft"" meets every expectation and even exceeds them. The opening scene of someone falling from the loft onto a car parked on the street below pulls you in and gives only the slightest clue of what is to come. The close-ups and unsettling (but effective) composition of the camera shots during the police interrogation makes the movie both intimate and appropriately uncomfortable. The scenes in the loft as the guys try to figure out what happened and what to do next has all the drama of a good stage play. The flashbacks are easy to follow and carry with them the intrigue of peeling back the layers of that proverbial onion. What all this adds up to is three different time frames, skillfully woven together, each with a different tone and coming together in an unpredictable and satisfying resolution. For telling an engaging story, daring to do it creatively and being so effective at bringing together all its disparate story lines and points of view, this film reaches the lofty level of an ""A-"".",The Loft
63,stephendaxter,A very disappointing mystery thriller without the mystery or the thrill,2,22 February 2015,"If you ever want to know how to make a well directed and well acted mystery thriller without the good directing, acting and absence of mystery and thrill then study this film. How this director managed to take a very interesting premise and create something so dreadfully boring completely baffles me. Firstly, the structure of this film just made no sense whatsoever, it jumps back and forth from the past, present and future in an attempt to slowly reveal the mystery, but 90% of the time these flashbacks were so boring because you had no idea how they were related to the mystery until the very end. The overall directing of this film was so poorly done that there was no sense of thrill or interest in what was happening, meaning you could not at all care about the mystery that is supposed to be carrying the film. When you do finally get some sort of reveal as to what is going on, it is supposed to shock the audience, but even though i did not see it coming, it had absolutely no effect on me at all; i just thought about how dumb it was and how it made most of the film make even less sense. THEN the multiple utterly stupid twists that occur within the last 15 minutes are just desperate attempts to continue 'shocking' the audience. But rather than making the audience realise things that they didn't notice before it just completely confused everyone, because the flashbacks are supposed to provide clues that make you question things that then get answered / revealed in the end but no-one was questioning anything because they didn't know why the flashbacks were relevant. You may hope that the performances save the film seeing as though there are actors who were great in some of their previous roles in movies and TV shows, but nope, they are all just atrocious. I want to believe that it has to do with the writing of the characters because all of your main cast sucked. Almost all of their lines seemed forced and cliché and that just took you out of the film. I did like Rachael Taylor in the film i thought she stood out over everyone else so whenever she was in frame i could stay awake, also Karl Urban had a couple of OK moments but not enough to redeem himself for the rest of the film. This film was a complete and utter disappointment in terms of the plot and performances, now i have to check out the original 2008 version and see if this movie converted crap into more crap or ruined a good original idea. - 2.4",The Loft
64,lnvicta,Convoluted mess of an erotic thriller,3,3 May 2015,"The only reason I knew this movie existed is because I was looking up what Eric Stonestreet had done aside from Modern Family, so I decided to give this a shot. The premise of the movie is the best part about it: Five guys have the keys to a secret loft where they can freely cheat on their wives, but one day they find a dead girl on the bed and have to figure out who did it. To this movie's credit, the first half is engaging and curious. They develop some shady history between the guys and show how the loft came to be, but as pieces of the puzzle start coming together and the more answers we get, the more the movie suffers. I mean I've seen botched premises before but The Loft takes it to a new low.The five leads in this movie do what they can. They are likable actors and they have some moments of conviction here and there, but the script is so horrendous it's astonishing that they can keep a straight face delivering these lines. Wentworth Miller is the weak link, and I don't know if it's his fault or his character just being really weird and uncomfortable but that's another thing: you don't like any of these characters. They're all despicable, cheating, lying, douchebags that are only friends because they all have those sh*tty traits in common. And I use the term ""friends"" loosely because these guys seem to hate each other as much as the audience does. Half the time they're yelling and arguing at each other, the other half they're just dull and plodding along with the script. It's sad because you want to like these guys but they really are just sociopathic dickheads. Honestly the only one with a conscious is James Marsden's character but even then still he's a deceiving slimeball. However the cokehead brother completely embraces the psychosis angle and gives a very nice standout performance considering the material he was given.The women in this movie are horrendous. There is not one memorable female character - they're all either stupid and married to these guys or stupid and f*cking them behind their wives' backs. It's hard to care about a movie where every character is totally unlikable. Like I said, the first half of the movie is very promising. The pacing was appropriate, it was easy to follow what was going on, it gave you time to become invested in the mystery, then all of a sudden things get crazy. Like unbelievable, ridiculous, stupid levels of crazy. First of all there are like six endings to the movie; it goes on for a good 10-20 more minutes than it should, and the worst part is that each ""ending"" is worse than the last. They try over-explaining what happened and it ends up getting so twisted and convoluted that it collapses onto itself. At a point you just stop caring about who did what - you just want the damn movie to end. The entire third act is a disaster in every conceivable way.This movie was watchable, mainly because of the cast, but the ending is so frustrating I had to give it a low score. I really tried to like it, it's just hard to care about a movie when you're just watching a bunch of stupid people do stupid things. And the police interrogation scenes were atrocious. If you don't care about plot and just want to see a bunch of good looking people act like complete jerks for an hour and a half, you can get a kick out of The Loft. If you want a thrilling murder mystery that makes you think, stay far far away - The Loft does not deliver.",The Loft

66,rprince-832-6294,"Like Clue, but less funny",6,27 February 2015,"-The Loft (2015) movie review: -The Loft is a mystery suspense film about a group of guys who have this loft where they can pretty much keep things from their wives. However, when an unknown woman is killed, they struggle to discover who did it. It has more depth than that, but I think that's probably a good quick summary.-The Loft is like Clue, but less funny. And less good.-So the story was pretty interesting, and I enjoyed these guys, who are not good guys because they are all cheating on their wives, undergo the pressure of having a murder take place and implicate them.-The pace was fine. It was not a fast paced film, but it kept me interested.-The acting was passable Karl Urban and Cyclops from X-Men did a fine job, but not anything special. Everyone else did about the same.-The characters are ALL dislikable, making the result of the film either really satisfying or not interesting at all. I'll let you decide.-The music was way too intense for this film. It was good, but like Taken 3, did not match.-I guess the biggest problem with the film is that nothing is motivated, and therefore none of the twists and turns carry much shock or value. That said, it was still somewhat entertaining.-The Loft is rated-R and has a mild-to-medium amount of language, some vague sexual content, some brief violence, and some brief partial nudity. (AKA: Karl Urban's butt) -The Loft is a less motivated, less fun version of Clue, but is compelling and interesting. I will say that even though it is not that good, it would be worth watching on Netflix.",The Loft
67,bravesfanc,Trying to hard for cheap twists,4,30 May 2015,"This movie was shot back in 2011 but wasn't released until this past year. That usually isn't a good omen for a movie but the premise intrigued me so I gave it a shot. Needless to say I should've skipped it.The plot is simple, a group of 5 men share a loft so they can cheat on their wives and do whatever else they want to. The only rules are 1. No one else but the 5 can know and 2. They must tell the others when the loft is in use so to not have an accidental meet up. Right from the beginning the dilemma occurs as one of the men show up to the loft to find a dead girl lying in bed. From there all 5 men show up and the movie takes off.Throughout the movie we are switched between the past and how the loft became to be, and the present in which the five of them try to figure out who did this and why. The biggest problem however, is that none of these five characters are likable. They all cheat and lie to their wives and to each other. The wives and the mistresses aren't likable either, so when we go back in time it's not interesting.When we do finally find out everything, the first twist was good and I thought that this wasn't such a waste of time. But it wasn't finished and they added another twist, which just added to the disappointment. The overall idea was good but the execution wasn't there. 4/10",The Loft
68,JamesRutland,"If not for the ending, 10 stars",5,9 March 2021,"It's an amazing story well portrayed by actors and directing, but the ending. The ending forcibly tends to surprise the viewer, when the architecture of the whole plan is well structured by one of the characters. Despite his accuracy, he is easy overwhelmed because of his emotionality for no apparent reasons, when he faces his mate in the last scene, so to get that exact epilogue. The movie ends without any possibility of redemption for the real victims of the intrigues perpetrated by cynical men: the women they used and betrayed as puppets. In my opinion, would have been preferable an epilogue where both the main involved mates and the viewer itself understand the truth by any circumstance like a clue, or an evidence, or the plan devised in the mind of its creator, showing the real nature of the deception with the aim his mates were stuck to their responsibilities to understand the consequences and the suffering of any deception they made.",The Loft

Almost everything about this quirky, old-style thriller is overdone - especially the music, which is excellent, symphonic, and hilariously brash, booming and thundering through every scene.The respectable ensemble cast chew enthusiastically on the scenery while barking out overwritten, melodramatic dialogue and simultaneously maintaining straight faces throughout. No mean feat.The superb, classy, and heavily stylised lighting is a master class in noir-esque cinematography, unsubtly complimented with intensely over-the-top rain effects.Nothing about this film is subtle or underplayed.

I wish he wouldn't have taken on the role. There is a reason why it was released recently after finished several years earlier. It's just not good.It's a B level movie at best. All the actors and actresses look like from those runoff audition agencies. The customs, setting, and make up said the same. It is remade from the same Belgian movie which was a big box hit that year. It is directed by the same director, Erik Van Looy. I wonder why he did such a lesser work. The script is unimpressive and raw. The sexual contents are somehow cheap and inarticulate. The storyline is over-plotting. It would look much better if they would put more efforts into details. Good movies come from good scripts and storylines. This one is short of both. Maybe that is why it couldn't attract good actors and actresses.There are no shortage of successes of remaking foreign movies into Oscar winning masterpieces like ""The girl with the dragon tattoo"", ""The Departed"" just named of few.

Was it someone from outside the group? Hmmmm..Hey, we have a mystery, and a good one at that. I thought I had it figured out, butYes, there is some sex in here, but nothing erotic. Nudity is of a male backside. We see the 5-friends accuse each other and no one claims anything. The keys cannot be duplicated without the code, and the alarm was shut off and this tells all of them that the killer was someone among them (where is Columbo when you need him?). The police eventually get all five and try to break them down. Those interrogations are pretty good.This gets somewhat complicated, as once again, we are led down paths that lead nowhere or do they? Hmmm.. And to catch us up on everything we are treated to flashbacks of the 5-friends with and without their wives.before the murder, of course. Was it one of the wives who found out about the Loft? HmmmOf course there is a twist, but it doesn't answer everything. It starts with Luke making an announcement. No, not that, something else.The music is good and quite compelling at times and this also helped quicken the pacing which was also supposed to instill tension and suspense. Sadly, it didn't. We saw concern on the faces of the five, but did we care? No. I was shocked to learn who did it. Maybe you will be too. Okay, maybe not. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, but nothing erotic. Nudity: A male backside. Bloody Gore: Yes. Sexual innuendo Yes. Language: Yes, not much though.",The Loft
75,DBLurker,"A box office flop, especially with critics, and yet..",8,5 July 2017,".. a movie that's far more entertaining than most of the crap produced these days.Really nice acting, cringe-worthy characters (in a good way) played by talented & believable actors with a nice suspenseful/thrilling plot. I honestly thought I would hate it when I started watching it on BluRay, but wow, I sat through it all without even taking a bathroom break. Not going to spoil anything, except for the fact that this movie is another reason why the so called ""critics"" should not be listened to.Oh and watch it with your wife for the best experience.",The Loft
76,Eric266,A Fantastic Little Thriller,8,19 July 2018,"I really enjoyed this movie. The cast is excellent, the plot keeps you guessing and there are several twists in the film that neither the characters nor the audience see coming.Five lifelong friends, Vincent (Karl Urban), Chris (James Marsden), Luke (Wentworth MIller),Marty (Eric Stonestreet) and Phillip (Matthias Schoenarrts) share a secret loft for cheating on their wives. One morning, there is a dead blond covered in blood on the bed in the loft. The five friends all start accusing each other. The story then flashes back to the weeks leading up to the crime and gives you plenty of reasons to suspect any or all of them. Vincent is an architect who tried to leverage a political leader. Chris is cheating on his very scary wife (Rhona Mitra) with an emotionally unavailable woman, Anne (a gorgeous Rachel Taylor). Luke might have feelings for Vincent that go beyond friendship. Marty is a loudmouth, obnoxious drunk. Phillip is a sadistic druggie.The cast does a fantastic job of playing these successful, but very flawed men. Each one could have conceivably killed the girl. The plot gets thrilling when each man starts blaming the other while trying to defend who he is not the killer. The simplest thing would be to just call the cops and let them sort it out, but then the wives would find out about the loft and all five men might be accessories to murder.The reveal of the killer(s) and the resolution were top-notch in my opinion. Even after finding out ""who done it"" the characters still make stupid, but very human decisions. That's what I loved about the film. The killer(s) identity doesn't end the suspense.My only issue with the film is the short attention paid to the female characters. The wives are one-dimensional and are just there to provide someone for their husband's to cheat on (ex. Rhona Mitra just glares at her husband in every scene. She has made a career out of glaring, but she's still lovely to look at). The other two female characters of Anne and Sarah (Isabel Lucas) are underwritten and poorly utilized (and one of them is the poor soul on the bed).. These characters could have been fleshed out better so they were more integral and integrated into the plot. As it is, they just feel kind of tossed in.I'm sure there is a backstory as to why the studio put this movie on the shelf for almost 3 years. It was filmed in 2011 and not released until 2014. I'd love to hear why. Its a neat little thriller and has enough suspense to keep you guessing. The actors/actresses give it their all and the ending(s) catch you off-guard.",The Loft

This little baby will keep you on the edge of your seat right up until the final reveal. It's got all the ingredients of a classy thriller so I'm baffled by all the low scores...what on earth did they want? The Loft is well directed, well acted and certainly well above your average film in this genre.

It's basically 5 married friends who share a loft. The way it works is the all have a single key and text one another when they need to use it. A mysterious prostitute shows up throughout the movie, and it confuses the viewer a bit. Is she with James Marsden or his friend the overweight sloppy drunk? Even the rich building owner may have something to do with this prostitute. The jumps in the timeline are a bit confusing. You have to watch it until the very end to get the main plot.

82,xcitenlady,"The Laugh, oops I mean The Loft",5,31 January 2015,"This movie was somewhat predictable, it ropes you in with several different themes of other movies mixed in this one (the Hangover, Very Pretty Things and Judgment Day and even The Affair""). It tries very hard to keep the suspense and does it to an extent but almost does in a high school writing project way. The acting is horrible. I thought Wentworth Miller had good acting expressions but the acting left a lot to be desired. We never get why one of the wives, never wanted to participate or mingle and she always watched as if she was the one and she could be. I question why in an expensive building like this why wouldn't they check the tapes of building, why wouldn't the police? where was the landlord? police never question them on who was in and out? Where was that secret room that only Luke (Miller) knew of? I think this writer tried to create mystery but by leaving what you think to result in mystery...well I am left scratching my head. I love a good mystery where I come out saying ""wow, what a twist?"" This movie was a let down.Fatso in the movies was the most predictable with his script. Hollywood loves the weight challenged people in comedic roles, he was funny and fat. So many whys and so many holes, but maybe more is left out intentionally because it surely ended like the wives are up to something or may have something to add to this movie....and then the last scene..""let's go and have coffee somewhere??""

Can't put my finger on what went wrong...Great cast, but the friends dynamic just all seemed entirely odd and unrelatable. It's almost as if they've been thrown in a room together and have nothing in common. So perhaps badly written characters.One of them is a violent crack head, the other cool calm and collected, the other is a Don Juan, the other looks like a creep and the last guy seems like he belongs in a chocolate factory.Just odd characters.Also really predictable half way through the film.

84,blankenshipdk,No Love Loft,5,21 July 2016,"Initially, this film appeared to fall under the definition of "" L. O. P. "" or least objectionable programming, a term that once applied to a minimally annoying cable feature one might discover in the course of late night channel surfing, which ironically, generally involved the lure of the lewd. While there's minimal gratuitous sex and violence contained, the story manages to be a completely salacious tale of dirt balls and scuzbuckets engaged in a total sleaze fest nonetheless. Karl Urban as Vince heads up the seamy crew as the main skeeze who covertly engages in getting his ashes hauled by the wives, girlfriends and sisters of his alleged friends who in turn demonstrate their strong sense of ethical fair play by framing him for a murder that they actually committed. With fiends like this, who needs enemies or even a key to the titular den of iniquity. Plot holes big enough to drive a Safari station wagon through only add to the cinematic malaise. Lots of whoring, lying, double dealing, voyeurism, cheating, drinking and sordid shenanigans by all the characters although they display some negative qualities as well. Everything is neatly wrapped up in the scurrilous, but consistent finale when Rachael Taylor as Anne the lovable strumpet, love interest of James Marsden as Chris, appears to rekindle their passion, wife and kids be damned.

However, I'm not sure it deserves the one and two star ratings that it is getting.All in all, the film is not good. The generic title lends itself to a very generic film about five very cliché characters that really aren't explored in any depth. Because of these wafer thin character developments, it's so difficult to feel any sort of connection with their story and even more difficult to feel any suspense when the film is encouraging you to.The film is very clumsy in it's storytelling. The jumping of time periods from past/present/future only becomes apparent right at the end of the film and the last 20 minutes seems very detached from the rest of the story. It's as if that they arrived at a natural ending but then deemed it necessary to bolt on another plot twist just to elongate the film, but it didn't work for me.All that said, the film didn't bore me and I never considered turning it off. On a very, very basic level at least, it is fairly entertaining with a couple of half interesting plot twists. It's just a very bargain basement, generic whodunnit. You will have seen several films of the same genre that are much better, much more sophisticated and much more entertaining.",The Loft
86,SushiStoner103,A Big Game Of Cluedo,6,21 February 2015,"The Loft is a murder mystery, directed by Erik Van Looy who also happened to direct the original Belgium film (loft) 2008. This remake follows the same story of five uncommitted husbands who struggle to sustain a relationship and to keep it in their pants. They are conveniently given access to a secret love dungeon where they can seek their mistresses and cheat on their wives. Shortly after somebody is ""murdered"" in the loft, the five begin to suspect each other and from there on the over complex CSI episode arises. Ill start off praising the positives, since the film did have potential. The cinematography is miraculous. The unique sense of direction makes every shot look great. The script is somewhat lethargic but thankfully the ""majority"" of the cast pull it off. Each character was evenly distributed and explored, creating fairly interesting protagonists and slight emotional attachment. The score raised tension when necessary and kept me guessing on the edge of my seat. But after the 100th twist, the suspense and fascination quickly dissolved. The loft has simply out smarted itself, a simple, yet at times intriguing plot desperately seeks for every twist and turn it can find and uses them, I don't even think M. Night Shyamalan could've handled it. Things started to drag and seem all over the place. It is one big puzzle with one too many pieces. Overall a fun, entertaining sexual thriller.

My extremely low expectations probably helped, but it's definitely an alright movie. I was engaged throughout.Sure, the acting and dialogue at times are bad, but overall the mystery and (most) twists hold up on their own.I think if Eric Stonestreet's character and his wife in the movie were given different dialogue (or even omitted all together from the movie), it could have made the entire experience much better.

It turned out not to be what I thought it was going to be at all and I'm glad I watched it. This is a very clever Whodunnit with subtle misdirection, few absolutes, and no clear heroes or villains. It deftly illustrates the shades of gray within morality. I would've thought the writer or director was a woman scorned, because it shined a harsh light of truth on the natures of a varied spectrum of married male personality types, their passive aggressive anger, their repressed hostility and the ways in which some of these types justified different levels of betrayal against and abuses of, the women in their lives.

There is one serious problem with painting everyone in a movie with a despicable side - you end up, not caring one whit what is happening and don't really care about the ending. By 1 hour into the movie I was already clock watching, hoping they would get a move on and finish it. Therein lies the problem, much has been said of the flashbacks in time, and why they were put there. Yes, I can kind of see the reason, but the movie was still way too long. It wasn't suspenseful, it wasn't a thriller, it wasn't clever, it wasn't surprising, it wasn't anything really. The wives, you couldn't care about, the husbands were a joke. The music score was way over the top. And generally the movie was as some people have said, like a crazy mishmash of previous films and ideas ,all rolled into one boring movie. Perhaps the original movie is better, but having seen this I wouldn't look out for it, to sum up, if you have an IQ of 80-100 you might be impressed, for anyone with half a brain working - you will leave feeling cheated.

114,rinzler-16487,Fantastic mystery thriller; good psychological element to boot,9,31 October 2015,"To be honest, I wasn't expecting there to be a whole lot of depth to this movie. Judging by the trailer, it seemed to be a sort of Hollywood ""one-off""; an interesting concept, but not much to back it up.I was quite pleasantly surprised. Before speaking to the meat of the film, I'll just mention how great the stylistic approach was. It would have been incredibly easy for this movie to turn into a silly sort of presumptuous art piece, but it pulled off its style extremely well.While it did have a great mystery-theme core, what held it back from a 10 was its plot twists. Now that's not to say they weren't good, they were actually some of the best parts of the movie. The problem is, there were almost no ""a-ha!"" moments. The twists made enough sense to follow, sure, but things usually didn't (especially towards the end) just come together nicely. Some moments towards the end also lacked build-up, which would've made their payoff the shining point of the movie.Instead, the highlight seemed to be the psychological element of the movie's mystery-thriller theme. Unfortunately I can't say too much without entering spoiler territory, but the personalities and different psyches of the main characters, and the way they play out over the course of the film, are what really makes The Loft interesting, and worth remembering.",The Loft

This movie has a lot of twists. The acting was great. It's about five married guys who rent the loft for their affairs. There is sexual nudity, violence, and drugs. If you like who dun it movies, this is for you.This is a great thriller, with lots of twists. We don't understand the bad reviews.

For their sake, I was really hoping they weren't, and I'm glad I was proved right. Because this is the most cringe-inducing dialog I've ever seen. The dialog from this movie seems to have come from two places: bad self-help manuals, and the worst-of-the-worst ""Letters To The Editor"" at Penthouse magazine. I literally could not believe what I was hearing. I thought this might be a spoof of other erotic thrillers. I mean, these are mostly good actors who've worked on high-profile projects. Couldn't they have offered up some input at some point, and politely said to the director/screenwriters, ""Hey listen, I'm really sorry guys, but people in America really don't say things like this to each other?"" YIKES.",The Loft

Well, critics seem to eat too much fast food and not enough Belgian French haute cuisine. Shame on them. THere are of course some plot twists ... Do you know a thriller where that is not the case? I don't, but the critics and rotten tomatoes seem to know better. I saw the first picture in Belgium at the start. I saw the second one at the start. I still like the plot a lot. Although I knew it by heart in the meantime. But, hey, a good story doesn't age, does it? So no problem there. I can only say and repeat it really is a picture worth looking at in the theatre near you :-)",The Loft
121,NonkelJulien,Silly but entertaining puzzle,7,17 October 2014,"Having seen the original movie 'Loft' by Erik Van Looy (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926762/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), I was hoping for a fresh take. But a fresh take is obviously not why they hired the same Van Looy to direct this version. This is essentially the same movie, just without subtitles.In short, the building blocks of 'The Loft' are a set of plot twists. They are mostly silly, suffering from a few red herrings that hurt the story's credibility, but it's still entertaining to watch them unfold. Largely because the movie flows well for the most part, with only a few dull moments in the first half.Although I preferred the exterior design of the original loft, the overall cinematography of 'The Loft' feels a little warmer and more comfortable. Only a little though, because the characters in it are stone cold. James Marsden is the warmest character in the frame, but like everybody else he doesn't get enough to work with to make for a convincing character that the audience can identify with. The characters are The Loft's biggest flaw (as they were in the original), which is especially disappointing since making you care about characters has often been a strong and successful focus in Bart de Pauw's earlier scripts. There are just too many of them, and as a consequence most of the dialog in the back story scenes is expositional and feels awkward. There's never an opportunity for development. The characters are just there to lead you from one twist to the next.The overall acting suffers as a result. Strangely I felt that Rhona Mitra, with barely any screen time, delivers one of the better performances, with obvious anger below her coldness, yet just enough restrain. Wentworth Miller does what he does best. He doesn't seem to care much, but still feels like a good fit, even with the little information we get for his character. Matthias Schoenaerts' presence is undeniable. But as a guy who seems to be on edge pretty much all the time, his marriage seems plainly unlikely, and his past couldn't be revealed more clumsily. Still, he's a welcome contrast to the otherwise held back main cast. It's a pity that he was clearly suffering from sickness or fatigue in a few scenes, where it's blatantly obvious how much he had to strain his voice. It's arguably suiting his character, but it's still distracting.The concept of this story lends itself to a much darker movie, and this just feels like a missed opportunity. I can't help but wonder how this would've worked as a film noir. You have five characters that could easily be despicable and instantly more interesting, and the women couldn't be more fatale. Of course, film noir doesn't sell anymore, so instead we get a bright and shiny thriller that doesn't thrill, that keeps you guessing, but doesn't make you ask questions. It deals with edgy themes, but it barely skims them and focuses on polish instead.7/10. It's definitely an enjoyable watch, but only for people who're into the whole whodunit thing. Not if you're looking for anything more. It's successful at what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything else, but I can't help but sense the potential for something more.",The Loft

123,koltira,Unbelievably revolting.,1,30 May 2015,"I have never seen a film as sexist and revolting as The Loft. The wives barely exist: they have almost no personality, no life except when their husbands are involved, and the same goes for any other female character, the luckiest of them being Anne who gets a little more than 5 lines. On the other hand, we get to know the five husbands very well: their personalities, qualities and flaws, their backstories (one of them being amazingly used as a rape apology because yes, there's rape and abuse in this film and no one seem to really care because ""You can't rape a whore""). Besides all that (which is already very much), the plot doesn't work one bit as we jump from one plot hole to another, and even the actors seem to wonder why they're here since their acting is hopelessly bad. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you're a rich white American man cheating on his wife who might enjoy the myriads of sexist jokes.",The Loft

It tries to be unpredictable but is not. I wouldn't even bother watching it. Sadly, the only actor that they cast correctly was James Marsden. Otherwise, it made the classic ""Jersey Shore"" type character look bad. The cast was mainly Caucasian the acting was bad with the exception of James Marsden, Rachael Taylor, and Isabel Lucas. I believe that most likely the other actors are bad actors, it's more due to the fact that the writing is awful. It has a Twilight-esque feel, writing style which creates pathetic characters who portray mental illness badly and this would have been better if it had been a comedy.",The Loft

American people are just not ready for this kind of movies and I'm pretty sure that this is what we see in the overall rating. The girls in the movie are as real as can be in real live, as this is what the movie stands for. We really don't need hotter chicks, let's keep the characters believable as it is in this movie.

Some parts of the movie didn't make sense at all and were to much...i mean too much predictable. The chemistry between the 5 friends is without complicity and just bad. James Marsden is a good actor and does is role with felling, what happened to Wentworth Miller???man i liked him in prison break but here i understand why he doesn't have job and is not in more TV shows or movies. Trying to resume ...the storyline gets confusing predictable and childish, i really cant give more than 2 out of 10 for a movie that actually had a good script idea but everything was all over the place, the screenplay just blew it with lots of mistakes along the way.

I have not seen the original one so I can't really compare but as I read the original one has the same script but this American remake is much more loaded. I was really moved by the atmosphere in the movie, starting at a party where you see the main actors discussing there naughty hidden life and sharing a key of a beautiful loft.

It's based, not on Wilder's 1960 ""The Apartment,"" but on Michael Gordon's 1962 Hollywood ""Boy's Night Out"" with Kim Novak and James Garner. The only difference is the thriller twist that caters to our current violent society. In the ""Boy's night Out"" four friends get together to rent an apartment where they can engage in illicit affairs. Kim Novak's character, a graduate student, plays them, however, as evidence for her thesis on psychology. The four men end up not having an affair with her but the lie to each other about it when they really engage in activities that are really their hobbies: cooking, plumbing, etc. She ends up marrying James Garner's character who is the only one that is single.",The Loft

I don't know what went wrong but I was bored to death.The plot had such great potential. I felt like the movie was so choppy in places. It switched from past to present in a way that I had to really think about what tense I was in.I had a free certificate that I used to see this movie, so at least I didn't waste my money...but I sure did waste an hour and a half.

It can be a bit confusing jumping around from past and present but that adds to the mystery. Its a smart movie and we don't get those that often. Performances are good- most actors seemed to be a bit out of their typical roles. Wentworth Miller was very different from Prison Break and its nice to see Karl Urban break away from SciFi/Fantasy franchises. Eric Stonestreet was very different from his TV role and James Mardsen showed the conflict of someone going against their norm. Also, it was nice to have a movie this length- not so long its hard to stand up when the film is done. Its a shame the studio didn't really back it and do any advertising. I never saw a TV spot- just a preview. They also kept pushing back the release date. Its a shame this one will just probably fade into DVD obscurity because its good and entertaining.",The Loft

The entire theater groaned through the ""tense"" scenes, we laughed collectively at the shoddy camera and downright comical acting.

Feel as though I should be compensated for the last hour and a half that this movies sucked from my life. The wife's had no depth of character and could have been replaced with cardboard cutouts instead (which would have probably been more entertaining). I have seen Budweiser commercials that had more character development than this movie.. you know the one with that cute puppy in it? It was as though the cinematographer was given creative freedom only in the first 5 minutes of the film then someone other jackass took over and f'ed it all up.

This film also raises many questions throughout the film but unlike the television series ""Lost"" it answers them all. The recaps throughout the movie also helps the more relaxed viewer exactly what is happening. The are quite a few dull scenes but the seem to have still served a purpose when the movie is finally complete. The only complaint i actually could have is that two of the lead characters are similar in body type and facial characteristics (Karl Urban,James Marsden) which early on made it difficult to tell them apart.
