0,TheLittleSongbird,Intriguing and ahead of its time,8,11 May 2011,"I don't know about anybody else but I really quite like this movie. While I did love its concept, I do agree some parts are difficult to comprehend at times and at others there is a slow rhythm making the film not quite as compelling as it would have liked. Regardless, I still like TRON a lot, especially for the superb effects and visuals and unique sound effects, both assets of which are quite ahead of their time. Also the soundtrack is very memorable and fits perfectly, and even with the odd stilted moment the dialogue intrigues. The direction is good enough and serves its purpose well in the more action-packed moments, and I did like the characters and acting. Jeff Bridges is charming and likable with a cool character, while David Warner comes close to stealing the show. All in all, a very intriguing film then and now and ahead of its time. 8/10 Bethany Cox",TRON
1,Leofwine_draca,Like watching somebody else playing a computer game,3,21 December 2013,"Like SUPERMAN, TRON was a film that slipped me by during the 1980s. I never saw it, never knew anything about it, never got caught up in the hype surrounding it despite an interest in computers and virtual reality back then. Seeing it now, over 30 years since first release, I can only say I'm sorely disappointed.This is an exceedingly dull and plot less film that's the equivalent of watching somebody else playing a computer game, and we all know how boring that is! It has potential at the outset, but after a short while - basically, when Jeff Bridges is sucked into the computer world - it becomes dull beyond belief. The endless computer-generated action certainly looks pretty, and the effects were and still are remarkable for the time, but that's all there is to it. It's like an early forerunner of the kinds of CGI-and-CGI-alone movies we get these days like TRANSFORMERS.There isn't even any point me making note of the acting, because nobody gets a look in. Everything, and I mean everything, is secondary to the special effects; the actings, the plotting, the dialogue, everything. I love computer games, but only when I'm playing them. TRON isn't a real movie but rather an excuse for graphics and graphics alone.",TRON
2,SnoopyStyle,Forget realism and just enjoy the adventure,7,17 October 2013,"Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is convinced that former colleague Ed Dillinger (David Warner) stole his games for his company. With help from Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) and Lora (Cindy Morgan), he sneaks into the company. However Dillinger's powerful A.I. the Master Control Program (MCP) digitizes Flynn and sends him into the world of the computer programs.Does the science work? No.Do anything here seems the least bit realistic? No.But it works as an action adventure. The visual design is completely unique and absolutely iconic. Forget about believability. Just allow yourself to enjoy the adventure.",TRON
3,Prismark10,Trace ON,7,23 June 2014,"If there was no TRON then there might be no Pixar or no Toy Story. There have been films with CGI before but it was TRON that showed John Lasseter what was possible yet the film makes cunning use of CGI, there is less of it than people think.The film underperformed on its release and did better as a crossover arcade game. The light cycle sequence certainly helped. 1982 was the year that home computing was taking off in the UK with the BBC computer, Sinclair Spectrum, Commodore 64 entering households in greater numbers and TRON was riding on that wave, even its film score was acclaimed.The story is simple although it has to be noted Jeff Bridges is not Tron. Bridges is Kevin Flynn a programmer who has been cheated by a rival Dillinger (David Warner) who has taken credit for his work such as best selling arcade games and taken control of the Hi Tech company Encom. Flynn breaks into the Master Control Program (MCP) which has gained its own AI and become a super computer and takes Flynn inside a computer world in order to delete him.Flynn is helped out by Tron a legendary warrior in this computer world and he also looks like Flynn's friend Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner). They along with others seek to destroy the MCP and get rid of Dillinger.Critics at the time were not impressed by the story but the film's graphical content, its cutting edge for the time representation of a Matrix style world and use of synthesised music has made the film endure leading to a belated sequel almost 30 years later.",TRON
4,claudio_carvalho,A Milestone in Cinema History,8,12 December 2009,"While unsuccessfully trying to hack into the mainframe of the corporation ENCOM, the programmer Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is detected by the Master Control Program that protects the system. Kevin worked in the company and is seeking evidences to prove that he had four video games including the successful Space Paranoids stolen by his colleague Ed Dillinger (David Warner) that was promoted to senior executive of the software corporation. Kevin's friends Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) and Lora (Cindy Morgan) visits him is his arcade and they decide to help him to break into the ENCOM to use Lora's terminal and find the evidences while Alan uses his security program Tron to shutdown the MCP. However, the MCP identifies Flynn and brings him to the virtual world. Flynn associates to Tron and Ram (Dan Shor) and they are helped by Yora to reach and destroy the MCP to end the dictatorship in the virtual world.The cult ""Tron"" is a milestone in the cinema industry with a wonderful story of virtual world and a stylish cinematography supported by an earlier CGI work. In 2009, the hardware in ENCOM may be dated, with monochromatic monitors and huge computer units; but in 1982, Atari was the state-of-art video game and Internet was not available. Therefore, I believe that even younger generations that enjoy video game and sci-fi genre will appreciated this film that was certainly a source of inspiration of ""The Matrix"". When Alan Bradley arrives in his cubicle, there is a poster with the sentence ""Gort Klaatu Barada Nikto"" in homage to ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", the 1951 masterpiece of Robert Wise. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Tron, Uma Odisséia Eletrônica"" (""Tron, an Electronic Oddissey"")",TRON
5,kosmasp,Ahead of its time,6,7 September 2011,"Way ahead of its time actually. So much indeed that the tragedy surrounding the ""Best Visual Effects"" nod it didn't get (more on that in the Special Features of the movie or here on IMDb) is one of the most amazing stories about this movie. And it's not even that long ago, where it seems like they considered this the work of a ""witch"" (my conclusion for their strange decision).Apart from that you get the Dude playing it pretty straight. Though his stories from the set (and the ""getting in character"" console playing) are another amazing story in itself. The movie itself was very much sci-fi back then. And while it didn't become reality, the movie itself has not aged badly at all.",TRON
6,lee_eisenberg,"precisely, Sherman",10,14 May 2011,"One might call Steven Lisberger's ""Tron"" the movie that set the stage for visual effects as we know them today. The plot of course has a video game programmer (Jeff Bridges) getting transferred into a digital computer world by a sinister program, and then having to help the other programs rebel. But of course, the movie's main purpose is to have some of the coolest visual effects imaginable, depicting a computer world. All the more impressive when one sees the old-style computers that they used back then (they didn't even have the Internet!).OK, so we could be cynical and say that ""Tron"" led to a series of lesser movies that were excuses for constant visual effects, but I still say that it's one of the neatest things that I've ever seen. It helps that the movie elicits fine performances from Bridges, David Warner, Bruce Boxleitner, Cindy Morgan and Barnard Hughes. Bridges brings out the same energy that he did in ""The Last Picture Show"", ""Jagged Edge"", ""The Fisher King"", ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""Crazy Heart"".All in all, it's one that you can't afford to miss!",TRON
7,jboothmillard,Tron,5,19 May 2009,"Before the impact of Toy Story, followed by successes like Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo, Disney brought us this science fiction adventure complete with imaginative computer animation. Basically computer hacker Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is digitally broken down and zapped into the Cyber world by a villainous software pirate known as Master Control. In this colourful 3D graphical world, Kevin joins forces with Tron (Bruce Boxleitner) to try and defeat Master Control and the many challenges it creates for them to face, in order to get out of the system. Also starring David Warner as Ed Dillinger, Cindy Morgan as Lora, Barnard Hughes as Dr. Walter Gibbs, Dan Shor as Ram and Peter Jurasik as Crom. It is obviously very dated by today's standards of computer animation imagination, but to see where cinematic territory was broken is interesting I guess, it will probably appeal more to video game fans. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design and Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Worth watching!",TRON
8,ccthemovieman-1,Dated.....But Still One Of Those One-Of-A-Kind Movies You Should Check Out,7,2 September 2006,"When this came out, about 25 years ago, the special-effects were eye-popping. I was stunned and saw this twice at the theater, something I rarely did. Nowadays, it looks primitive. It's like when video games first came out, compared to what they are now.However, a few years ago when the DVD came out with the widescreen and 5.1surround sound, it made it somewhat-respectable again in parts and made it still fun to watch.The story was never that great. There was too much technical talk and the characters were the kind you really couldn't get involved over. It's nothing super, but if you've never seen it, I still recommend it. I don't recall any other movie quite like it.",TRON
9,ma-cortes,Precursory film with Jeff Bridges who finds pulled into another world against baddie David Warner as corporate executive realizing evil-doings,6,9 October 2011,"Original Sci-Fi film with rousing images and innovative computer generator scenarios about a creator whiz , a rebellious youngster ,who is flapped inside a computer game and haunted by the mysterious new world , undertaking a risked adventure . This cult movie deals with a computer genius named Kevin Flynn (a brave young man well played by Jeff Bridges who with his charisma keeps afloat the film ) , a youth once known as the world's leading video-game developer . When Kevin investigates the machine he soon finds himself pulled into a digital world where he has been trapped . During his investigation Kevin is zapped into another dimension and finds himself a player in a giant gladiatorial video-game competition . As he is sucked inside a powerful computer where he must fight for his life but with the help of the fearless partners and friends (Bruce Boxleiner and Cindy Morgan as Tron and Yori respectively ) embark on a life-or-death journey across a cyber universe , a universe created by Kevin himself that has become far more advanced with vehicles, weapons, digital outdoors and a ruthless villain (a computer generated David Warner) who will stop at nothing to prevent their escape and all sorts of bizarre things begin to happen .This exciting movie is full of thrills , action-packed , fights , tension , suspense and overwhelming races , but also several commercial elements , including computer-simulated violence . This is a dynamic, fast-paced and amusing movie It's an enjoyable , if somewhat light-headed piece of escapism with state-of-art special effects . Big-budgeted film led to break into the booming Sci-Fi/adventure/fantasy market full of inventiveness and imagination . Full of action, it's complemented by spectacular scenes , breathtaking flights and duels with illuminated disks and balls . Stunning action though the story runs out of steam too soon , however the thrilling ending arises the film . The flick relies heavily on the overlong and death-defying races that are incredible and magnificently made by means of innovative 3D computer generator by that time of the 80s , though nowaday dated . The tale moves like a supersonic bullet for most of its running time and the last generation of fantastic computer generator effects steal the show . Contrived beyond belief with spectacular motorcycle races that play like video games , but slickly calculated to please 1980s audiences and children especially . Jeff Bridges is good as valiant racer , he's an instinctive , stubborn and valiant young man . Cindy Morgan is beautiful as computer-generated young . Colorful cinematography plenty of neon and glittering color by Bruce Logan . Impressive and groundbreaking production design by Darren Gilford . Stirring and moving musical score by Wendy Carlos , Stanley Kubrik's usual , though composed by means of synthesizer . The motion picture is well directed by Steven Lisberger .Followed by a superior sequel , much better than original ¨Tron: Legacy(2010)¨ by Joseph Kosinski , and appears as producer Steven Lisberger , and also with the same actors as Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner , though doesn't appears David Warner , the former nasty executive , here replaced by Michael Sheen and Jeff Bridges in double role as good and bad guy ; furthermore , Olivia Wilde and Garrett Hedlund playing Kevin's son. ¨Tron¨ rating : 6,5 . Good , well worth watching , it proved to be a precursor for the modern cinema ,the movie boasts some impressive C.G. animation , reaching a high level of entertainment and excitement commensurate with its effect budget .It's viewing delight and amusing though toothless entertainment that benefits greatly from sympathetic acting and rudimentary but effective C.G special effects .",TRON
10,Quinoa1984,the visual effects and animation are so incredible you might forget how thin the plot is,7,29 October 2008,"TRON made me believe in how ambitious anyone working in animation and visual effects, like those working on TRON in 1982, could ever try to be. It's a film with such an incredibly loaded palette of sights and colors and shapes and contours and technological things that pop up, one might be distracted just about long enough to forget that the story at the center and the characters aren't very memorable. Which maybe is just as well - the director Steven Lisberger and his co-writer leave it all to what can be seen, as 'show, don't tell' becomes the mantra in delving into the simulated world of TRON. It's a computer game, the biggest and most elaborate one, and it's really great for two audiences: kids who love simple adventure/drama put to the smashing graphics, or those looking for the next 2001. Better yet, put it on a double bill with Wachowskis' Speed Racer and see if you come out on the other side unscathed.Then again, Lisberger isn't entirely reliant on the trippy-goes-tech mind-set. He also has Jeff Bridges as the lead, at ease a charismatic and too-smart-for-his-britches gamer who's a whiz at it but wants to hack back into the system to get the evidence that he really created the games that a business hack (David Warner) is claiming credit for. Just as he gets close enough to the source, he's ""copied"" and ""pasted"" (to use today's computer lingo) into the actual computer simulation that he created to 'play the game' against MCP- the Master Control Program- who runs like HAL squared, completely indomitable (seemingly anyway) and the puppet master to villain Warner.So yeah, a lot of this sounds like ripped off of cheesy 50s sci-fi magazines. Which, in small doses, is part of the fun. None of this is very brainy, despite what the filmmakers might want you to believe or that it has any kind of 'statement' to make about the horrors or dangers of technology. It doesn't pretend to be anything else that it isn't, which is why it (mostly) succeeds. While it doesn't cross that same barrier it's CGI descendant Toy Story or other Pixar movies did- it doesn't have the solid story worked out or with enough humans to care about- it holds up fantastically well some 25+ years later. It's also probably best to seek it out at a revival screening or midnight showing somewhere, as it's also a must for a big-screen viewing; you get lost in this world, so much so you'll just stare at it, bewildered, maybe too much so. It's its own... world, for a little while.",TRON
11,tavm,TRON was a mostly awesome trip back to my movie viewing years as a teenager,7,29 December 2010,"Having not seen this movie since it first came out 28 years ago (and missing much of the beginning to boot), I've now watched the whole thing on YouTube in anticipation of watching the sequel, TRON: Legacy, tomorrow. Writer/director Steven Lisberger is fine when visualizing the computer images and they're as awesome to see now as then but the actual story in the live-action sections are just a flimsy reason to hang the ongoing action story on. Still, seeing Jeff Bridges bring his cool self as the leading character Flynn is well worth a look, having Bruce Boxleitner as the title character and his ""user"" counterpart Alan is a good normal counterpart, and seeing Cindy ""Lacey Underall"" Morgan as the girl between them with her eye candy looks make all the sparks fly when they're all on screen together. Add in David Warner as the villain with all those cliché orders he keeps barking and Barnard Hughes as the father figure and you can't go wrong with a combo like that! Oh, and Wendy Carlos-who I've long admired from when she was Walter Carlos and had scored A Clockwork Orange-does fine with the music here. Like I said, great computer images, not-so-great story, but overall, TRON is well worth the watch and I just can't wait to see the sequel tomorrow...",TRON
12,BandSAboutMovies,Childhood dream,10,19 July 2021,"I was ten when this movie came out and it was - without a doubt - the biggest thing in my life. Talk about brand synergy - to walk into the GameTrek arcade and see an actual Tron arcade machine with all the same sound effects! I wanted to disappear into the video game grid and escape the bullies of my childhood. I'd much rather hang out with Sark and the Master Control Program - I had an affection for evil even then.Writer and director Steven Lisberger (Bonnie MacBird* wrote the original story with him) had been inspired by the video games hed played in the 70s and dreamed of a movie based on them. He finally landed at Disney, where computer animation would join with traditional filming techniques and backlit animation to make this groundbreaking film.Disney executives were uncertain about giving $12 million to a first-time producer and director using techniques that had never been done before. They did finance a test of the flying discs and it won them over, as long as the studio could rewrite and restoryboard the movie. At this time, Disney rarely hired outsiders to make films for them. They were given a cold reception and none of the animators would join the film.Now for some geeky stuff.Disney decided in 1981 to film Tron completely in 65-mm Super Panavision**, which makes the movie look way bigger and stranger in the best of ways. And as a result of this being a non-Disney Disney movie, the outside influences make it seem even odder. French comic book artist Jean ""Moebius"" Giraud, who had worked on Jodorowskys canceled Dune, designed the characters and costumes, while the machines were designed by Syd Mead (Blade Runner, Aliens) and Peter Lloyd worked on the environments, yet all three would switch jobs and pitch in to create the overlook look of the film and even its logo.However, none of the four studios hired to design the computer animation - Information International, Inc.; MAGI; Robert Abel and Associates and Digital Effects - collaborated on their art, which gives a variety of looks to the film.Tron sees a world where we all have a computer version of ourselves inside the master grid, a place ruled by the Master Control Program and policed by David Warner's Sark. It's a world that Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) helped created when he made a series of video games for ENCOM before growing disillusioned with the big business that those games became. Shades of Atari and Warner Communications, huh?Programmer Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) and his girlfriend (and Flynn's ex-girlfriend) engineer Lora Baines (Cindy Morgan) have learned that MCP is taking over their projects and is shut down by senior executive vice president Ed Dillinger (also Warner). It turns out that the businessman got so far by stealing Flynn's games. In retaliation, Flynn has quit and runs an arcade when he isn't hacking into ENCOM.Of course, that allows the Master Control to blast Flynn into his reality, a place where Alan is Tron and Lora is Lori and all the video games that the creator loves have become life and death. I kind of love everything about this movie except for Flynn becoming the CEO at the end. We all know how business works and we'll learn even more in the sequel.Another part of my childhood was in the soundtrack to this movie, which was composed by Wendy Carlos. I never could quite figure out why my dad's Walter Carlos albums just ended and wondered if his sister took over for him. It wasn't until years later that I learned the brave truth. Two other songs - ""1990's Theme"" and ""Only Solutions"" - came from Journey.Unfortunately, Tron was originally going to be released during the Christmas season of 1982. When the chairman of the Disney board Card Walker found out that Disney expatriate Don Bluth's film The Secret of NIMH was coming out in early July, he rushed Tron in an attempt to crush Bluth. This also meant that Tron would be going up against a summer of films that included Blade Runner, Poltergeist, Star Trek II and E. T. While it would become Disney's highest-grossing live action film for 5 years, it still lost the studio a ton of money, as they thought it would generate $400 million in profit.The world has changed - the state-of-the-art computer used for the film's key special effects had only 2MB of memory and 330MB of storage, for example - but Tron has remained a cult film that deserved a much wider audience.*MacBird believes that she was the first screenwriter to edit a screenplay on a computer, but chose the industry-standard Courier font when she printed it, all so Disney would still think she used a typewriter.**The computer-generated layers were shot in VistaVision - both anamorphic 35mm and Super 35 - and the real world scenes were as well, then blown up to 65 mm.",TRON

15,Hey_Sweden,Of Programs and Men.,7,30 November 2016,"""TRON"" may not exactly be a truly great film, but it is interesting, and incredibly stimulating on a visual level. It's also obviously historically important as one of the earliest films to take advantage of computers in creating amazing, digitally designed environments. It really does take you into a different world of sorts. But it's fortunately also not an empty experience, as it does make one think about the nature of artificial intelligence, and even touches upon philosophical / religious themes as well.Jeff Bridges stars as Kevin Flynn, a former program designer for a leading software corporation whose ideas for games were stolen by the devious Ed Dillinger (David Warner). Flynn now spends part of his time trying to hack into the Encom system to find the proof that Dillinger screwed him over. Assisted by his friends Lora (Cindy Morgan) and Alan (Bruce Boxleitner), he infiltrates the big company building, and ends up beamed inside the system by the omnipotent Master Control Program. Here he must participate in ""games"" and evade deadly tanks and persistent ""Recognizers"".The innovation in this project, scripted and directed by Steven Lisberger, is impressive. The ideas in this narrative are still relevant 34 years later, and the animation is still quite effective. More tech savvy viewers may maintain that the film does show its age, but all this viewer can say is that he enjoyed the ride on which he was taken. After a while, the wonder of the images does start to fade a bit, but at least ""TRON"" has the charisma of Bridges, and the abilities of his supporting cast (also including Barnard Hughes (""The Lost Boys"") and Dan Shor (""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"")) to fall back on. Fine electronic music by Wendy Carlos and two songs by rock band Journey also help to make this enjoyable.Followed decades later by a sequel.Seven out of 10.",TRON
16,utgard14,"""I'm worth millions of their man years!""",6,18 June 2014,"The beautiful thing about Tron is that there's just no other movie like it. Certainly not before it was released and I don't think since. That, in itself, is a huge accomplishment. The special effects, costumes, and designs may seem hokey to some today but I think they are very cool and unique. The plot's a little hard to follow, I admit. I recently watched it with a friend who had never seen it before. She spent a good deal of the movie confused. I think I had a similar feeling the first time I watched it. It's one of those movies that grows on you the more you watch it but obviously that's not something that everybody wants to hear when sitting down to watch a film for the first time. The cast is good, though the characters are mostly one-dimensional. Jeff Bridges rises above everybody else and adds some much-needed humor and charm to things (""Now THAT is a big door!""). All in all, Tron is a good movie with awesome visuals but not without flaws. It's definitely something you should check out if you like '80s movies or sci-fi movies.",TRON
17,zardoz-13,Landmark But Shallow Sci-Fi Classic,8,23 December 2010,"Slipstream (1989) helmer Steven Lisberger wrote and directed Tron, a state-of-the-art, formulaic man-versus-machine melodrama that combines elements of Fantastic Voyage and The Most Dangerous Game. Clearly, this Disney opus was far ahead of its time in terms of its visual graphics. The film received two Academy Award nominations for Best Costume Design and Best Sound. Incredibly, Oscar shut Tron out of the Best Visual Effects category because the Academy thought that the use of computers rather than hands to draw environments was regarded as negative. Clearly, the industry felt that computers posed a threat to artisans who had made their living painting and drawing ersatz backgrounds and animation. E.T.--The Extra-terrestrial won Best Visual Effects. Nevertheless, Tron became a landmark movie not only for its use of computer-generated graphics but also for blending animation with live-action filming. Despite a slow opening weekend of under $4-million, this seminal sci-fi saga that cost $17 million wound up coining $33-million. Unfortunately, Disney decided not to follow it up with a sequel until 2010 with Tron: Legacy. Lisberger has written a crisp, trim, action-oriented, electronics thriller that takes audiences into a computer as our hero pits himself in life-and-death struggles with an enemy greater than himself, namely Master Control. Revenge winds up being sweet for our protagonist. Along the way, we are exposed to new and entirely different landscapes from what normally went into a sci-fi movie.A sinister bureaucrat, Ed Dillinger (David Warner of The Ballad of Cable Hogue), who is the CEO of the ENCOM Corporation, has stolen five computer games, among them Space Paranoid that an agile twentysomething programmer developed. The heroic but reckless computer-programmer-turned-hacker sets out to recover his rightful property. Downtown video arcade owner Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges of Thunderbolt and Lightfoot) needs to get back into the computer system so he can crack its security settings and retrieve his programs. The catch here is that he finds himself zapped by a laser and sucked into the computer and compelled to participate in various gladiatorial trials of combat on a game grid with other cyberspace competitors. The computer files in Tron have been turned into men decked out in funky, cyber-suits with bicycle-style helmets and Frisbees. Dillinger has generated what is called his Master Control Program that serves as a form of artificial intelligence to safeguard himself. Flynn's former colleague and girlfriend, Lora (Cindy Morgan), smuggles him into ENCOM so he can get onto a terminal and amass evidence that Dillinger parlayed a fortune from stealing his software. Master Control discovers Flynnand digitizes him into a computer file. This transformation scene looks cool. Initially, Flynn finds himself imprisoned until two other computer files and he escape on futuristic type motorcycles and evade tank-like predators. Meanwhile, Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) has engineered a security program named Tron which represents a threat to Master Control. The Tron program has been designed to confine computer programs from acquiring too much power. The ultimate penalty that our heroes face for failure is called de-rezzing when a human-looking computer files is erased, the equivalent of death.Jeff Bridges qualifies as a sympathetic hero and David Warner is dastardly as ever. The special effects overshadow the thinly-scripted plot, much the way that the special effects and futuristic architecture overwhelmed the plot of the Fritz Lang masterpiece Metropolis. Everything pretty much makes sense, but the plot and the obstacles that our heroes face are relatively routine but exciting looking.",TRON
18,view_and_review,"Agent Smith, MCP is the first rebel program",7,16 July 2008,"Before ""Virtuosity"", before ""The Matrix"", and other similar types of movies, there was ""Tron"", a movie about a rogue program eliminating all other programs so there would just be him: Master Control Program (MCP). I decided to check this movie out again being that I hadn't seen it since I was a kid and all I could remember were the race car scenes. Looking at it again I can honestly say that Tron was ahead of its time. Now you have seen the concept played over and over again: machines/computers gaining awareness and cognizance then seeking to break free of their creators, most times violently. Tron was also innovative with the computer graphics overlay with real people. Sure it looked very elementary, but at the time it was all new. The movie was great in my opinion and the story worked really well. I did find myself chuckling a bit at the obvious Atari sounds & icons used in the movie. Galaxian was clearly audible and there was a picture of Pacman in one scene.",TRON
19,neil-476,A triumph of style over substance,7,6 June 2010,"One must acknowledge Tron for its vast importance in terms of bringing computer graphics into mainstream movie making. Yes, the graphics in question look fairly dated these days by reference to their simplicity, but I don't count that against the film (and I certainly didn't do so at the time). Tron still looks pretty impressive all these years later.But looks alone aren't everything. Performance helps, and Tron is saddled with forgettable performances. I can't even remember the names of the people who were in it once you get past Jeff Bridges, David Warner, and Bruce Boxleitner (wo was always going to be the next big thing and never was).Tron is also saddled with a story which should have been wonderful, fantastical, and completely gripping, but which never quite manages to climb out of ho-hum.As a result, the finished movie lands squarely halfway between success and failure. Let's hope that the forthcoming revisitation does better.",TRON
20,Uriah43,Ahead of Its Time,7,22 July 2017,"Having risen through the ranks of a large computer corporation known as ENCOM, a sociopath named ""Ed Dillinger"" (David Warner) has installed a software package known as the Master Computer Program (MCP) into the corporate computer which hacks into various computer programs and data bases all over the world to steal valuable information and thereby increase profits. However, the MCP soon gets too powerful and after taking control of ENCOM decides to appropriate other computer systems in an effort to rule the world. However, a former ENCOM employee named """"Kevin Flynn"" (Jeff Bridges) feels he has been cheated by Ed Dillinger and convinces two current ENCOM employees named ""Alan Bradley"" (Bruce Boxleitner) and ""Lora Baines"" (Cindy Morgan) to give him access to the main computer terminal to prove his allegations. Unfortunately, the MCP becomes aware of his activity and manages to transport him into the computer system where he has to fight for his life against programs designed to eliminate anything that interferes with the computer's operational status. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film created quite a sensation in the science-fiction community when it first came out due its computerized graphics which were well ahead of the times. Unfortunately, it suffered at most of the science-fiction award ceremonies that year due to the release of ""E.T. the Extraterrestrial"" and ""Star Trek-The Wrath of Khan"" which dominated that specific genre. That aside, however, this is still an enjoyable film even though it is certainly quite dated. But in any case, I liked this particular film and have rated it accordingly. Above average.",TRON

Planning to put some background sound on whilst looking, the play list hit RedLetterMedia's fantastic review for Tron and Tron Legacy (2010-also reviewed),leading me to take this as a sign,of it being time to program TRON.View on the film:Raging against the machine from within,Jeff Bridges gives a live-wire turn as Flynn, whose youthful enthusiasm Bridges has Flynn swing against the system,while Bruce Boxleitner programs his performance of Tron with a growing awareness of facing deletion, and David Warner brings a quality touch of boo-hiss 80's British baddie as lead program Sark.Made at a time when Disney were taking big swings in live action (such as the excellent Return To Oz (1985-also reviewed)) that sadly missed at the box office, co-writer/(with Bonnie MacBird and Charles S. Haas) director Steven Lisberger & cinematographer Bruce Logan play the big budget special effects into a retro Cyberpunk atmosphere of Art Deco-lined CGI flying across the mainframe like a updated version of Pong.Getting served on a plate to them the first score Wendy Carlos had composed since The Shining (1980), the makers sadly completely miss the opportunity to bring a striking stylisation to the set-pieces, by pushing Carlos's Electronic score right to the back of the mix,in order to have the sound effect of a computer hum, be the noise which dries excitement from the action scenes.Investing a huge amount in the appearance of the film, the writers skip putting the same level of investment into the script,which stops/starts at attempts to bring religion (God is in the machine?) into creating a Sci-Fi epic scope, at the drop of a hat, in order to button-bash the failed quips between Flynn and the End of Level Boss.",TRON
22,safenoe,Ahead of its time,8,28 June 2021,"I remember seeing Tron in the cinemas at its time of release, wow nearly 40 years ago!

23,Mr-Fusion,Disneyfied Cyberpunk,8,16 August 2012,"""TRON"" seemed to have a good nose for where technology was headed. Virtual reality, the Internet - hell, just looking at your smartphone makes the MCP and programs seems pretty relevant. But all of this is couched in video game culture, which makes it easily accessible. I mean, really, you can't walk into an arcade without thinking of this movie.But when all is said and done, this is really just about a guy getting zapped into a video game. That sentence just screams Disney to me - even more so when you see that the digital world was created mostly with animation techniques. But there's an inherent degree of silliness to all of this that makes it fun and it's a tone in which Jeff Bridges' goofball performance fits well. But even with the family-friendly tone, this is still pretty cool. After all, it gave us the light cycle.I don't have a lot of favorite Disney movies, but this is one of them.8/10",TRON
24,namashi_1,Fascinating...,8,25 February 2010,"Here's why I watched 'TRON': I was reading Jeff Bridges's Wikipedia page, where I saw 'cult classic' written before they pronounced the name of this 1982 sci-fi flick 'TRON'. As Bridges is one of my all-time favorite actors, I just called for DVD and here is my analysis: Steven Lisberger's 'TRON' is amongst the most daring & interesting films to come out in the early 80's.'TRON' tells the story of Kevin Flynn (and his program counterpart inside the electronic world, Clu), & his journey then against the villains who have stolen his talent. This classic released way back in 1982, when technology was just getting better. The computer graphics are simply astounding; each time you look at it, you're in love with it. 'TRON' stands out because of the graphics is has, it's a joyride all the way! 'TRON' has a interesting start, middle & end. It's high-packed action & fun! Lisberger's direction & screenplay deserve an ovation, he made a path-breaking film, what he thought then will be remembered for ever! Bruce Logan's cinematography is top-notch. Coming to acting, Bridges steals the show, the veteran is superb. Bruce Boxleitner as TRON is excellent, giving his character a style of his own. Cindy Morgan is fantastic. Others are perfect.'TRON' is a fascinating fare, Two Big Thumbs Up! I am dieing to watch 'Tron Legacy'!!!",TRON
25,Rainey-Dawn,A Neon Wonder,10,2 July 2014,"I saw TRON (1982) when it first came out - I was 10 years old. I enjoyed the at home Atari and Intellivision games as well as time in the arcades. I also loved science fiction movies and I was awestruck with TRON (1982)! The movie was breath-taking from the viewpoint of a 10 year old kid in 1982. I did not fully understand the movie at the time because I knew very little about computers outside of what I saw in film and on TV. What I did understand about the movie I liked. And, of course, the amazing neon effects and the action going on in the film.I re-watched TRON (1982) as an adult and I like the film even more that I did as a 10 year old kid - strange isn't it. As an adult, I know some things about computers now (although I am not a computer whiz) - and with that little bit of computer knowledge I have now I am able to understand and enjoy TRON (1982) so much better as an adult.The story of TRON (1982) is very good - I find it quite interesting. The special effects were top-of-the-line, cutting edge for 1982 and they still hold up to any modern day effects we see in movies today.TRON (1982) has never been just an ordinary science fiction film - so I do recommend it to fans of sci-fi, computers and gaming.Rated way to low on IMDb - it's a great movie! 10/10",TRON
26,disdressed12,Tron,7,15 April 2011,"Tron may seem quaint by todays standards but It as definitely ahead of its time and very original when it came out in 1982.to me,it still looks very good,especially in Blu-ray format.it's a very fast moving film,though it doesn't seem like it at the time.but it's over before you know it.and if you're like me,you'll want it to keep going.i think it could have been longer.but that's just me.the movie certainly has nostalgia appeal.i really enjoyed watching it again.i think it stands the test of time.though i know a lot of people won't agree with that statement.as an aside,the extras are extensive on the 2 disc Blu-ray/DVD combo pack.for me,TRON is a 7/10",TRON
27,KineticSeoul,Groundbreaking visuals and original idea for it's time,6,21 January 2011,"Okay so I give credit to this movie for it's visual for it's time and the original idea for it's time as well. But despite that I just didn't really find this movie to be all that compelling or felt like it pulled me into the story. Maybe it's cause a lot of aspects of this movie is outdated and cause it was made way before I was even born. But for it's time it really did have some groundbreaking visuals, it's basically what launched computer animation to the mainstream and is the first full length feature that had this much computer animation. The thing is, seeing it now, everything about it just seemed way too outdated and boring since the story although original for it's time was that intriguing or gripping in anyway. But for what it accomplished for it's time I give it a 6.4/10.6.4/10",TRON
28,thesar-2,Hal Rebooted,3,7 June 2010,"And to think: as lackluster, boring and trite the year 2010 for movies has turned out, I was really looking forward to Tron: Legacy. Even without seeing the original. Ever.Maybe it was because one of my all-time favorite arcade games was, and still is, Tron. Perhaps it was the wonderful trailers? Or the fact, I love Jeff Bridges and give ""The Dude"" kudos for making a well-made decision on making a movie/sequel.So, naturally, I have to see the first one first before venturing into the winter of 2010's only promising release. After growing up on the game, the theme music and the anticipation of the (almost) 20 year-follow-up I must say: what a letdown.I don't want to take away from what the original writers/director created here. Surely, they had something going for them in 1982: an original idea, a complex action film with futuristic graphics – for its time. Does it hold up? Apparently not, in my opinion, since I had the privilege of watching for the first time in 2010.I'm not knocking the graphics. I simply can't – that was the technology back then. And they even showed things (like the touch screens) that had years left to be developed. So good for them. But, my problem was that there was just too much. They wanted to be too many movies wrapped into one without focusing on the center of the plot. Or any heart. You wanted to care for some of the characters, but they were so thrust onto the screen with little to no background and then yanked away to make room for more ""plot developments."" And speaking of which, there were so many plots and subplots, it was hard to keep up where this movie was going.Recently, I watched Disney's other big live-action ""blockbuster"" relatively in the same era, The Black Hole and as much as I rated only 3/5 stars, at least that had a central idea and went with it. Tron is all over the place and requires several viewings to get it all straight.Let's see, it's been about a week since I've seen Tron and I'm going to try to remember all that it was about, or all the subplots: Oust developer Kevin Flynn (Bridges) is recruited to thwart a supercomputer (i.e. Hal from 2001) master program who is gaining a bunch of power from mini-programs to be the ultimate dominator. Years later, this would be portrayed in The Lawnmower Man, Terminator: Salvation or The Matrix.Meanwhile, there's the corporate bigwig who wants the same thing, a rouge ex-girlfriend bent on stopping the madness and Flynn who's inadvertently thrown into the ""game"" or ""program"" to prove himself against the computer's main competitive baddie.This is how forgettable this movie is, aside from those who first viewed it in 1982. It has only been a week and I've already forgotten the dozen or so subplots and reasons for the movie. I guess suffice to say, it's a ""heart-whelming"" story of the dangers of technology and despite the limitations of 1982 graphics, it will be really fleshed out in decades to follow with much better products. A good idea at the time, but just have patience, audience and you'll have a much better movie to watch. And to follow.Will I still see the sequel? Of course. I'm still looking forward to it and hopefully will watch the progression and ironing out the problems with the original. Also, I give a plus to Disney for not following the recent trend of ""rebooting"" and sticking with the time-honored tradition of simply releasing a SEQUEL.",TRON
29,Robert_duder,The campy cult classic won me over,9,19 February 2011,"Everyone and anyone has at least heard of Tron but I imagine it got its second wind with the recent big budget release of its sequel 30 years later. That is when I finally decided to watch the film. I think when I saw trailers, posters, and even the arcade game as a kid it kind of freaked me out. You don't get any campier than Tron. Because the film is so heavily reliant on technology it is hard for the film to be timeless. The technology from the film seems almost silly now and yet at the same time some of the ideas underneath it all were literally revolutionary. And I have no doubt that at the time the technology and special effects in the film were cutting edge. Regardless, even now, the film is one of the most visually unique films I have ever seen. I wouldn't call it stunning but very, very unique in the way that it is filmed. The world that Disney built with Tron is fascinating. In a way I'm surprised that it didn't pick up more of a following right away given how submersed the world and the sci-fi elements are. But make no mistake Tron is campy at its core. Whether it be most of the performances, the crazy costumes and the story is geek heaven.The legendary Jeff Bridges plays free spirited and zany Kevin Flynn. On the surface Bridges' character seems a little empty, not a lot of depth but he has enough charisma and chemistry to keep you watching him regardless. For all intents and purposes he is not the focus of the film anyways but he definitely is memorable in the role. Bruce Boxleitner is Bridges' friend and partner and also the heroic program Tron. He does a good job but he brings a lot of the campiness to the film because he is downright hilariously campy in his role. Its not on purpose, you can tell Boxleitner takes this role very seriously but in the process makes it almost funny. I don't mean that to sound terrible but its true. Cindy Morgan was an 80's character actor staple in everything from The Love Boat to Caddyshack. Morgan plays the lovely and cute program Yori. Morgan has good chemistry with Bridges but somehow her performance is rather campy as well. She also shares even better chemistry with Boxleitner (maybe their campiness binds them together.) An amazing character actor, David Warner plays Ed Dillinger, nemesis to Bridge's Flynn, and the voice of the Master Control Program. He doesn't have a big impact on the film but he always is a pleasure to see on screen.Writer and director Steven Lisberger doesn't have a ton of credits to his name and this is really his biggest piece of work but I'm sure when he saw what he was dealing with as far as special effects and the story. I don't even know if anyone from Disney to the film makers knew that they could potentially have a classic on their hands or maybe it was something they wished for although it took years for it to become a cult classic that it is today. I have no doubt that Tron isn't for everyone. It takes a certain breed of geek to really follow the more technical stuff but when you watch that from 1982 and then look at what we have today its almost frightening how much they touch on despite the technology still looking so retro back then. The concept is cool and I actually think they could have delved far deeper into it. Tron was made as a family film so you don't get the kind of depth that some would like but if you're a geek or a geek at heart or just want a cool family adventure unlike any other you'll enjoy seeing Tron and the way technology used to be. 9/10",TRON

33,Rodrigo_Amaro,Sadly Overrated,2,2 April 2010,"The idea of a hacker transported into a computer having to destroy an evil program was brilliant. But something was missing in ""TRON"". A more developed story, substantial dialogs and, yes, a director capable to do his job in a better way than Steven Lisberger, master and commander of this sadly overrated movie. How in the world Disney green lighted such a good project in the hands of an amateur?I'm dazzled with the positive reviews of the many viewers of this wrecked project quoting that this was an underrated film when the time of its release. Sorry, that's not just the case. The story wasn't that appealing as ""Matrix"" was. The real life sequences were far more interesting than the whole visual effects side, that got overlong, boring, and nowadays dated. I was trying not to sleep in many parts of that long race between the characters (something like a car chase scene but instead of cars running chips and programs chasing each other). Jeff Bridges holds this movie very well and David Warner plays the usual villain as he almost always does. But, if you want to see these two actors in a good movie go rent ""The Big Lebowski"" (in which Bridges star) or ""Time After Time"" (an awesome sci-fi movie starring Warner as villain). I only watched this movie because: 1) In 2005, The Strokes (one of my favorite rock bands) made a video clip for the song 12:51 in which ""TRON"" was used as reference to the whole thing. Very Interesting by the way. And 2) I heard that ""TRON Legacy"" is going to be released this year so I thought ""Let's see what this movie has of interesting"". And the result came to nowhere. And I'm glad that Supertramp, another of my favorite groups, wasn't available to contribute to songs in this wreck. The music in the movie, by the way, is so strangely executed.The dated visual effects has some charming things that remind us of the 1980's with a twinkle in the eyes. After all who doesn't love the movies of that decade? I loved the visual concept of the movie along with the brilliant and themed costume designs (Oscar nominated). But its slowed rhythm story and its lack of expectation, lack of a better climax just ruined the movie for me. I hope that ""TRON Legacy"" became a better project. At least, I know it's going to be because Lisberger is not directing the movie, but his hands are in the screenplay again so let's hope he makes something good this time. 2/10",TRON

The plot was very interesting consisted of some plot twists that made it even more interesting while there was much of action and suspense through the whole duration of the film. The interpretations of both Jeff Bridges who played as Kevin Flynn / Clu and Bruce Boxleitner who played as Alan Bradley / Tron were very good and I believe that made the difference in this movie. Finally, I have to say that ""TRON"" is a nice movie to watch and I recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will be amazed by it.",TRON
35,Dr_Coulardeau,Too bad it has aged so much,7,3 May 2009,"That was maybe an interesting film when it came out but now it is obsolete and old-fashioned. The ""plot"" is too complex to be clear apart from the thief who steals the intellectual property, and copyright, of someone else and gets the profit and the fame for a computer game he never produced. Then the attempt to introduce a super controlling software to take over all games is slightly over-dramatic and leads to a messy situation in which we hardly recognize the characters, apart from them being red or blue, because of their costumes or uniforms or whatever that hardly let their noses and eyes peep out of the dark grey plastic.

36,johnnyboyz,One man and his computer.,8,29 September 2007,"Before there was The Matrix, there was TRON; a wonderful and fascinating film about friendship, dedication and survival. TRON is an art film, an animation film, a film that utilises computers in such a way that they are integrated as characters into the actual film; something that hadn't really been done to my knowledge since the great HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey  only further cementing the brilliance of that particular film. But TRON is so much more than an action film set in an unreal world where survival is key  this plays out like Star Wars, The Matrix or Lord of the Rings in basic film form but when you watch it you only then realise how tense, dramatic and innovative it actually is.TRON deserves whatever plaudits it gets merely for the fact it was made in 1982. Its references through dialogue to computers and artificial intelligence is stunning given when it was made  one such character states that one day, 'computers will be able to think for themselves' and this is so true, not only in the world of film but also in real life: computers can beat us at Chess; most famously when Deep Blue beat Kasparov and computers in film were shown to think on a massive scale a mere two years later when The Terminator was made. Of course, HAL 9000 predates TRON by twenty years anyway but TRON reinvents the evil, psychotic robot character in some style, updating it to the size of a table and giving it it's own kingdom of which to rule over in another world within the film  it's sort of an antagonist within a world within a world within a film and it's fascinating to watch.Like I said, TRON demonstrates a film's ability to switch between two worlds. The Matrix did it with Neo, Star Wars had Luke go through with it and The Lord of the Rings had Frodo ripped out of simple, everyday Shire life to battle monsters in a setting opposite to that of The Shire. Here, TRON transports Flynn (Bridges) into an even today mind blowing world of a computer where massive blocks of data form corridors and look down at whoever travels down them; a place where hovering two legged things float down the corridors and remain a constant threat throughout; and a place where the HAL 9000 for the 80s puts different systems and such into death or glory games involving physical and mental skill. One thing that struck me is that when I or anyone else plays a computer game, physical skill is not required  a character you control can sprint or dive through the air or play a sport to a level you can't yet in TRON; you'd need to be at that physical peak to ultimately win.Of course these two worlds provide different aims for each character. In the 'real' world (as the film puts it) Flynn is bitter as someone stole his gaming ideas and made money out of them, hence why he can beat the high score without breaking sweat since he programmed the damn thing whereas on the inside, Flynn and his buddy Tron (Boxleitner) just have to survive and their mission basically consists of that narrative of chase which can be so effective. Tron is also after a new order of peace within the alternate world which I found to be very touching because of course Neo is after a new order in The Matrix, Frodo is after new order and one thing all these films have in common is that the evil kingdom must be brought to a halt and peace restored but this time, it's actually inside a computer  given the technological advances made since 1982, it makes for one hell of an interesting ride.I would recommend TRON not only for novelty but for its effects, its story, its numerous memorable scenes involving chase, duels and problematic situations as well as for its general laid back, 'hero vs. villain' routine which is done very well. TRON is in a way; a masterpiece and in another way; a guilty pleasure but one thing it most definitely is, is pure entertainment.",TRON

For the now old guys who watched TRON first handed in 1982 it is still a great nostalgic trip back and it is still charming like all those Japanese Godzilla movies from the 60s and 70s or the original Flash Gordon with Buster Crabbe from the 30s.

Damn those spiders and the cone of death.Tron is so much better than the other movies. They lost track of what the reality of it movie was supposed to be. Tron was a program who had a user and the user was trying to hack the system. Flynn was a user trapped inside and he was trying to get out/figure stuff out/and stay alive. The computer scanned him and brought him in to the world beneath the computer chips.yeah, I take off points for the whole scanning thing and plus who created the city and why do they need buildings or transportation because they can all move at the speed of light. That part is a flaw for me, but I let it slide because you need to be able to see the story unfold some how or else its all numbers and symbols dripping down the screen.Tron holds up even after 40 years later, ok, 39 years.

At times the production design looks like a cheesy neon laser tag set and the special effects are ancient -- especially more than 25 years later. The plot of course is amateur while somehow also confusing. But to love ""Tron"" is to look past all that and see the adventurous soul behind this imaginative computer-world fantasy. It's a one-of-a-kind work of imagination that was decades ahead of its time.""Tron"" stars a younger Jeff Bridges as Flynn, a former software program developer who wants to get back at the head of his former company, Ed Dillinger (David Warner), who stole some of his computer game programs and used them to get to the top. To maintain and expand the power of his cyber network, Dillinger created the Master Control Program. That's not too weird, except there's a whole world inside that computer system where programs appear as people or machines. Trying to access the files hidden away that prove Dillinger stole the programs, Flynn is sucked into the computer world by the MCP. Teaming up with his friends' programs, one being Tron, Flynn tries to take down the Master Control Program from the inside.The world of ""Tron"" in conceptual terms is what makes this movie so interesting. Not the way it's visually put together, though it kind of has a unique retro high-tech style to it that in some circles might be ""cool,"" but the thought process behind it. When Flynn enters the computer, the first thing that happens is he's sent to the game zone where he's forced to compete in games where the loser is deleted. The trademarks of the film such as the flying discs, digital jai alai and the lightcycles come out of these scenes early on. The inventives of these games are what makes ""Tron"" good for those apt to like it.Discussing the finer plot points of ""Tron"" is to forget it's a wacky Disney movie. There's nothing great about the acting and there's nothing too suspenseful about their adventure either -- it's all about watching what creators Steven Lisberger and Bonnie MacBird come up with next. I do have to mention the very cool aerial shot of the city at night where Lisberger speeds up the tape to make it look like a computer chip. Also, Wendy Carlos' score is a perfect fit for the movie.Then you also have to look at ""Tron"" for the achievement that it was in 1982. This movie predates James Cameron movies and he's looked at as the director who is always ahead of his time, working on the cutting edge of technology. As cheesy as it all seems now, it was ground-breaking and 28 years later, it's simply the only of its kind.",TRON
43,funkyfry,What could have been,4,7 July 2008,"I have to say, I just now got the chance to see ""Tron"" on the big screen for the first time. When it came out, I was younger and I wanted to see it but didn't end up seeing it till it came out on video. I never liked it. And even now, after seeing it in 70mm on the big screen, I think it's a failure. The movie is totally gorgeous, the visual look of the thing is unique. But the characters just do not appeal to me and I've never gotten drawn into the story.The effects are to this day very high quality. Nobody really laughed at the effects in the audience, and it was a packed house. The only scene that looks a bit laughable is when Flynn (Jeff Bridges) gets laser scanned and transported into the digital world. That's because that scene takes place in our ""real"" world and has digital effects imposed on top of it -- the entire rest of the film is so stylized that everything in it is aging or ""dating"" really well. Everything takes place within that stylized universe, so as long as it fits into the special look and feel of this movie it feels right. And the look and feel of this movie seem to promise something of a very high order. It's a bit like ""Metropolis"", with its weak story and boring characters, except that ""Metropolis"" ended up being a truly great film because it had a truly great director, Fritz Lang. ""Tron"" on the other hand had a guy who seems to be a really lame director, Steven Lisberger. He has only done a few movies, but he did direct ""Slipstream"", with Mark Hamill. That was another movie, like ""Tron"", that could have been really cool but ended up pretty flat.Jeff Bridges brings whatever moments of warmth or genuine humor that the movie has. The only laugh I really got was when he was supposed to be drinking some kind of liquid that was like pure energy, and he was getting high off it and didn't want to leave with Tron right away. There's a funny shot of he and Ram (Dan Shor) watching Tron walk away, looking at each other like ""what the heck?"" and going back for seconds (or thirds). And his performance at that point was like he was high on coke. That was pretty funny to slip into a Disney movie. But there wasn't enough stuff like that. It's way too serious overall considering how ridiculous the whole thing really is. A bit more of the self-conscious cheezy like Lucas' ""Star Wars"" and De Laurentis' ""Flash Gordon"" would have improved it.Bruce Boxleinter is not a name that ever lit up too many cinema marquees. And for good reason, because the guy is like a cinematic black hole, consuming all the energy in the scene despite Bridges' and Cindy Morgan's valiant efforts and nullifying it completely. Cindy Morgan by the way is very cute in that skull-cap and glowing body suit; I thought she was Kim Cattral actually, they looked a bit alike at that time. I see looking at her list, I probably recognized her unconsciously from ""Caddyshack"" where she was Ted Knight's horny niece, ""Lacy Underall."" David Warner's performance is the most unfortunate of all because he's a truly great actor. Here he's got some value, but the audience laughed at things in the movie that he was forced to play straight. Around the same time as this movie, he played ""Evil Genius"" in Terry Gilliam's ""Time Bandits"", where he got a chance to show off his villainous persona with a humorous wink at the audience. There's not enough emotion in the screenplay of ""Tron"" to even enable Warner to give the audience a wink or a nod, or to make the villain really fun in any way. He just sort of represents the generic mindset of corporate greed, which ironically enough is basically what produced this movie itself at Disney if you ask me. I read that there was a much more interesting story concept for ""Tron"" in development at one point but it was dumbed down by the higher ups in the company.This could have been a really special movie, with a few changes to the production and the cast. I'm glad I saw this in the theater, because the effects and the visual aspects of the movie are by far the reason it's remembered and valued. I just can't rate the film highly even for kids, because I didn't enjoy it myself at the time. Kids are just like adults, they still want some emotion from the characters and something to the plot besides just a one dimensional quest.",TRON

45,hellraiser7,Computer Warriors,10,28 February 2020,"This is one of my favorite films of all time. This was also a film that came out on my birthyear which makes it even more special. This film is also a childhood gem, I saw this film when I was seven it was one of the first sci-fi films I've ever seen. When I saw this film for the first time it just blew me away because I never seen anything like it. And, I have played the ""Tron"" and ""Discs of Tron"" arcade games which are awesome, another one of the very first video games I've ever played, but also part of how I heard about this film.This film really was something special as it not just helped finally bring the cyberpunk sci-fi subgenre to the silver screen which at the time was a genre rarely touched upon and still is. But really gave us a new way in seeing movies and film making. It really was ahead of it's time in many ways as it predates the films ""The Matrix"" and ""Ready Player One"" but also was a partial influence on the CG animated TV show ""Reboot"" (original version). The film was also somewhat of a dream come true for me as I was a kid in the 80's I was highly into video games and computers.I really like the whole concept of the movie which I think is very imaginative, how cyberspace is a living world we've created, which might not be that far off when you think about all of the principles in computer tech, AI, and everything else whose to say no world was created. The plotline is also good if nothing totally new but plausible as it's about an intelligent computer program called the MCP (Master Control Program) that develops a god complex and wants to take over the world though the world's computer networks. I like the fact that part of this plotline was actually prolific on the concept of A.I.(Artificial Intelligence) as well as the type of computer that the MCP resides which is similar to the kind of table touch computers you see in TV shows ""Hawaii Five O"" (revival version), ""NCIS"" and others.Characters are solid and well-acted. From Bruce Boxleitner as Tron, who is also known as Captain Sheridan in ""Babylon 5"" for sci-fi TV show fans. He's an archetypal straight-laced hero but I just like his performance as Bruce is always good at playing the strong authority type.Though the two that stand out are Sark/Mr. Dillinger played well by one of my favorite actors David Warner. Sark is pretty much an archetypal villain but it's really David's performance that makes him enjoyable. He just has real presence from the design of his outfit with the glowing red but it's really the head gear I like which is designed like a samurai helmet, he's basically a cyberspace samurai warlord. I really love his vocal delivery which just conveys menace and can almost make you nervous as he's just ruthless and gets easily teed off when things don't go right.Jeff Bridges another actor I like is good as main protagonist Flynn. His character is a computer/tech genius that is a little on the cocky side but in a harmless sense. He's a fun protagonist as he's got some really good lines, but is a person that just always on the light side of things as it seems like he's always having fun, but also he does know when the fun stops and he buckles down to do what's right.However, this is a film that's more style overtopping substance and there's nothing wrong with that as we're really in this movie more for the adventures and the world ventured. I really love how the cyberspace world is built, it really looks otherworldly as it a world with dark skies but lots and lots of lighted land and people. I think it's a cool look and a unique one, where in most sci-fi shows and movies they always have to make cyberspace look like the real world which to me has gotten really old. Here, they go for the alien/otherworld concept which I think is cooler and makes more sense when you think about it, whose to say the world behind the computer screen is going to look like our own. There is just so much to see and going on in this world it will just eat your eyes whole, and it's the kind of place I would love to go into and explore.I love the fact this film was done all in CGI and all in green screen which was a revolutionary concept for it's time as there never has been a film done that way before, it really predated films like ""Sin City"", ""Avatar"", and many others that have used this method now. However, this film was the first and still one of the best in my book because it's one of the examples of CGI when used the right way. And in a way the film literally invented the concept as the makers of the film really had to take the computer tech they had and take it the next step which I'll admit is an amazing feet not just in filmmaking but in technological development.The music is awesome, this film has one of my favorite movie tracks of all time and this is by one of my favorite rock bands Journey. The music really fits the film well gives it that technological, adventurous and otherworldly feel.
The action is solid there are a lot of fun sequence. One which is one of my favorite battles of all time is the disc battle with Tron in this cross arena, where he is constantly blocking and deflecting light discs from four red opponents.The light discs are one of my favorite fictional weapons of all time as their pretty much laser frisbees, what cool about them is not just the fact they leave a laser trail and can dereze opponents but the fact you can control them with you mind as you throw them, they can go as fast or slow and can change direction however you want to.But of course, my favorite is the Light Cycle battle, I remember seeing those light cycles in action let alone the design of them, I wanted to drive one of them. I like that the light cycles weapon is creating a light wall trail and the object is to get ahead of your opponent and converge on him with the wall for him to run into. I thought that was a really cleaver where it's a race that is also a dog fight, kind of like the ""Mario Kart"" franchise well kind of. But I remember I was always on the edge of my seat on that sequence and as a kid I would put my hands up pretending I was riding one of the cycles and I would imitate certain turns the good guys made.Though there is some substance in the film, I like how it has a bit of the mythological and philosophical concept on Gods and Mortals. I really like the idea that we the users of computers are looked at as gods, which is kind of mind blowing when you think about it but not far off when you think of how you use your terminals every day. It sort of makes you think about how the gods we worship have some sort of world similar to ours and if their not any different from us as they possibly deal with the same dilemmas as us, as Flynn character states things for users aren't any easier.Really also like how the whole god hood thing is played out as we see when Flynn comes down we see as Greek mythology states he has became a demi god as he has god like powers from being able to operate a Recognizer machine and divert a beam. It makes sense since he's not from the world of cyberspace that means he doesn't biologically abide by the same rules which gives him the freedom to bend, break and make new rules which is much like with computer programing.Also, we see that the MCP's goal is to attain God hood. He does this from appropriating programs but also by denying the existence of users to make himself the supreme being in the program's eyes. But this is deception, the MCP has been written by a user, so despite how much power the MCP wields it doesn't shield him from his mortality, nor does it make him a god.Tron is an illumination of fun and wonder.Rating: 4 stars",TRON
46,freemantle_uk,Entering the Grid,7,12 November 2011,"Back in 1982 Disney was starting to take their first attempts of making sci-fi films, starting with TRON, an revolution for computer graphics. Whilst the film was not a success at the time it has become a cult classic and after 28 years a sequel was released.Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is a skilled software engineer and arcade owner who attempts to hack into ENCOM's computers to retrieve evidence that the company executive Ed Dillinger (David Warner) had stolen his computer games codes. Dillinger himself runs a programme called Master Control (voiced by Warner) and uses it to commit corporate espionage and he Dillinger discontinues the TRON programme that could act as a third party watch on other programs. But Master Control has gone rogue and starts to hack into the Pentagon and Kremlin.Flynn and his friends Alan (Bruce Boxleitner) and Lora (Cindy Morgan) break into ENCOM so Flynn could straight into the system, but Master Control uses a experimental laser to teleport the man into the digital world. In this new world Flynn not only has to survive in the computer but also has to stop Master Control.TRON was made at a time when computer games and home computing was starting to grown and the film makers wanted to tap into that. It was also a time of growing paranoia about the grown computers, Wargames was only released a year later. Ideas in TRON seem to be an influence or at a coincidence in other films, TV shows and comics, such as The Terminator, The Matrix, Digimon being ones on the top of my head. The design for Master Control was also very similar to VIKI in I, Robot, who also have similar plans.The big selling point of the film is the visuals. The scenes in the real world are shot much like other sci-fi of them. There are some dark scenes in offices, the arcade and the cityscape, but there are also bright, well light scenes in the sterile environment in the labs. But it is the computer world scenes we are most interested in and it is basically what would it be like in a 1980s arcade game. It was both dark and black, with bright colours all around. The director Steven Lisberger certainly used what was new technology to its fullest and he made a fast paced film with grand set pieces. The beginning of the film also reminded of some fantasy, Master Control being like an evil ruler or wizard, rounding people up, torturing people and even threatens his own people.The film also reminded me of a childish idea I used to have that all computing is interlinked, including computer games and many basic things that are electronic. But obviously I outgrown that idea and this was a film where ideas of computing and the internet were at a very early stage.Bridges plays cocky man who is incredibly skilled but can also rub people the wrong way. He had good interplay with Boxleitner, both having a love triangle and being antagonistic towards each other despite being one the same side. Warner too gives Dillinger some depth because he is shocked that Master Control has developed his own consciousness and blackmails him, fearing what machine could do with high politics. Also Boxleitner and Warner also made sure they were playing different characters from one the in the real world to the ones in the character.I have to say some of the plot elements are a bit predictable and it was simply a quest film, but they has been much worst and stupid ideas been put to film.Overall, TRON is enjoyable I think an overall IMDb rating of 7.2/7.3 would be fair.",TRON
47,drqshadow-reviews,A Decidedly Disney Dose of Faded Futurism,5,14 September 2020,"Back in the days when digitization was tomorrow's creeping threat and computer programmers were modern-day wizards, Disney toyed with those preconceptions in a bold, experimental mixed narrative. Now, nearly forty years later, Tron serves as a curious time capsule and obvious trail blazer, if not a particularly good film. It splits time between two distinct landscapes: the physical world of dim video arcades, outlaw hackers and evil executives, plus a metaphorical digital reality with stylized unitards, neon grids and airbrushed horizons.The splashy graphics of the latter are what everyone associates with the picture, a jittering display of cutting edge techniques and loud influences that correctly anticipated countless visual trends of the coming decade. Back in grade school, I carried Trapper Keepers that stole, shamelessly, from this movie. Still, with so many years between then and now, nothing else has managed to look quite like Tron. Computer-aided effects have come miles since '82 - most of the big chase sequences, for example, look quaint in a modern light - but it's still memorably one-of-a-kind. By contrast, the storytelling is sluggish and obtuse, a mixed-up dinosaur that slings too many allegories for its own good. Eye candy is nice and all, but when that sugar rush crashes in the second act, the plot is just too convoluted, too concept-heavy, to compensate. That's usually the point where I fall asleep.Creatively ambitious and highly influential, Tron can't escape its snoozier tendencies. It's a textbook example of style over substance, despite the best efforts of young Jeff Bridges and a talented team of concept artists.",TRON

So too is the praise for its far-seeing look at a world that did not yet exist, but would soon come to be, as well as its mood enhancing electronic score. But I don't think it gets enough credit for its clever subtext (religious, corporate and Cold War) and for not letting its story--however basic on the margins--get lost and buried under the techno-wonder of it all.",TRON
49,jimbo-53-186511,"The first half of the film is compelling and interesting, but the second half is pretty lame",4,3 February 2017,"Computer hacker Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is abducted by the master computer programme for Encom and is plunged into a 'cyber' life or death battle with this computer programme. With the help of his friends and former co-workers Tron (Bruce Boxlietner) and Yori (Cindy Morgan), Flynn attempts to overthrow Dillinger and his master programmer and reclaim rights to an idea that he had originally conceived which has been stolen from him by Dillinger.I actually enjoyed this film in its early stages and liked where the film was going; the idea of a computer literate person hacking into a computer main frame is an example of a very early form of espionage and back in 1982 this was clearly something revolutionary and in this respect it means that a film like Tron was way ahead of its time. Like I say it is engaging in its first half when we learn what Dillinger has done and why Flynn is so determined to access and bypass Encom's security protocol...It's a shame then that the director and writers never followed up on what they tease and promise in the first half. In the second half, we lose the intelligent plotting and carefully crafted character motivations in place of a lot of really cheap, dated and lame looking computer graphics (I'm aware that these things might have been cool 'back in the day,' but they look really naff now). The sight of computer tanks and some kind of flying objects chasing our protagonists round a computer matrix at 5 miles an hour might have looked cool in the 80's but nowadays it looks silly and I hasten to add that it also didn't exactly add any tension to the picture or make me fear for the protagonists. To me, it seemed clear that the director got bored of the intelligent plotting and let his ADHD kick in at around the 45 minute mark; I can almost imagine him saying 'Yes let's get to the cool looking computer graphics and if I put loads of cool looking graphics on the screen maybe I won't have to finish the story that I started telling' Yes well I'm sorry Steven, but this might have worked back in the 80's and it may still work for nerdy teens, but mature audiences are not going to buy it for one second.The film also has a major flaw in its virtual world; at one point Flynn attacks a baddie whose outfit has red on it and by making contact with him Flynn's blue outfit automatically changes to red. This colour swapping aspect is introduced to the film for no real reason yet it clearly could have proved more pivotal to the story. For example, Flynn seems shocked that making contact with a rival individual within the computer vortex means that you adopt their colours yet he designed the programme?? Or looking at it another way, maybe the master computer programme has made some alterations to Flynn's programme, but if that's the case surely he could have just allowed his crew to make contact with one of Flynn's cronies so that Flynn believed that the enemy was one of his crew??Despite a promising start, this film finishes on a pretty lousy note and the second half is nothing more than a cheap assortment of pretty colours and computer graphics with barely a narrative to be seen. It is perhaps good for a few unintentional laughs and those with a guilty pleasure for 1980's cheese may get something out of it. As for me, I found it very disappointing particularly given how promising it was for the first 45 minutes.",TRON

For me, someone who has no knowledge of computer programming and the sort, it's a very slow, tedious and boring watch.'Tron', unfortunately, didn't take my interest whatsoever. Not helped by the poor special effects (they get a pass due to it being an 1982 release; though I'm not convinced it's good either way) and forgettable cast performances, it's not a premise that's easy to get into if you have no prior understanding of coding etc.There is some intrigue in there, but not nearly enough to satisfy my viewing pleasure - it felt like a much longer run time than 96 minutes, that's for sure. All cool if you love this, but I very much didn't. Hopefully the 2010 sequel gives the concept a major boost.",TRON

The script could have used further fleshing out and the religious themes are not explored as much as they should have been. The first ten minutes are near incomprehensible in how much they throw at the audience too.And yet, there is something hypnotic and compelling about this odd, undeniably nerdy movie. It was intended to be a big blockbuster megahit, but it has all the quirkiness of an independent production. The over-calculated plotting and overemphasis on action so common to modern blockbuster fare is nowhere to be found here. The world of TRON was like nothing audiences had ever seen before and even now, there's an eerie, quaint beauty to the visuals. Sure, they don't look ""realistic,"" but I don't think they were ever meant to be.I get why people dismiss the movie, but it's just so earnest and imaginative that I admire it a great deal.

The basic storyline is about a company controlled by a master control program and a programmer who cheated his way to the top. The programmer who was cheated from, played by Jeff Bridges, is trying to find proof of this and is transported into the program by the MCP to play games to survive. We are then transported into the computer world, where most of the rest of the movie takes place. A small band, including the tron program(which is a security system), a girl(of course) and the Bridges's character try to conquer the MCP and free the system from the evil dictator. The light cycles are pretty cool and the master control program is pretty well done but the problem is we never really care for the people and the characterizations are pretty lame. David Warner, plays the evil MCP and is believable but Bruce Boxleitner as Tron is not. Good try by Disney to enter a different type of film-making world but the story doesn't lift itself enough to make this movie a winner.",TRON
53,gcd70,Worth Kids Flick,5,2 February 2008,"Movie mogul Disney Pictures (which now incorporates Touchstone) presented in 1982 this worthy kids flick about three computer hackers who determine to overrun an all controlling computer program called the M.C.P. (Master Control Program) which has shut down their priority access code.The technical crew have worked overtime on the wiz bang computer graphics and the result is an innovative movie with some impressive f/x. Of course it has nothing on ""Star Wars"" dazzling miniature effects, and both ""T2"" and ""Jurassic Park"" have long since outdated it, but ""Tron"" still looks great all the same.Jeff Bridges, Bruce Boxleitner, Cindy Morgan and David Warner are the real life players who do battle for and against the M.C.P. on both sides of the computer screens. In the real world (as 'Users') they find it nearly impossible to confront their nemesis and so must face their foe within the computer as 'Programs', and there try to destroy him.Lisberger's original plot premise is an interesting supposition of how programs might operate within a mainframe computer if they were slightly 'human'. Always enjoyable fare, the script unfortunately lacks the sharpness and effective humour required to make the transition from children's viewing to adult adventure. Also missing from writer/director Steven Lisberger's show are sufficiently involving characters that would have given ""Tron"" extra depth.

While most science fiction movies of today blow Tron out of the water, the movie still holds a true (cult) audience. The ending of the movie, the hidden depiction of a future world that is similar to the fantasy setting of Tron makes the story true science fiction. In fact, much of the movie is reality with the rise of the computer age and the corporation. The cast may seem too ""white"" because it is.

Overall, I loved it. I thought it was well ahead of its time, and a film that will be considered the patron saint of modern special effects and even digital animation. But one thing I noticed about the film was the political overtones. Clearly, Disney was trying to present themselves as a purely democratic entity, making this a film a good example of their beliefs. This entire movie wreaks of communism and its destructive grip on humanity and self expression. TRON (who was well played by Bruce Boxleitner) isn't just a computer program, he is the embodiment of America, a figure head for freedom. He believes in his fight as just and proper. It seems fitting to make a film about destroying communism considering our cold war with the Soviet Union (which was called the Master Control Program) and our involvement in the Arab countries during the time of this film's release.

56,Blueghost,A question of existence.,10,18 March 2009,"Or, ""My two bits""..., or ""Goddard, for the masses"" This film was way ahead of its time. If you view it as a simple CGI adventure mixed with live action, then you'll think it something quaint, or, at the very least, cute in a nostalgic kind of way. But this film is so much more, and it implores you to open your mind.I have to admit that I was a Star-Trek/Star-Wars sci-fi snob back in the late 70s, and much throughout the 80s. And, I am ashamed and sad to say that I rode the ""they cheated with computers"" SFX hype that haunted this truly wonderful and deeply insightful film. The film makers experimented with then cutting edge technology to enhance the theme they were trying to convey.As stated by director Steven Lisberger the point of this film wasn't simply to dazzle the audience of the early 80s with new visuals. It was to introduce a burgeoning world outside the general public's experience with stunning visuals that complimented the story and theme of the film.What we get aren't the nearly photo-realistic CGI images we're so used to in today's big budget productions. We presented a machined world that operates with precision, but that can be regimented under tyranny or opened to create fantastic beauty. This, in and of itself, comments on the ""real world"" counterparts who have created Tron's world.But the film goes deeper than that. It's not merely an adventure story, nor a story of seeking restitution, nor some mere social commentary. No. This film truly digs at the soul of mankind by asking what and who we are as a self aware species. It's dressed up with a few zingers, some light adventure and derring-do, but, if you pay attention to the story and dialogue, it truly hits upon primal themes.Who are we? What are we doing here? Good sci-fi takes those questions a step further, and it's given to us in a very clever piece of cinema that's not only interesting to look at, but also fun to watch.There's a lot of contemporary criticism of the dated CGI by some of the other user comments. This bothers me some. One wonders what they were expecting from a film made in 1982. Having worked in SFX, seen cutting edge graphics on high end computers of the 80s before the days of 3D accelerator cards for Pentium computers, all I can say is that I'm still impressed not only with the scope of the visuals, but the sheer scale of imagination. Tron's world looks like a world a living breathing piece of software would live in and spend time in. The tanks aren't CGI M1 Abrams, but something truly unique. A design unto themselves to accentuate the mood and feel of their environment, and the mind of the creator.I'm going to go out on a limb here, but one can also truly say that this is also a very ""religous"" or spiritual film. It doesn't just contain an existential theme, but it also alludes to the notion of a higher existence. A life after this one. A creator, or perhaps pantheon of deities. And yet, like all great sci-fi allegories, the message is cleverly wrapped, camouflaged if you will, in a nice elegant tale of adventure.And that's why this film is so good. It's not just about people, computers and people uniquely interacting with computers with some whiz-bang SFX. It's a real exploration of the human soul.Oh sure, there're some jokes, some stunts and moments of high energy, but there're also some very tender moments. When the film starts to wrap up at the end. As an example, it is truly comforting to witness true love and romance in the electronic world, and a manifestation of it as introduced by Jeff Bridge's character, who plays a kind of Prometheus in matters of both heart and mind. And that adds a whole new layer of profundity to an already hearty film.I personally gave it a pass when it was in theatres, and am sorry to say that I did. But, after seeing a little bit of it on HBO, my sci-fi snobbery changed to one of welcome acceptance, and I soon went out and rented the VHS. It's a film that's stayed with me for a long time. And when the special edition DVD hit the shelves, I grabbed it right away.Truly a remarkable film. If you didn't get anything out of it the first time, then give it another chance. If you simply like it for what it is, then that's all anyone can ask. If you're a little curious as to what I posted here in my comments, then I urge you to view it once more with an open mind. You won't regret it.Enjoy :-)",TRON

59,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Nostalgic for its time and entertaining even if with its flaws,7,13 January 2013,"If anyone knew that this science fiction adventure was on its way, my bet would be on the viewers who saw Disney's The Black Hole (1979) three years before. It started out with an electronic grid that digitally introduced the opening credits and it resembles what director Steven Lisberger's most famous film uses in CGI. My question is, why didn't Lisberger go any further than the 80s? Sure he was a producer for long awaited sequel, Tron Legacy (2010), but he hasn't done much else since. Did he lose the Hollywood bug? He made a decent film here.The plot is about a computer whiz named Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), who created an entertaining gaming software for a company called Encom. That is until a corrupt co-worker named Ed Dillinger (David Warner) stole his ideas and became the head of the department. Along with Dillinger, is an electronic associate named the MCP (Master Control Program) that is self aware of its ability to collect data. One day Flynn decides to go back to the building he was fired from and regain the files that were stolen from him. But as he tries to hack into the system, he is zapped into cyberspace from the MCP. There, he must find a way to get back home with the files he needs to reclaim what's rightfully his.What's neat is how Lisberger visualized the world of the computer. It is stylistically creative. Each character or ""program"" in this electronic universe wears a suit that is either colored blue or red. Red means they belong to the MCP. And amazingly, this is not done by a physically lit suit. It was all CGI. That's pretty impressive for 1982. But as everyone knows, the most famous thing Tron (1982) is noted for, is its lightcycle races. Tiny motorcycles that can only make 90 degree turns. It's unusual but its cool anyways.As Flynn navigates himself through this new world, he also makes new friends. Tron, a program created by a real friend of Flynn named Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) and Ram played by Dan Shor. My favorite character was the ""bit"" who only knows how to say yes and no, very humorous. What was also clever about these characters is that they are all played by their creator. Boxleitner plays Tron and Bradley, Bridges plays Clu (a program he created) and Flynn and so on. I do have to call love interests into question though. There were a few times where it looked like there would be a love interest but it was never addressed. Did Lisberger forget to write an ending for it? I don't get it.I liked the special effects a lot. For their time, it was quite an inventive feat to pull off such cinema magic. The action that takes place using these effects were well performed as well. Each sequence looked authentic, like they were really apart of that world. I also enjoyed the music that Wendy Carlos' scored for the film. It did have a reoccurring theme although I don't think it was prevalent enough. But it did go together well with each scene. Since the movie took place inside a computer, it is understandable to why Carlos had synthesizers in her soundtrack. Fairly entertaining.Tron is the first movie to literally dive into the mainframe of a computer and its visuals are one of a kind. The characters' relationship to each other can be confusing and Wendy Carlos' score isn't John Williams scope, but it works.",TRON
60,lewiskendell,It's like you always thought: there are little people in your computer!,6,4 July 2010,"On the other side of the screen, it all looks so easy.""It's all-out war inside a powerful corporate computer, as the evil Master Control Program and his villainous user hold sway over all the other programs that fall into their grasp. It's up to a few determined programs and a human User with godlike powers, to restore order to the system.It would be a massive understatement for me to say that I'm excited about Tron: Legacy. It has Olivia Wilde in it, it looks really cool, it has Olivia Wilde in it, the teaser trailer was awesome, and, did I mention that it has Olivia Wilde in it? I thought that since there's a pretty strong chance I'm going to see it, I should watch the original movie so that I'll know what's going on. Thankfully, Tron is good enough that it would have been worth watching, anyway.It's definitely an 80's movie. You'll be able to tell that not only from the characters, language, and the settings, but from the special effects. Some of them are really cool, like the light cycles and the costumes of the programs. Others are incredibly cheesy, like the giant face of Master Control (he looks like Zordon from Power Rangers). The plot takes a little while to get going, but once we get inside the computer, it's an exciting ride until the end of the movie. It helps a lot if you're somewhat familiar with computer programming and video games, but it's not totally necessary. Tron is a fun movie that is pretty impressive if you judge it by the standards of the time it was made. If you're a fan of the 80's, want to see a young Jeff Bridges showcasing early signs of The Dude, or the story sounds interesting to you, you shouldn't hesitate to check Tron out.",TRON
61,WeAreLive,Space Paranoids,7,15 November 2017,This movie was never really in my era when it was out but this was pretty good considering the time it was made. There was of good acting from Bruce as Tron and David Warner was also very good as Sark and the voice of the MCP.This movie also did include lots of different puzzles that were good for my brain and the characters in the film to solve.The only problem with the movie is that it is too short and the effects weren't that advanced at the time when it was made considering it was made 17 years before I was born. Which I know can't be helped because of the technology at the time.,TRON
62,denis888,A masterpiece that was before Matrix,10,14 July 2006,"I saw this excellent funny movie back in the 1980's still in the Soviet Union times, and I fell in love with this work at once. Yesterday, when I watched this again, my feelings just reinforced. Maybe, so many people do not like the Tron because they took it too seriously. No, just watch it with a grain of humor and irony and you will love it. I am still amazed that even in 1982 people could draw such intricate video effects and then they still look very fresh. But even they are not the main catch. What I really love is the marvelous play of Jeff Bridges. He looks so merrily and fresh and he certainly doesn't get all that so seriously that you immediately believe him. Anyway, the very idea of somebody stealing your programs and being in fact a hacker seems so up-to-date today. The evil Mr. Dillinger and his alter ego inside the computer is performed with a chilling truth. I do recommend this masterwork for all those who thought that all computer effects first appeared in Matrix or even later.""",TRON
63,Jeremy_Urquhart,Somewhat confused about the cult following,5,29 January 2020,"For everything the original Tron almost does right, it does at least one thing wrong. I could barely engage with a single second of this storyline, nor could I get attached to the characters, and the film takes about a third of its runtime before it even starts to make any kind of sense. I feel like it might as well just get by on the early CGI effects, the iconic bikes, the colours, and some of Jeff Bridges' charm that I guess he can't help but exude.Watching this almost forty years on from its release, I feel like that's about all there is. Why is it so narratively broken and un-engaging? How can there be so much effort put into creating this digital world and giving audiences new special effects, whilst there also feel likes there's almost no effort putting into making the basic story interesting?It's such a frustrating movie; very sporadically engaging, and sometimes cool to look at, especially by wondering how they pulled it all off. But at the end of the day, it sort of feels like a somehow less interesting, less fun version of something like THX 1138, which is odd because I reckon on paper this movie was supposed to be more exciting, and THX 1138 is clearly going for something more thoughtful and low-key. Tron has the feel of an adventure film but there's very little about it that's particularly fun, besides, as mentioned before, Jeff Bridges on occasion. Even then, his character isn't amazing, and it's not like his performance is particularly great. I guess the rest of the movie's so lifeless that you have to hold onto what you can.30 years later they'd try rebooting the franchise with the marginally better Tron: Legacy, though that one falls victim to many of the faults of this one too. Maybe Tron should just be left as a cool concept; a cool idea that looks cool, but not be made into decidedly not cool movies anymore. Tron: Legacy gets tedious as it goes on, and this one is more or less tedious from the get-go. It can be watched from a historical perspective, as a chapter in the ongoing story of special effects in film. This is one of the only things that stops me rating it any lower than a pretty underwhelming (and honestly sort of generous) 5/10. But if you wanted to watch this for any other reason, I'd say stay away and spend your 96 minutes on something else.",TRON
64,emasterslake,The ancestor to the common CGI movies.,8,14 March 2006,"I got to see this movie for the first time recently.And it's a cool movie. Tron is taken place during the early 80s involving this highly advance computer company that hold the smartest computer of it's time. The Master Control Encom, able to detect software pirates, and has the power to run other computers throughout the country.A new device is made at that company that's able to digitalized objects into a computer.A computer expert named Kevin Flynn has be digitalized into the company's computer.And a computer word is different from the real world. Video Games are a survival of life, love isn't a common thing there, and escaping from this computer world is merely impossible.Kevin Flynn must find a way to defeat the Master Control, and find a way home with the help of Tron a program that's able to defend and fight off evil.It's a unique flick. I recommend it to those who like movies that have early done CGI that's different from today's standards.",TRON
65,mentalcritic,The film that The Matrix wishes it was,10,26 November 2004,"In 1982, the concept of artificial intelligence was advanced enough that a gamer could easily defeat a computer opponent if he memorised the sequence of moves that the AI followed. A computer capable of handing the intense mathematical calculations CGI entailed often took up an entire room. Video games were strictly two-dimensional, and often consisted of video displays that a legally blind man could make out the individual pixels in. Yet they were considerably more fun than most of the annoyances we have to bear with today. The reason for this is as simple as it is obvious. In 1982, programmers realized that graphics are not what make a game fun because graphics could not be made as ""real"" as they are now.Tron fell flat at the box office because the concepts it dealt with were not in the public consciousness. Home computers from many manufacturers were duelling for market share, and the idea that the market could one day all be controlled by one monolithic corporation was far from anyone's mind. This little fact is what keeps Tron relevant nearly twenty-five years later. However, as the information age grew into focus, the number of films that openly steal from Tron are numerous. They try to capture the same level of excitement and intrigue, but they fall down because of an inability to make the audience care about the characters.Tron begins with simple interactions between the world of the programs and the world of the humans, some of which are programmers, or users as they are called here. The sequence in which one user, Flynn, is sucked into the world of the programs, well, let's just say that the Wachowski brothers obviously watched it very carefully before they penned the screenplay for The Matrix. Only in this case, it is done with much more credibility and impact.Many have talked about the curse that plagues film adaptations of video games. Tron was the first of many films to have a video game adapted from it, the reasons for which should be clear when one watches the game sequences. During the middle act of the film, Flynn is made to compete in a couple of video games, the first of which, while quite clearly based upon Pong, was adapted more or less element-for-element into a crude tennis game. The latter is more notorious, however. The concept of bicycles that create walls behind them as they move, into which one tries to run an opponent, is one of the simple concepts that kept old 4-bit video game machines like the Atari 2600 profitable for so long.It has been said that it is difficult to understand what is going on, which is hogwash. Once you learn some of the basics of computing, or rather the concepts that Microsoft would like to keep hidden from the user such as input-output addresses and the like, and learn to pay attention to dialogue, it is incredibly easy to follow this story. It is, in fact, one of the best renderings of computer concepts on the big screen to date, which is a sad indictment upon Hollywood when you consider how far technology in both areas has come since 1982.I gave Tron a ten out of ten. It entertained me immeasurably when I was a child growing up on the cusp of VHS technology. As an adult who is having endless fun with the recordable DVD technology, it entertains me even more. Few things grow more relevant with time, in both happy and sad ways, but Tron is amongst them. If every science-fiction film in which computers and artificial intelligence figured heavily were up to this standard, film critics would have a lot less to do.",TRON
66,hall895,A great achievement. But not a great movie.,4,27 July 2012,"TRON is a landmark film. Wonderfully visionary, a monumental technical achievement. It made possible so many later films which we came to know and love. There, now that we've got that out of the way can we point out that TRON is not a good movie? It has plenty of technological wizardry but the film is sorely lacking in entertainment. The story is weak, doing very little to grab the viewer. It doesn't matter how much of a visual spectacle your film is if the story doesn't engage. Director Steven Lisberger seems to have lost sight of that. Give Lisberger and his crew credit for pulling off something which in 1982 seemed truly impossible. But the innovative technology is all this film has going for it.TRON takes place largely inside a computer. Have you ever wondered what goes on inside your computer? Apparently Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner are in there tossing Frisbees around. Now that just sounds silly. But that's OK, silly can at times be entertaining. This is not one of those times. Entertainment here is in desperately short supply. Bridges gives the film a little juice, providing some humor and creating a character you care about at least a little bit. Boxleitner on the other hand is a dud, a total wet blanket with all the personality of a doorknob. And that's a problem since Boxleitner plays Tron himself. Or is it Tron itself? Because you see these characters are playing computer programs. Well, except for Bridges, he's a person but he's in the computer anyway. Yeah, it's all very weird. Could have been wonderfully weird but it isn't. The story just kind of sits there, it's never developed properly. There's the requisite villain and the requisite girl but really it's just a big light show. For 1982 a very impressive light show but still just a light show nonetheless. It takes more than a light show to make a film. You need to actually have something happen. In this film there's not nearly enough going on to hold the viewer's interest. The dazzling (for their time) visuals only take you so far. In its time TRON was something special. But time has been unkind. What was revolutionary in 1982 is mundane today. And the film doesn't have a story to fall back on. We see it with so many big-budget visual extravaganza films today. It doesn't matter how good your film looks if the story stinks. Story is always the most important thing. And the story lets TRON down. Bravo for the vision. Bravo for having the technological know-how to bring the vision to the screen. TRON was a wonderful technological achievement. But there are other films you can say that about which were also wonderful entertainment. Here TRON falls well short.",TRON
67,Beta_Gallinger,"Not very good acting, but still a visually groundbreaking sci-fi piece with a fairly stimulating plot",7,4 December 2010,"This sci-fi film came to the silver screen 28 years ago, which was four years before I was born. I never heard of it for a very long time, but last month, just before I finally watched it for the first time, the title sounded familiar. Maybe it was one of the ""TRON"" video games I had heard about, since there have apparently been a number of those made since the movie which they are based on. When I first watched this movie, I found it to be dull for quite a while, but then it improved. I felt that it could be better with a second viewing, so with the sequel, ""Tron: Legacy"", coming into theatres soon, I watched the original again, not long after my first viewing. This time, it still wasn't quite as good as I had hoped, as I still found the significant flaws in it which I remembered from before, but I was hoping I was right in believing that it would be better that second time, and I think that happened, even if it wasn't exactly a major improvement.Kevin Flynn is a former employee of a software company called ENCOM, but now runs a video arcade. He developed several video games while working for ENCOM, but Ed Dillinger, the senior executive, took the credit for these games, presenting them as his own ideas! Flynn has been trying to hack into the software company's mainframe to find evidence to prove that Dillinger is a fraud, but all his attempts prove to be unsuccessful. One night, Flynn sneaks into ENCOM's laser lab with the help Alan Bradley and his girlfriend, Dr. Lora Baines. In here, Flynn tries to break into the system, but the very powerful Master Control Program does not approve of this, so he digitizes Flynn, sucking him out of the real world and into the digital world, where programs have the same faces as their creators from the real world! Here, the former ENCOM employee is held captive and forced to take part in gladiatorial games with captive programs until he is killed! In order to have any chance of escaping this and getting back to the real world, Flynn must work with other programs, including Tron, developed by Bradley, and somehow put an end to the MCP and his oppression of the other programs in the system! Throughout the film, the acting is continuously lacklustre. There aren't too many cast highlights, if any. For this, 1982's ""TRON"" definitely loses some points, but it's not enough to completely ruin the experience. This sci-fi flick is known for its groundbreaking CGI effects, which certainly look primitive by today's standards, as there have been so many advancements in technology since this was made, but they still look good here, with some nice colours. The digital world in this film basically looks like a video game from around the time this was made, with graphics which are fairly simple but still pleasing to the eye. Plotwise, the movie isn't quite a stunner, as it is a little dull as we watch Flynn, Bradley, and Baines conversing before they go to the ENCOM laser lab, but ""TRON"" does get better after this, especially after Flynn is forced into the digital world, with the adventure that ensues, which features some good exciting moments, even if the film as a whole could be more suspenseful. For me, trying to stay into it could be a bit of a struggle, probably largely due to the acting and how hokey the film can look, but overall, I certainly can't say the film completely bored me. I can imagine many people today watching this movie and thinking that everything about it is terrible, but if you want to see a milestone in CGI and know not to expect the visuals here to be anywhere near as advanced as computer effects are known to be these days, this innovative 1982 feature is one you might want to check out.",TRON
68,gftbiloxi,The Story Is Silly--But The Visuals Are Still Stunning,8,28 July 2005,"Disney's TRON received mixed reaction when it debuted in 1982, but now it seems even more visually amazing than when it first appeared. The story is slight: when computer hacker Jeff Bridges attempts to access a computer system to find proof of theft, a self-aware master program responds by digitalizing him and transporting him into the computer itself. Once on the ""other side of the screen,"" he finds himself embroiled in a conflict between programs personified as humanoid beings, some of whom battle against the master program's control.TRON was possibly the first mainstream feature-length films to incorporate computer generated graphics; surprisingly, however, the film relies much more heavily upon various animation techniques that give the appearance of being computer generated. Much of the art concept was inspired by arcade games that were popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and as such some viewers accuse the film of being ""primative"" in design: after all, our ideas about computers and computer graphics have changed quite a lot in the past 30 years. But in fact, computer graphics have moved increasingly toward simulations of reality; the complete unreality of TRON is part of what makes the film both effective and enjoyable.TRON is visually fascinating, seemingly made with DVD in mind, and I found the DVD transfer quite good. The ""anniversary"" edition includes a second DVD with bonus material that ranges from a fairly lengthy ""Making Of"" documentary to storyboards and art designs; the ""Making Of"" is quite interesting and gives the viewer a good sense of the challenges the technicians faced in creating the film.

70,ajs-10,Still holds up today!....,7,25 November 2010,"In anticipation of the forthcoming Tron Legacy, I thought I'd go a bit retro and take a look at the 1982 original. I remember being blown away by the whole concept when it first came out, but now I'm a tad older and several tads wiser, it's maybe lost a bit of its awe. Don't get me wrong, it's still a pretty enjoyable film But more of that later, here's a short summary before I tell you what I really think (summary haters please wait on the game-grid until the end of the next paragraph).Kevin Flynn is a programmer who has been swindled by his old boss, Ed Dillinger. In order to find evidence of Dillinger's con Kevin must break into the system holding the data. He is assisted by his friends, Alan Bradley and Lora. Little do they know a rogue Master Control Program (MCP), written by Dillinger, has taken over the system. Flynn is digitised and sucked into the system, where programs take on the form of their programmers. He is forced to take part in gladiatorial games, at the behest of the MCP, but he escapes with two other programs, Tron and Ram. Now Tron was written by Alan Bradley and is designed to take down the MCP. The trio must make their way to the MCP before it becomes too powerful. They are pursued by the MCP's most powerful warrior, Sark. Will they make it in time? Well, I guess I'd better leave it there, don't want to give too much away.Although it does look fairly dated by today's standards, I think the effects stand up pretty well. You can tell they spent a lot of time and money getting it to look as good as it does. Unfortunately some of the dialogue is a bit wooden, particularly in the first half hour, and the musical score doesn't exactly set your toes tapping, but I can forgive that. Performance wise, Jeff Bridges did a decent job as Kevin Flynn / Clu, as did Bruce Boxleitner as Alan Bradley / Tron. Honourable mentions also go to; David Warner as Ed Dillinger / Sark / Master Control Program and Cindy Morgan as Lora / Yori.I found it a little dull for the first thirty minutes or so, but after Flynn is sucked into the computer it soon grabbed my attention. It brought back so many memories, I used to love playing the light cycles game at the arcade. But enough nostalgia, although is seems a little dated, it's still perfectly watchable today. I really enjoyed it and I hope the younger generation will also get the chance to see this one Recommended.My score: 6.8/10",TRON
71,itamarscomix,Badly dated,6,2 August 2012,"TRON is ridiculously out of date, but it should be fondly remembered and watched at least once, not for the poor pacing, silly story or horrendous, hammy acting (Boxleitner and Morgan are the real offenders; Bridges and Warner are over the top but are entertaining and effective); but for its visual innovation, which was uniquely monochromatic for its time (early influences on both The Matrix and Sin City, perhaps), and for the fact that it created a computerized world with no CGI whatsoever, making it several years ahead of its time.

The Alternative Universe Is "" A Carousel Of Color"".",9,19 December 2010,"when i was a kid the old 'Wonderful World of Disney' on Sunday nights would start with a song that went ""the world is a carousel of color..."". that must also be true for alternative universes too because i just watched the original 'Tron' for the first time in years and boy...i didn't remember it being quite so psychedelic and colorful. it was actually almost blinding.i have always loved this movie and have defended it from it's many critics for so long that i never imagined it would finally start to get the attention it so rightly deserves. it really was a ground-breaking film in terms of film effects, and along with the 'Black Hole', was among the very last live action features to come from Disney's original Burbank studios. it was also the last film by Ron Miller, Disney's son in law and long time Disney executive and producer. not to mention Disney FX man Art Cruikshank's last Disney flick.i always felt the Disney classics that Ron Miller produced were some of the finest live action films the Burbank studio ever made. films like the 'Black Hole', 'Candleshoe', 'Napoleon and Samantha', and the original 'Freaky Friday'. he really threw himself into the productions of 'Tron' and 'The Black Hole'. even though nobody has ever really verified this to him until now, those films were well worth his effort. there is even a poster of 'The Black Hole' in the boys bedroom at the beginning of 'Tron Legacy'. all i can say to Mr. Miller and the original fans of those films who have stuck by them through neglect and forgetful memories is, hey, we've all come a long way baby.i hadn't seen the original 'Tron' in so long that i was delighted to find that it is still a marvel and a lot of fun. the colors of the original film are even brighter and more Technicolor looking than the muted monochromatic colors of the sequel. and because of the vibrant colors, it also bears more than a passing resemblance to the Disney hand drawn animated features. i sorta felt like i'd been blown over the rainbow into 'OZ' or something.i also think it's kind of amusing that fans are into a movie that had a music score that was composed by a trans-gender composer. Wendy Carlos a.k.a Walter Carlos. the brilliant composer behind such cinematic Goliaths like 'A Clockwork Orange'. the music score for the original 'Tron' has always been so memorable for all of us original fans, and the score for 'Orange' is one of the very best in cinema.the original 'Tron' also shows how wrong a lot of mainstream taste and critics can be. a lot of people i knew back then were fond of 'Tron', but always kind of embarrassed to admit it because of the critical lashings it received. i am proud and vindicated (if not a little scornful) to say i NEVER underestimated this film when everybody else seemed to. oh well. now everybody is going to claim to be a big fan now. it's always that way. being amongst the first is often a lonely and unrecognized thing to do. i can't tell you how many people have trashed my opinion only to find...oh well. you're all the way you are and that's it i guess.this is a wonderful Disney classic and even has some interesting messages about the suppression of religion. i'm so glad that it's reputation is coming into it's own. it's a incredible FX film and deserves more respect than it has generally been given in the past.to all the people who suddenly decided to join this film phenomenon after having trashed it for years...you s--k. to all the hard core Disney buffs that have been faithful and remembered the original Burbank studios, hats off for keeping this film alive and well. we've all been vindicated here. 'Tron Legacy' the sequel, is a true homage to the forgotten and neglected Disney classics. i plan to see it in 3D as soon as can.",TRON

This was the very first movie ever to rely heavily on computer graphic interface (CGI), as I remember from a ""History of Computers"" report that I worked on as a freshman in prep school; that totally convinced me to see this movie someday.The movie: We start off in an arcade. Later on, a scientist was working on a large computer experiment involving an apple. Suddenly, the laser shot the man, putting him into the world of computers!

76,timdalton007,Tron Version 1.0,8,4 January 2011,"Having seen Tron: Legacy at Christmas, I've spent the week or so since then trying to track down the movie that Legacy is a sequel to: 1982's Tron. If you're like me and have been doing the same then the following will come as no surprise: it has become rather hard and/or expensive to find thanks to it being out of print and highly in demand. So imagine my surprise when I went into a local Blockbuster with a friend and found a DVD of it sitting on the shelf. Needless to say I scooped it up and rented it! So, given that I had seen the more recent sequel first, what did I make of the original movie?For starters it has a pretty good cast. Leading the cast is Jeff Bridges as computer programmer turned arcade-owing hacker Kevin Flynn whose attempts to prove that his work was stolen by a rival programmer leads to him being sent into the digital world of the movie. Bridges gives Flynn an eccentric yet everyman quality that, while perhaps not serving the character best in the opening part of the movie, works perfectly when the character of Flynn ends up trying to make sense of the digital world he finds himself in. Bruce Boxleitner plays computer programmer Alan Bradley and his creation: the heroic security program named Tron. The two are very different characters and at times it is hard to believe that are being played by the same actor. Aiding them in both the real and digital world are Cindy Morgan (as Lora and Yori) and Barnard Hughes (as Dr. Walter Gibbs and Dumont) who, like Boxleitner, find ways of making each of their characters different from the other. Opposing them, and perhaps giving the best performances in the movie, is David Warner as program stealing executive Ed Dillinger in the real world as being both the digital world menace of Sark and the electronically distorted voice of the the dictatorial Master Control Program. Put all these actors together and the result is that they give this digitally set movie a human grounding.Which brings us to perhaps the most iconic part of the movie: the digital world the majority of the movie takes place in. Given that the nearly thirty years that have passed since the movie was made have seen a true revolution in special effects, one might expect that the effects (including some of the earliest CGI effects) would look rather passé now. The truth of the matter is in fact quite different: the digital world of Tron is a truly immersive, and highly original, one.The production design, costumes and effects all go towards creating that unique world. The production design imagines a digital world that is both alien and yet familiar with its take on tanks, ships and perhaps most famously cars in the form of light cycles. Then there are all of the unique costumes of the digital characters with their stark whiteness contrasted by the illuminations of the apparent circuitry on them with a truly unusual look being the result. Last but not least on this list is all of the effects work. The effects would seemingly be the most dated part of the original Tron and to some extent this is true on the surface. But if you scratch below the surface you'll discover that those seemingly dated effects are surprisingly effective. Two perfect examples can be found in the light cycle gaming sequence where there is a point of view shot that gives the viewer a true sensation of speeding along a maze of lines or during the chase sequence that follows directly on from it when the ""camera"" follows two ships that are pursuing the escaping light cycles. If you are however looking at the effects of the movie cynically from the viewpoint of today's CGI here is another way of looking at them within the logic of the movie: the film is set and uses early 1980s computers and therefore it makes perfect sense that the digital world reflects the technology of the time rather the more advanced and evolved digital world seen in Legacy. Back to the main point: the result of all these elements put together is that the digital world setting of the film remains both unique and immersive almost thirty years on.No review of the film though would be complete without a discussion of its script or storyline. The basic plot of Tron are quite simplistic: in the real world Flynn is trying to prove that Dillinger stole his programs to further his own career while in the digital world Flynn and Tron end up on a quest to save to free that world from the tyrannical reign of Dillinger's Master Control Program and its minion Sark. The dialogue too is often as simplistic as the plot and can be at times either corny or cringe-worthy. Yet Tron's script and story are full of fascinating ideas: Programs acting as avatars of their programmers with deletions being their literal death (or derezzing), information and programs being sent along by incredible vehicles with energy or light used as paths, and and even religious undertones to the relationship of programs to their users. Tron then, on the script and story level, is very much driven by its ideas rather then its own plot. As a result Tron on the script and story level is very much driven by its ideas rather then its own plot.While it may be lacking in plot, Tron makes up for that in other ways. That includes the cast which makes the most of the duel roles that most of them have. Where it does that mainly though is in the immersive digital world it is set in and the ideas that lie behind it. Tron therefore is perhaps more a triumph of style over substance but it more then makes up for that fact.",TRON

79,vampyrecowboy,Where the story?,4,31 December 2010,"The idea of a hacker transported into a computer having to destroy an evil program was brilliant. But something was missing in ""TRON"". A more developed story, substantial dialogues and, yes, a director capable to do their job in a better way than Steven Lisberger, master and commander of this sadly overrated movie.I'm dazzled with the positive reviews of the many viewers of this wrecked project quoting that this was an underrated film when the time of its release. That's not just the case. The story wasn't that appealing.The real life sequences were far more interesting than the whole visual effects side, that got overlong, boring, and nowadays dated. I was trying not to sleep in many parts of that long race between the characters (something like a car chase scene but instead of cars running chips and programs chasing each other).I'm only watched this movie because I heard that ""TRON Legacy"" is going to be released this year so I thought ""Let's see what this movie has of interesting"". And the result came to nowhere.The dated visual effects has some charming things that remind us of the 1980's. After all who doesn't love the movies of that decade? I loved the visual concept of the movie along with the brilliant and themed costume designs. But it's slowed rhythm story and its lack of expectation, lack of a better climax just ruined the movie for me.I hope that ""TRON Legacy"" became a better movie.",TRON
80,elicopperman,More Impressive Technologically than Narratively,5,17 May 2020,"If we're to go back during the early days of computer graphics in motion pictures, one of the earliest instances of heavy usage was in the ambitious Disney summer sci-fi epic Tron. Although moderately well received by critics and audiences, the film wouldn't gain a true following until years later when it spawned its own franchise: with comics, video games and even a sequel and TV series. So now that the feature is nearing 40 years of existence, one would think it would stand the test of time as a cultural landmark, and admittedly it certainly does. However, for every thing that works about it, there were also some kinks along the way.In terms of appraisal, the visual effects and world-building are astonishing, and while one could argue the effects don't hold up today, the remarkable craft and unique stylization surprisingly makes them stand out all the more. Considering this movie mostly takes place inside a software world, the large amount of possibilities the filmmakers could do back then are put to great use in terms of scope and scale too. In addition, the sound design is also well done, as every possible sound you can imagine from a computer software environment you can imagine would be at place, and they also helps compliment the sporadic action sequences. Also, the most consistent aspect of the movie would have to be the rules behind how this world works, mainly in terms of how ""programs"" function even in spite of their users not controlling them. Few movies really let their world play out to make their rules as consistent as possible, and this feature does at least offer a lot of cool sci-fi action tropes worthy of being adored by fans of the genre.That all said and done though, the same amount of praise can't really be said about the story and characters, as the whole movie is told in such a straightforward manner. In fact, the whole premise of a computer programmer who is transported inside a computer software world is told so briskly that it doesn't really give much time to really give much explanation to the logic behind the inside world; it more so wants to just play ahead and hope for the best. Not to mention, the characters don't really stick out that much in terms of personality, even with the charm of Jeff Bridges, Bruce Boxleitner, Cindy Morgan and David Warner. Even the antagonistic Master Control Program doesn't really rise above the typical overly intelligent machine who wants to rule all technology and even mankind. If you want your viewers to only be interested in the world-building and creative side of your concept, you won't have much to offer in the long run without a proper narrative. Finally, without giving away the ending, talk about a rushed climax and a vaguely told resolution (if there even was one).Needless to say, Tron proves to love its style and fascinating concepts more so than its story and characters to leave a true emotional impact to the audience. However, one cannot deny the hard earned work and effort that did pay off in terms of the visuals. It's not surprise that the film would go on to win a special Oscar for Technical Achievement several years after its release. So I'd say this film is made more for those who prefer the style and presentation of movies than the substance. It really goes to show that even with a weak narrative, you can still have fun with whatever's around said story to make it stick out from the ground.",TRON
81,nickenchuggets,Stuck in the digital world,7,12 November 2021,"For me, the science fiction genre peaked in the 1950s with movies such as The Thing, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and Earth vs the Flying Saucers. These movies have had a place in UFO culture for so long, that by the 1980s, it seemed like every direction sci-fi could go had been done already. Then comes along Tron, a movie that is no doubt science fiction, but adds a new element into the story. Something that was relatively new back then and not featured in many films: video games. The first thing that could be considered a video game is up for debate and is still a topic of discussion today. Most people agree that the Magnavox Odyssey of the 1970s was the first game console meant for households, but if you really want to go back, there existed games played on old radar screens from the 1950s. The point is, video games are often seen as a new invention when this really isn't the case. Tron's story doesn't have much in the way of classic video game graphics that are very simplistic to look at, such as Atari games. The movie looks pretty realistic even today, but some things (such as the vehicles) are stylized on purpose to look simple to fit in with the game world. The movie focuses on a programmer named Flynn, who is attempting to do something he's not supposed to and hack a computer system called ENCOM. The leader of ENCOM is a guy named Ed Dillinger, who says the system is locking him out in order to protect private information. In his office at the top of a huge building, Dillinger talks with an entity that is meant to represent the computer as a sentient being: the master control program, or MCP. The MCP was invented and coded by a human, but it boasts about having over 2000 times as much intelligence since it was created and now wants total control over government and personal information. Another programmer named Alan and his girlfriend Lora head to an arcade to find Flynn after they find out Dillinger has apparently ripped off his idea for a new video game. The trio sneak into a room that has a computer left unattended, and Flynn attempts to question the MCP for info. Suddenly, a laser behind him fires and blinks Flynn out of existence. He reappears in a strange world which resembles the world of a video game. Everything looks like a wireframe and has bright, neon colors. While this place may look cool, its true purpose is more sinister. The MCP resides in this realm and pits people against each other in fights to the death. Flynn meets Ram and Tron (two other captured people) and the three are forced to take part in a game of light cycle. The object of the game is to drive a motorbike-esque vehicle and avoid crashing into the other bike's colored trails. The game is hectic, and the group eventually go outside the boundaries of the game's area, prompting Sark (the MCP's lieutenant) to intercept them. He sends tanks and large, flying vehicles called recognizers to track them down. A tank blasts two of the bikes and destroys them, forcing Ram and Flynn to find other methods to escape pursuit. Ram dies (or derezzes) shortly afterwards, but Flynn manages to steal an enemy solder's uniform in order to move around unnoticed. Eventually, the remaining players board a large, gondola-like vehicle called a solar sailer which moves along a beam of light. Sark, determined not to let the survivors get away, destroys it from his huge command ship flying overhead. Sark attempts to feed the MCP captured players in order to give it more power, but Tron fights and distracts him long enough to have Flynn jump into the light beam the MCP is in. This gives Tron an opening to attack the MCP and he manages to destroy it. The computer world is now free of the MCP's malevolent influence, and Ed Dillinger gets what he deserves once he finds out the MCP no longer functions. Not only this, but everybody now knows he stole Flynn's ideas. While I thought the idea for this movie was pretty original, the film itself has a number of serious (in my opinion) drawbacks that limit the amount of fun I got out of it. The most glaring negative of this movie is also arguably its greatest strength, which is the art style. The scenes that take place in the real world are fine, but that's only like 10% of the movie. The video game world looks like it's locked down on a grid, with vibrant colors everywhere. The colors are so bright in fact that I had to take a few breaks from watching the movie because the saturation was making my head hurt. The story itself is a mixed bag because on one hand, it involves video games, but conversely, it's pretty hard to follow what's going on because the plot is so confusing. This was actually a criticism people had about this movie from the day it came out. It's also pretty confusing how the main characters are known by different names in the game world. While these are, in my eyes, pretty big flaws, Tron is able to partially make up for this by having an impressive sense of scale. The whole movie is filled with huge environments that both the audience and the characters in the movie find amazing. The movie also features unique vehicles like the recognizers, tanks, solar sailer, and Sark's flagship. The bickering between the Sark and the MCP reminds me a lot of Darth Vader speaking with Emperor Palpatine in Star Wars. Most people think Vader is the epitome of a villain, but even he has a boss. Sark is shown to be ruthless, but the MCP makes sure he knows his place. To summarize, Tron is far from perfect in my view, but there's no denying that it was one of the first successful movies to incorporate video games as a central theme.",TRON
82,SkullScreamerReturns,Must see for the unique effects,6,10 June 2021,"It's weird I've never seen Tron before even though I've been aware of it for a long time. It was never on TV (in the 90s when I was a kid) but recently I finally found it from a library.Yes! The cheesy but awesomely 80s ""futuristic"" digital effects are mindblowing. Maybe it's a generation thing. I complain nowadays movies for having too much cgi and it looks annoying, but in this case I liked all of it. Maybe it's the fact that nowadays the effects often try to be too ""realistic"". But in Tron the vision looks so alien and strange, it tingles my fantasy/surreal nerve. Howevery you look at it you have to admit there are not many movies that look like Tron. Is there any?The plot is ok. It's an interesting science fiction story but also quite typical ""computer tries to take over"" thing that has also been used in many other films. But the original take to the story makes it quite good. There are interesting ideas, like computer programs appearing as people inside the system, and the actual human can interact with them.In the end the story was a bit too typical sci-fi adventure but good enough to not be boring. But more than that I give points for the effects. I think everybody should see this film just to know what is Tron when somebody mentions it.",TRON
83,lagudafuad,wonderful,7,23 December 2012,"Tron is a cult classic and a milestone setter and the beginning of extensive use of computer animations in film production. The thing that captivates you about Tron is the idea, the screenplay and the graphics that seemed to be so high ahead of its time that numerous studios turned down the idea because it was new, before Disney picked it up.Based on an idea by Steven Lisberger, who came up with the idea for the film when he saw a reel of a video game from a computer firm; the name of the reel was Pong since then Lisberger became obsessed with creating a film that will incorporate video games and live animation, the animator even went as far as to study an MIT so as to have an idea on computers and stuff, there he met programmers who he shared his idea with and they assured him that it was possible. So Lisberger and his partner Donald Kushner decided to start work on what they called their ""Tron Warrior, Tron gotten from the word electronic"".The Tron plot is about a Hacker and an arcade owner Kevin Flynn (played by Jeff Bridges). Flynn got disintegrated from the real world and regenerated in the 3D graphical computer world by a software known as the Master Control. Flynn now faced with a new world and new laws, had to join forces with the security software of the ""Grid"", Tron (Bruce Boxleitner), to be able to free himself and get back to the real world.In the computer world for survival Flynn had to face a gladiator like game, where if you are not careful you will get killed.After an intense pre-production process, Tron was filmed, done and released to only gain a mild box office success but the cult following was massive, that after Disney released the sequel and refused to re- release the original Tron on DVD again sales of the original Tron movie was going for as high as $100 in Amazon and E-bay (source/culled from wikipedia).Tron gained a high approval rating even getting academy Award nominations for Best Costume and Best Sound. Tron spawned out a franchise which consist of multiple video games, comic books, a sequel Tron: Legacy in 2010 (continuing from where the 1982 version stopped, the sequel also got a mild box office success) and an animated series Tron: Uprising, which seems to be connecting both films.Tron is a classic, one you will enjoy, even more than the highly visual perfection of Legacy.www.lagsreviews.com",TRON

It suggests a desperate and short brainstorm session that started with an old man saying: ""OK - computers!"" Mission: retrieve quarters. Results: negative. The Wizard of Oz construction suffers the absence of any real-world resolution, the 'bit' character is one of several clever ideas that has no story function, the ending is incoherent and way rushed, and the 'user'-as-deity is promising in theory and nothing at all in practice.

I found it also difficult to tell who was who at times, I wish the characters had a small amount of difference in their costumes to be able to tell who is who. I thought some of the scenes were done really clever, but I also wish we got a bit more about what was going on in real life. However, my main problem with this film was me just asking WHY?

89,SMK-4,Tron works,8,1 April 2002,"For the average viewer, 'Tron' is a puzzling film.  The language is loaded with jargon, the world experienced by Clu and Tron (inside the computer) appears strange, forbidding and two-dimensional. It is a world that seems to work though, but how does the human Clu instantly know how to adjust to its peculiarities?Viewers have come to expect that techno-babble jargon in SciFi flicks is completely meaningless.  That isn't entirely the case for 'Tron', much of it is firmly based in computing.  Even more importantly, this strange world Clu and Tron inhabit is equally firmly based on the way computer operating systems work, and that is the reason why Clu (in real live a computer hacker) knows how to handle it.Using this world as the basis for a movie was pretty audacious, especially in 1982.

92,Thrashman88,A marvel to watch,8,22 May 2009,"I remember back in the early 80's when I first saw TRON; I admit I was perplexed by all the ""user-program-computer"" jargon. After all, I was kind of ""anti computer"" back then. What I do remember from that first screening were the dazzling visuals, the overall surreal aspect of the film and Wendy Carlos outlandish score. I also remember the movie was sort of a box office failure and that it ended in a rather uninterested way.Now I have the movie on DVD and I must confess that I have a newfound love for it. Ironically, I have become more computer savvy and all that computer jargon makes perfect sense to me now, thus my new understanding of the movie. The effects, design, music, etc. hold up pretty well in this day and age of CGI. Still, the ending is still dull and I get the impression that TRON lacks a certain spark I can't describe, a spark that would undoubtedly had made this film into a much bigger box office success. The acting by Jeff Bridges, Cindy Morgan, Bruce Boxleitner and (especially) David Warner is decent to say the least, but the ""real"" world scenes lack a certain something. For one thing, Bridges character (Flynn, in the real world) acts as if he were high on dope or something. I guess he wanted to play an extroverted geek but in reality he looks as if he was high on something. And one thing I think could've put more ""drama"" into TRON was the neither Alan (Boxleitner) nor Lori (Morgan) noticed that their friend was sucked into a computer. There's not a single scene where they ask where he is or anything. We're meant to believe that, maybe, he was away from the real world for Milli seconds (?). Also, when Flynn is actually IN the computer world, he expresses no concern as to how he can get back to the REAL world. It's as if director Lisberger was so immersed in getting his concepts right that he missed a few things to put more drama into TRON.And that ending. Sure, we see Flynn and his friends celebrating his victory and Flynn as the new director for the company that once stole his video game programs. There are no final lines, no final words. Sure, they've won, but SOMETHING could've been said, you know.Still, despite the fact that I'm complaining, I admit I'm a fan of TRON and recognize its greatness and its importance in the annals of cinema. Younger audiences might dismiss TRON as a boring graphics show. After all, a PLAYSTATION game has way more in a technological sense than this movie.

But I still enjoy watching this movie for one simple reason: the special effects are in service of (rather than a replacement of) a great plot with interesting characters and intelligent dialogue. Jeff Bridges does a great job as the computer genius Kevin Flynn whose invention (several video games) is stolen by a very convincing villain Ed Dillinger (David Warner not only plays the villain part to a tea, but he even looks sinister). With the help of two friends Lora (Cindy Morgan) and Alan (Bruce Boxleitner), Flynn is determined to prove he authored the video game programs (which Warner claims to have invented) and to take back his own company. Flynn (and we in the audience) assumes that he only needs to break into the company building and hack into one of their computer to find that crucial piece of evidence proving that he authored the video games. But Flynn is unexpectedly sucked into the vortex of the computer system by Master programme, who is even more evil (this is given away by a very strong, aristocratic sounding British accent) than Ed Dillinger himself, and forced to fight for his life. Will he survive? Well I won't answer that question, except to say that there are enough twists and turns, enough interesting characters who are given interesting things to say and do to make this movie well worth watching.7.7/10",TRON
96,fjhuerta-2,Someone had to try it,8,19 September 2000,"""Tron"" is not for everyone. This first sentence should make you think that ""Tron"" is a cult movie. Well, maybe it is. My parents abhor it. My sister detests it. But my friends, who were born in the early 70s (very early, actually) and me see it as an amazing piece of work.Is it stunning? Yes, even though more than half of the film is colorized b&w. Is it computer animated? Yes, although I am betting your home PC might be able to render the images you will see there without any problem. Maybe not in real time, but almost. Is it special? You bet. Even though CGI had been tried before, Tron took it to the next logical step: creating whole CGI rendered scenes (e.g. tanks, cycles, Recognizers).The film is confusing at times, and 18 years later you can safely say the script wasn't actually the best. On the light of the Internet, though, it all makes a lot more sense, and it plainly demonstrates that the writers really loved computers. In fact, they were so ahead of their times that I am betting too many people who saw it the first time didn't understand it. That was its failure: only computer geeks could get the whole picture (no pun intended).Still, I guess Toy Story I and II are the direct development of Tron. And that cannot be bad in any way.",TRON
97,simon_booth,One of the best,10,10 May 2003,"How TRON has an average 6.8 score on IMDB I don't know, as it is surely one of the best and most important films ever made.  There are very few films that can actually claim to have changed the world, but TRON is one.  TRON changed the way we view computers, programs and games indelibly - it shaped the future, and now seems almost prescient as a result. 
Most importantly, TRON made *me* cool.  It's hard to believe, but prior to TRON computer games were considered ""geeky"".  Now of course everybody recognises that programmers are heroes and video games are sexy, and a video game programmer like myself can rightly take his place at the top of society.  Thank you TRON.What's most extroadinary about TRON is the consistency and creativity of its vision.  ""How does a computer program see the world?"" and ""How will the world see us when computers become smarter than man""?   Humans are largely in denial about it, but that day IS coming... machine intelligence is a reality, and it's only a matter of time before the first electronic lifeforms are created.  In fact, who's to say this hasn't happened already - it's perhaps only due to our anthropomorphic definitions of life that we haven't recognised it in our own creations. Admittedly, in 1982 the prospect of artificial lifeforms looked even closer than it does now, after initially great successes in artificial intelligence creating machines capable of logical thought that way outstripped human ability.  Unfortunately, that success brought about the realisation that humans aren't actually much good at logical thought anyway, and it isn't that important a component of what we call intelligence.  There's still some way to go before we can create programs that perceive the world and their own relationship to it in a similar way to us.Anyway, TRON isn't set now, it's set in a future when man has succeeded in creating just such programs.  Developed by man to perform his tasks, the programs have evolved to a state where they develop awareness of the world they live in.  Not the bricks and mortar world that we recognise, but a global network of software, systems and information.  TRON realises that world brilliantly, giving us a great visual analogy for how a computer program would perceive reality.  The special effects were incredible in 1982, and frankly they're incredible now.  Technically they look very dated and primitive in an age where special effects have attained the look of absolute reality... but artistically they are still unsurpassed.  The goal was never to create a digital copy of our reality, after all - it was to create a truly digital reality, another world entirely.  TRON set the standard for this, and even now presents the best and most accurate representation of the computer system world.Truly, TRON was prescient as much as it was influential.  It was made by people who really understood the technology of the time, and the potential it contained and what this meant for the world of the future.  Perhaps the low IMDB score is because even now the majority of the world audience haven't understood this as well as they did.  Humans still fear technology but imagine they can control it.  They can't - it's something we've created but now it exists it has a life of its own.  Technology will improve, will become more powerful, will supercede its creators in every respect.  When that happens, what will our relationship with our creations be?  THE MATRIX gives us one possible answer, though TRON's suggestions are 1000 times more realistic.  The human race really has no idea what its future holds though, and I only hope to live long enough to find out some of it for myself.",TRON
98,junk-monkey,A Unique Stylistic Treat,8,5 December 2005,"There is not a lot to say about this movie that has not been said many times, and much more eloquently than I will ever manage by other reviewers. But there is one thing I would like to add...The story is very simple (verging on the simplistic) and mythic in quality; it lends itself to any, or many, interpretations: an allegory on belief systems, global capitalism, the Frankenstein story of the creation becoming the master etc.. Take your pick. The actors do their jobs. The writing is not particularly clever or witty but tells the story well enough. What makes this film a big fat 9 for me is the visuals.The visuals are still stunning; when I first saw this movie in the cinema when it was released I was blown away. Now, many many years later watching it on a battered second-hand VHS I am amazed to see how well they have stood the test of time. I think ,and this is the point I want to add, I think this is because they were never imitated.The Star Wars style was ripped off, copied, duplicated, and watered down by other jump-on-the-bandwagon filmmakers, and so merchandised to death by Lucas that the freshness, novelty, and sheer fun of the first film is unrecognisable now. It's been buried under millions of tons of expensive cheap toys, tatty imitations and huge bloated pre/sequels.Tron never suffered that fate. No other movies co-opted the Tron style. It is one of a kind. This is not to say the movie has not been influential; no one can read William Gibson's books without seeing that, but in movie terms Tron is a unique stylistic treat.Watch and enjoy! I'm off to buy a DVD copy and yes Babylon 5 fans, that IS Peter Jurrasik (Londo) in a small part.",TRON
99,tomfsloan,Groundbreaking,8,14 February 2019,"Steven Lisberger made a great movie that was ahead of its time. Not the first to use computer generated special effects, but the first to use them to such a degree. Audiences were stunned to see such high resolution on the big screen. Tron did not get an Acedemy award because at the time, computer imagery was considered cheating. The plot and the CGI work together perfectly. Parts of the movie were a little campy, particularly Jeff Bridges scenes, but that's ok because it worked. Wendy Carlos wrote an outstanding and unusual score. Mixing in the synthesized music, it couldn't have been better. Much of the live action was filmed in black and white and transferred to Kodalith so more creative imagery could be made. That would include the glowing lines of colors on their clothes. Since1982, CGI has greatly improved, but that doesn't change anything in this movie at all.",TRON
100,skrstenansky,Did not age well,5,22 October 2021,"This may have been great for the time, unique story and good special effects, nothing really like it at the time.

The story was interesting a bit and the it was unique, I thought the experience was fine. Not really good but not really bad.",TRON
101,headly66,Still cool,7,11 December 2009,"I saw Tron in the theater when I was 16 and at the time it was a very cool movie. The kids here saying it's old and boring better be in for a shock when 30 years from now their kids call District 9 and Transformers boring, but neither of those films broke any new ground, they just repeated what is popular. Tron came out at a time when there were barely computers, I had three in my high school and you had to spend multiple hours on it to write enough code to make a fake looking boxy bird flap it's wings on a monochrome screen. Video games were all the rage but even they were in the infant stage so when something like Tron came out it was like being trust into that world in the coolest way possible.This is not a Disney film like most think though they did fund it and it was light years ahead of it's time. I feel this was more of an experiment than anything else, sort of saying ""let's see what we can do"", almost like Fantasia was in 1940. It is still a visual treat for the eyes and I can't wait to see it in Bluray. The movie has an eerie look and feel to it and though most of it is just overlays of humans on a backdrop it still works in it's sharp coldness. The live action parts are pretty straight forward fare, the acting is good with Tron himself being the best part. Cindy Morgan (who was delicious in Caddyshack) is just lovely here but this is sadly her last film lead.All in all a fun time. For those naysayers, stop comparing generations of film, it will always change and what you think is cool now will later be corny, the trick is to be original and it will last.",TRON
102,krycek19,The sequel is much better,1,14 April 2016,"I have no idea how this is considered a classic. Even in 1982 the effects were very, very bad. The acting is pretty bad as well, the music is annoying and the movie in general is boring.The only two good things are that this is a short movie and it spawned an amazing sequel. The only ones who would have liked this were programmers back then.This movie has so little plot that, watching the much better sequel can be done easily.And the sequel is the only good thing that came out of this crap.Avoid the original.",TRON
103,TheRadiobox,The best proof of concept ever made,7,3 March 2021,"TRON was directed by Steven Lisberger, written by Lisberger and Charles S. Haas, and stars Jeff Bridges, Bruce Boxleitner, David Warner, Cindy Morgan, Dan Shor, and Barnard Hughes. It's about a computer hacker who attempts to return to reality after being transported into a video game world.The Plot: Since TRON is more focused on bringing to life its unique world and ideas, it doesn't have a very complicated story, but what's here is passable enough although it doesn't exactly impress. Kevin Flynn (Bridges) is trying to hack into the company he used to work for via Clu, his personified program and gets stopped by Dillinger and his avatar Sark (Warner). Current employees Alan (Boxleitner) and Lora (Morgan) are shut out of the machinery; now going to Flynn to warn him about Dillinger's efforts to shut him down. The three try to find proof of wrongdoing but are stopped and transported into the game world at the behest of the MCP which is trying to make itself a super-duper computer (a trope that somehow predates the movie). The trio, forced to use their programs (Clu, Tron, and Yori) to compete in life or death games, meet Ram (Shor) and Dumont (Hughes) and they must escape before the MCP becomes an all-knowing, all-controlling machine.The Characters: To make up for the flat story, TRON plays up the characters, making a peculiar bunch out of the humans and the programs alike. Kevin makes video games after being burned by his former employer and now, barely getting by, has a score (get it?) to settle. He's an unconventional hero initially introduced as man solely focused on getting his money flowing again but becomes an endearing protagonist thanks to his lightheartedness and child-like sensibilities. Alan's a charismatic computer genius much like Kevin but has more on his mind; striving to create better security for programs to limit the MCP's power, unknowingly working against his employer. He's much more serious and only wants to get into the machines to get back to work, but still has his more out-there moments. Lora is a good go-between for the men since she had romantic history with Kevin and is now with Alan. She's just here because she wants to be but gets sidelined. Dillinger is a slimy villain that just wants money, if he has to bow to a machine, so be it. He's simple but fits with the story exceedingly well, as does everyone else.The Action: While TRON doesn't quite fit the action movie profile, it does provide more stunning sequences of games, chases, and escapes than it does anything else; and on that level it's a success. The world inside the computers provides intriguing obstacles for Kevin to overcome, such as the ""Ball Game"" which takes Pong to a new level, pitting Kevin against other programs and users as they attempt to remove the standing platforms from beneath each other until one is derezzed. Any world as complicated and hostile as the one in these machines (to the programs residing inside, not so for the audience) has threats, and the Recognizers (towering machines that hover along and zap whatever they deem to be malevolent into nothing) are ever-present and intimidating to the characters and the audience; which lights a fire under the heroes to keep the stakes high and the movie chugging. Lightcycles and the games they're in are great creations that, again, take the simple ideas of older games to an extreme and provide some edge-of-your-seat action in a movie more than willing to slow down and ruminate about its ideas. All of these moments build to an admittedly disappointing final showdown combined with some vacant stretches. Dated and flawed the action may be, but the threat is still real.The Technics: For the time, TRON is a marvel of movie making. Its world goes deeper than the movie is allowed to venture but what Lisberger did get to show is captivating, its costumes are still recognizable in no small part to the simple design of wiring on top of a full-body suit which contrasts the rigid, neon-laden geometry of the world that perfectly illustrates 80s arcade games in an up close fashion. The lighting is rough but never less than endearing because of the unique methods the film makers used that involved shooting the computer world sequences in black and white and colorizing them later. Any little missteps in this area are easily overlooked when the level of passion is clearly so high. Despite the more action-oriented approach, the movie does ask some heady questions that were way ahead of their time about humans being subservient to tech and the concept of a God. Asked in no subtle manner, but asked nonetheless. All of it has aged but the talent involved is clear as ever.This is a unique experience to this day, creating an instantly iconic world and characters while paving the way for effects as we know them now. As a show of lights and sounds, TRON is still entertaining despite its simple plot.73/100",TRON
104,chelano,A Frisbee that kills people,7,20 December 2010,"It has been awhile since I watched this film. So I had to watch it again to get the full effect before the newer one was released. I have a lot of things against this film though as a movie. The concept for its time was amazing. I will give it that. But the filming was a bit off. The cast was half and half. Jeff Bridges was great. He basically made the movie. Bruce Boxleitner who is Allen and Tron did a decent job. As Allen he didn't seem to fit well, but did fit as Tron. Cindy Morgan was the love interest of both Bridges character and Boxleitner. She was not a very good actress. It was like her emotion was shut off. David Warner was a excellent bad guy. Even though Master Control was pretty much the main bad guy, Warner was a close second. Like I said, the concept was great. It really had something going for it. The Grid world was excellent and how most of the small characters were named after computer terms was clever. An example would be Dan Shor's character named RAM. The film on the grid was shot combination rotoscope and hand drawn. This gave the film more of a fantasy feel when you were in the Grid. The use of colors in the film were vibrant and interesting to keep the viewers attention. Now they needed this since some of the scenes were just really boring; making you wait for the more interesting parts. The music was orchestrated, but at sound parts sounded like a Sunday afternoon made for TV movie; which didn't fit with the epic feel of the film. The only other problem was the ending of the film. It just stopped. Very undeveloped with the characters and the story. They were trying to set it up for a sequel, but the way it was done, you couldn't even tell. You just felt like everything was left out. Tron was a gem of its time. But if you look at it as a whole, it is just a decent movie.",TRON
105,adrongardner,The Silent Type,8,29 December 2010,"There are some movies that you enjoy and have no idea why. When I was growing up in the 80s, TRON was one of those movies. My memory is that I really loved watching the film, I didn't understand it, but the act of just watching things happen on screen was a joy. Looking back on the film today, it's not hard to see why it is such a joy to look at. The film was a visionary work of art. Not dramatic art, not character driven art, just something purely visual. In this way, TRON is much like the early, experimental silent films people paid in droves to see. These audiences wanted a new type of experience and that is exactly what TRON was in 1982.Of course not everybody liked the film. Critics either hated the film or they praised it for what it was. Often times, jaded moviegoers or critics are fed off of conditioned reflex. Character A meets Character B, conflict happens and then resolution ensues. The credits roll. Nope TRON is a movie about MCPs and ""hacking."" There were lightcycle chases and Group 7 access clearances. These McGuffins were not the ones audiences and critics were used to. Screw them. TRON grew its audience over time. Much like Blade Runner, another peculiarity from 1982, and Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey decades before, time has been kind to these films. Where established critics of the time ravished them in reviews, a decade or two goes by and they all became classics or more.Movies are not filmed plays. Every film should provide a unique experience. Some movies are about love and loss. Some films are about cowboys and bank robbers. TRON is just one of those films about a security program out to kick the MCP's ass. TRON is not a drama, it is an experience like a ride at Six Flags or Disneyland. Nobody gets off a roller coaster and says, ""Well I'm not sure they got the plot right."" No, you just want to get right back on and enjoy it for what it is.8/10",TRON
106,RCWjr,Way ahead of its time,7,18 December 2010,"When I first saw this film 28 years ago, I honestly did not get all of the technical references in it. I was not part of the early computer crowd that this movie was written for. I was into video games and hanging out at arcades. But all of the character and dialog references to the world of computers was totally lost on me. I loved the arcade game based on the film. The film itself, was an oddity, an interesting one, but nothing I invested much into.Spring forward to this year, when all the talk of a sequel coming to theaters was in the air, I had to revisit the film that I literally had not watched since 1982. What I found was a lot more than I originally remembered. I think a lot of that has to do with my knowledge of computers being much greater than it was in 1982. Watching the film now I am able to appreciate the characters based on computer references and the dialog which at the time, didn't make much sense to me. What is commendable is that the film was way ahead of its time. The effects, though antiquated by today's standards, set the foundation for the CGI work we have today. Disney was reaching, perhaps a little too far, but none the less, they were trying to push people beyond what they had experienced at the time.There is no doubt watching this film again today that the Wachowski brothers were inspired to create The Matrix from a love of this film. There is so much about TRON that is echoed and mirrored in The Matrix.A film that was way ahead of its time and a fun revisit today. I am by no means hardcore devote of the film, but I do recognize the effort and the desire to stretch beyond the borders Disney tried. A fun film to watch, kind of cold, but none the less fun if for nothing else than seeing a studio trying to take the audience on a new ride.",TRON
107,matlock-6,Underrated science fiction classic,9,15 May 2002,"Tron rarely gets the respect it deserves. It's been a ""cool"" thing in recent years to mock it, as they have done on The Simpsons, yet Tron is still once of the greatest science fiction movies ever made... and by DISNEY??!!The storyline is a recognizable one, borrowed somewhat from the Harlan Ellsion story ""I have no mouth and I must Scream"", about a supercomputer that becomes something of a god. However, unlike the Ellsion story in which the computer actually takes over the world, the computer in Tron has its own ""innerspace"" world contained within itself.The special effects in this movie were astounding for the time, and still look great after the passing of time (and are a lot cooler and more imaginative than the modern day CGI obsession). Jeff Bridges is always a solid performer, and Bruce Boxleitner (later of Babylon 5 fame) is very good as well. Cindy Morgan plays the primary female character, who is probably best known as Judge Smails' sexy niece from ""Caddyshack"", of all things.Uppity ""look down your nose"" types will probably find plenty to mock, but then, when is that not the case? Ignore the fact that it's made by Disney, and sit back and enjoy a great science fiction adventure classic.",TRON
108,ihrtfilms,The special effects have stood the test of time...but,3,18 November 2010,"Computer games, BORING! That's what I imagine I thought when this was first around around 18yrs ago. I remember it only vaguely-the motorbikes racing around and that's all.Watching it on a whim recently, I was quite surprised at well the film has lasted. Special effects are the one thing that may wreck this film's worth, but whilst at times they looked pretty bad, for the majority of the film they are superb. The opening sequences of the bike race is incredible, but throughout there are moments where it's hard to see how they would improve. The story is of course fantastical and at times I felt it was a little difficult to know what was going on and eventually the story began to bore me, so much so that by the end I wasn't really paying attention. For sci-fi and/or computer nerds there would be lots to enjoy, but whilst the special effects are impressive, even more so if you think that they were done on computer which was revolutionary back then, the story feels a little dragged out.It will be interesting to see how the new film Tron: Legacy with it's Daft Punk soundtrack and modern special effects will fare amongst a world of CGI laden films.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilm.weebly.com",TRON
109,tmpsvita,A too ambitious film with a lot of potential and a lot of problems that in any case become a sci-fi cult,5,28 April 2018,"An extremely ambitious film, too much for the time, there was the willingness to do something really new, but without the proper tools to do it willingness isn't helpful. Too bad because the ideas are there, there is a huge amount of ideas many are interesting and original, some even brilliant, while some could avoid because unnecessary, confusing or senseless but the main problem is that most of it is badly developed, so much to be, especially at the beginning, almost incomprehensible, especially for a spectator who has not lived in that historical period and therefore already understands with difficulty the type of computer science, now archaic, of the 80s, and so he will finds it really difficult to identify with it.
All this because of an immature and superficial script with various holes, in which the feelings and emotions are missing and that is lost in the great quantity of present ideas and ends up being too confusing and flat as original and at times interesting it may be; not to mention the bad dialogues and really forgettable interpretations, in some points almost terrible, even that of Jeff Bridges.
The film also suffers from a very strong aging too palpable that makes really difficult, at the beginning, the vision of the film itself, because of really bad special effects even for the time (five years before it was released ""Star Wars"" and the same year ""Blade Runner""!), which you get used to only after the first half hour.
The same applies to the unconvincing direction, especially in the staging, in the sets and costumes where it does the worst of itself, even there the ideas are not enough if they are misdirected.
Fortunately, after a while, you begin to appreciate the trashy aftertaste that spreads with great force throughout the duration, so that you get to appreciate it. This also allows you to better immerse yourself in the extremely special atmosphere of the film so that in the end it can also involve, a bit 'for the plot and a bit' for the unintentional comedy of many scenes that in any case provide a bit 'of genuine entertainment.
In short, a failed project but that manages in many places to entertain despite the many problems, which however have not prevented it to become, over the years, a small cult of science fiction with a large and strong fanbase and on this I can not say, so much of a hat.
In any case I think it is a film that strongly needed a sequel / reboot that could exploit the great potential that went here wasted, so the following of 2010 (which by the way I saw a lot before this thinking it was stand alone ) I found it rather discreet.",TRON
110,GTeixeira,Charming science-fiction,8,22 February 2014,"A very fun science-fiction where Jeff Bridges ends up trapped inside a computer world, being forced to partake in gladiatorial-like competitions with other program's AIs.This film seemed somewhat overlooked in the rise of beloved child-focused sci-fi, 'ET'; just like another infinitely superior sci-fi, 'Blade Runner', was. Now, while 'Tron' is still far from a 'Blade Runner', it is a very fun and entertaining science-fiction that deserves its fair share of praise.The cast is good, with Jeff Bridges and David Warner being particular highlights. But the true highlight is in the special effects that compose 90% of the film; they might look silly and overly-dated to most people, but that is the point. They aren't supposed to look real, they are being used to showcase one's idea of a digital world, to show it as being very different from our own, and do so marvelously.I would take 'Tron's special effects over most of modern CGI any day, especially its sequel's CGI. It is also helped by the fact that the plot is very nice and entertaining, not very clichéd but actually quite original, and it allows the use of the effects in some very creative and even impressive ways.

114,J-bot6,TRON: 'All that is visible',9,12 November 2004,"TRON. Now here's a film that seems to generate a wide spectrum of reviews.As for my take on this landmark motion picture, I have to admit that I will always be able to reflect on it in its original context.In 1982, TRON (along with Blade Runner) was nothing short of breathtaking. And, although it was originally panned by critics, those who have taken the time to look closer, have noticed that there is more to this film than there first seems to be.One of TRON's greatest strengths lies in its extensive use of parallelism. There is the world of the user (almost a god or demigod motif), contrasted with the world of the programs (very much a metaphor for our world). And, just to enhance this metaphor, Dillinger's helicopter is shown with neon-red lines, and the final fade to black is preceded with a time-lapse of the city  suggesting data running along traces.The obvious parallels are with the use of the same actor for each character's counterparts in the digital world. Flynn and Clu, Alan and Tron, Laura and Yori, Gibbs and Dumont, Dillinger and Sark.However, we see a number of other characters show up here and there, in more subtle form: For example, there's Sark's second in command on the bridge of the carrier. He shows up earlier in the film as Peter  the suit who was watching Dillinger's office. Then there's RAM's human counterpart asking Alan if he can have some of his popcorn. I find it surprising that many are critical of the 'unbelievable' aspect of this film. However, never is the audience expected to believe that this is the way the computer world really works or that a person could ever be zapped into a computer. In fact, to allude to the type of story that the audience is being presented with, TRON does a near-quote of Alice In Wonderland, with 'Stranger and stranger.' Perhaps Kevin Flynn fell down the rabbit hole. And  for those who think TRON is a Disney film  watch the production notes and you'll discover that this is not a Disney film (although they did fund it).Of most obvious interest is the fact that TRON pushed the computer graphics technology of the time to its limits and beyond. And  despite many who have said that its graphics are primitive, they're confusing resolution with texture-mapping. The truth is, the number of colours displayed and the resolution shown in the computer-generated components in TRON is higher than most desktop displays  even today. To output to film with the level of sharpness and smooth gradients seen in TRON, you'd need at least 24 or 32-bit colour, with a horizontal resolution of approximately 3000 to 4000 pixels. On top of that, it was the first film to use transparency in 3D CGI (the solar-sailor simulation). To my knowledge, texture-mapping didn't exist in 1982. Fortunately, the lack of texture mapping works well with the stylized look of the film's 'world inside the machine.'As a film, TRON is definitely both unique and entertaining. And, for those who are visual in nature, it's full of splendid eye-candy. The design work is top-rate, and is best appreciated when viewed on film. I recall watching this movie when it first came out in 1982, and have to say that it was nothing short of total immersion. Unfortunately, most of the modern transfers of this film have been pretty rough (with the exception of the out-of-print Laserdisc box-set).The plot for TRON is actually quite simple. Despite this simplicity, it is cleverly used for the purpose of -- hopefully  making the audience think about our world, and how it may relate to some 'higher world.' If we are programs, then who are our users? Is there a level up from us, and do they know all the answers? There is certainly a metaphysical angle to TRON, which the audience can ether pay attention to, or disregard in favour of the simple thrill of watching Light Cycles square off against each other on the Game Grid.Many elements are combined in this film: the gladiatorial film, the exodus, the revolution, the sentient AI, the battle of good vs. evil, and  of course  the almost prophetic depiction of the computer industry. Encom and Ed Dillinger are very much parallels to real themes that took place in the computer industry in the years that followed the release of TRON. These themes are very much repeated in more recent trilogy of films. I think the actual name for the Light Cycle game that Flynn mentions will give you a clue as to which trilogy I'm referring to.Finally, there's Kevin Flynn. Some may be surprised that I left this one to the end. However, I thought I'd leave the best for last. Fact is, Jeff Bridges did a brilliant job with this character. Over the years, I have actually known computer-industry hot-shots who are remarkably similar to Flynn. He made the character believable. And, this carries over to the film itself. No matter how much of a leap you're expected to make when approached with a script or screenplay, be compelling. Jeff Bridges and David Warner do exactly this. TRON is a movie that really entertains. I like to think of it as a big small movie. One that was definitely ambitious and is presented in 'glossy' and vivid wide-screen, yet has a sort of nice-light-snack kind of feel to it. It's a movie with a great deal of replay value, and one with compelling characters. In short, TRON  like its video game counterpart  is fun.And for that, and a host of other reasons, it will remain on my list of favourite films.End of line.",TRON
115,brower8,Now a period piece,7,28 January 2004,"Tron is, for all practical purposes, a cult movie once one got beyond the dazzling animation. Acting isn't great, and one gets few memorable lines (this isn't Casablanca!) The script, which entails the usual anthropomorphism that one associates with Disney, has obvious limitations due to the story. For an exercise in expressing technology at once both mesmerizing and menacing, one now has a period piece. So the tables are turned and a videogame devotee becomes a part of the game with all of the dangers that one associates with the artificial objects and characters of the game once he breaches the security devices of a game which an 'evil corporation' has stolen from the player; it's Alice in Wonderland with testosterone but little charm. This time one can't simply insert another quarter when the game ends; one could be ""de-rezzed"" (that is, obliterated like one of those videogame characters when zapped}. Good but not great; I give it a '7' out of a '10'. Several movies handle some of the same elements of plot far better than does Tron; 20001: A Space Odyssey far better treats a machine gone bad; Metropolis (1927!) holds up far better because it better establishes the seriousness of the situation; the original Star Wars trilogy far better delineates good and evil so that one has more cause to associate with the hero. Settling a personal injustice and getting what one deserves isn't quite as admirable as saving the universe.",TRON
116,Theflyace,Revolutionary and Fun (Something Disney Hadn't Done for Years),10,22 January 2013,"**This Review May Contain Spoilers**After the huge success of Mary Poppins, Disney was on top of the world in terms of entertainment. Unfortunately, Walt Disney died two years after, and the studio began failing, and failing, and failing. It had a couple of hits, but they were modest at best, and didn't leave an impact audiences wanted. This went on for about 15 years. This era has become known as ""The Dark Age of Disney."" I mention this period of time because Steven Lisberger came in with a script that would help turn things around at Disney. Tron was one the most original and thought provoking films of the 80s, as well as all time. The story involved Kevin Flynn (played by Jeff Bridges) who seeks to obtain information that a rival (played by David Warner) has screwed him out of ownership and a job at a tech company called Encom. While searching for the information, a rapidly growing AI called the MCP (Master Control Program) transports Flynn to the electronic world in order to get rid of him. In order to break out, Flynn befriends the legendary warrior Tron (Bruce Boxlietner) and both seek to destroy the MCP to free their world and Flynn from its tyrannical leader.The most talked about aspect of this film is the animation (there is a lot of it) as well as new Computer Generated animation. Lisberger teamed up with special effects wizard Harrison Ellenshaw (son of the great Peter Ellenshaw) to nail down the look Lisberger had envisioned. These effects still hold up really well. The back-lit animation is stunning, especially when it lights up on the characters. The light-bikes are totally awesome, and still provides for a neat chase in the middle of the film.The script is very strong, considering it's outlandish ideas compared to its very simple storyline. It takes advantage of the video game culture and the booming advances in Silicon Valley, but makes people think in terms of a religious undertone. The idea between the users and the ""programs"" are very touching. There are some shots where Lisberger never makes it clear whether or not we are living in his world or if our world looks like his. Most of it is because of good acting from the indelible Jeff Bridges, and underrated work from Bruce Boxlietner as ""Tron."" David Warner as the villain is an inspired choice, and he delivers a devious minion to the MCP. He is a villain god, nothing less. The only thing that isn't very special anymore is the MCP himself, nowadays it looks like a Super Mario blooper. This film is very often overlooked. It's very unfair that it is because it is a very unique film. For what would seem a dated film, it has a timeless feel to it, and will last longer than other Disney projects from the ""Dark Era of Disney.""",TRON
117,srobi280,Weird man... really weird.,7,20 April 2006,"Tron is a movie in which some hacker guy gets sucked into a computer or something along those lines. There really isn't a plot to talk about. The whole movie is computer animation. You can tell that this movie was the first, I believe, to use computer animation. The computer graphics are consistent with video games of 1982. There's this big orange thing in there too. In a way, I think the graphics in this movie are actually pretty cool. Stoners would definitely love this movie, as there is absolutely no plot, and all graphics. If you want to just zone out to trippy 80's video game graphics, then this is the perfect movie for you. It gets a 7 out of 10 for the oh-so-cool breakthrough revolutionary 80s graphics.",TRON

119,jordache-wee,The Matrix of Tron,7,30 January 2014,"A young and gifted software engineer who works at ENCOM programming games such as Tron has had his software codes stolen by senior executive, Ed Dillinger (David Warner) who gets promoted because of his codes. He tries to hack into the mainframe of software company ENCOM but fail.Not knowing that Dillinger has already overridden the Master Control Program to prevent Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) from entering ENCOM. Flyn seeks help from ENCOM employees Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) and Lora Baines (Cindy Morgan). Flynn convinces Bradley that he is trying to increase maximum security for Bradley's security program called ""Tron"".Tron is capable of monitoring communications between the MCP and the outside world. They take him to the ENCOM laboratory. When Flynn attempts to hack his way into the system, the MCP takes control of a nearby laser; developed for 'quantum teleportation' and uses it to digitize Flynn into the ENCOM mainframe.In the mainframe, Programs appear in the likeness of the Users who created them. However, the MCP and its commander, Sark (David Warner) renounce their belief in the Users, giving the MCP a complete control over input and output in the system.Programs that disobeys are forced to fight in gladiator-like games in which losers are destroyed. In the process of playing such games, Flynn meets Tron (Bruce Boxleitner); the two escape into the mainframe during a Light Cycle match, and are later split up.While he attempts to reunite with Tron, Flynn discovers that, as a User, he is capable of manipulating the physical laws of the digital world. Tron manages to communicate with Bradley and receives instructions to destroy the MCP.Tron and another Program, Yori (Cindy Morgan), board a solar sailer and make heads to the MCP core.Before they reach the MCP, Sark's command ship destroys the sailer, capturing Flynn and Yori. Sark then leaves the command ship and orders its self-destruction, but Flynn keeps it intact while Sark flies to the MCP's core on a shuttle, carrying a number of captured Programs.Tron confronts Sark outside the core and damages Sark, and attacks the MCP directly when Flynn distracts the MCP long enough to reveal a gap in its shield. Tron throws his disc through the gap, destroying both the MCP and Sark, and freeing the digital world. Input and Output towers begin to light up all over the landscape as programs begin to communicate with their users.Flynn is sent back to the real world. A nearby printer prints out the evidence that Dillinger had ""annexed"" his code. Dillinger arrives the next morning to find the evidence of his wrongdoing displayed on his screen. Later, it is revealed that Flynn has become the CEO of ENCOM.",TRON

121,StudentDriver,Beautiful film that presaged the future of film making.,10,16 October 1999,"I was terribly excited about Tron when it came out theatrically; I was all of 8 years old, but was already a computer geek.  15 years later, I ended up purchasing the $100 Archive Edition laserdisc box set as my very first LD. Tron definitely made an impact on me.Tron has survived the years- more so than many other contemporary SF films, and more than I think most critics would have guessed.  Instead of looking out-dated and corny, as the years have passed, Tron has aged gracefully. Sure, the monochrome-screen terminals might look a bit old, and the arcade is a distant, fond memory, but the SFX are still beautiful, and the storyline, in this era of the Internet, seems shockingly modern.One of the reasons Tron's SFX have aged so well is because they did not try to simulate anything already existing.  We have no basis to determine if the architecture of the MCP's world is out-dated or not-hip; everything is styled so uniquely that it's never going to look wrong.  Much like the design of Maria in Metropolis, the look of Tron is never going to be laughable or quaint.The storyline is lacking a little bit; you can see the ideas the script writers wanted to insert, but there are too many ideas for only 2 hours of film.  There are quite a few points in the film that are mentioned and then ignored (Grid bugs, anyone?), and occasionally the film digresses from the plot for no other reason than to digress- the digressions being unimportant to the story at hand.  But, despite the problems, the philosophy of user/program interaction, and the handling of technophobia are both handled admirably.I recommend every video game, computer, and SF fan to watch Tron at least once.  I echo the call for it to be the widescreen version, but I am disappointed with the DVD's extra features- or lack thereof.  The LD is much more full featured, and better for fans, despite the side breaks every 30 minutes.",TRON

123,vesil_vesalier,"Beneath its surface is an important, mesmerizing experience",10,19 October 2016,"If you take the idea of TRON, advance it to today's world of computers, and pretend like both it and its sequel never happened What would today's TRON look like? What would it be like, having a human being digitized into the world of the internet? The reason I ask is merely a curiosity: What battles would TRON face? Would he be like Superman in the internet? Battling hordes of evil corporate programs with the help of other guardian programs? Geez. This is the first time I've ever thought of a reboot as a good idea. It would be an impressive landscape to throw Tron into, wouldn't it? A superhero movie in today's cyberspace.TRON was the first movie I've ever seen in a theater. That by itself pushes it up to a 10 for me. Understandably, I am biased. At the ripe old age of five years old, watching the screen with my eyes and my mouth wide open, I had found Heaven in the battle between light-cycles.But there is more to TRON that meets the eye.A lot of pictures have attempted the idea of artificial intelligence, some even earlier than TRON. COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT comes to mind. WARGAMES comes to mind, though honestly I don't remember which one came first. Newer movies like THE TERMINATOR, and even the much more recent A.I. gave it a shot (though honestly A.I. was a hodgepodge of thrown-together ideas and too many cooks in the kitchen. That review is for a later day).Accepting a film like TRON today is difficult, similar to the way that watching an episode of the original STAR TREK has its challenges. The special effects are dated. The concept is completely silly. Remember a time when MOST movies had silly premises, instead of the ultra-realism of today? It is quite possible (and more than likely) that we take ourselves far too seriously, and today's mainstream films prove it, time and again.Jeff Bridges is the star, playing Kevin Flynn in a movie whose title reflects on a co-star, instead of the main character. TRON is more than a character here, he is the embodiment of a general concept, and truly, the centerpiece of the film. Like his character, Bruce Boxlietner plays TRON, and like TRON, Bruce has (believe me, no offense intended, sir) always been more of a side-character his whole career (unless he's doing television). In that regard, his performance fits perfectly here Just enough to get the job done, without stealing the show from Jeff.The idea of digitizing matter and sucking it into a computer is a feat that even we, in the 21st century, have not yet cracked. But here, it is produced to us as a given, and like all movies with silly premises, the forcefulness of the delivery is everything here. The operation is taken as seriously as anything else in the film, and that is what forces you to accept it. In this version of the 80s, matter can be digitized and sucked into a computer mainframe.You have to admire the story, and pay attention to the subtle seriousness of it all to really feel the impact. Admittedly, being five years old, I kind of missed it the first time around, but there is some very serious business going on here. Sure, the main plot is simply that Dillinger (played awesomely by Mr. David Warner, sir, one of my all-time favorite actors) stole computer programs from Flynn and found a way to boot him out of the company, riding on false laurels all the way to the top of the chain—but what he's dealing with now is the Master Control Program, a monster of a program that lives in both worlds—computer and real—and KNOWS about them both. By the end of the sequence with Dillinger and him dancing toe-to-toe, not only do we learn that Dillinger is the puppet of the MCP, but we learn its true intentions: World domination. Dillinger, not only spineless but caught in blackmail, is helpless to assist the MCP despite knowing what its intentions are, and goes along with it helplessly.So even though Kevin Flynn is simply trying to right an age-old wrong and get the life back that he rightly deserves, he accidentally assists the computer program TRON in stopping the MCP from taking over the real world By giving him the chance to erase him from the system.Take that into account, the next time you watch this truly underrated masterpiece of 80s culture, and the fear of Artificial Intelligence, before it ever had the chance to become a real threat.",TRON
124,StephenBurg,My TRON Review,6,9 June 2012,"TRON is a Disney box-office bomb from 1980's that was outranked by parodies, its video game counterpart and its sequel. (IMHO, the sequel only grossed higher than the original, but the sequel is still a good movie). You might not want to say this movie sucks by poor special effects because it came in the 80's and though they did have special effects, there are still very crude things to come out of it like this.

Tron has been a favourite from the first time I saw it in the theatre, when I was 11. My grandmother took us to it, and complained afterwards about how it gave her a headache and that she'd never look at neon lights the same way again. Personally, I was transfixed. I was seeing the future of film visual effects, and I knew it. Granted, Bruce Boxleitner makes a fine piece of balsa in this one, but his character is supposed to be wooden. It's like all the stupid lines Mark Hamill had to say as Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars Trilogy. Films like this need a moral centre, no matter how ""square"" the character winds up looking. His woodenness is more than compensated for by the evildoings of David Warner, who manages to convey a sinister presence without damage to the scenery. Jeff Bridges is good (as always), and computer geekdom gets an accurate portrayal. I was so glad when the new DVD came out for this film. It's worth a look, even if you've never seen Tron before, and cements Tron's place in history as the inspiration that launched the current CG animation movement.",TRON

127,tobydale,Very far ahead of its time in so many ways,9,24 December 2010,"I recently rewatched TRON with my 7 year old son as a prelude to viewing TRON-Legacy; so here's my review.I first saw Tron in the cinema in 1982/83ish. I was dazzled by it; simple, immersive, visually stunning. Very enjoyable - an image of another reality which was credible and new. There is a large element of dark/light dualism which generates and maintains interest and inertia from within the story. The ""look"" of the film sustains this interest. Obviously technically highly advanced - far ahead of any other kind of cinema experience. This was an iconic film of its time that every cinema goer had to take in. Back then I would have graded it 10. As a film in my 9 - 10 band it sits proudly in my DVD collection.Over the years I have felt that time was not been kind to this film; by todays standards it looks ""80's"" - in ways it's too simple and for todays energy packed kids - too slow moving. For one thing, we don't have Video Arcades like Flynns anymore, we have Ninetendo DS and Wii in our homes, so this element is well out of its time. Nevertheless, TRON still looks great - dark, inviting, intriguing, its wonderfully stylised ""look"" still grabbed the attention of my 7 year old! He liked the battle scenes and the general feel - the Goodies Vs Badies aspect of the piece; the malevolent computer and its servants Vs good guys trying to save the day Tron & Flynn - A Hit! My 9 grade is a joint effort with my son - who is becoming a bit of a movie buff! (I thought 8, but I was overruled!) TRON is a film which should be seen. It was a landmark film in the history of cinema for a variety of technical and thematic firsts.Watch this film. It is dated by todays standards - but still worth a viewing.Now go and read my review of TRON-Legacy.End of line.",TRON
128,rtrnt,"Science fiction trailblazer, visually unique",8,10 January 2021,"The story of a hacker who gets pulled into a computer and finds himself not only in a battle for survival but also in an epic power struggle with the evil Master Control Program was still a fairly novel concept in 1982. One can argue how original it was and its execution is slightly uneven story-wise. But occasional narrative lapses and possibly dated plot aspects are completely balanced out by the film's sheer spectacle, one which remains fairly exciting to watch even today.I don't know how much the film's plot stands up to scrutiny or how well it's aged but I don't care. This is one of those films whose legacy, no pun intended, has been established as molding the science fiction genre into the brand of moviemaking it has since become. As hit-and-miss as the narrative may be, the film's imperfect nature informs its integrity as a rough draft for how the science fiction film genre would change over time.

When I put my comments down I realized I had not said anything about this movie, the original 1982 Tron. I was only six when Tron came out. I am not sure how old I was when I first saw it. I do know that I fell in love. The special effects were revolutionary for the day. The story dealt with concepts relating to a world that was changing so quickly and seemingly had no limits. Where was the line between humans and technology? Would technology become intelligent enough to think independently of their programming, of humans? There was even something for romantics. The story in Tron was a little less complicated, a little less philosophical but it worked! I think that to truly appreciate Tron Legacy, you have to appreciate Tron.

131,monsterhunt-94296,Entertaining,7,8 July 2020,"Tron was a surprisingly entertaining movie that had my attention the majority of the run time. i definitely see where the whole ""cult classic"" thing came from with this movie, as it has an appeal to programmers, especially in the 80's. i didnt understand any of the computer stuff and still understood the story and enjoyed the film. there were slightly confusing parts, but this was more due to the screenplay than a lack of understanding from the viewer, and i did a quick google search to make sure i wasnt missing something but it was just the screenplay. this movie is also very important, as it was basically the first movie to use CGI in this heavy way. i thought the dated CGI would get in the way of the viewing experience, but it really didn't. is it dated? yes, but it really isn't dated in the way you would think. this movie's visual effects exist with the purpose to simulate a computer world, while CGI nowadays has the purpose of simulating our world. this makes ""modern"" CGI become dated far quicker than something like Tron. the style and tone created from these visual effects still holds up today in my opinion, but let me say this movie isn't for everyone. if you aren't really ""into movies"" in the way i am, then you probably won't like this film very much. you'll only see it for the surface-level visual effects, which is completely fine if you watch movies like that, so the somewhat intriguing screenplay and good performances won't appeal to you that much. it just depends what entertains you in a movie. the antagonists in here are classic 80's over-the-top (although i wouldn't say its TOO over-the-top) villains. if that and old visual effects aren't your thing, pass on this one, but if the significance, premise, and good performance (jeff bridges has the best) intrigue you, give the movie a watch. i'd give tron a 7/10. it's not a masterpiece, but i got a whole lot of entertainment out of this thing. on a more objective scale it'd probably be a 5/10.My Rating System:1/10- hot garbage

133,jwhale9382,-Start of Line-,6,3 November 2003,"OK, maybe Tron was a little cheesy, but I loved it. Disney promised us a world inside a computer and so they gave us a world inside a computer. In this movie, computer programs become people, and programmers, hackers, or just anyone who can use a computer are called users. Users are seen as gods; the creators of this digital world. It's like 'Reboot', only twelve years before 'Reboot' was even imagined. The villain in this film is the Master Control Program (MCP). The MCP takes over programs and rules the digital world with a 'digital' iron fist. He is so intelligent that he can even communicate verbally with his user, Dillinger. All of the MCP's messages end with 'End of Line'.It's hard to say who the real hero is, Flynn or Tron. Flynn is a user and Tron is a program, and overall I think they wouldn't have won if they didn't work together.The CGI images were pretty good for a movie in the early 80's. To the modern viewer, they would seem cheap and lame, but they were great effects for '82. They give you the feeling of floating through digital space.My favorite part in the movie was the lightcycle races. I think I'd be cool to drive a lightcycle. I still don't understand what the Recognizers do. They just seem to float around and chase things. That doesn't seem very threatening. Maybe if it had guns...Overall, I think Tron is a classic and I hope it's remembered for a long time. Rent it if you can.-End of Line-",TRON
134,mar9,Of historical interest only,5,23 April 2001,"A curious film this one, in the light of events that followed it (the collapse of the home video game industry in the late 80s and the 2000 dotcom meltdown). Filmed as a cash-in on the then video game craze, the film has dated badly in many ways, particularly the early chunky grey Silicon Graphics special effects, not even as good as in The Last Starfighter, which has a similar look. A blindingly unoriginal good vs evil subplot involves a charismatic hacker lined up against the evil executive that stole his programs (played in a slow walk by British veteran David Warner - true to stereotype the Englishman's the bad guy). In spite of itself the film raises some interesting questions. When our hero gets drawn into the computer he meets replicas of people he meets in the real world, predating the concept of virtual worlds and avatars by a few years. In places, the film echoes earlier classics like Metropolis, particularly in the way the characters' faces are coloured and lit. For the most part, a curiosity only now.",TRON
135,zurnd,This Is Why We Have Pixar Movies,9,5 September 2013,"John Lasseter once said that without Tron, there would be no Toy Story. While working as a Disney animator, Lasseter caught a glimpse of the light cycle chase from Tron and his eyes opened up to what could be accomplished with computers and computer technology. Thus, he would go onto be one of the founding fathers of Pixar, which of course has spun a massive web since it's inception in the mid 80s. Of course Lasseter and the people at Pixar weren't the only ones inspired by this film. The French band Daft Punk was inspired by the film's electronic score and video game like sound effects, so much so that they even assisted Hans Zimmer in composing the score for Tron's sequel. But for how groundbreaking Tron was when it first hit theaters back in 1982, is it even a good movie? Is it's story compelling and relatable and can we see ourselves as parallels to the characters of the movie? I would say so. It's all how you look at it. Tron still holds up incredibly well 31 years after it's original release and while the effects can be a bit wonky from time to time, they give the movie a certain edge and stylized feel. When I think of this movie, shades of blue, red, orange and black come to mind, for those are the colors seen frequently throughout the picture and the fact that some of the effects look grainy at times really makes the film's environment look more digitized in my eyes. I also like the look of the characters, particularly Tron, Sark and the Master Control Program, who looks like Zordon's cousin three times removed. He spins around, freezes when he wants to talk to someone and his voice (provided by David Warner, the same guy who plays Sark) is one of the most intimidating voices I've ever heard. You could take this guy's voice and put it over Darth Vader. It's just that awesome and mighty.The acting is pretty decent. Jeff Bridges is great as always, playing the fun loving schmuck Kevin Flynn who ""plays video games better than anybody"" and Bruce Boxleitner is a gallant Alan Bradley/Tron who is determined to take out the MCP and bring balance back to the cyber world. He's the Chosen One in some ways and the most heroic out of the programs, although Kevin Flynn builds up his bravery and assists Tron in the MCP's defeat. David Warner has that presence to him that really makes him a force to be reckoned with and his portrayal of Sark and the MCP stand apart from all the other film's performances. Every time this guy enters the picture, you can just tell that some crap is going to hit the fan. He's plays two of Disney's most memorable adversaries and he's probably my favorite player out of the film. He also plays similar characters in Titanic, Star Trek 5 and 6 and he even plays the voice of Ra's Al Ghul in Batman: The Animated Series.The last thing I must talk about is the film's awesome score and sound effects. As I said before, this is what inspired Daft Punk to do what they do and it's not that hard to see why they got so enraptured. The film's score, composed by Wendy Carlos is an electronic feast for the ears, with a very exciting, blood rushing excellence only accomplished through computer chips. It's so catchy that they even used the music in the Tron arcade game, just listen to the film's score and then listen to the music from the game. It's identical. And the sound effects really make this film feel like a video game movie. Every time a character walks, there's this slight ""clink"" noise and the sound effects for the disk throwing, the light cycles and the character deaths makes me feel like I'm standing right in front of an arcade cabinet playing a game from the golden age. They really do a good job of making you feel part of the Tron universe and adding that bit of magic that takes you out of reality and places you in the realms of a digital fantasy.Tron is an all around great thriller and would change Disney forever. Perhaps without Tron, there would be no Toy Story 3 or Monsters Inc. or Finding Nemo. Maybe Disney wouldn't have had their grand Renaissance. Maybe special effects wouldn't have progressed the way they did. Maybe Jeff Bridges wouldn't be the highly profitable actor he is today. It all makes you think, doesn't it?",TRON
136,Vezon123,Virtual world,10,12 December 2010,"I remember, was it akkurat after the first ""Matrix"". I spoke with one fellow who was (and still) older and wiser than me. Then I was not skeptical critics and excitedly told me how cool the film received from the then Wachowski brothers, and how cool that finally removed the film about the people in virtual reality with awesome special effects ... the response was brief and unexpected: ""You just do not seen ""Tron"".Naturally, in the next few months I found on the disk referred to the collapse of the film and looked. Not at all impressed.Ten years later, I'm almost a graduate who is knowledgeable in several programming languages, has a shelf worn notes on Mattanah and theory of AI. Only at this age, I finally matured to the correct perception of the movie ""Tron."" A man gets a reality inside a computer where the program around him walk, ride a lightsaber, fly to the light packet data transmission, fighting on the lightsaber ... drives. The idea on which the film is based, is excellent, in the spirit of exciting fantasy paintings of the time (in some relatives even a TV series «Star Trek»). But with the gradual unwinding of its 90 minutes of screen time drive is lost, and the layering of the secondary plot moves with style, ""They stole my code"" line does not support. Fighting the user and a supercomputer at all possible magnitude is very limited.Alas, tightness in the media are not allowed Lisbergeru Stephen and his companions to modify plot component - too much attention to itself required special effects, vector graphics, glued Tanchiki and soaring arch. They, of course, by modern standards, the polballa, but I, for all its self-confidence and ""professionalism"" for a month could not draw a two-dimensional shimmering ellipse as a child of another object. And then the three-dimensional figure with a large number of angles in the motion on the technique is not 2010, and 1982 - built-in monitor, mouse, the size of a brick (if any), the operating system without windows, without doors (solid line commands). In my opinion, there should not pucker, and a standing ovation.Actors in this film, no doubt, it was hard. Now all accustomed to the green and blue cloths, and then any non-existent object, designated flags or points, was a novelty. Plus, many artists have played at least two roles (in the main and virtual reality), then there would have to think two personalities, one of them was dressed in a hurry, but soundly tailored leggings with elements of light bulbs.Unfortunately, the hero Jeff Bridges - savvy programmer and understand your software creation with a bang, but the viewer to follow the progress of his thought is problematic. And I think that the main drawback of ""Tron"" is not disclosure of the average global ideas, not the level of special effects and editing - all it could to please not another wave of spectators. The main disadvantage, banishing the audience - the film is not a full-fledged character, who would ask questions of ""what is it?"", ""And how does it work?"", ""What will happen now?"".

137,david-2829,"Cult-classic still enjoyable today, an intriguing sci-fi adventure!",7,10 March 2011,"Under appreciated in its time, Tron was a unique film undertaking that produced an above average film with way above average lasting power and name recognition (as evidenced by the 2010 remake). It pushed the envelope of possibility and made it's way into the venerable world of ""cult classics"" with its unique vision.I love science fiction, and the epic struggle between man and machine provides terrific fodor for a great story. The computer world of Tron might have been primitive for special effects, but is still visually intriguing and believable.Perhaps a little bit tough to understand conceptually (ie. why would ""programs"" have free thinking) it provides memorable scenes that have been part of our culture ever since. The human element is present, even in the computer world, and we connect with ""programs"" like Tron and sympathize with those who fight the oppression (a definite human trait) of the MCP.I always thought the sound effects in Tron were superb, my favorite being the unique sound of the flying ships. Another unforgettable scene filled with original sights and sounds are the iconic light cycles. Add some great music throughout that fits the mood and style and it's no wonder it has survived the test of time.When Flynn (Jeff Bridges) emerges from the computer near the end of the movie, we feel like we've been to another world and back, and I really enjoy ""Tron"" for bringing us through that journey. A great adventure, and a sci-fi classic.",TRON
138,nivek_nailgun,great!,9,1 February 2002,"Ok my summary was hardly jaw dropping but what else can I say? If you love the 80's,computers or storys that are certainly not so run-of-the-mill,then you must see this movie! I am in no way/shape or form a Disney fan (actually I generally hate Disney movies because of all the musical gak in it) so this is truly a stand alone Disney flick. 9/10",TRON
139,DrLex,Groundbreaking and still entertaining today,9,10 April 2005,"I still remember having seen parts of this movie when I was a very little kid and I thought it was incredibly cool, I hadn't seen anything like it. Now I have bought the 20th anniversary DVD and this was the first time I watched the movie in its entirety (and with a developed brain). And I still like it. Not in the same way as when I was young, because now I understand the story (I didn't understand English back then and I couldn't read the subtitles) so it's different from what I imagined back then, and now I have seen a truckload of modern movies with CGI effects.However, even though the effects in this movie are somewhat 'dated', they are still unique. While listening to the audio commentary (which is a must if you wonder how they managed to make a movie like this in 1982), I heard someone stating my thoughts exactly: the unique thing about this movie is that while modern movies use CGI in an attempt to simulate the real world, in Tron one tried to simulate a computer world with real world images. Because they did succeed in this, the movie will never become 'dated', while movies trying to use limited CGI effects will become dated as soon as CGI evolves. The limitations of computer graphics at that time forced the makers of the movie to be very creative. E.g. all camera motions in the CG scenes (including the swinging motions in the chase scenes) had to be calculated by hand, there simply was no software for it! Nowadays computer graphics are nearing perfection, and that's why a movie like this will never be made again.If you haven't seen this movie yet, to fully appreciate how groundbreaking it is, you must be willing to imagine that you're back in a time where the most complex computer animation to be seen were the moving blocks in video arcades or the 5 seconds of wire-frame models in Star Wars. You might expect that the resolution of the images will be very low and the pictures will be blocky, but this is totally untrue. The images were created at film resolution, often using methods which don't even involve the rasterization of images, so they look perfectly smooth. Some might say too smooth, due to the lack of texture mapping (which hardly existed at that time), but IMHO this is what gives the depicted 'digital world' its unique appearance.The story is not of great complexity, but it's original and entertaining enough. Of course it's a Disney movie, so there aren't many 'sharp edges' to it (a scene with a mildly erotic undertone was even removed), but don't expect 'Bambi' sweetness either. Grown-ups will probably be more amazed by the kind of effects they managed to pull off in 1982, while children will be enchanted by the strange world shown in this movie. If you want to entertain young kids during a hour and a half, this movie will be perfect. They will like every bit (pun intended) of it!",TRON
140,TomConnors,TRON Blu-Review...,10,24 July 2013,"TRON is one of those movies, that could have been as bigger, but yet still managed to weave it's way into the culture, especially with the internet boom in the 90′s. TRON has a hazy past on home video, only being released maybe twice on video, and once on DVD in a sub-par version, and then a decent special edition.The movie had become such a cult classic that Video Games and other forms of extended universe entertainment had always been in development at Disney. Nearly 30 years after the original film, a sequel, TRON: Legacy, was released. It would seem history would repeat itself with TRON's legacy, pun intended, as TRON: Legacy didn't exactly bust blocks, but did make it a viable franchise that does continue in Animation, Video Games, and a possible third film.So as a sequel was on the way you would think a Blu-Ray release of it's 1982 elder would be a no-brainer. This did occur, but not until he Home Video release of TRON: Legacy. That being said, it doesn't matter really in the grand scheme of things, other than maybe a bit more interest in the sequel, or what Disney seemed to fear, that audiences would turn away from the sequel as they did the original, because it is different, and when things are different it's hard to find a way for Hollywood to get their heads around it.I will review TRON: Legacy soon, but I want to take a look at the original first. It is a classic, no matter if you want to admit it or not, it is a breakthrough in not only technology and special effects on the screen for it's time, but is also the first film to use computer generated images, (CGI), and blend them with footage of real people.Disney tried to jump on the Arcade Game craze of the late 70′s and early 80′s and that is why it's more than obvious that is the reason Disney made this movie. The lead character in TRON isn't the character of the same name, but an Arcade owner and former game and program designer Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), who is trying to hack into his former employers computers to prove that his games were stolen by new VP of Encom, Ed Dillinger (David Warner). He is helped by former co-workers, Lora (Cindy Morgan) and Alan (Bruce Boxleitner) who just happen to create a new program called TRON, created to fix the problems with the new Master Control Program, Dillinger has total control over, so it seems. They try to break into Encom one night, while in the process Flynn is sucked into cyber-space accidentally and is now a user in the world of programs. Programs are like the people who make them, and of course resemble them. The world they live in though is where Disney's hard work comes in. It may not seem so visual by today's standards but the fact that the Academy disqualified the film because they used computers and felt they ""cheated"", goes to show that they were on to something, and this is modern film-making in it's infancy, light years ahead of the rest. (Less than 10 years later many awards were given to movies for utilizing computers, including Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Jurassic Park.) My review is getting a little long, and that is part of the turn-off to some people about TRON, it is a very simple story told in a very original and complicated way. There are so many elements that all tie in to the plight of Flynn to get home, and the programs defeating the Master Control Program, that forces them to play games to the death, like the Romans, using the ones it has use for, disposing of those it does not, and once a user gets thrown into the mix, everything changes.The Blu-Ray presentation is well done. The colors are vibrant, and the computer world stands out and even though some of the effects are archaic, High-Def doesn't really show the tape and glue, so much as enhances the charm of the challenge that this huge task was for the group behind it. The new sound mix is also well done for a 30 year old film, it serves it's purpose without complaint.The Blu-Ray adds a few new short documentaries in High Def, along with the previous DVD special edition bonus features, so everything is covered pretty well. The 2 Disc DVD from years ago was Criterion quality, so even if those features were all that were on here, it would still be a good haul.",TRON
141,joltjohn,A classic and a first for computer animation that is a little funny after 20 years of computer technology advancement,8,12 November 2002,"After 20 years of advancement in the world of computers (both in terms of technology and effects), Tron is quite interesting to revisit and is applauded for it's ground-breaking computer generated animation.  It also holds it's place in history as the first massive effort in computer animation. The film  had a damn cool story that is even a bit funny now looking back on it.   It is basically  one man a computer programmer named Flynn (Jeff Bridges) out to save the world  from the evil Master Control Program (or MCP).  But this time he has to do it from inside the ""computer world""   and he has to do while playing the games he created in the real world. But he does get help from a security program called Tron (Bruce Boxleitner) to overthrow the tyrannical MCP. I really liked the light cycle scene, and those glowing blue and red suits still look damn cool. And for those who are computer literate, the little in-jokes are still funny. Flynn's program named ""Clu"", the insurance program ""Ram"", and the Bit that will only answer ""Yes"" or ""No"", etc.
If you want the best-looking edition of Tron, you must get this DVD.Even though it says that it is 5.1 it doesn't sound like it. However, it does take advantage of the .1 channel to give you some rumbling bass in addition to the clearer sound.",TRON
142,imdb-21622,I feel it must be evaluated in context,7,16 May 2011,"The problem I see with some reviews is two-fold. One, the movie was not viewed in it's context. Perhaps that's a bit fair, but if I watch Metropolis and I give it a 1 / 10, people will flame me.When the movie was made, the graphics were so ahead of their time, they had to hire multiple companies to do the graphics. And they used super computers.The graphics are mostly important as impressive for the time. The costumes, did not fully work, nor did the sets. But forgive the movie makers that (The visual effect work for the costumes alone, was an amazingly difficult and tedious process, and could be considered a brave experiment.) Instead of focusing on that, I focus on the story. I think of it as a classical ""myth"" of sorts. You have your archetypes such as Tron as the night, and Dumont as the wise man, etc. It could be viewed in a religious or philosophical vein...there's a higher power of some sort you put your faith in blindly. Or there's technology vs the spiritual aspect of nature, etc. You can see many messages in the story.Good defeats evil. People's faith is rewarded.The weakest part is the dialog. Perhaps they simply had too many technical issues to concentrate on better dialog. I think Bridges is entertaining, if nothing else. No one else is really given the dialog to shine, except maybe Dumont and his real world self.I liked it then when I saw it, and I like it now. But I understand a modern audience may not see what I see.",TRON
143,ozymandiaskingofkings,"Like the Matrix, but with The Dude as neo...",9,1 July 2009,"Tron is one of the best films of the 80s. Fact. Never mind the smart Alec at the back telling you its nerdy and dated, or the small skit on the Simpsons which automatically made you (and I admit, me) think it was rubbish, Tron is an intelligent, groundbreaking movie that not only holds up incredibly well visually, but when viewed today, seems to foreshadow the Matrix to such an extent that the Wachowskis should hire a damn good lawyer when Disney notices. Obviously, it isn't as dark or as philosophical, its a fun sci-fi action film, but the fundamentals of plot and the main characters are very similar.The film follows Flynn, a slacker computer programmer who was fired after his work was plagiarised by the hissable David Warner. He tries to hack into the computer to download the eponymous Tron, an antivirus software which will stop the powerful Master Control Programme from taking over the world. So far, so cheesy. However, when it goes wrong he is beamed into the computer and things get distinctly more interesting.Flynn is now captured by computer game villains and force to compete in gladiatorial computer games he devised. After a while though he meets Tron. Tron is a chosen one who must get to the mainframe of the computer and upload a virus in order to stop the villainous computers. Along the way, Tron and Flynn meet an old man who was a remnant of the original programming and are pursued by one of the system's villainous agents. Sark, the villain could very easily be Agent Smith, with Tron as Neo, the old guy as the Oracle and Flynn as Morpheus, the huge chasms of difference in style between this and The Matrix masking very similar plot mechanics.The acting in the film is mostly strong, with the standout cast members the always excellent Jeff Bridges (whose Flynn is almost a precursor to The Dude) and David warner doing the token English bad guy thing as Sark and his real world counterpart. The biggest strength is the visual effects though. You have NEVER seen a film like Tron before, wonderful neon landscapes stretching to infinity in the imaginary computer world. The funny thing is, while people mock, if you try to imagine living inside a computer world, Tron is unavoidably what you come up with.So if you had trepidations about Tron in the past and are open for watching an entertaining, intelligent, exciting and visually stunning piece of work, I recommend you to seek it out.End of Line",TRON

145,mhlong,Interesting Film Especially For Its Time,8,18 December 2010,"OK, Sherman, set the Wayback for ..... What made this film very enjoyable for me were the references they used. That first line above is Flynn sitting in his room talking to Bradley (and maybe Lora). Taken from Mr. Peabody's Improbable History, a segment of Rocky and Bullwinkle. Now, forward to Bradley's cube, which was a perfect replica of cube farms that were quickly populating the countryside. And there on Bradley's wall was the phrase 'Gort, Klaatu berata nicto'. Taken from 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' which were words that Michael Rennie told Patricia Neal to say to the robot.Two little sequences, two references to popular culture, just before Trivial Pursuit (I was there at a pivotal moment for that icon)and I have do doubt there were more, that had to endear the movie to computer nerds and geeks everywhere. Not much, but seeing those, I knew somebody 'got it'. And to me, that is very important in movie making and relating to the audience (something I slammed in my review of the 2009 movie 'Land of the Lost'). I went to work for the old Burroughs Corp. right exactly at that time, 1981, and guess what their mainframe operating system was called? Yep, 'MCP'.The rest was interesting but straight forward storyline, some plot holes, and great graphics that still hold up. And a great sequence of lines 'here goes nothing' ... you mean 'here goes something, here comes nothing'.The light racer program was one of the first I played on a computer (just after Colossal Cave and StarTrek and that irritating Mouse game). I have always thought that Flynn's program name was Klu or short for kludge, because that's what he really was...or did, as his presence kludged the program giving Tron's user the ability to get in.Reading some of the reviews here, makes me realize that you had to see it in 1981-2 and understand what was going on at that time, and how much, or actually how little everyone knew, to really appreciate the movie. They didn't get it entirely right, but they were on the right track.And anyway, at that time I happened to enjoy Bruce Boxleitner, Jeff Bridges, and Barnard Hughes. Cindy Morgan was nice as was David Warner being evil. See him in this and see him in the George C. Scott 'A Christmas Carol' and you'll have a hard time believing it's the same person. He was in his 'Titanic' persona for this one.I'm seeing hints that the new movie seems to reference this one, bringing back actors and roles, etc. That gives it a head start for me. The original 'Tron' is worth the watch, if only to see the beginnings of cg.",TRON
146,dung_rat,An underrated piece of sci-fi genius...,7,18 January 2002,"Lisberger's 'TRON' is a very competent and enjoyable sci-fiextravaganza.Despite being a 'flop' when originally released this seriously is anunderrated classic. Ok, well, maybe the word 'classic' is a tadstrong but it certainly deserves alot more credit than many naivemovie-goers originally gave it. It's also rather annoying to see thatpeople still insist on giving the film a bad review even today.Special-effects-wise 'TRON' is a very original film; certainlyahead-of-its-time. The use of back-lit characters and sets helps tocreate a 'glowing wonderland', and considering the time, moneyand effort it took to create the computer-generated sections I feelthat this film more than succeeds in giving the audiencesomething truly unique. Erroneously mistaken for a film that was constructed entirely fromCGI, only around 15 minutes of 'TRON' is a result of this. However,considering that the film was made at the beginning of the 1980sthis is seriously impressive.The film obviously looks terribly dated now but for nostalgicreasons it still strikes a tender chord. The story is relativelystraightforward (then then again...aren't most 'Disney' features?)and the acting is everything that one would come to expect from akids action film. Jeff bridges gives a 'chirpy' performance as""Flynn"", and his alter-ego ""Clu"". 'TRON' isn't a film that's simply forkids though; there are deeper issues regarding the threat oftechnology and obsolescence...but I'm not going to go too muchinto that now (not enough time...).I did and still do enjoy this movie. I recently wrote a detailed thesisabout it for a University assignment fully justifying and supportingit. I just wish that some viewers can go back to 'TRON' at a laterdate and appreciate it slightly more. It is a great movie andseriously underrated. The 'light-cycle' duel is a great scene too!",TRON
147,Oceans17,Visual paradigm shift to 3D freedom,9,22 June 2007,"My parents taught me that cinema had cultural and entertaining value. But when Tron was released I had already seen ""Star Wars"" and learned another, perhaps more basic, lesson: you go to movies to see things that you had never seen before (like that huge space ship in the opening of SW). Could that wonderful ""loss of visual virginity"" be experienced again? It could, thanks to the computer wizards of Tron and futurist designer Syd Mead (""Blade Runner"") equaled in imagination only by Jean Giraud (Moebius).Like in SW, the camera could fly freely everywhere, no longer limited to slow travelings, zooms or attachment to the wing of an airplane. The virtual point of view was free and truly tridimensional. What in SW was achieved thanks to Dykstra's computerized camera, in Tron was by means of a fully digital world, and the camera motion was ""only"" a matter of calculation... Enter amazing networks and awesome ever-shifting perspectives over apparently infinite geometrical patterns, faceted mountains and very original hypercool vehicles (even the ""real"" helicopter is cool, with those red fluorescent lines).""Computer world"" strict, military hierarchy, adopted its aesthetic from video games, or was it the other way around? Anyway, I saw Tron at age twelve and understood the computer concepts very well. I had seen other sci-fi movies with less realistic robots or computers, and many scientific documentaries on computers, and Tron was a confirmation more than a revelation. In fact, I felt anchored in the past during years, until very recently (now we have Internet, cell phones and multimedia laptops). Even the idea of molecules suspended in laser beams has turned not only real but routine.That flight of transition into the ""computer world"" made me move in my seat, with real feelings of speed and acceleration, something I had only experienced with, again, Star Wars films (nowadays it's a usual feeling with all that CGI). No need of 4D moving seats: I even feel the motion when I watch Tron or SW on my TV at a normal distance.And that butterfly-shaped solar sail...

So accurate a look, actually, that it's almost unbelievable.Even today, many movies that talk about the Internet, are less truthful, believable, than Tron. In comparison, ""The Net"" is braindead.The other reason it gets a 10 are the CGI (computer graphic imagery) effects, stunning even by today's standards.Little spoiler ahead!! - I will mention the elements that I disliked: the acting wasn't very good, and the little scene of infidelity was out of place (the one where Flynn and the female program kiss romantically).But that's about it, I really enjoyed the movie, and was surprised that I didn't find any Disney-bollocks.

I was surprised to see such good special effects (and basic 3D graphics) in such an old movie (1982) and at the same time I was quite disappointed by the scenario. The story is boring, clichéd, and pointless. All the references to computer technology and programming are, as usual in cinema, just a mishmash of buzzwords with no meaning. It's obvious that the guy who was writing the script and directing this has no idea of how computers work.Still, it was quite interesting for me to see how general audience was perceiving games and computers in early 1980s.

So that in itself sparked an interest. But, all that said, it was one of those things that had went on the back burner. Anyway, watching it I was quite surprised at how good it really turned out to be. It seems somewhat dated, but not really. I think the characters in ' the real world' give the time frame away more than any of the technological effects.(The girls big glasses, etc.) BUt the cars were super cool, and I really liked the way the suits lit up...that seemed almost flawless...I am really curious about how they did that... was it some sort of gel or paint or lights in the suits, or what?

Its' uniqueness resides in the filming process used for figures in the computer world scenes via a process called ""back-lighting"". See the ""trivia"" section for more information on how this was done, but let me say that back-lighting creates the image that has stayed with me over the years and keeps bringing me back to this milestone movie. The world of the Programs is unlike any other visual setting I have experienced in a movie, with buildings, landscapes, characters, and vehicles that have to be seen to be believed. Like most fans, the Lightcycles and the battle discs are among my favorite images from the story, which while simple, is profound in the context of the evolution of the computing world. Having viewed the documentary on how this movie was made, I also have the utmost respect for the Lisberger team that had to invent the wheel to get this world on film. Bravo for their efforts, and shame to the MPAA for refusing them an Oscar for Special Effects.

158,xtonybueno,Tron as a Christian allegory,9,30 September 2000,"SPOILERS AHEADTron is a film I enjoyed so much as a child who grew up on the first generation of video games.  Now looking back on this film, I see that most people (including myself, until now)completely miss all of the symbolism it presents.Sark urges the blue programs to ""renounce this superstitious and hysterical belief"" in the users, knowing that to keep his warriors in line, they must not know the real truth.  Recall the scene where RAM asks ROM, ""you believe in the users?""  The answer is, ""Sure.  I mean, if I don't have a user, then who wrote me?""  Also recall that the blue programs were ridiculed and persecuted for their beliefs, and even forced to fight gladiator (albeit video game) style for their lives.Flynn represents the Christ figure.  He is paradoxically both user and program in the computer world, as Jesus Christ was (according to Christian doctrine) both man and God.  Recall the powers he has over other programs (repairing recognizers, saving others from untimely deaths).  The MCP and Sark (Caesar and Pontius Pilate?) are only defeated when Flynn voluntarily sacrifices himself by jumping into the core of the MCP.  This of course parallels Christ's accepting His own crucifixion to save Mankind.  After Tron throws the disc, Flynn's descent reverses and he ascends back in the real world (Christ's resurrection and return to Heaven).  Also recall that the whole computer world is freed and literally lights up as soon as the tyrannical MCP and Sark are vanquished.  The most important line of the whole film is when Yuri tells Tron, ""Flynn saved us!  He really did!""Add this to many, many other obvious and subtle symbols of Christianity (i.e. water/baptism/purification; the I/O tower which Tron uses to communicate with his user/ communication with God through church)and it's hard to see how so many people overlooked the hidden meaning of this movie.Highly recommended, the dated effects don't bother me one bit.  In fact, they even make me nostalgic for the simpler, far more primitive, charming time that was the 80's.  End of line.",TRON
159,JamesL-4,Truly a classic.,9,8 May 2001,"Tron is, so far as I am aware, the first motion picture to be based on the paradigm of a computer as a place for programs to live and work, and it argues quite eloquently for that paradigm. The combination of computer animation, colorized black-and-white footage, photo-rotoscoping, and creative set and costume design gives the world inside the computer a striking appearance, and the score, combining live orchestra, live chorus, analog and digital synths, and the Royal Albert Hall organ, is one of the finest to come from the pen of synthesist/composer Wendy Carlos.",TRON

The visual beauty of the film has never left me and I still can visualise the electronic world as a luminous land of electric sparks and stars.The story line was pretty good and although the well known games of the time were not used I don't think it detracted from the finished product.

164,zordmaker,on TRON : It was thirty years ago today...,10,2 February 2013,"TRON has always taken pole position as my FAVOURITE film – and that's a big thing. Maybe not the best, or always the most enjoyable but definitely my favourite.No film – anywhere – has ever (nor is likely to ever again) approached the artistic masterpiece that is TRON. Every frame is a work of art. TRON will always stand as the quintessential motion picture artwork of the 20th century.The artwork of TRON was constrained by the technology available at the time. However it is these same constraints that make the art of TRON so captivating, simple and visually wonderful. It's a bit like clearing your house of all the clutter and discovering the beauty of gazing upon clean framed windows and freshly painted walls.So much has been said about the animation of TRON. However what separates it from the pack is it's live action. It's like one massive dance. A celebration of movement, like 100 ballets all at once. TRON elevates this art form to it's absolute highest levels using a perfect white canvas upon which positively astounding visuals are superimposed. TRON is the perfect mix of life and art.TRON is ""Alice in Wonderland"". The TRON universe is a place which is so vastly different from our own and yet many rules are so similar. A place where just discovering things like how to live or even how to survive, eat, breathe, move and sleep can become a source of entertainment and challenge. It's a place where anything CAN happen, but rarely does. A place so taken for granted by everyone and everything involved in it but also so mysterious, unknown and undiscovered. A place so easy to imagine ourselves in or even wanting to escape to. This is the Electronic world of TRON. It's something I have not seen equalled in celluloid since this film's release in 1982. That includes the much more recent sequel TRON : Legacy.You may have heard it said that TRON is a religious film. Yet there are obviously no ""religions"" (as we know them) involved in it. TRON brings to the fore the value of life itself. Here we have an alternate universe filled with facsimiles (programs) of ourselves (the users). The programs view their user (or at least the ""collective"" of users) as their creator or god. They look to them for guidance, protection and an answer to that almighty question of ""why"". The programs (just like us) know not of why they must do the things they do – but they follow the motions all the same, believing that us ""users"" really know what we're doing. They hope that one day it will all make sense to them.TRON deals with the struggle of life and calls into question the value of it. TRON programs are so easily ""dispensed with"" because they are not supposed to be living. The look of horror that fills the face of a of TRON character when they suddenly realise death is imminent and that they have failed in their task – it boils up an emotion within us that cannot be ignored. A disgust that life could be worth so little and that something so frivolous and pointless as losing a video game match could result in a precious, innocent and child like life being destroyed.It's interesting for me to remember waaaay back in 1982 overhearing a small group of young women discussing several films they had recently seen between each other. One of them had seen TRON, the other two had not but had seen trailers. Right away the one that had seen it, picked up on the tragedy that is TRON.""Did you know that they really DIE when they die in those video games? That was really hard and disturbing to watch"".Here was an ordinary (female!!) movie goer who had seen the film. Despite all the fuss about ground breaking animation, up to date graphics, amazing artwork and fantastic story lines the one thing that made an impression on her (and became the talking point with friends) was the tragic message that lies behind this amazing film.Yori's Love Scene.The biggest blunder in film history must surely have been the deletion of this completed scene from TRON. I have always wondered why in the '80s, about two thirds through watching the film I often used to get bored with it. More often than not I would stop the film around that point and come back to finish watching it later.Now I know why.The place that I would always seem to stop it was where this scene belonged. The scene was pivotal in telling the human tragedy within the story of TRON and helping to bring to life the characters. It was just 30 seconds of film. Yori's love scene would have introduced a completely new dimension to the film. It would have posed the question : just where do programs come from? If they can love each other.. if there can be such a thing as sexual activity between two TRON programs then what is the purpose? Can two programs create a new one? Who would that program's user be? Yori's love scene explores not only relationships between two living machines.. it goes on to explore the ultimate relationship between them. Cool concepts and questions posed that almost certainly would have woken up just about anybody watching at that crucial moment. It would have more than easily left ET looking very dull by comparison.Paul Matthews.",TRON
165,elvisrivet-1,Opens up and ends great but the middle drags on far to long,6,4 December 2010,"Let me start off by saying for a movie that was made back in 82 I got to say I loved the visuals even if I was only born in 1994. The film is good like a lot of people are saying it is. The score for the film is good, the visuals were good and the acting was decent for a movie made back in the 80's. The film opens up great with the main characters. We meet our hero and our villain we even get to see a little bit of the computer world a little early on which I found to be really great to show. While the opening was great, the middle was just OK and nothing what I was expecting or hoping for to be honest with you. The problem with the middle is that it drags on far to long, there was not enough action. The story was just not going anywhere and at this point you really didn't care to much about the characters, except for Flynn and maybe Tron himself. The middle was really the only thing I didn't like about the film and like I said it dragged on to long. But that is only a small nitpick compared to the rest of the wonderful and beautiful film, it's no wonder why this film is loved so much by the fans it's because it did something that no other film back then dared to do. Tron is a very good film that only suffers from the middle half, if you like good movies then you might want to look at Tron. Now bring on Tron Legacy.",TRON

Not only is the movie ""cool"" but it actually has story.  Most people I know say, ""I had no idea what was going on"".  This is totally the computer geek's sci-fi movie.  They all said, ""Now why is that guy with the glasses and the girl in the computer now?  They were outside!""  No one grabbed the concept of a persons program carrying their traits.  Aside from the satisfaction of having a game genius actually ""play"" the games, the movie puts forth a very important social commentary by the MCP calling programs trying to reach the outside ""religious fanatics.""  I just think TRON is fabulous outside of the effects, it's just a great movie.  A dream for a child, and a well executed otherwise.  Just a thought.",TRON

And you know that this flick broke animation barriers in sci-fi. They should re-release ""Tron"" in the theaters and it would make big bucks which it didn't 17 years ago. This was the movie that Bruce Boxleitner starred in before he became famous in the sci-fi show (OF COURSE!) in ""BABYLON 5"".

170,SpaceMonkey-Mafioso,The Genesis of the Cinematic Digital Revolution,8,25 November 2006,"I love Tron. I thought it was great when I was kid. And, I still think it's great. I've never understood the hate it gets from so many. I can understand some people's issues with the world outside of the computer in the film. But once Flynn is sucked inside the supercomputer, Tron is magic.This has a lot to do with the groundbreaking look of the film: the mix of black and white film stock with neon computer generated imagery. There hasn't been anything quiet like it since, but it's influenced the look of countless movies AND video games. One would think a film with such a groundbreaking look would be critically hailed, but Tron still remains mostly ignored in cinematic circles. It's knocked down for it's story, character development, etc; I personally find the story inspiring.The sound of Tron is almost as great as the look. Wendy Carlos' score takes electronic synthesizer music to a sublime and other-worldly high.Cinephiles praise Fritz Lang's Metropolis for its groundbreaking look(as they should.) But, please note: they're not praising Metropolis for its story, characters or acting; it's all about the cinematic vision. Isn't Tron basically a digital age reboot of Metropolis? Metropolis ushered in the age of early sci-fi; Tron ushered in the DIGITAL age of sci-fi cinema. It's time Tron got the respect it deserves.",TRON
171,backflipboy,"26 years later, this still holds up well",10,25 April 2008,"I got to watch this movie this morning when they played it on Showtime - I hadn't seen in in something 15 years or so. Interestingly, it was rated ""G"" - I would have given it a PG because, real or not, people did expire at times.With personal computers just entering peoples homes when this movie was released, the only people that had any real access to computers programmers and data entry operators that used computers in their every day life. The fact that this film didn't make the big dollars at the box office doesn't mean it wasn't a good concept, it just meant that people who didn't understand this new technological onslaught weren't about to shell out their hard earned money to see it.Yes, it certainly looks dated, but everything looks that way from the point of view of 20 odd years into the future but some of the tech we take for granted today was there - for example, Dillinger's touch screen desk shows some forward thinking in an age of chunky push buttons and knobs.Throughout the film, there seems to be a hidden message about the danger of allowing one all encompassing power to take control of smaller and weaker ones - an unintentional allusion to the dangers of a one world government perhaps. Was the MCP really the USA or USSR in disguise? Acting performances were generally good. David Warner played the sinister bad guy to great effect as he always has. Even at such a young(ish) age, he had a threatening aura about him. Bruce Boxleitner seemed to be a bit wasted considering his was the title role. His ""real world"" role was damaged by the ridiculous eye wear he had stuck to his head (I couldn't stop looking at the nerdy glasses he wore) and Jeff Bridges played the part of Jeff Bridges perfectly (I am sure that one day he'll play someone else).I see the movie is to be remade in 2010. I would hope that it is faithful to the spirit of this original version and that they don't go CGI mad on it.

173,Neonfinity,My Favorite Movie of All-Time,10,20 November 2017,"Tron is a 1982 Science Fiction film directed by Steven Lisberger and stars Jeff Bridges, David Warner, and Bruce Boxleitner. It was distributed by Disney and I consider it my favorite film of all time.Tron follows the story of a ""young, bright"" game programmer and arcade owner Kevin Flynn (Bridges), whose job is taken away by another employee of ENCOM, Dillinger (Warner). Wanting to find evidence of taking Flynn's credit and selling games under his name. With the help of Alan (Boxleitner) and Lora, he goes into the world of Tron, ""where energy lives and breathes"". The characters in Tron are a little shallow, especially the titular character. Flynn and Dillinger, along with his digital counterpart, Sark, pretty much steal their scenes. Flynn himself was somewhat a Jesus figure on the grid who was really an everyday guy which is kinda neat to think about. Sark himself gives off a menacing presence in his scenes, though with a little bit of humor attached.I love this movie. The reason it is my favorite is due to the huge impact it had on my life ever since i've first heard about it. It has quite the reputation in visual effects being the first ever movie to include extensive use of CGI in 1982 (20 minutes worth). The distinct style of the world Tron presents bear a huge impact on cyberpunk culture and it's early representation on computers as a positive impact.Tron includes themes of Religion and Technology. One of the main points of the movie as mentioned before is that Flynn is Jesus on the grid and Tron represents a ""David the Warrior"" type figure. Tron envisioned technology better than most movies of the past using computer-literate terms to describe the world and what characters do, though to a degree. Tron didn't do well during its time and became a cult classic over the years. There is and are people who can appreciate the film the most for nostalgia and visuals with a pretty big impact. This is one of those films that people say ""isn't for everyone"". Overall, I give Tron a",TRON

Being a movie released in 1982, the special effects are rudimentary, at times confusing, and somewhat annoying (the colors are too bright), but computer and video game geeks like myself will surely love this movie.
The plot is simple as compared to other movies of that era (like ""Star Wars""), but the concept behind computer stuff is quite complex. And visionary, I might add.I love the song played in the closing credits: ""Only Solutions"", by Journey. Another song by Journey (""Separate Ways"") is featured in ""Tron: Legacy"", thus giving an idea of continuity.Tron is a must-see for every science fiction fan.

178,mellowo,why does this movie have a cult following?,3,22 February 2016,"I don't like Tron. There I said it. People regard this film as a cult classic but personally I don't see why.For anyone that is unaware, Tron is a film released in 1982. It's about a video game creator's idea being stolen by a big company head. He goes in to get proof that the idea was his, only for a machine to get him sucked into the game he created. He needs to work with programs that he created in order to get out as well as fight against viruses inside the game in order to get out. The plot was probably one of the best things about the film. It was quite a unique idea at the time and was interesting to see this new sort of plot being taken on.The main thing that's praised about Tron is its visuals and I'll come to agree. The movie's effects were really impressive for the time and even live up today.The one thing I noticed about the reviews of Tron was that they only seemed to talk about how good the visuals were and didn't talk about anything else. I find Tron stupid. Some questions are left unanswered and it also has a few confusing and unnecessary parts. I will go onto list them here. At the start of the movie a scientist says ""his whole life he's worked on a machine"" and that machine's purpose is to make objects disappear and then they reappear a few seconds later. I don't know about you but I think that's his life wasted. I can't think in one way how that sort of machine could be useful. The guy who created the game is introduced in an arcade playing a video game which he for some reason sweats from, I don't know one person who sweats from playing a video game. It might have also just been an excuse for that actor to take their top off to reveal his pecks for no reason and yes that actually happens. There is a scene when he's about to have a fight to the death with a program. I'm not sure about you but if I was going into a fight to the death and I was just a video game creator, I would be terrified, but this programmer isn't as he goes into the fight to the death grinning like an idiot. There's a huge dramatic moment where one of the programs dies and despite this program appearing in about 2/3s of the film, the other characters don't seem to care. I'm actually going to type the dialogue that is delivered after he dies.""Where is he?"" ""He died"" ""*gasp* alright* I'm not joking, that is actually what is said. There's another part where one of the programs is tired from lying down. I'm not joking about that either. He literally lies down, gets up and is gasping for breath.I fail to see how other reviews of this movie haven't considered that this movie is so bad that it's good. That's how I see it. Yes the plot is creative and the visuals are cool and still hold up today but everything else falls flat. The characters aren't given anything to be called characters, the acting given off feels like the actors were held at gunpoint to perform, there are scenes that don't go anywhere, and most of all it suffers from bad writing.",TRON

If it were released into theaters today, ""Tron"" would be a smash hit, 'cause the movie-audiences of today would understand it a heckuva lot better than the movie-audiences of 1982.""Tron"" tells the story of a young computer programmer named Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who gets sucked INTO a computer, and must fight for his life playing life-or-death video games, run by the evil Master Control Program. With the aid of a good warrior program named Tron (Bruce Boxleitner), and Tron's significant-other Yori (Cindy Morgan), Flynn must put a stop to the MCP and set things right in the computer world once again before returning to his own world.With breathtakingly beautiful computer-animation (and the very first film to use computer-animation extensively), and presenting an original, dazzling world where energy lives and breathes inside a computer, ""Tron"" was way ahead of it's time. This may explain why the film was greeted with incomprehension from critics and audience members alike back in 1982.The problem was, back in 1982, there was no such thing as the Internet, and, apart from business types, most people didn't really know diddlysquat about computers yet. As a result, the computer jargon heard throughout ""Tron"" went sailing over most audience members' heads, and for many, the story was difficult to follow. Critics complained that ""Tron"" was all special effects and no story. And, for the final insult, ""Tron"" wasn't even NOMINATED for Best Visual Effects at Oscar time, presumably because the Academy in 1982 didn't recognize computer-animation as ""genuine"" visual effects, i.e. ""it's animation, not visual effects,"" they thought to themselves. ""The Abyss"" changed all that in 1989, but that was a big seven years after ""Tron."" Obviously, everyone in 1982 had missed the film's point.But the passing of time has been very kind to ""Tron.""

183,jackman-74739,A lovely time capsule of a neon blue era,7,27 April 2020,"The first time I watched this film, I was around 9 years old. I rented it from a library and watched it at a friends house, and being honest, it's somehow exactly how I remembered it.
It's quite surreal, having a plot take place inside a computer and it's clear there are places where it's being pulled out of nowhere, using computer buzz words like 'ram' and 'programs' to be cool and fit into the universe, which kinda adds to the weird charm of the film. I cannot tell whether it takes its self seriously or not at all because there are places where it tries to pull at your heart strings or create a serious moment but there are other moments where you just zone out from some of the imagery on screen.
Major credit to Jeff bridges who just seems like he's having a whale of a time. He and the bad guy carry this film by fully embracing this idea and doing the best job they can, although it's clear they have no idea what's going on and that's just brilliant to me.
The main thing I love about this film is the visuals. They are straight out of a tame impala album cover. I can't tell if it's matte paintings or early digital imaging but either way it looks like it was intedned to; it's so dated to the point where it's come back around and looks impressive. I need to see how they did all this stuff in the early 80s, must have blown people's minds.
Although, they never really explain things though. I kinda could maybe tell what was going on because I've seen the film already but half the things they just don't explain, which did get confusing in places.

I remember the impact the special effects and particularily, the Snake/motorbike races, had on me as a kid - I loved it. It was a great film to watch as a sci-fi hungry kid.Now, almost twenty years later I decided to buy the special edition dvd which was released last year, mostly because I wanted to see it again, but also to see how well/badly it had aged.I had expected it to be a nostalgic, but unimpressive rewatch - full of bad matte lines and badly animated cgi. And, ok, there are lots of fat matte lines around the characters, but the cgi is still good, actually. It's animated well, and it's clear that a lot of thought went into creating the basic design and look of the film, which is wonderful. Thankfully, the filmmakers chose to go with a completely alien look, meaning that they never wanted the film to look realistic or life-like. This is the main reason why the film and it's effects have stood the test of time. I must admit, there were times when I went 'wow, that looks really cool!'I also think that the film is exciting and suspenseful and the action scenes still feel very original and fun. Gotta love those race scenes - they're great!And, combined with a great electronic soundtrack, this was a highly enjoyable revisit. I heartily recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi and effects-driven films.I give it an 8/10 for still feeling as fresh and interesting, as it was all those years ago.",TRON

As I plopped myself upon the couch.  My friend, who had given me several sharp kicks, now explained what had happened thus far (something about how this guy was zapped into a super computer because some guy had stolen his computer games or something...it really wasn't logic based) and so i accepted it as illogical at best.  And just enjoyed myself as it wallowed it in its own crapulence.  A lot of stuff happened but i really don't know what if anything was accomplished. Undoubtedly the movie hit its peak in an energy frisbee battle (that's right energy frisbee battle) between Tron(?) and some other guy in orange.

But this world has now fallen under the tyrannical control of the ""Master Control Program"", who seeks nothing except complete domination.  A whimsical hacker (Jeff Bridges)is transformed into electrical energy and brought into this pseudo-reality against his will.

188,Karri_Koivusalo,Grievously underrated cult movie.,8,11 October 2005,"Tron was made in 1981-1982, at the time when home computing was in it's infancy. The greatest home computers at the time were Commodore 64, Atari XL series and Apple 2 computers, all which were quite expensive. Computers were the new uncharted land, and there Tron established it's realm of fantasy.Tron is sci-fi only superficially. It's roots are deep in the fantasy, translated into a modern-day high-tech world. The creators knew they weren't doing an essay on how computers worked. In today's computer-savvy world the story might appear as anthropomorphic naivety, but the pseudo-realistic hacker movies of the '80s (and the '90s) have fared much worse.Computer time was very expensive in the early '80s, and the software wasn't too advanced. The brilliant idea was to use the CGI to depict the immaterial world inside the computer, instead of trying to mimic the real world, which really wasn't feasible until some 10 years later. At the completion of the film, the technology used for Tron was cutting edge, and the CGI was the best seen so far. Today, the graphics are outdated, but in their role, depicting the world inside a computer, they are perfectly sufficient.I believe Tron is not for everyone's liking, but as a modern age fantasy, it's a great movie.",TRON
189,mwwmb,one of the great sci-fi films of all-time !,10,12 June 2005,"Tron is even to this date one of the best sci-fi films ever made. simply because it's a simple and complex film . a film that does count on s/f's but that's only a part of it, another story of good vs. evil. good performances from the leads,fun story ,and at the time really jumps on the very 1st video game craze. the landmark in special effects and film-making . not much credit at time of at it's release but at 23yrs old it's still one of the best. today to many films count on special effects to carry them . stories get lost in them, you tend to forget what the film is about and the effects is one of the main reasons you'll see them tron still performs on the highest level even today. as effects have gotten so real the stories have gotten more lost. films like the great minority report is also like tron shows respect for story telling & great effects and when it's mixed right you'll have films that will never be forgotten.",TRON
190,rburton66,One-dimensional storytelling in 3D!,3,27 May 2006,"Tron reminds me of another one-word titled film that relied on special effects to bring in money: Them! from 1954. Neither film's effects hold up over the years. That is where the comparison fades since Them!, bizarrely, is the only one of the two with a slight focus on dialogue and plot. Tron lacks all the vital elements for a good film and instead hurls us into a nonsensical world of pastel colors and cheesy effects. Dialogue and plot may not exist within the mind of a super-intelligent computer, but any somewhat-intelligent human should be wondering where they are. With shots and ideas stolen directly from Star Wars, something must have gone wrong at a fundamental level to make Tron look like Star Wars's ugly cousin.The suspension of disbelief is important for a viewer to have when watching a movie. Tron is certainly no slice of life, but has characters that look very much like a slice of key lime pie. I am well aware that the possibility of Jeff Bridges being transported into a computer is fairly slim. It does not especially bother me that Tron, Yori, and Sark all look like people he knows in the real world. For all I know, he could just be really, really high. But the fact that Flynn (Bridges) and Tron and Yori are all wandering around in costumes that Star Wars's stormtroopers would laugh hysterically at sort of grates my nerves. The film is not the visual feast it thinks it is. Honestly, the film is not remotely entertaining. The sense of urgency we are required to feel in this adventure does not seem plausible when one stops to think, ""If a user's program took this long to contact me when I tried talking to it, I would go outside and play baseball and maybe hope it would talk to me in an hour or two."" There is no urgency. There is no logic in Master Control's desire to take over the world. In fact, that is a subplot so desperate to draw us into the story that the movie is obviously using scare tactics to convince us we think it is cool. Yes, Master Control, you are so cool. You shrunk Jeff Bridges. You are making him perform tedious tasks instead of killing him when he obviously would waste no time in killing you. You know, Tron's a pretty capable hero. I think he would make it OK without Jeff Bridges, but never underestimate star power in a bad Disney film. He even manages to kiss Yori without making her short circuit, in a proud tradition of female Disney characters who could not possibly be more one-dimensional.There are no impressive twists or turns in this film, and not a single, catchy one-liner to be heard in a string of flat dialogue. The film lacks charm, story, but at least I can be glad we have come a long way since 1982... sort of.",TRON
191,courtjester,Grandaddy of the computer animation revolution,9,1 July 2001,"When I first saw this movie as a wee lad it blew my mind.  So the computer animation in the film may have been eclipsed and the mythology about what goes on inside a computer may call for suspension of disbelief in a more computer-savvy America - but by 1982 standards it's way ahead of its time.For those of you who had an Atari or Collecovision in the early 80s or dumping pockets full of quarters into the arcade games of the era, this film is a stunning interpretation of the look and sound of those games.  The Wendy Carlos score brilliantly incorporates electronic music to add another texture layer to the world of Tron.  This film is worth checking out for its unique visuals alone, but also sports a very good (if perhaps more child-oriented) story.",TRON

Of course when watching the movie, i wasn't expecting Lord of The Rings graphics but i didn't expect what i saw. It was incredibly simple and frame like and the dialog was corny...if there was any at all. The soundtrack was especially annoying due to the monotony of the computer generated noise. It wasn't all bad for me though since i found the concept behind the movie very original and well put out...a good plot was lacking however and the plot had more holes than a sieve. Anyway, it was painfully entertaining but i must say that what i enjoyed the most was relating the characters and setting to the modern day computer.

193,ripplesofserenity,A reminder of an age gone by,7,21 March 2010,"Tron is a reminder of an age gone by; today's Hollywood is a hallmark of amazing CGI to create ""real"" real world scenarios. On the contrary Tron uses more traditional techniques and real world elements to generate a virtual world, that of inside a computer. This is a movie for those who at some point in life shared an undying excitement for pong, pac-man and upright cabins of arcade games. Inspired by animation techniques of MAGI and the gaming excitement of Pong, director Steve Lisberger had a vision of integrating the two and bringing the spectacular of video games and computer visuals to silver screen. Tron is a story of a game designer/ hacker Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who is cheated by an ambitious ENCOM programmer named Ed Dillinger (David Warner) who locks Flynn out of the system and presents Flynn's work as his own. To prove Ed Dillinger's wrong doing Flynn tries to hack into the ENCOM mainframe to find evidence of Dillinger's wrongdoing, but his program, Clu, is caught and erased by the Master Control Program (MCP).MCP is this big-fat AI antagonist who thinks ""it"" can do thing ""900 to 1200 times better than any human."" and decided to take on Pentagon. Meanwhile, Alan a.k.a TRON (Bruce Boxleitner) and his girlfriend, Dr. Lora Baines a.k.a Yori (Cindy Morgan), friends of Flynn sneak him into ENCOM's laser laboratory, where he forge access to mainframe. Lora, who has been developing a method of digitizing real objects into the computer, sets Flynn down at her terminal in the laser lab. As Flynn attempts to break into the system, he is confronted by the MCP, who takes control of the laser and digitizes Flynn into the ENCOM mainframe. Flynn finds himself in the digital world, where Programs resemble their human creators, the Users. Here Sark, a MCPs minion forces the captured programs in a gladiator combat till they are eliminated.Tron is almost wholly a technological movie, of a computer world where programs make themselves romantic and display human nature; first of its kind with many to follow in its footsteps.""It's exciting, it's fun, and it's just what video-game fans and anyone with a spirit of adventure will love—despite plot weaknesses.""",TRON

Tron employs some of the best cinematography ever done; when you see the close-up of Sark's eyes at the conclusion of the ring game, you feel the tension.

However, that's not to say there is some substance there and the character of Kevin Flynn and his pursuit for the wrong done to him at least holds your attention for periods.An all time classic, probably not, a solid film that you can re-watch, definitely. Also, a good bench mark to see how the improvement of visual effects has progressed, however, I am sure if I watched this in 1982 I would have been blown away by the special effects and that needs to be considered when reviewing this film, taking into consideration the context of the time it was made and its contemporaries.A solid seven, light weight in some departments but always a fun watch, even to this day.",TRON

I always was forced to watch this stupid movie until I learned all the words:""Tron, Tron, Where are you?"" ""I'm in the computer""Very nice
Yes I fell asleep once or twice but then again I don't think I was missing much apart from a few guys jumping around and throwing things, there was a bit where they were racing on these little electric bikes in this little microchip thing. Was there really a point? If you have ever played on a game called halflife:ricochet you may see that they copy this idea, and yet people wonder why it is the most unpopular game in the world.
In short this film has a very thin plot, without a doubt the worst special effects with relation to the period in time and these actors (if they say they are actors) make a mockery of SI-FI films.

Mr. Lisberger and his team were like the real life Kevin Flynns embarking upon a quest to bring something groundbreaking to the screen.I watched this again after having recently gone and watched Tron Legacy (which was an unforgettable experience, especially in IMAX 3D), and I know now why Tron left an indelible impression on me from when I first watched it in my pre-teen years. Even now, although admittedly for me I'd go with the Tron Legacy generation of effects, if I put myself in the shoes of someone in the early to mid eighties, this film sweeps one off their feet.There's something otherworldly yet familiar about the world Lisberger propels the viewer into, with programs and the interface with users. The characters are great, the story is something you can follow enjoyably and the created world is a treat for the eyes, especially the gladitorial combat scenes (give me a light cycle any day).One thing that I have felt from watching Tron Legacy is that it has kept the spirit of Tron, in terms of what the film and the characters strive to achieve, free data movement and uncorrupted access amongst the aims. Tron is as much the perfect prequel as Tron Legacy is the perfect sequel. They work hand in hand and 28 years apart, it couldn't have been done better I think.I'm so glad I have watched this film again, it will shine looooooong into the future as a landmark moment in movie history.

Also starring David Warner as Ed Dillinger, Cindy Morgan as Lora, Barnard Hughes as Dr. Walter Gibbs, Dan Shor as Ram and Peter Jurasik as Crom. It is obviously very dated by today's standards of computer animation imagination, but to see where cinematic territory was broken is interesting I guess, it did appeal more to video game fans.

210,chris-m-c,A Beautiful Film,8,22 January 2005,"More than just reminiscent of Lang's Metropolis, Tron is a beautiful, well made exercise from a main stream producer (Disney) which reminds us of the time before Jurassic Park and Episode One where creative skill was left to human perception rather than a computer's digitally correct ideal. Owing more to the human colourists than the now outdated computer effects, this film is evidence - similar in a way to Kubric's pre-Moon landing, pre-CGI 2001 - to the creative and more sensory-pleasing abilities of the human artist over soul-less programmers, from a time before when a box would 'parse' it all for you. It's difficult to express how high-powered computers fail to create an image that is satisfactory to the human eye; there is always something that rings false about it. Tron was created in a period of wire diagrams being the best you could coax from a computer; anything else was added by human hand. A film that makes you nostalgic for the time when Disney made films that were accessible for all, almost Bakshi-like in its disregard for the mainstream. There is struggle against adversity; there is an oppressive, evil regime; there are two heroes who survive despite all odds; and there is love conquering all (a token woman is included as love interest. Ironically like the IT industry). The naive use of technical jargon merely adds to the ""computer program"" style setting and this film is ideally suited for today's retro-chic society. As a Disney film this is aimed predominantly at children, so if you fail to understand the plot then I would recommend sticking to the Lion King or some other pabulum.

When I did, I was bored. I don't Think I've ever waited so long for a movie to end. However, let's first discuss the good parts. The villain, Master Control, was neat. He was cool, he was intimidating, he had a menacing voice and he was one of the few effects in the Movie that aged well. When in the real world, the movie was okay. It looked promising and Jeff Bridges was pretty likable. However that completely changed when he entered the virtual world, where 20 percent of his lines were one-liners. And now the bad things: I'm sure the effects were revolutionary for 1982, but they look soooooooooooo dated when watched in the 21st Century. The acting turns bad as well, and we've heard the story so many times, or so we think, but then it gets so complicated it's hard to understand it. You'll probably like this movie if you like computers, but I didn't like it at all. 5/10.",TRON

220,neuromancerxl,Tron was at the beginning,10,16 January 2012,"What can a person say about the movie TRON? well ... It was at the forefront of modern SCi FI.. the movie came out before many of the novels and comics which shaped what we know as cyberpunk ..Far as I'm concerned without Tron .. we might not have ever had Neuromancer, Matrix, Lawnmower man ( film), the hacking culture would have taken longer to come into the main stream .. heck even movies like war games may have taken years longer to be filmed if it weren't for the buzz Tron started about computers .. computer animation .. AI and hacking ..the film itself considered in the time frame it was released, was stunning and action packed for its day .. revolutionary .. Jeff bridges is great as usual. I enjoy his character Flynn more so than any other character he's played, even more so then the dude from big lebowski ..some great nods to other sci fi greats like the original "" day the earth stood still"" Tron is a great, feel good, loaded with 80's nostalgia. If you are into retro you cant go wrong .. Younglings who want to see where and how it all began should check this movie out .. I bought the anniversary DVD along with tron legacy not too long ago ..""that's Tron ... he fights for the users""",TRON
221,m.se,Charming special effects mile stone,7,4 July 2004,"Tron is perhaps not the most important movie ever made story-wise, but it certainly is a mile stone along the road of special effects. With Star Wars having been released five and The Empire Strikes Back two years earlier a person watching the movie for the first time today may not think that its all that amazing even in that aspect, but what's so special is that it helped divert special effects into a whole new direction - obviously into a far more computer oriented one. The effects may never have been considered as stunning as the previously mentioned Star Wars movies were at the time, but they do possess a certain charm that gives Tron quite a unique feel to it. And unlike most movies you see today Tron comes with a tricky little post-movie challenge. After having seen the movie, try telling your friends about it and convince them to see it - without sounding like you've completely lost it.""Well, its about a guy who's like sucked into a computer and forced to participate in computer games from like the Pong era... but he decides to revolt and fight this master control program (sort of like Windows or MacOS i suppose)... and to his assistance he has this guy, who's like a fire wall or something.

Tron is an amazing film even 20 years after it was released. Even though the computer graphics and sythesised music seem odd, they were top notch back in 1982.  I love this movie. I think you have to be really geeky, like myself, to really enjoy it.  The plot in the beginning of the movie goes fast and is kind of hard to follow but most of it comes together later in the film.

Owning that (any) kind of computer at the time meant parting with most of your annual salary. And for what? People didn't really see why and how they would benefit.I think TRON was a milestone in changing this sentiment and it had took a naive, but critical approach to the dangers of the virtual world (back then...?)

They were prophesying a world in which computers took over our day-to-day tasks (see Dr. Gibbs' great soliloquy towards Dillinger), video games became a way of life, and computer animation changed the way movies are made.It's no wonder that the minds behind Tron went on to form Pixar Animation.If Tron is watched by someone remembering that it was made when Gibson's ideas of ""cyberspace"" were only twinkles in science fiction's collective eyes, and see Tron as a forbearer of movies such as ""The Matrix"" (thematically) and ""Toy Story"" (technically), then to discount this film as silly or cheesy sci-fi would be a real shame.Every sci-fi or animation buff should see this movie.",TRON

One can't also forget the original Battlestar Galactica and Buck Rogers. The visuals in those looked cool back then.Now when they are watched, they seem really cheesy. The new Battlestar Galactica is way better.Tron has not suffered that fate. Those that criticize the movie need to look back on the technology of the time. Home computers were in their infancy. The internet barely existed. Who knew what the World Wide Web was?

230,riebau,Retro Graphics,10,27 December 2000,"I haven't seen this movie in a long, long time.  I asked for the DVD for Christmas. Upon viewing it for the first time where I could actually comprehend it and appreciate it, I loved it. I had to remember the fact that this movie was made back in '82 and that computers were a lot different than they are today. Remember, the mouse was just about to become a new piece of technological innovation that would revolutionise the way we use computers today!I am a graphic designer and I also work on website aesthetics, so I love to look at things in a sort of artistic-beauty-mode. This movie is the first of its kind to implement a computer generated three-dimensional painting matted with real-life subjects. The colors, though simple, effectively portray a digital mode of exhistance. The Lightcycles are definitely the most retro, futuristic, righteous part of the movie - I think. The gladitorial aspect of the story is definitely timeless as well.To think that a TRON 2.0 is in the works only excites me to imagine what is capable right now in the field of computer generated effects, and what the TRON producers of '82 were limited to are mindboggling. A new representation of this movie now in the present will also surely be appreciated as most of us are now ""users"" whereas back then only a select number of ""computer jocks"" knew what all the lingo and concepts meant. TRON was way ahead of its time, and to remember the technical limitations under which were worked, only makes me think that we need that kind of innovation here and now where virtually anything can be infinitely portrayed.",TRON
231,adgarza,It changed my life,10,25 December 2006,"Well... I have to confess... Tron changed my life back in 1982. I saw it because my brother took me to the cinema to see that ""awful"" movie. I remember that days: learning computing was like learn to swim without a pool (there were only classrooms with boards but no computers to practice). Then, computing was merely a weird subject in life, only at the reach of freaks and nerds... Yes, my brother was one...I don't know if it was because of the hour and the day we went to the cinema (was the last function by 22:00 not in weekend) but the place was alone... There were no more than 50 or 70 persons there, and some other were arriving suddenly... I thought that I was missing my time but, he was my eldest brother. And I really love to spent my time with him...Well... The movie was impressive since the first shots... ""Oh, my god! How the hell did they that effects?"". I was at the edge of my seat during almost all the movie, wondering how they did all that... I barely understood all the jargon used in the movie (my brother did his best to try to explain to me all that, but I didn't understood what the hell is a bit as ""the minimum information piece of a computer"").Since then I decided to decant towards the computer field. Computers became my passion and in 1985 I bought my first PC. Well... I still sign my messages as Tron.BAS (Being Tron a suffix of a motto that people used with me (Computron), a keyword from BASIC language, and the title of this movie; and .BAS because I develop applications with BASIC, so I am a BASIC program by my own).Now, my children doesn't understand it... My daughter started to play Tron 2.0 and her interest for the movie growth. I think we will see it now, with calm, and trying to explain why this movie is so important to me as is my way to live now.

232,day@telme.com,Totally underated,9,20 January 2003,"When I first saw this film in 1982 I was 10, twenty years later it still entertains me. surely one of the best accolades a film can get.There are two worlds, the world we know (the world of the Users), and the world of the Programmes. Flynn is a wiz-kid programmer looking for proof that his video games have been stolen by his old employer. During an attempt to find his proof the evil MCP transports Flynn in to the digital world and forces him to play in his own video games to the death. But he has help, a programme created to fight the tyrannical MCP called TRON.
Maybe i am looking too deep into this film but it works on so many different levels.The graphic style, the Story , the obvious comparisons between the worlds of the Users and the Programmes, the films religious overtones. Plus all the geek stuff.It is difficult to watch allot of older sci-fi fantasy without the technological limitations getting in the way. But not with TRON, the special effects don't seem dated because they have such a unique style.It is important though to realise that TRON is a Disney film and really has none of the sophistication or grit that modern films have. Also the story relies on the visuals to hold the viewer rather than develop a complicated story.Maybe it was a fluke how such a great film was made, and maybe i am on my own or am a bit of a nerd, but I don't care.",TRON
233,david-3475,ahead of its time . . .,10,3 September 2006,"Tron rocks in a unique way. It shines without seeming dated. Sound design and special effects excel all expectations whether it's a first view of a film from 1982 or a 15 year reunion with the film you saw as a kid. The analog sound effects will please fan of the Moog and early sci-fi films while bringing something fresh to the table- as eerily soothing as 2001: A Space Oddysey. The result of such skill in audio mechanics brings you deep inside the world of the master control program and the alternate world of the computer. Kudos to the sound engineers.And with visual effects to match, Tron is highly recommended and enjoyable- especially but not solely for tech geeks. This film proves that an ounce of creativity can outshine a ton of state-of-the-art technology. If you see it, be prepared to ""flip into the game!""

234,chainsawposse3,A Movie Beyond Its Time,9,21 February 2008,"A computer animated classic that was ahead of its time in 1982, Tron mixes technology, action, love, the classic battle of good vs. evil, and the belief in the super natural together for a very entertaining movie. It is the story of a real world programmer, Flynn, who lost out on fame and fortune due to the deceptive actions of a co-worker named Dillinger. Flynn losses his job and opens an arcade, spending most of his time trying to hack into the mainframe at his former work looking for evidence to prove Dillinger stole his work. Dillinger, now a senior executive has allowed an aggressive artificial intelligence computer called the MCP to take over most of the control of the company and it has even begun invading other systems. When Flynn gets an opportunity to look around the MCP from a computer terminal inside the company, the MCP digitizes the real-life Flynn and sends him to the game grid to compete in Romanesque gladiator competitions against programs that have lost all usefulness to the MCP. It is here that Flynn meets Tron, a program created by an acquaintance of Flynn in the human world. Tron's purpose is to monitor the MCP and shut it down if it violates its original design. Because the danger Tron poses, the MCP has imprisoned Tron in the game grid. Flynn and Tron end up fighting together on light bikes - vehicles resembling enclosed motorcycles - and make a daring escape from the game grid. Their goal is to make contact with Tron's user, get the information needed to shut down the MCP and accomplish that task. Working together and separately Tron and Flynn make their way towards a final showdown with the MCP and its henchman program, Sark. Tron and Flynn are able to defeat Sark and destroy the MCP using the data given by Tron's user. The computer world is freed from the stark dictatorial rule of the MCP, Flynn is transported out and re-digitized to the human world and given a copy of the file containing the evidence he needs to bring down Dillinger. The movie ends with Flynn back at the company in a senior executive position, vindicated and happy. One of my favorite elements of Tron are the spiritual overtones that exist in the computer world. Instead of humans pondering the existence of God, it is programs pondering the existence of their real world ""users"". Belief in the users is denied by the MCP and those who profess belief are persecuted. Enter Flynn, a true user who is transported to the computer world and has special powers, including the ability to heal and repair. I do not believe it is too far-fetched to compare the Flynn character to the biblical Jesus. I say this especially considering the sacrificial act by Flynn of jumping into the MCP so that Tron could have the opportunity to destroy it with his data disc. Without Flynn jumping into the heart of evil, there could have been no victory. Makes one wonder if the writers had taken a stroll through the bible's gospel stories during the creation of the screenplay. If you have not seen Tron, then you should rent or buy it soon, just don't get too hung up on the ""advanced"" graphics of 1982. Greetings, programs!",TRON
235,postroom,Still great after 20 years,10,7 March 2003,"For me TRON still looks as good as it did when it was released 20 years ago. The CGI looks superb, and the world is visually stunning and the story manages to hold its own. TRON came out way before it's time and took us to a place no-one had ever been before. Looking back its amazing to see where computer technology was in 1982 and where it stands in the present. David Warner is the usual english villian, which he plays perfectly, Jeff Bridges is a confident but likeable Kevin Flynn and Bruce Boxleitner brings out the warrior in the title role as TRON. I couldn't recommend TRON enough to anyone who hasn't seen it. Long may it stand the test of time and continue to endure for another 20 years and beyond.",TRON
236,bbockatmacdotcom,Tron is a missed opportunity,4,17 December 2010,"Tron has an extremely weak plot and poor character motivations. But with a little more work by the story editor and with the inclusion of a few short scenes, it could have been a lot better. Hearing the film makers talk about the making of Tron, it sounds like they spent all of their time worrying about back lighting Kodaliths and animating and not much time writing the script.SPOILERS AHEAD:In its villain's monologue with Dillinger, the MCP tells how it is taking over the world by stealing and integrating the programs from all the banks and governmental offices, the Pentagon and the Kremlin. So the stakes to stop it should have been really high. But as the movie actually plays, this information is pointless. It is never paid off by any other character acknowledging it. Flynn's sole motivation is to find prove that Dillinger stole his games. So he commits felonies to prove it? And Alan's and the Lora's motivations are what, friendship? Flynn and Alan never know that the MCP is sentient or that it has a plan. And while Flynn's life is apparently at stake in the electronic world, there's no peril for Alan or Lora. Alan is worried about his program and being locked out of the computer system that his employer pays him to program. It makes no sense. The film makers were trying to riff on the centralization of computer resources that was happening at that time in the corporate world, which was limiting and annoying for programmers and stifled innovation, but makes for a really boring movie plot point.To fix it, the writers could have had Flynn discovered what the MCP was doing. Maybe discover it had nuclear launch codes, or some other thing that would pay off the MCP's monologue with Dillinger. They could have made the stakes relevant to all of us in the real world. In Tron, nobody finds out what the MCP was doing.In the real world Alan and Lora could have discovered evidence of what the MCP was doing. Lora could have witnessed Flynn being digitized. They could have discovered that Flynn wasn't just stored in the grid, he was actually alive and aware inside of it. They could have added peril for them that they had to help Flynn from the real world to get him out of the grid before taking down the MCP. There could have been a lot more suspense. In the electronic world, in addition to running into accounting programs and actuarial programs, Flynn could have met CIA programs, Pentagon programs, Kremlin programs. He could have pieced together the MCP's intention.Tron could have been a good movie instead of just innovative in movie making techniques that is in people's hearts and minds because it was unusual.",TRON
237,Kingholland,The Gospels!?!?!,9,10 January 2002,"Let me tell you... If you haven't seen this movie go away, there are a few spoilers in my review.I just wanted to know if anyone has seen the common story of Flynn and Jesus. Now I know I'm going to be wrapped in the mouth for this but bare with me...We have an Inventor that creates a world(video game world). The world is stolen from him(from a man dressed in red). So he must go down to the world that he created and save the programs that he created. On this world all the weak and downtrodden programs believe in ""The USER"". Well all of a sudden there is this new program on the scene that can do things that they've never seen before. Like fix vehicles with his bare hands and heal weak programs(people). He starts to develop followers. And at the end what does he do but sacrifice his own life to gain his world back. He also ascends back up to the world he came from. Sound similar to me. But you can also find a common source of material in E.T. and Gladiator. So I guess the Story of Jesus is a good one to go by.I'd really like to know what people thing of this.",TRON
238,manronkerwin,The greatest leap for computer graphics since Star Wars.,10,31 January 2002,"Although many people may now write it off as cheesy or dated, or even as a quaint example of 'how things used to be', Tron was a huge step forward. The red and blue flourescent lighting lend it an atmosphere like no other film ever created, of a completely artificial world. The immense contrast between the real world and the computer world is shown perfectly by this, as things which were once perceived as small and insignificant are now highly dangerous. Yes, this was also done with ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"", but this was also a breakthrough film for other reasons.For, as video games became an increasingly more important part of everyday life in the US and worldwide, Tron was the first film to have a video game tie-in. For a modern film to have a video game released concurrently is nothing special, and often they're not spectacularly good. But Tron was the perfect way to start this phenomenom. And, as an example of how computer games of films should be done, this is upstaged only by GoldenEye007. The range of game types, from the car racing to the shoot-em-up sections, taken from the film, could be perfectly represented on the 4-bit Spectrums, Amigas and BBCs of the 1980s.As Disney movies go, it's far from the most famous and far from the best loved. However, as a huge sci-fi fan, this is almost up there with Toy Story as perhaps the greatest Disney film ever made, simply because it makes a significant effort not to fit with the formula of their cartoon films, and that is why it is probably the best film of the 80s.",TRON

243,driveindungeon,The Original Avatar?,7,6 December 2010,"Way ahead of its time when it was released in 1982, it could be argued that Tron would go on to influence James Cameron's Avatar. Much like the latter, Tron was a groundbreaking achievement in cinema at the time and like Avatar, it portrayed its characters as having extensions of themselves in another form. In this case, those extensions of the characters are in the form of computer programs that resemble their human counterparts but instead of sharing the host human's personalities, the programmed characters behave similar to what task they were programmed to do. In other words, the computer characters lack human emotions and their actions are based on logic.Jeff Bridges is great as Kevin Flynn/Clu, a video game programmer who gets wronged by his boss when his ideas get stolen. Seeking justice, Flynn creates a computer program called Clu that will be able to hack into his bosses mainframe computer undetected to find the proof he needs to convict him. Things go awry when the mainframe catches on to Flynn's activities and ""scans"" him into the cyber world where all the programs battle in gladiator type games.Helping Flynn in the virtual reality world are Tron (Bruce Boxleitner) and Yori who is portrayed by the sexy Cindy Morgan, who was Lacey Underall in Caddyshack.

But this film, unlike the other two, has not held up with the passage of time and fails to provide a gripping narrative. The special effects and the black light suits can be hard on the eyes, and the acting is serviceable at best (even the Dude himself, Jeff Bridges, is flat here). The plot itself is mildly interesting (hacker gets beamed into a computer) but the storytelling bulldozes along without any explanation of what's going on. And one can't help but think ""that's just like that scene in ""Star Wars"" every ten minutes. A few highlights do present themselves, though. The famous lightcycle scene is still vastly fun to watch, and Bridges' hammy acting is laughably bad at times (but in a good way, mind you).

It's honestly quite difficult to take your eyes off him. The Grid (The world of Tron) is beautifully animated for it's time, and still quite a thing to see in today's modern age.

The world pulses with a unique electronic light, sound and energy. You will be swept away into a fantastic other world.This film stars one of my favorite villains, David Warner. However he is not pure evil in this which I like. The 2 heroes are the ""good guys"" and their acting can be a tiny bit cheesy but they fulfill the good guy role perfectly. The woman whom they both love, is beautiful. Unlike most modern movies none of the action feels forced or contrived in any way. It is entirely story driven. There's not a bunch of gratuitous explosions every 10 seconds. However there is plenty of action to be had. It is best watched on a large screen with an excellent sound system, turned up. The awesome sound effects and music never get harsh or annoying, and are perfect for this film.If you love sci-fi or fantasy artwork, if you like synthesizers or 80's music or electronic music and sound effects, if you like 80s computers or video games, or arcades or arcade games, you will love this film. This is a world, created from concepts of incredibly talented sci-fi artists. The only ""real"" part of the computer world, is the actors on a blue screen, the entire background and everything else is drawn in by artists or computer modelers following the designs of the artists. Its unique light fx, coloring and style gives it an otherworldly and surreal feel. The movie has a hallucinogenic feel to it making it a popular cult film.Due to the vector graphics and computer animation scenes, the whole movie has a 3d effect, although it is not shot in 3d. Some of the most impressive scenes are way ahead of their time and rendered in 3d with the camera programmed to follow the movement of the moving machines/vehicles in all types of awesome angles/speeds and ways, never before seen in a movie. These same type of computer controlled moving camera effects did not show up in other movies until nearly 20 years later. The computer world is shot in a bizarre greyscale, even the characters skin is grey, and the world contains a black sky. The black grid and circuit inspired artwork-laden background is drenched in a blue light. But the characters and world glow and pulse with a colorful neon light energy effect. Blue neon signifies good and red, evil. Thankfully however many colors are used at times, and against a black or dark blue or grey background create awesome contrast, similar to neon lights at night.I really liked the artwork included on the bonus disc. And, most of it was used in the film. I'm still not sure how that was done in many scenes. This movie is an amazing artistic and technological achievement. Just remember this film was made in 1981 and most of these visual/audio fx had never been done before in movies. The music is fantastic and creates a awesome feel to the movie. The sound fx of the machines and vehicles is super cool. The sounds create a very real feel that you are a digital being trapped inside a computer or computer game.As soon as the music came on at the title, I immediately remembered this movie. That is the sign of a good movie. I saw Tron Legacy in 3d when it came out not all that long ago and I can't remember it.I can remember as a 5 year old hearing the ominous voice of the MCP and when tron finally sees it, feeling fear. I still feel this fear deep in my brain and when I experienced it today it was incredibly thrilling. I also remember being afraid when Flynn is being targeted by the laser and due to awesome special fx and sound fx, when he gets sucked in it seems so real.I watched the collectors edition DVD today. The picture was a bit shaky and I did see a slight outline around characters in a few scenes, since the bluescreen is used extensively in this movie. However I'm sure its a lot better quality than the original VHS. Im interested to watch the blu-ray version, as I heard it was re-remastered.I recommend this movie highly. If you were not alive in the 80s you may not understand the concept and it may seem low-tech by your standards. But anyone with half a brain can appreciate the artistry and originality of this movie.",TRON

250,eltanan,The Stuff Dreams are Made Of...,10,23 February 2005,"This movie shaped my childhood. Everything in my mind that is 'cool', 'awesome', awe-inspiring or deeply emotional, is visualized in terms of the visuals of this movie. I still have dreams about Tron to this very day. Every time I hear the ending credits music (not the Journey song, the Wendy Carlos stuff) I still get all misty-eyed. Above all other television, movies, books, or any media, THIS is the story that exists eternally at the center of my consciousness. Thank you, Tron.As an after-effect, I seem to be unable to dislike anything I see Jeff Bridges or Bruce Boxlitener in. As long as they're on screen, I'm happy. Funny how that stuff works. OF course, Babylon 5 is excellent anyway, but the fact that Boxlitener is a main character is definitely a bonus. I wonder what would have happened if JMS had written Tron? As another added note, the recent 'Tron 2.0' first-person shooter game is one of the best PC games I've ever played. I highly recommend it.",TRON
251,seanatanubis-1,"Do you believe in the ""Users""?",9,2 June 2005,"After watching this film again after a few years absence, a few motifs became clearly apparent. The most obvious of which is the constant reference to an ancient Greek style belief system. I found this to be very interesting, and keeping an eye out for references throughout the film made me enjoy it even more than I ever had before. Besides the fact that they wear pseudo-togas in the computer there is also the belief in the Parthenon like ""User's"" - the human programmer's who created them. Add to this the I/O towers, temples if you like, to communicate to the Users. Sark becomes a Gorgan and Tron is a great Greek hero; competing in gladiator games defending his beliefs and, because of fighting against the oppression of the MCP, fighting for good old fashioned Greek democracy. This film has just as much, if not more, reference to Myth than Star Wars in my opinion, and yet it is never discussed. Its a forgotten mythology.",TRON

253,pjunkie,"Profound themes and allegories, as well as being a great action movie!",8,30 October 2005,"Truly a movie ahead of it time in many ways and yet the conflict between good versus evil in this movie could easily represent the Cold War that our nation was dealing with at the this movie was released(1982). The MCP represents the evil, atheistic, and dictatorial communist threat. The the programs looking to bring down the MCP represent the god-fearing American ideals of freedom, innovation, and well-rewarded hard work. What makes the film ahead of its time is the use of a setting that was still very foreign to many people at the time: the inside of a computer. The ""computer in every house"" boom had yet to take off, and many people still didn't even have them at work. But yet it worked because the creators avoided making the parameters of that world overly technical, and instead, made it seem almost fantastical. The filmmakers employed everything that their cutting-edge animation style was providing. The digital landscape had varied terrains, perilous cliffs, and natural elements, but you never lose the thought that the action is taking place inside a computer.The continuous power-seeking, and fear instilling motives of the MCP parallels the worst characteristic that we were taught about communist regimes at the time. The MCP denies the existence of Users (God), and eliminates any program who believes otherwise. Furthermore, it has turned its own user into a servant, much like the core ideals of communism demand that ""the party"" be served at any cost, especially over a single humans desire to rise above.More interestingly though is how the ""American"" ideals represented by the protagonist actually divert from the aggressive capitalist and conservative ideals that prevailed at the time with Reagan in office and his efforts to deregulate and restrict the governments role in general. For Tron, the lead program out to destroy the MCP, is ultimately an oversight program, powerful in its own right. Even more than his user, a rigid programmer who needs the assistance of his more daring friend to bring help bring down MCP. More to the point Tron ultimately wishes to organize a more benevolent order to the digital world where programs live ""free,"" but ultimately have their fated-function. To me this represents a more socialistic view point, where class exists free of persecution under the guidance of a strong governmental infrastructure.Aside from all that above-theoretical mumbo-jumbo, it is all just a great little action movie, with great performances by David Warner, and Jeff Bridges, who plays the daring Flynn who Serendipitously gets shrunk down and injected into the computer to help Tron.",TRON
254,moviequestblog,Visions of Tron,10,26 November 2017,"August 6, 2017 Tron provides simple, beautiful electronic landscapesSome films go beyond its audience. Their clear visions come at a price. Steven Lisberger's Tron is one such film, it premiered in 1982 and grew no audience. ""It's too confusing"", that was the comment i kept hearing from friends who saw it with me many years ago. The rest of the world seemed to agree. But that consensus has changed. Two decades later it's considered a classic. What happened? Is it a severe case of audience jet lag ?. Maybe yes; we had to catch up on computer technology. I enjoyed the film, now and then. From costume design to screenplay Tron stands tall.Dressed for successTron's costumes are a landmark in design. Observe them carefully, they have complex, colorful, intense circuitry. Although they are one of the iconic images of the film, these costumes were not drawn by a computer, real artists painted them. Their names are listed in the end credits in Taiwanese. The filmmakers used traditional 'photographic animation'. The director filmed the actors wearing spandex costumes against a black background, then each frame was retouched in multiple layers. Instead of animating a 'drawing', the filmmakers animated a photograph. All frames were painted in Taiwan and sent back to America. This is a computer movie built, in part, without the help of computers. The result is a unique, retro-futuristic look. But if a filmmaker wanted to reprise the look of Tron today, he would need to replicate this painful, expensive technique used more than 20 years ago. Such attempt is not an appetizer to any movie studio nor investor, it just does not happen anymore. Tron is electronic art.continue review here:http://fun.sytes.net/movie-quest/tron-movie-review-1982/http://fun.sytes.net/movie-quest/tron-movie-insight-1982/",TRON
255,jay-maynard-tronguy,I love Tron! I made a lot of money from it!,10,17 December 2005,"Tron is just great! I made my own Tron costume and even was a regular guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live, all because of Tron.See my website at HTTP://www.tronguy.net/ The people at Disney are so stupid, I ripped off their images and trademarks and they haven't done a damn thing! I hope they do make a remake of Tron, or at least a re-release, it will be the greatest thing for my ""career""! If anyone is interested in booking me for parties or other events, my contact information is on my web page. Also, I am a Registered Certified Parliamentarian, and I will come to your meeting and preside as the Parliamentarin while dressed in my Tron costume. I can control the lighting on my costume so any time I determine someone is out of order in the meeting, my costume lights up! It's fantastic!All the best, Jay Maynard ""Tron Guy""",TRON
