0,bkoganbing,Cross Country drag race,6,23 January 2013,"Before there were Police Academy movies there were these two Cannonball Run films where a whole lot of people did a movie with absolutely no story to it, but looked like they were having a lot of fun. If you could call it starring Burt Reynolds and long time pal Dom DeLuise because they have the most screen time.It's clear that this cast was enjoying all the overacting they were allowed to indulge in. Except possibly for Roger Moore who rather drolly underplayed his own image as an action hero, James Bond, the Saint, etc. Reynolds did too, to a lesser extent.You've got to love Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. as a pair of fake priests who copied Richard Nixon's dirty play book in their effort to win The Cannonball Run which when you come right down to it is just a cross country drag race. Reynolds and DeLuise are using an ambulance, the better to fool the Smokeys that they meet traveling west. And for insurance they have a kidnapped patient in Farrah Fawcett and one bat crazy doctor in Jack Elam. Between Elam and DeLuise I have to say it's a tossup as to who overacts the most.Like The Police Academy movies, the Cannonball Run films are dumb, witless, stupid, puerile, and you will laugh your derrière off.",The Cannonball Run
1,SnoopyStyle,Simply fun fun fun,8,22 July 2015,"The Cannonball Run is a highly illegal, no holds barred car race from Connecticut to California. JJ McClure (Burt Reynolds) and his sidekick Victor Prinzim (Dom DeLuise) with his alter ego Captain Chaos chose to drive an ambulance. They use wacky Dr Van Helsing (Jack Elam) and kidnap tree-lover Pamela (Farrah Fawcett) as their patient. Environmentalist Arthur J. Foyt has the hots for Pamela and intends to stop the race. Race car driver Jamie Blake (Dean Martin) and Fenderbaum (Sammy Davis Jr.) dress as priests in their red Ferrari. Seymour Goldfarb, Jr. (Roger Moore) imagines himself to be the Bond actor Roger Moore. Jill Rivers (Tara Buckman) and Marcie Thatcher (Adrienne Barbeau) use both their looks and their black Lamborghini Countach to full advantage. Jackie Chan and his computer sidekick Michael Hui drive their hi-tech Japanese car. Oil rich sheik (Jamie Farr) drives his white Rolls-Royce. Wealthy risk taker Compton and Shaky Finch ride a motorcycle doing a wheelie. Terry (Terry Bradshaw) and stuttering Mel are two good old boys. Mad Dog and Batman drive the truck through everything.It's irreverent. It's sexist. It's silly. It's got car chases. It's ridiculous. It is entertainment of the lowest common denominator. It is simply fun, fun, fun. Everybody is having fun. It introduces Jack Chan to America. Dom DeLuise is a great sidekick to Burt Reynolds and Jack Elam is terrific. It may actually be better if Farrah Fawcett plays dumber. Its unabashed ridiculing of leftist environmental movement probably left the critics cold. Its low brow humor also doesn't help. But everybody has to love the hilarious outtakes.",The Cannonball Run
2,jboothmillard,The Cannonball Run,3,30 October 2011,"I knew two of the stars of this road based movie, but I was surprised it was quite an all star cast, I knew it wasn't rated very well, but I was looking forward to at least trying it, from director Hal Needham (Smokey and the Bandit). Basically this sees various contenders as they take part in the big illegal Connecticut cross-country road race, and they are all keen to make it to the finish line first and scoop the prize. The teams are: J.J. McClure (Burt Reynolds) and Victor Prinzim (Dom DeLuise) with his alter ego Captain Chaos in an ambulance, Englishman actor or spy Seymour Goldfarb, Jr. (Sir Roger Moore) who poses as movie star Roger Moore (so he is essentially playing a James Bond mock version of himself) in an Aston Martin DB5, Jamie Blake (Dean Martin) and Morris Fenderbaum (Sammy Davis Jr.) in a Mercedes 280 SEL sedan, Jill Rivers (Tara Buckman) and Marcie Thatcher (Adrienne Barbeau) in black Lamborghini Countach, Jackie Chan and Michael Hui in a Subaru GL hatchback, Terry (Terry Bradshaw) and Mil (Mel Tillis) in a Chevrolet stock car, and The Sheik (Jamie Farr) in a white Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow. Obviously as it is an illegal race the police are chasing after the teams they can, but also new participants join some of the racers, such as the oddball Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing (Jack Elam), photographer Pamela Glover (Razzie nominated Farrah Fawcett), and a Chief biker gang leader (Peter Fonda). After so many attempts to speed things up on their cars, near misses with the police and trying to find ways to stop the other racers, in the end there ins't really a clear winner. Also starring Bert Convy as Bradford Compton and Bianca Jagger (Mick's daughter) as Sheik's Sister. I may have giggled at the antics of Moore, when he was at the height of his Bond status, and it was nice to see stars like him, Reynolds, DeLuise, Martin, Davis Jr. and Chan trying to be funny and create some kind of new live action Wacky Races laughs, but I can completely see why it is two stars out of five, it is not funny or original, and you are not even bothered about the winner of the race, a silly action comedy. Adequate!",The Cannonball Run
3,Woodyanders,Pure fun,8,7 June 2013,"A diverse array of colorful eccentric folks participate in a wild and illegal cross country road race. Director Hal Needham, working from a brash script by Brock Yates, relates the simple and hugely enjoyable story at a constant zippy pace, maintains an utterly engaging breezy'n'easy loopy tone throughout, and stages the thrilling vehicular carnage with his trademark rip-roaring brio. Moreover, the all-star cast have a ball with the wacky material: Burt Reynolds effortlessly projects his customary amiable charm and plays beautifully well with Dom DeLuise, Farrah Fawcett looks positively radiant and brings a sweetly daffy appeal to her character, Roger Moore gleefully sends up his own slick'n'suave James Bond persona, legendary Rat Pack members Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. display a marvelously loose and natural chemistry as a pair of bogus priests, Jackie Chan provides American audiences with an early demonstration of his considerable martial arts prowess, Jamie Farr joyfully devours the scenery as a madcap sheik, Mel Tillis works uproarious wonders with his stutter, and Jack Elam almost steals the entire goofy show with his inspired off-the-wall portrayal of a creepy'n'kooky doctor of dubious pedigree. George Furth also hits the prissy bull's eye as the uptight killjoy nerd determined to stop the big race. Better still, luscious babes Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman show off loads of tasty cleavage while Valerie Perrine has a witty uncredited cameo as a sexy state trooper. Why, we even have neat bits by such familiar individuals as Bianca Jagger, John Fiedler, and Peter Fonda and Robert Tessier as a couple of belligerent rough'n'rowdy bikers. Cool rocking theme song by Ray Stevens, too. The good-natured sensibility ensures that this picture never becomes too crude or offensive. A total blast.",The Cannonball Run
4,ccthemovieman-1,Burt & Company In Their Element,6,25 April 2006,"Burt Reynolds made a fortune in this area with these goofy ""chase"" movies (this and Smoky and The Bandit plus all the sequels). They featured a an irreverent '70s attitude toward about anything decent with an emphasis on a sleazy atmosphere, all covered up with a lot of humor, and they worked. They worked because they were fast-moving generally fun movies to watch.....certainly not any great works of art. Cannonball Run had an all-star cast of Reynolds, his good buddy Dom DeLuise, Farah Fawcettt, Jack Elan, Roger Moore, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Farr, Jackie Chan, on and on....pretty amazing. Reynolds, of course, was Mr. Cool/Mr. Macho.....at least in his eyes. Fawcett and Barbeau meant beauty and boobs whom all men - especially dimwitted cops which Hollywood loved to feature - drooled over. The Japanese were made to look stupid (this was pre-PC days) as were priests (nothing's changed there with filmmakers). The movie is filled with really profound statements such as, ""Why do we take all these risks? Oh, just for the hell of it."" Yes, words to live by.Yet, as dumb as this movie can be at times, is does provide a lot of laughs and speaking of that, DeLuise's laugh always made everyone do the same. Sometimes the best part of these films were the outtakes at the end with DeLuise cracking up and Reynolds slapping him!",The Cannonball Run
5,Tweekums,An hilarious all-star race across America,8,5 November 2015,"The plot to this film is as simple as it gets; a group of people are planning to race across the United States paying no respect to the 55MPH speed limit enforced at the time. The first half of the film introduces us to the various racers. The protagonists are J. J. McClure and Victor Prinzim who are having a little trouble deciding what sort of vehicle is best for such a race; they eventually reason that an Ambulance will be best as it is less likely to be stopped for speeding of course they will also need a doctor and a patient to be convincing. There are also a couple of Chinese drivers in a high-tech Subaru; two men in a Ferrari, who are disguised as priests; two beautiful women in a Lamborghini and a Englishman who claims to be a spy and calls himself Roger Moore and played by Roger Moore. There are quite a few other secondary racers too; each fairly distinctive. Once the race is underway they must deal with zealous cops, fellow racers, a motorcycle gang and an environmental campaigner who objects to the motorcar in general and to the speed merchants taking part in the race in particular.There have been plenty of films about groups of people racing across America but this is probably the best known thanks to its all-star cast. There are lots of laughs to be had throughout the film; provided by a cast that is clearly having a blast. The cast, which does a solid job, includes such well known people as Burt Reynolds, Roger Moore, Farrah Fawcett, Jackie Chan, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. amongst others. The humour is, for the most part, suitable for viewers of all ages although some elements of the film are definitely not politically correct; most notably the Lamborghini Girls who show an impressive amount of cleavage to persuade male policemen to let them off! For me the highlight was Jack Elam's strange doctor; just looking at him was enough to make me laugh! There are a few plot holes but that doesn't matter as this is all about delivering laughs ultimately we don't even care who wins the race even. Not all of the gags work but enough do to make this comedy worth watching.",The Cannonball Run
6,ma-cortes,First rate stars at a car chase caper in which all-assorted drivers dash at highly illegal race,3,29 March 2010,"An unusual assortment of pilots converge for a cross country automobile race where breaking the rules and chaotic car chases are part of the game , and everybody competing for a grand prize in less than legal rally. In the car race participates the protagonists, McClure( amiable Burt Reynolds in similar role to 'Smokey and the Bandit' films) and his sidekick schizophrenic Victor (Dom Deluise who turn in moments into Captain Chaos) disguising themselves as paramedics, a duo posing as priests(the Rat-Pack ,Sammy Davis, Dean Martin) , two Chinese (a racer Jackie Chan and engineer Michael Hui), two Lamborghini sexpot babes (Adrienne Barbeau, Tara) and of course Roger Moore in a James Bond character-alike and several others. Along the way they elude police , crash into road-blocks, and meet-up with a number of roles.This race chase caper is full of witless comedy with tongue in cheek, noisy action, Kung-Fu fighting, gratuitous star cameos and many other things. This nutty film with extraordinary star-studded cast achieved a huge Box-office hit, one of 1981's top grosser, in spite of its brief amusing moments and ridiculous, embarrassing situations. Most interesting for plethora of cameos as Peter Fonda, Valerie Perrine, Jamie Farr, Jack Elam and many others . At the end there are out-takes such popular and usual subsequently. It's followed by a languid sequel, less than illustrious its predecessor, with similar actors and artist equipment , adding more explosive girls as Marilu Henner, Catherine Bach and Susan Anton, furthermore more Rat Pack as Frank Sinatra and Shirley McLaine. Booth of them were badly directed by the ex-stunt Hal Needham. Other films dealing with mindless cross-country wheel spinning , are the following : ¨Cannoball(1976)¨ by Paul Bartel with Robert Carradine, Mary Wonorov , Joe Dante ,¨Death race 2000¨ again by Paul Bartel with David Carradine, Silvester Stallone, Simone Griffith ¨Gumball rally(1976) ¨by Chuck Bail with Michael Sarrazin Gary Busey and Raul Julia, among them.",The Cannonball Run
7,BA_Harrison,And I was SO sure that this was a good film.,4,28 November 2007,"The Cannonball Run, an all-star caper about a bunch of ne'er-do-wells competing in a trans-American road race, is one of those films that I have had fond memories of ever since seeing it on its original release. So re-watching this film after many years was going to be a real treat - or at least I thought so. Isn't it funny how time affects your memory?Instead of the laugh-a-minute, stunt-packed classic that I recall enjoying immensely as a kid, I was shocked to find that the film is in fact a rather tedious, poorly directed, mostly laugh-free effort saddled with mundane action. Apart from some stunning cars, and a few stunning women, The Cannonball Run actually has little to recommend it.Not nearly exciting enough (the car stunts are limited to a few unremarkable jumps, skids and crashes), nor funny enough (the desperate non-PC humour making light of schizophrenia, drink driving, stammering, abduction, racial differences, the law, and drug and alcohol abuse), director Hal Needham's chaotic comedy rarely gets into gear, and repeatedly stalls when it does.With an improvised feel to every facet of the film, The Cannonball Run gives the impression that much of it was made on the fly. In fact, I wouldn't be at all surprised to discover that Needham got his cast, crew and cars together first, and worried about the finer details (like a script) once the shoot had begun. The director and his Hollywood pals probably had a blast making the film, and I would like to say that the sense of fun is infectious. But it isn't.To be fair, a few moments did manage to make me smile - Jackie Chan kicking biker ass, Adrienne Barbeau's cleavage, Jack Elam as a drunken proctologist - but the majority of the film left me massively disappointed.The Cannonball Run gets a star for the kung fu, one for the babes, one more for the freaky doctor, plus a bonus star purely for nostalgia's sake. A not-so-grand total of 4 out of 10.",The Cannonball Run
8,moonspinner55,"""Are you one of those Volleyballers?""",2,13 March 2013,"Car race comedy written by Brock Yates, who may have been inspired by the television cartoon ""Wacky Races"", though his screenplay steals more liberally from ""Cannonball!"" and ""The Gumball Rally"", both from 1976. The whole thing looked like yesterday's news even in 1981, what with star Burt Reynolds on auto-pilot, surrounded by a slew of his off-camera friends on sycophant-duty. Hal Needham directs without inspiration, and even the photogenic pairing of Reynolds with Farrah Fawcett fails to come off. Slurpy-mouthed and manic-stupid, with a withering finale at the finish line. A big hit at the box-office, nevertheless, and followed by a sequel in 1984. * from ****",The Cannonball Run
9,BandSAboutMovies,Dumb. Loved.,6,11 April 2020,"Directed by Hal Needham (Megaforce, Smokey and the Bandit), this movie was based on the 1979 running of an actual cross-country outlaw road race - the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash - which began in Connecticut and ended in California. Or, you know, Cannonball, the 1976 Roger Corman produced film that tells the exact same story. Or The Gumball Rally.That said, screenwriter Brock Yates came up with the actual race while writing for Car and Driver. The race had only one rule: ""All competitors will drive any vehicle of their choosing, over any route, at any speed they judge practical, between the starting point and destination. The competitor finishing with the lowest elapsed time is the winner.""Yates' team was the only participant in the original 1971 running, which was named after Ernest ""Cannonball"" Baker, who in 1927 drove across the country in just 60 hours.This is pretty much my dream idea of what a movie should be.A very simple premise: a cross-country race for lots of money.Add in plenty of actors you love.Let hijinks ensue.The players:The ambulance: JJ McClure (Burt Reynolds) and Victor Prinzi (Dom DeLuise) are driving a souped-up Dodge Tradesman ambulance, the very same vehicle Needham and Yates used in the 1979 race.The Ferrari 308 GTS: Driven by drunken former race star Jamie Blake (Dean Martin) and his gambler Morris Fenderbaum (Sammy Davis Jr.), who are both dressed as Catholic priests.The Lamborghini Countach: Driven by Jill Rivers (Tara Buckman) and Marcie Thatcher (Adrienne Barbeau), who are using their looks to get ahead. This is pretty much the horror genre car, as Buckman would go on to appear in Silent Night, Deadly Night, Xtro II: The Second Encounter and, of course, Night Killer. Barbeau would live on in our hearts thanks to appearances in Creepshow, The Fog and Escape from New York.The Subaru GL 4WD: Producers Golden Harvest demanded some Asian stars in the film. They got Jackie Chan in his second American film - after The Big Brawl - and Michael Hui.The Laguna/Monte Carlo: This Hawaiian Tropic NASCAR car somehow switches makes throughout the film. It keeps the same drivers: Terry Bradshaw and Mel Tillis.The Aston Martin DB5: Driven by Roger Moore, who is really James Bond, who is really Seymour Goldfarb, Jr., the potentially crazy heir to the Goldfarb Girdles fortune.The Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow: Driven by rich old sheik Jamie Farr.There's so much more - DeLuise is also a superhero named Captain Chaos, Farrah Fawcett hooks up with Burt, Dr. Van Helsing (Jack Elam) wants to inject everyone with his medicine, Bert Convy gets into a fistfight with bikers led by Peter Fonda, Valerie Perrine shows up as a state trooper, stuntman Robert Tessler (Chief Thor from Starcrash, Verdugo from The Sword and the Sorcerer) fights Jackie Chan, all of the Bond girls are dubbed just like the real films and all manner of car stunts take up much of the running time.Burt Reynolds did this movie for $5 million, a percentage of the profits and a promise he'd only work 14 days. He later said, ""I did that film for all the wrong reasons. I never liked it. I did it to help out a friend of mine, Hal Needham. And I also felt it was immoral to turn down that kind of money. I suppose I sold out so I couldn't really object to what people wrote about me.""This movie is also the reason why seatbelts are required on all stunts now.24-year-old German American stuntwoman Heidi von Beltz, who was a former championship skier and aspiring actor, was critically injured driving the Aston Martin car during a stunt. She had no previous stunt driving experience and was behind the wheel of a car with defective steering, clutch, and speedometer. Even worse, it had bald tires.Her vehicle collided head-on with a van and made her a quadriplegic. Her personal injury lawsuit exceeded all available primary insurance coverage, so the production's excess insurer, Interstate Fire sued von Beltz and her employer, Stuntman Inc., claiming that the lawsuit was not covered under its policy.After years of court cases, she was eventually awarded $7 million although the judge later reduced that amount to $3.2 million or just enough to pay her medical and legal bills. She died in 2015.Here's something good out of this movie: It inspired Jackie Chan to always include bloopers at the end of his films. Hopefully that makes up for the fact that Needham didn't know the difference between Asian races and cast Chan as a Japanese racer.",The Cannonball Run
10,Coventry,Mediocre race movie,5,13 June 2010,"Silly, insignificant and most of all forgettable screwball action/comedy; principally made to further cash in on the success of the ""Smokey & the Bandit"" movies with largely the same cast and crew. The concept is actually a complete rip-off of the obscure but totally awesome so-called 70's carsploitation classic ""Cannonball"", directed by Paul Bartel and starring David Carradine. There's a bunch of eccentric people participating in an illegally organized cross-country race from to New York to California. That's pretty much everything. The rest of the film jumps back and forth between the large variety of characters and their crazy encounters along the way. The main polestars are macho man J.J. McClure (star Burt Reynolds) in his ambulance, his jolly chubby sidekick who transforms into superhero Captain Chaos, two heavy-drinking gamblers dressed up as priests in a Ferrari, a spoiled rich boy convinced he's Roger Moore and two voluptuous babes in a Lamborghini. ""Cannonball Run"" was probably the most fun to make and (re-)watch for all the major stars involved. They're clearly having a terrific time hanging out with each other, both in front and behind the camera. The list of famous names is impressive, with apart from Reynolds and Moore also Farrah Fawcett, Dom DeLuise, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Jackie Chan, Adrienne Barbeau and Peter Fonda. They're enjoying themselves, but it's not like they're giving away great performances. The only fantastic performance comes from Jack Elam as the totally deranged and crazy-eyed doctor Van Helsing. The film contains a disappointingly small amount of car stunts and/or action sequences. The aforementioned ""Cannonball"" is a lot better, also because it features more sarcasm and black humor whereas this film continuously remains politically correct.",The Cannonball Run

12,Theo Robertson,Very Daft But Not Unentertaining,6,12 October 2005,"Never mind about pens being sharpened I had the knives out for THE CANNONBALL RUN and when I read that it was directed by Hal Needham the same director of SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT the knives were getting extra sharp . I mean we've got a movie full of stars ( A film full of stars is usually the sign of a not very good film especially if one of them is Burt Reynolds ) set against a story of characters having a road race which sounds like an over produced version of THE GUMBALL RALLY and if truth be told that's exactly what we've got , but it's nowhere as bad as I feared Okay let me point out that THE GUMBALL RALLY is not a great film but by the same margin it's not an awful one either . It's very daft where Jackie Chan plays himself except he's Japanese ( ! ) as does Roger Moore who's actually Jewish ( !!! ) and this sums up the movie in that it's entirely mad but in an endearing way . It's very good natured and I can understand why many people describe it as "" fun "" . It's inoffensive without being politically correct , amusing without being laugh out loud and silly without being embarrassing . If it has a problem it's entirely forgettable but I do remember liking it after seeing it ten minutes ago , not immensely but I did like it",The Cannonball Run
13,Bunuel1976,"THE CANNONBALL RUN (Hal Needham, 1981) **",4,21 December 2008,"This is one of those films watched during my childhood days which, unfortunately, didn't now live up to my recollection of it; even if I knew it doesn't have a good reputation (despite the box-office success which spawned a sequel three years later), I still expected the film to be more entertaining than it proved to be! The film is said to rip-off THE GUMBALL RALLY (1976), which I haven't watched; ironically, I had intended to check it out for this Christmas season as well but its DVD is currently unavailable at my local rental outlet. Being only a little over one and a half hours in length, the narrative doesn't have enough time to adequately accommodate its roster of stars, all of whom seem to be there for the fun of it anyway: a pity, therefore, that this sentiment isn't always transmitted to the audience! The cast is led by Burt Reynolds (a regular in ex-stuntman/director Needham's films  having been also the star of the ""Smokey And The Bandit"" franchise), Dom De Luise (whose character has a superhero alter-ego named Captain Chaos  one of the film's few inspired touches), Roger Moore (playing a man posing as Roger Moore and with the expected rampant nods to his James Bond image!) and Rat Packers Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. (who spend most of the time disguised as priests)! Also on hand is Jack Elam (as an eccentric doctor who likes to inject himself with whatever he's administering to his patients!), Jackie Chan (who manages to demonstrate a bit of his martial arts prowess but his scenes are otherwise among the dullest in the film), Jamie Farr (as an Arab sheik, whose role will eventually be expanded in the sequel), Peter Fonda (as the leader of a biker gang, what else?) and, of course, a number of women including Farrah Fawcett (who naturally hitches up with Reynolds) and Adrienne Barbeau (as one of two female competitors who don't think twice about using their generous cleavage to get ahead in the race). To be honest, having been a few days since I watched both films anew, their proceedings (and jokes) now seem not only interchangeable but have begun to fade in the memory; I do recall, however, that the race is finally won by the two sexy girls (after Captain Chaos is called upon for help just as he's about to tread the finishing line)!",The Cannonball Run
14,utgard14,"""You know what I like best about trees?""",7,26 February 2014,"""All-star"" comedy about assorted characters competing in a cross-country race. The main stars are Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise. But the cast is full of Burt's friends, as well as the likes of Roger Moore, Jackie Chan, Peter Fonda, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr. Of those, Roger Moore is the most fun. The best part of the film for me is Adrienne ""Boom Boom"" Barbeau's cleavage. I also love the Valerie Perrine cameo. Farrah Fawcett is Burt's love interest and her nipples are erect throughout the whole movie. She wears no bra, of course, which she was known for back then. Every time they have a tender scene, Farrah's headlights are on bright and you can't help but giggle or drool or a combination of the two. Her tree fascination is pretty cute stuff, though.It can be unfunny at times, especially when DeLuise is doing his thing. He's an acquired taste. I know Burt thought he was hilarious. I also know Burt had a drug problem back then that no doubt colored his judgment. Also worth mentioning is that several of the participants in this race drink (a lot) and drive. Doubtful that would happen today in a frivolous movie like this. I guess this is one case of times changing for the better.",The Cannonball Run
15,view_and_review,Fools Gold,4,7 December 2019,The Cannonball Run is essentially the sequel to Cannonball. It's also the biggest waste of talent I've ever seen. With too many names to even mention here you're going to either be pleased as punch or bitterly disappointed. I think that after a certain number of stars you don't even have enough screen time for them all. It was a saturation of celebrities with a very weak script. Their only hope was that we'd be blinded by the glimmer of the stars so much that we couldn't see the skid mark of a movie it was.,The Cannonball Run
16,neil-476,Silly but OK,7,28 June 2011,"The Cannonball Run, for me, disappears into an pit of indistinguishability with the Smoke And The Bandit movies - Burt Reynolds, lots of driving stunts, some sort of pursuit, yadda yadda yadda (you should admire my being able to say ""yadda yadda yadda - I'm not even American).This one has an excellent cast, albeit many of the cast members are slightly past their sell-by date.But, for me, the two things which make this film really worthwhile are - no, not Adrienne Barbeau (well, yes, Adrienne Barbeau, obviously) - Jack Elam's boggle-eyed Dr Van Helsing, and Dom DeLuise's inspired and hysterical (dan dan daaah!)

You could take some admittedly nice stunts (but as I said, way too few for this kind of picture when they are the main reason for its existence), the jaw-dropping cleavage of Adrienne Barbeau & Tara Buckman (bonus: Vickie Reigle as a drive thru girl), a brief display of agile martial arts by Jackie Chan, and Roger Moore parodying his Bond persona, and make a decent 10-minute action reel out of this movie. *1/2 out of 4.",The Cannonball Run
18,Uriah43,Good Cast but Lukewarm Comedy,5,17 July 2019,"This film essentially begins with certain people from all over the world competing in an illegal car race starting in Connecticut and finishing in Los Angeles, California. Naturally, being quite competitive and having already raced against each other previously, all of the drivers seek to gain some kind of an edge over everybody else which will propel them to victory. In one particular case, ""J. J. McClure"" (Burt Reynolds) and his partner ""Victor Prinzim"" (Dom DeLuise) have decided to drive an ambulance which will allow them to bypass certain restrictions typically enforced on everyone else. Likewise, ""Jamie Blake"" (Dean Martin) and ""Fenderbaum"" (Sammy Davis Jr.) pose as priests in the belief that it will confer some kind of advantage along the way as well. Anything to win. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay comedy which was inspired by an actual series of illegal coast-to-coast races in the 70's known as the ""Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash"". Yet, despite the fact that it had an all-star cast, the overall comedy wasn't that impressive and for that reason I have rated this film accordingly. Average.",The Cannonball Run

Moore literally parodies himself and Bond, and all the better for it, proving he is a good sport, and even Davis Jr. Let's a little racism slide when Reynolds calls him a 'chocolate monk'.It's really pointless writing a review of this, because it's a compilation of mini movies, surrounding one race.A guilty pleasure for sure, but very forgettable.",The Cannonball Run
20,Aaron1375,A lot of stars race across country.,6,22 December 2009,"This movie was pretty good, not the best comedy of the 1980's its main attraction was less the plot or anything the movie had to offer, but rather its huge cast of characters. Burt Reynolds and Dom Delouise are the headliners, but aside from them there is Roger Moore of James Bond fame, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr., Adrien Barbeau and even Jackie Chan. The plot is fairly simple, the cannonball run is about to take place and a host of oddballs is entering to win the prize. Burt and Dom are on the same team and they figure out the perfect vehicle to race cross country to avoid the police if possible an ambulance. It is actually brilliant and quite frankly I do not see how they did not destroy everyone else who was racing, because most of the vehicles consisted of sporty cars, the types of which the cops are looking for. Granted Adrian's team had a nifty trick that worked a lot, but was not fool proof. The comedy also at times makes no sense, they establish that Burt and Dom know Sammy and Dean's team, early before the race yet for some reason Dom's character gets fooled by them later during the race. There is also a rather pointless fight scene near the end of this one too, where all the main stars duke it out with a biker gang or something. Also, Dom's character has a bit of a split personality which as a kid I liked, but now I have to say it was rather silly. Still, it was an okay movie and is better than the sequel. Part two is essentially the same movie and I thought even Speed Zone was better than that one.",The Cannonball Run
21,mm-39,WOW What a disappointment!,4,14 May 2003,"I was excited about seeing this movie.  When I was in grade 6 I wanted to see the king of burnt rubber Burt Reynolds.  This movie is based off the Cannonball, and the Gumball Rally.  A big budget, and big name actors alone can not make a movie.  Great idea but no script.  The first movie I saw on the VCR was this one, I waited 2 years to see it, and my sister's boyfriend Blake was right this film is flat. 4/10",The Cannonball Run
22,SimonJack,Racing fans may still enjoy this film in the 21st century,5,10 December 2020,"""The Cannonball Run"" had a fantastic cast of well-known actors of the time and was a box office hit and success for 20th Century Fox. Although not special for acting or any production, it was a somewhat fun movie to watch in theaters in 1981. But, watching it again years later, it struck me as being more fun for the people making the film than it was funny for the audiences.The comedy in this film is mostly antics from tricks played by the car racers on one another. There's very little funny dialog. Some of the funniest scenes involve the police chief and highway patrolmen, as one might expect in this type of comedy. Even with the antics, the comedy seems dated and not nearly as funny a few decades later.Those who enjoy car racing and fans of any of the particular actors may enjoy this movie in modern times. Others may find it tedious or uninteresting.",The Cannonball Run

The 'stache gets upstaged by two chicks in a Lamborghini (mmm Adrienne Barbeau), but who's going to complain about that? Jack Elam seemed to get all the laughs in this movie, at least from me.

They are all very funny in this film. If you like Smokey and the Bandit then you may enjoy The Cannonball Run as well - both are similar and quite fun to watch.This is a great afternoon ""popcorn"" film - this is not the kind of film that provokes any deep thought - it's just pure fun comedy.

26,KineticSeoul,Stupid absurd cross country race that is fun,6,18 March 2012,"Now this is far from being a great movie but I can sort of see how this movie would have been entertaining to watch in the early 80's. If you played the video game Need For Speed: The Run than the premise is sort of similar, basically it's a race to get from one area to another while others are chasing after them. It's basically a cross country race where they have to cover great distance while driving. Yeah nothing special in the story department but the way it mixes comedy with it, is what makes it stand out. Instead of going in a very serious direction like movies of this genre do today, while being absurd. This one doesn't take itself seriously. But if your looking for a movie with great or even good plot you won't find it here. But what it does offer is car chase/race entertainment. Jackie Chan also make a cameo appearance as Jackie Chan as number 1 car racer. The editing is all over the place though and although it's a very very simple story. Since it's all over the place, it gives off the illusion of being a complicated story. Even though it tries to introduce and give a little about each racer. So basically it's a bunch of degenerates gathered for a race, which is fine because if the characters were normal this movie would have been really dull. When the wackiness ensues during the race it gets fun but not too so fun to the point I can turn away from the fact that this is a poorly written, acted and edited movie, even for a comedy. The whole thing just seemed so sloppy, despite the over the top mayhem and how the teams try to screw over the other teams and out drive or stay away from cop radar during the race to win. Also the young Farrah Fawcett is prettier than ever in this and Roger Moore is funny as his self-parody of James Bond. You know those serious and yet funny characters? Well he is that in this.6/10",The Cannonball Run
27,OllieSuave-007,One of the funniest movies I have seen!,8,26 January 2015,"The Cannonball Run is a comedy where a group of adventurers, played by an all-star cast including Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, Farah Fawcett, Roger Moore, Dean Martin, Jackie Chan and Michael Hui, participate in a cross-country car race and will resort do nefarious tricks to win.A friend of mine told me that this is a plot-less nonsensical comedy, which isn't something I am a big fan of. However, this turned out to be one of the funniest movies I have seen. While there is really no basic plot to the movie except for the wild car race theme and while there is nonsensical stuff, Hal Needham's direction really made this movie an attention grabber from start to finish, from the car racing at light speed at the beginning to the all-star fight scene toward the end.Seeing each of the characters' physical comedy and quick humor as they compete in the race is what makes this movie entertaining. Burt Reynold's calm and collected demeanor as he cracks his jokes and his facial expressions toward the weirdness and oddball events that take place are humorous, and his frustrating partnership with the superhero-wannabe Dom DeLuise is fun to watch. Roger Moore did a great job in spoofing his James Bond character, bringing with him his suave charm, refined British accent and his acidic wit. Jackie Chan and Michael Hui brought with them their classic Hong Kong-style comedy humor, quick wit, fast-talking and martial arts action. Rounding up all the physical comedy are some evident but harmless political puns and ethnic stereotypes.It's just interesting seeing all these well-known legends in a wild comedy; it's screwball stuff, but they aren't done childishly or overboard. Filled with surprises, it is a really fun movie; I just wished that there was a little more action scenes and also comedic stuff from Roger Moore, Jackie Chan and Michael Hui. And, I would have liked to see the other Cannonballers emphasized more. But, I still highly recommend it! Grade B+",The Cannonball Run
28,gridoon,Thin at best.,4,17 August 2001,"This popular 1981 movie can best be described as a flimsy excuse to string together as many gratuitous car stunts as possible. Hal Needham, an ex-stuntman, made an insipid directorial debut with ""Smokey and the Bandit"" in 1977, but then also made one of Burt Reynolds' best movies, ""Hooper"", one year later. Here he's back in Square One, and Burt has rarely looked more tired. The film does have an amazing cast, but most of the actors don't have roles, they have cameos. I especially disliked Roger Moore's self-conscious spoofing of his James Bond persona, he's so much better when he plays Bond straight with a subtle sense of humor. The only performance that REALLY stands out is given by Jack Elam; he has a perfect deranged look! (*1/2)",The Cannonball Run
29,paulclaassen,(Mindless) Fun action comedy...,4,9 September 2018,"This felt like an extended 'Smokey and the Bandit' storyline, or a spinoff, especially with Burt Reynolds back in the saddle and a similar story with regards to the girl joining him. Indeed very similar. It was nevertheless a fun (if mindless) action comedy. I really enjoyed Roger Moore in the film as well as the James Bond reference.The film's ending give us the impression the winner is the first person to cross the finish line, but this is not the case. Before the race, each contestant punched their cards. The winner is determined by the time it took them to finish the race, so the first one to cross the finish line is not necessarily the winner. A significant amount of time passed from the time the first contestant left until JJ McClure's (Burt Reynolds) team left. The girls in the Lamborghini also left well before McClure's team, yet they end up together at the finish line and then race to cross it. If they ended up at the finish line together, then surely McClure wins, regardless of the girls crossing the line first, as they finished in less time. The race for the finish line at the end is therefore pointless.Although this was an enjoyable film I'd rather watch 'Smokey and the Bandit' ten times over than giving this a second viewing.",The Cannonball Run
30,johnnyboyz,Cynical and rather ordinary feature that has nothing going for it bar the novelty value of seeing all these names and faces on screen at once.,5,29 August 2009,"The Cannonball Run was worse than I thought it might have been; a wax-work museum of yester-decade stars of the previous generation, mugging their way through a plot-less, rather humourless, but pro-consumerist and recklessness road movie during which its characters start at point 'A'; physically travel through to point 'Z' but basically end up right where they began in terms of everything else. It must've been a sad moment, back in the day, when children, young adults and seasoned adults alike were watching their past/current heroes in the form of Dean Martin; Sammy Davis Jr; Burt Reynolds and Roger Moore engaging in nothing more than tired pastiches; slapstick comedy and acting as pawns for advertisements.The film doesn't even deliver on what it promises in the form of a race of some kind. The opening is overly long; too talky and takes too much time establishing what are essentially either clichés or archetypes, while for all the talk and build up of the race, it's essentially nothing more than a rare series of pratfalls and incidences in which in order to laugh, you have to find either speeding cars; women in revealing outfits or persons impersonating those of a medical profession, funny. In a bizarre change of tact towards the end, there is a mass-brawl between the racers and a load of bikers; the leader of which is Peter Fonda who I guess is sending up his Easy Rider role, which just sees the film throw its hands up and announce that: 'Yes, we've finally run out of ideas'.The Cannonball Run gets across its highly unmotivated and desperate sense of the sheer spectacle to act as a means of laughter, very early on, when two characters whom are the closest we have to anything at all resembling 'leads', land an aeroplane in the middle of a public street, run into a shop and buy beer before taking off again. The characters are J.J. McClure (Reynolds) and Victor Prinzim (DeLuise), two people that later acquire a van, disguise it as an ambulance, kidnap a woman, bung her in the back and pretend to be off somewhere where she can receive help – and they're the one's we're supposed to root for. Along for the ride is Jack Elam's doctor, named Nikolas Van Helsing; an incompetent and slurring individual who's the victim of one of the film's many re-occurring gags; that being that he has an odd looking face and that if we crash zoom in onto it to some mock-horror organ music now and again, everyone will laugh. Another rather sad, tragic even, ingredient to this quartet is DeLuise's character's habit of donning a cape and mask; from whence he brandishes them from, I'm not sure; and breaking off into bizarre, mock-super hero skits complete with his own fan-fare sound effects. While everyone else watches on and, I'm sure, laughs their heads off; I actually found it quite sad to watch.Partaking in the race, a journey from Connecticut to California, are a number of names and faces doing it purely for kicks. Jackie Chan and Michael Hui are the more technologically-advanced-than-anyone-else-Japanese, although they themselves are Chinese and according to what I read, they speak Cantonese on a Japanese TV show when selected for the race. They exist solely to provide advertising for Subaru. Then we have Roger Moore, a man playing a character named Seymour Goldfarb, Jr.; who's a send up of his James Bond character, a role he still occupied at the time of shooting. His inclusion reminds me of a recent time when the producers took years and years to make a sequel to 1998's The Mask of Zorro, while in the meantime Banderas, who played the role of Zorro, sent up the character in 2004's Shrek 2 by way of voicing Puss in Boots. A year after that film, a sequel was actually made, entitled The Legend of Zorro, with Banderas once again back in the role. No, hang on. A year ago you were creating a pastiche and sending up this character for the comic creation it was. Now you've gone back to it and you're making heaps of money in the process out of, what is essentially, something you've already discarded as a joke. Moore in The Cannonball Run fits exactly this situation. He sends the thing up in a tired spoof, then goes back to it for consequent Bond films Octopussy and A View to a Kill. Suddenly we're supposed to forgive and forget? I don't think so. Was it not the case that after The Cannonball Run, everyone got on Moore's back over his Bond role? Then you've got the slack-jawed Southerners; the typically rich, eccentric Arabs in the form of Jamie Farr's Sheik plus the jewellery-clad African-Americans, all of whom are partaking. Where does it all lead? Well, it leads to a glut of Goodyear tyres and Camel cigarettes product placement, while at one point, DeLuise is relegated to that of a performance chimp as he dances in front of the camera and sings a Dr Pepper jingle; seconds after it ends, the film restarts again with Reynolds walking back into shot ready to spout the next line of dialogue that'll move everyone on to the next pratfall. It's a shame that so many people have taken to this; like with most films of this ilk, I'm tempted to say that when people come to re-view The Cannonball Run, they're reviewing their childhoods and how happy they were when they first saw the film as opposed to how good it is as a stand alone piece. But with a distinctly leery sensibility at times; a running theme of total disregard to superiors and authoritarian figures, such as the law enforcement, plus every highway code rule broken under the pretence of ""We're having fun"", The Cannonball Run burns out pretty quickly after the starter's gun goes off.",The Cannonball Run

32,leonblackwood,Silly in parts but Reynolds is on top form. 5/10,5,21 April 2016,"Review: I know that this movie is really old and that everyone has seen it before, so I won't type a long review about the film. This has to have the best, genuine, outtakes that I have seen, and every time that I watch them, they crack me up. The movie itself looks really dated and some of the jokes are pretty awful but the chemistry between Reynolds and DeLuise is brilliant and you can see that J.J. McClure (Burt Reynolds) wants to burst out laughing most of the time. Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin, also were funny throughout the film but the race itself was completely over the top and unrealistic. Personally, I still enjoyed the movie, and it was good to see Burt Reynolds when he was on top form and I really can't see anyone topping Reynolds and DeLuise, if they remake this all time classic. Enjoyable!Round-Up: The opening credits of this film, reminded me of the old Kung Fu movies, with the big Golden Harvest and Fortune Star logos, and judging by the big scale and the huge cast in the film, they really done a good job. It seemed like the director just let the actors ad-lib through most of the film, which is what made it original and really funny in parts. Anyway, the movie was directed by Hal Needham, whose first project was Smokey and the Bandit in 1977, so it's not surprising that he teamed up with Burt Reynolds again. He also directed Hooper, which also starred Burt Reynolds, Cactus Jack with a young Arnold Schwarzenegger, another Smokey and the Bandit, Stroker Ace, Cannonball Run II, Rad and Bodyslam. He's obviously a master at the old comedy movies especially when working with Reynolds but he decided to turn to TV in the latter part of his career with the series Bandit. This is definitely one of those films that you can watch time and time again, even though some of the jokes are more silly than funny but it's worth having in your collection.Budget: $17million Worldwide Gross: $72millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their sport/action/comedies starring Burt Reynolds, Roger Moore, Farrah Fawcett, Dom DeLuise, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Jackie Chan, Peter Fonda and Adrienne Barbeau. 5/10",The Cannonball Run

I would rank this movie among the better of his weaker efforts. There are quite a few laughs, a lot of beautiful women and great stunts. It has a great cast. All of whom seem to be having a great time. I'm surprised someone got screenwriting credit. The movie seems to be mostly improvised. At the end of the day, ""The Cannonball Run"" is lazy film making.

35,Captain_Couth,Golden Harvest bankrolled this picture? Part one.,5,20 June 2004,"Cannonball Run (1981) was one of those road race movie genres that was reborn during the mid 70's. The first of them was released by New World Pictures and it was the entertaining Cannonball, starring David Carradine and the Roger Corman players.  A few years later Hollywood and Golden Harvest teamed together to make a washed up Hollwood stars road film about the mythical cross country race called The Cannonball Run. Yes, this film has more wash-ups and has been than you can shake a stick at.  It looks like a who's who of former and future stars of Hollywood Squares. Golden Harvest produced half the film and they used their stroke to put in the company's two biggest stars Jackie Chan and Michael Hui.  The problem is they play Japanese race car drivers. Japanese race car drivers who speak cantonese?!
But the ring leader of this motley crew is old Burt Reynolds.  Yes, him and Hal Needham made this film to please his Smokey and the Bandit crowd.  Needham should stick with directing stunt scenes and leave film-making to the professionals.Not as bad as the later films in this series but not quite that entertaining.

Based on a real event, Cannonball Run is an illegal cross country race where the winner is the one who averages the highest speed while avoiding cops and other obstacles. Who will win, will sabotage come up or will the police be able to stop the race? There are assorted cars and characters who join in the fun. Burt Reynolds is the main character along with Farrah Fawcett and Roger Moore, who plays his real life self as the mega Hollywood James Bond star, is a close third and drives his classic Aston Martin DB5. The film quality is rather poor with clumsy editing, cuts that avoid having to stage expensive accidents and MANY scenes were guilty of speeding up the footage to give the false impression of actual speeds.

Greenie Farrah Fawcett and proctologist Jack Elam also add to the mayhem.Hal Needham doesn't have to do a lot of work with Brock Yates' script as it allows the players to go for broke and make the most of the comedy.

Which is fine, this was not made with them in mind. The Cannonball Run was based on a real illegal cross country race and made for a really wild and fun movie with a great ensemble all star cast with Dom DeLuise( who is hilarious as JJ(Burt's buddy) and steals the show as superhero alter ego Captain Chaos), also Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Roger Moore and an early US appearance from Jackie Chan. For good looks Farrah Fawcett and Adrienne Barbeau make a good showing as well. There is a whole lot of content in this movie that would not play well in today's more PC climate.

McClure and his sidekick Victor are out to win in an ambulance. Can they beat the motley group of reprobates competing, and will killjoy Senator Hoyt spoil their fun ?Needham and Reynolds made six big-budget race-car movies in the seventies and eighties, all of which are dumb but fun, and I think this one (which came between Smokey And The Bandit II and Stroker Ace) is probably the best. It starts off with a dynamite title sequence featuring a Lamborghini Diablo, has some nice songs and stunts, is filled with enough screwy characters and shamelessly mugging stars to keep you amused, and almost never tries to be anything but a big joke. I like the way these pictures, in a politically-correct and environmentally-conscious age, are gloriously offensive, as out of date as Fawcett's huge sunglasses. The chief attractions are the cars (a Ferrari, an Aston Martin, a futuristic Subaru, a Rolls Royce and several others) and the large cast; DeLuise is terrific, Chan does some groovy stuff, and don't miss the scene where an unbilled Valerie Perrine out-cleavages honeys Barbeau and Buckman. Personally, I prefer Paul Bartel's earlier, wackier Cannonball, but this is still good-natured fun with a bunch of drunken good ol' boys driving recklessly. Oddly, despite being all-American nonsense, this movie was financed by the Hong Kong-based Golden Harvest film company.

40,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A live-action wacky races movie,7,11 July 2013,"Seeing people get away with some of the most ridiculous actions in comedic fashion is always tantalizing. How do they get away with such foolishness? That doesn't happen in the real world as often as this. If only I (as in the viewer) could be that crazy with no problems. This is exactly what this live-action version of Boomerang's Wacky Races (1968) is. It's a movie where rules don't apply to main characters as well as physics, gags and mindset. The movie just can't be taken on a literal level; otherwise, the viewer will not enjoy it.Joining director Hal Needham in this racecar comedy is veteran actor Burt Reynolds who has also completed several projects in the past with him; so it's no surprise they are in this project either. Co-starring Reynolds is a slew of other well-known actors, singers and models. Playing Reynolds right hand companion is Dom DeLuise who also has an alter ego whom no one seems to understand of how he shows up and exits. Together they ride in an ambulance as a disguise to help them win the race. Accompanying them is their doctor played by Jack Elam who was cast perfectly because of his unmoving left eye. To name a few more, Farrah Fawcett, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Jackie Chan and even Roger Moore (who pretends he's Roger Moore) all play funny characters.This is the real strong point to this movie; it's an ensemble cast and if you're a viewer who likes seeing movies with lots of star power, this is one of them to see. The story however, written by Brock Yates isn't anything special. The plot is about a bunch of wacky racers doing what they can to win and really that's all this movie needed. It does give a back-story to Reynolds' character and DeLuise's alter ego but it's nothing to be real interested in. As for the comedy parts of the writing, that is a slight bit stronger than the story itself. However, that also doesn't mean every joke was funny. There were some places there just were not funny enough when it should have been.Each actor has their own thing going for them and it's because of that, that they all don't rely on the same thing to make a joke. Again, my favorite was Jack Elam playing the doctor. God he was a laugh! And surprisingly, the score provided by Al Capps did a decent job as well. His tunes may have not been longer than a good 30 seconds, but it did evoke the right feeling of the movie, which was lightheartedness. One thing that did bug me was how politically incorrect and sexist everything was though. I understand that it this time it wasn't taken seriously and I also understand that this is partially what helps make the film effective in a comedic sense but unfortunately, in today's age, it can be offensive to some who are closed minded individuals.There isn't a story to fall back on which can leave some people feeling empty.

Heck, I have a warm spot for all the rampant stupidity, myself.All the better that Roger Moore plays a deft parody of his own James Bond persona, complete with an Aston Martin.

It'll only ruin your good memories of the first.  And if you didn't like the original, well....Five stars.  Plus one star extra for adding Jackie Chan for what adds up to mostly as a cameo as a karate-kicking racer.  And a half star more for Adrienne Barbeau's fancy work with a jump suit zipper.

51,TheHonestCritic,"Well, this ""film"" was a wasted opportunity!",2,25 September 2019,"""The Cannonball Run"" (1981), this ""movie"" is an example of a mess from beginning to end. However, when I first heard of this ""film"" and it's story along with it's star-studded cast, I was blown away. I thought: ""I need to check this out! So much all-star talent, with a brilliant story concept. They can't possibly screw it up!"" But, to my surprise, they did. The film makers really screwed up this ""movie"" badly. Here's something interesting to point out, ""The Cannonball Run"" is based on an actual real event. During the 1970's, there was an illegal racing event that took place, known as Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash. Which was also known as the Cannonball Baker and of course known as the Cannonball Run. That was the inspiration behind this ""movie"". A brilliant concept, but such terrible execution in this ""film"". It has a terrible story, the acting is all over the place, most of the special effects are dated, and even the soundtrack is kind of lousy! As far as the ""story"" in this ""movie"" goes, there's very little to no plot. All it shows is a group of idiots racing across America with lazy jokes and one-liners. Seriously, did anybody proof read the script? A little rewrite would have gone a long way! The only good parts were the opening logo (IT MADE ME LAUGH A LITTLE), and the opening credits were exhilarating. But after that, it all goes downhill. If only the whole ""movie"" was as good as the opening logo and opening credits, it would surely have been a classic. As far as the cast goes, the casting is one of the most memorable in all of cinema, the cast list shown on the poster and credits is any way. So many talented actors, but such a wasted opportunity. This ""film"" takes very little to no advantage of it's monumental cast. I hate when that happens in a movie, when there's a great cast of actors, and they aren't utilized to their full potential. That really aggravates me to no end, I could scream! If I was making a movie with a cast this huge and star-studded, I would be going to town with each and every one of them and be taking advantage of them all as much as possible. Think about it, how often do you see a great cast like this? Let alone, get the opportunity to work with such a big ensemble cast like this? It's like the producers knew that this ""movie"" was going to be a flop, so they cast as many A-list actors as possible to lure moviegoers in to watch it so it could make money at the box office, and we fell for it. Talk about wasted potential! There aren't that many special effects, but whatever special effects they do have are kind of cheesy and have not aged well. The soundtrack is lazy, and it sounds like it was rushed together at the last minute! Most of the songs are good, but they are just added in haphazardly. Another film that suffers the same problem with it's soundtrack is ""Battleship"" (2012). That soundtrack is also lazy, and haphazardly put together as well! The only good thing in this ""movie"" are the sets/locations. I love seeing the changing scenery and landscapes as the ""film"" travels across the country. I was very disappointed with this ""movie"", so much wasted potential and such a wasted opportunity! I'm giving this ""film"" only 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from this ""movie""! If you're looking for a great road-racing comedy film, watch ""Smokey and the Bandit"" (1977) instead. That movie is phenomenal, and actually funny and exciting! ""The Cannonball Run"" is nothing more than just a ""Smokey and the Bandit"" wannabe. You'd be better off sitting this ""movie"" out! Trust me, I'm saving you 95 minutes of your time.",The Cannonball Run
52,Mcduff3601,Not as funny as I remember it when I was a kid.,6,22 March 2021,"Still it has some heart. I think the big fail in this movie is the attempt at comedy. Back in the 80's just putting Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise together meant it was funny. I find they play well off each other but it is dated comedy. Which is fine , but I have to be in a certain mood to watch that. Like watching Laurel and Hardy and thinking meh its been done.This movie is really all about it's star power. It has a ton of high level stars from the time. There is not much in the way of action other than watching people race across country.Can't say much more about this one. I don't think I would recommend it and I certainly won't be re-watching it down the road... get it. I am giving it a 6 because it does hold some nostalgic memories for me and I do like a lot of the stars in the movie but i think this one would rate a 4 or 5 for the average human that was born after the 80's.",The Cannonball Run
53,the amorphousmachine,Decent schlock!,6,10 August 2006,"You know, I wasn't actually sure if I had originally seen this film or not when I rented it recently. I had definitely seen parts of it before, and I do vaguely remember catching it once on television. However, I don't think I ever watched it from start to finish, but my memory of its representation of the 80s road films made me want to check it out one more time.Well, it's not great. 'The Cannonball Run' is reminiscent of 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World', and both are equally as boring in parts. Like the former film, we are introduced to an array of characters who want to compete in the biggest illegal road race across the USA. The main characters are J.J. McClure (Burt Reynolds) and his sidekick Victor (Dom DeLuise), who as a strange alter-ego that both of them would rather not talk about. They have the perfect vehicle in an Ambulance for speeding in this race, but first they have to recruit an unwilling patient (and potential love interest for J.J.) in Pamela Glover (Farrah Fawcett) and an actual doctor who would stoop low enough to assist them in Dr. Van Helsing (Jack Elam). However, the race is not going to be easy for J.J and his crew with many wanting glory in this race.Their main rivals are Rat Pack duo in Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jnr, aptly disguised as priests. These two provide some competition as well as Roger Moore who plays someone who pretends he's Roger Moore, and he has many James Bond references and music cues (which, actually still work even 20 years later). Elsewhere, Jackie Chan has a computerised Suburu, two sexy vixens (Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman) who have arguably the coolest car, and a Shiek(Jamie Farr) all provide entertainment and rivalry. Other characters seem unnecessary; such as motorcycle duo consisting on a Wall Street type character, and two annoying Budweiser-guzzling hillbillies who have a tendency to shatter windows. The film cuts from one character to the next as they progress through the race, and that's your basic plot there.As for the comedy, it's very dated at times. Some works, but most feel like a joke to show how obnoxious some drivers can be while racing. There is a fair dose of cheese in there, especially when DeLuise becomes his alter-ego- which is, ummm, not that funny! Other parts are pretty funny, such as the use of Chan, Moore and particularly, Elam as the wacky doctor! All in all, it's fairly decent schlock! 'The Cannonball Run' doesn't really stand the test of time very well compared to other 80s vehicles, but at least we know the mustache was in full force back then. Jack Elam- an actor I'd never really heard of- is the best thing here, and it was good to see Chan show off his stuff to Western audiences. I noticed the Good Year product placement a little too much, and there was some wayward jokes that wouldn't be tolerated in comedies these days, such as some racial slurs. However, not to be taken too seriously in a film where cars are just as crucial to the story as the drivers. Great end credit sequence with some funny out-takes. Not essential 80s viewing, but you can forgive its enthusiasm for fast cars and silly comedy due to its time.*** out of *****!",The Cannonball Run
54,squirrel_burst,"Dated, unfunny, boring and offensive",1,3 November 2014,"If you took ""Death Race 2000"", took out all of the blood, all of the nudity, made it unfunny, boring and only had the racing begin halfway through the film you would have a pretty awful movie. Well, 1981 brought us just that! ""The Canonball Run"", a lousy, offensive comedy that shows that just because the stars are having a good time, it doesn't mean that anyone else will. The film is about a cross-country car race across the United States, where teams of two or more racers compete for no prize at all besides bragging rights (how exciting!) The team we're supposed to be cheering for is J.J. McClure (Burt Reynolds) and the sidekick he has abused into submission, Victor Prinzim (Dom DeLuise). Every team has to have a strategy to avoid getting busted by the cops during this outlawed race so these guys come up with the actually pretty ingenious idea of empowering what looks like an ambulance with a powerful motor. Against the heroes are a slew of wacky racers, including Jackie Chan and Michael Hui as Japanese drivers with a high-tech car; Jamie Farr as an Arabian Sheik; Roger Moore as what is either himself, a Roger Moore impersonator, or a man named Seymour Goldfarb who is a secret agent, an assassin and a philanthropist who also acts in films under the pseudonym of Roger Moore; Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. as two drunks pretending to be catholic priests, two spandex-clad hotties who seduce their way through their speeding tickets (played by Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman) and more. Because J.J. is a nearly psychopathic horn-dog, he and his team also kidnap an airhead tree hugger they brainwash into calling herself ""Beauty"" along for the ride (Farrah Fawcett).This film was an absolute chore to watch. The film is extremely predictable and further hindering it is the fact that we do not see our titular characters race until 42 minutes into the movie. I've forgiven films for starting up slowly before because they were setting up a big story or developing the characters but everyone here is a one-joke paper cut-out that isn't the least bit exciting. Burt Reynolds is a player who always has one eye on the finish line and the other peering down the shirt of every girl in the vicinity. Dom DeLuise is an idiot with a split personality that we're supposed to love because he was a kind heart and is the constant butt of jokes. I hated the both of them... almost as much as Farrah Fawcett's character Beauty. She literally gets kidnapped, drugged and dragged across the United States against her will and barely protests. When her character is introduced, she's a total ditz, meant to be sexually ogled by the audience and the people in the film and it gets really old really quickly. At first, the film threw me for a loop. When she is introduced, she comes off as the kind of person who would be against an illegal car race because she's hanging out with some hippie stereotypes with sticks up their butts. I figured she would be somehow roped into joining the race and would argue with J.J. constantly until they inevitably fell in love. ""At least, (I thought to myself) she isn't a dumb, ditzy blonde that joined up with the level 3 vegan assembly without knowing what she was getting into. If that was the case, she would be too stupid to argue against J.J. and would, as the film goes along lose more and more clothing to make her an obvious sex object"". Just a few scenes later and we can see her wearing a white sweatshirt and no bra underneath, ready to be fooled by the dumbest lies and convinced to abandon her name because of J.J.'s charms.Forget that the characters are bland and that the film is boring, the least it could do is be either funny or charming. It's neither. It plays like an inside joke between this group of friends that are having a great time and don't care who they are alienating. It's like everyone was having such a good time they didn't realize how downright offensive the movie gets. Take for example the introduction of the ""Japanese Team"". They cast Jackie Chan, who is Chinese, as one of the racers. As for his girlfriend, ""the top movie star of Japan"", she's clearly Philipino and is described as appearing in many Godzilla movies. We've got the broadest stereotype of Arabs in the form of the Sheik, several jabs at Jews and we're supposed to let it slide because these actors were having a good time? I rolled my eyes at the endless Roger Moore-James Bond references. We get it! You played 007! Can we move on? Yeah, Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman are attractive, but they don't do anything with these characters. I would have laughed hard at an obvious joke they SHOULD have done, which was see these two being held p for a half hour while a particularly frisky state trooper insisted on strip-searching them after they attempts at seducing him. That would have been clever though and there's nothing clever in this movie.I didn't absolutely loathe this film as much as I did say... ""Freddy Got Fingered"" but I cannot think of a single thing that was good about this movie. Some people would say the stunts and yeah, a couple of them are good but the terrible fight choreography edges that out. I found it unimaginative, offensive and worst of all completely boring. I cannot think of anyone I would ever recommend the film to so I have to be honest and give this film a 1 / 10. Don't watch it and stay away from the sequels, which I hear are even worse.

55,aramis-112-804880,Thirty-Six Years in the Making,6,1 June 2017,"""Cannonball Run"" hit theaters when I was 20. Having a low threshold for Burt Reynolds and little tolerance for car-race movies (I hung with an artsy crowd at the time that disdained anything popular as suspect) it took me thirty-six years to finally sit down and watch it, and I wish I'd seen it in the theaters.This tale of a cross-country race (literally, from NY to CA preferably in 72 hours) has a phenomenal cast (circa 1981). I expected a lot of cardboard characters, but in fact the film takes too long setting up the characters--and still they come off as cardboard.Reynolds stars. Frequent Reynolds co-star Dom DeLuise is his co-driver, and Dom needs a stronger hand than Hal Needham to keep him from going over the top, which he does too frequently. They are accidentally joined by Farrah Fawcett, looking even more lovely than she did when leaving ""Charlie's Angels"" four years earlier. Fawcett is the reason I wish I saw this flick in the cinema. Though the film contains no actual nudity Farrah wears a sweater at one point that perfectly shows off her nipples, and I'd rather see it on a large screen with twenty-year old eyes than a small screen with what I have today.High points: Jack Elam's crazy doctor. Wall-eyed actor Elam steals every scene he's in. While good use is made of his eyes, he never falls into the trap that often killed Marty Feldman, who thought his eyes were enough for a joke. Elam is always inventive and his crazy doctor always does the unexpected.Then there's Roger Moore. He's also crazy, a nice Jewish boy who believes he's . . . Roger Moore, international celebrity. It sounds like a one-note part but he's actually given some clever bits, including appearing in every scene with a different girl (the last girl he's with has the best line in the movie).""Cannonball Run"" is wonderfully politically incorrect. The prime beneficiary of this is newcomer (to American audiences) Jackie Chan, who is able to show off some of his martial arts prowess. Jamie Farr is a hoot as an Islamic Arab prince, who today would have vest bombers in the theaters. And George Furth plays a whinging bureaucrat (in the mode of William Atherton the later ""Ghostbusters"") who lives to put an end to everyone's fun. It's good to revisit the days when even film-makers who like liberty thought the nine scariest words in the English language were ""I'm from the government and I'm here to help."" Low points: 1) Two NC rednecks played by football player Terry Bradshaw and stuttering singer Mel Tillis add nothing to the movie, especially not humor. 2) Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr., perhaps the last of the all-round entertainers who can sing, act and do comedy and who are as comfortable onstage as they are in front of a movie-camera, don't even seem to be trying. The two most talented members of the cast, and two of the eldest who, like Elam, should be showing the youngsters how to do it right, are just abysmal. If you want to see this movie because you're a Dean or Sammy fan, do yourself a favor and remember them as they used to be. 3) Adrienne Barbeau based a lot of her career on her bust (she got a big break onstage in ""Hair"" and her shapeliness never hurt her. Here, her only contribution is, every time she's stopped by the cops is to unzip her skin-tight suit and show off her cleavage (just enough to get by without an ""R"" rating). If that's all you want, rent ""Swamp Thing"" instead.Then there's Burt Reynolds, as usual thinking he merely has to show up for women to swoon. He struts across the scene wearing that 70s ""porn moustache"" in the way Moore's character does in his fantasy world, only in a real, live moving picture. It's hard to believe this movie came out the same year as the subtle, beautiful drama ""Chariots of Fire"" which was about another sort of race.Apart from the low points, ""Cannonball Run"" is brainless fun, but it may be just the remedy for you when you're ill or can't sleep or on a low biorhythm. But Dom really is hard to swallow.",The Cannonball Run

This movie was about a bunch of people who wanted to race in the Cannonball Run a Race that went from New York to California and the first one to stamp there card wins the prize. Let's start with the drivers as they arrived at the hotel where the Cannonball Race will stat. There's Marcie Thatcher and Jill Rivers riding around the highways going 220 MPH and spraying traffic and speed limit signs. Then you got JJ McClure and Victor who are also in this race. Victor and JJ are trying to figure out what kind of vehicle they need to win this race. So JJ can think first they go riding in an airplane, landing the in the middle of town in order to get beer. Next they go boat riding, only to crash and both JJ and Victor and up in an ambulance. JJ asks the doctor how far away is the hospital and he was told about 15 miles. But they were also told it would only take 5 minutes because with an ambulance you can go in and out of traffic with no one bothering to stop you. So they look at each other and laugh as they continue to fly through traffic. Next you got Jamie Blake and Morris Fendebaum who are dress like priest but they sure don't act like one. So everyone one is at the hotel having a party the night before the race starts. That's when JJ discovers Pamela Glover a very young and beautiful girl who happens to like trees. As JJ is trying to talk to Pamela he is interrupted by Victor who wants to talk about the doctor. JJ tells Victor that they need a doctor to ride in the ambulance so right before the race starts Victor finds Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing but JJ doesn't want to know where in found this doctor. So while the race has started, and JJ realizes that that they don't have a patient for in back of the ambulance. So as there going down the road they come upon and accident where Pamela Glover is standing when JJ and Victor pull up. Pamela ask if they will help the young man and so JJ opens the door, get Pamela Glover inside and Victor takes of leaving the man behind. As there going down the highway a New Jersey State Trooper has his lights on stopping the ambulance. Inside the doctor has given Pamela laughing gas to make it look like she really sick. The girls had a few tricks of the own. You see they would go down the states highways like a bat out of hell only to get pulled over by State Troopers. They were both wearing one piece suits so they open up the zipper show a little and the State Troopers would let them go every time. Who wins this race? Where does Captain Chaos come into play? How many of them get caught and don't finish the race? Here are some thoughts of my own on this movie. I thought the plot and the comedy of this movie was great from beginning to end.

61,matija-trost,"SOOOOOO BAD, THAT IT'S ALMOST...",3,2 November 2003,"...GOOD, quoting one of the critic who wrote this sentence, before me. True, true...this movie has one of the worst scripts ever, the story filled with holes, terrible acting...I mean, boy oh boy, really, everything in this movie is so pathetic, but than, for this reason it can be quite funny. The only mentionable thing is an opening scene with one of the most beautiful cars in the world and some nice ladies in it. Though, too bad, that the crew didn't produce a better movie. I mean, who wouldn't like to watch an illegal race with a super sport cars, based on the truth story. The plot is great, just waiting for the right producer to make it into a successful movie. I couldn't imagine why I liked this movie back in the 80's, when i was a kid (maybe, because I WAS a kid), but now, well I guess it's an icon between pathetic movies and because of that it deserves more than one star.3 out of 10",The Cannonball Run
62,chvylvr80,a fun filled race across the US,9,8 March 2002,"The Cannonball Run has been vilified by many critics over the years but I love this movie and have been watching it ever since I was little. This movie is what happens when a bunch of movie stars who just happen to be close friends in real life decide to make a movie just for fun. The plot is simple enough, race from one end of the country to the other for a million dollars and avoid the law on the way. The cast is jammed with big names and just about everyone in the movie that has a speaking part is a star of some stature. This movie is simply great fun and has a lot in common with the rest of director Hal Needham's films,i.e. Smokey and the Bandit. I can't really say that this film is full of great acting because the entire cast horses around through the whole movie. Jackie Chan makes his first appearance in a American movie with this film and both Hal Needham and writer Brock Yates have cameos. Don't expect a lot in the way of plot or acting or effects or anything like that and just enjoy the ride. The outtakes at the end of this and Cannonball Run II are hilarious and it makes it more fun for me anyway to know that this movie was just like a big meeting of old friends. Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. are great as Blake and Fenderbaum respectively. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise anchor this film (they're the main characters)and the give and take between these two make them one of the best comedy teams I have ever seen. Bottom Line: Buy this flick, drag it out every once in a while, and have fun watching it with family or friends. A truly fun movie to watch.",The Cannonball Run
63,bannonanthony,"""We're trying to win a race, not set a record!""",7,30 December 2002,"I actually saw CANNONBALL RUN 2 before I saw the first movie. I must say I preferred CR2 more than this first film, but this film still has greatmoments. Most of the celebrities were a little unfamiliar to me as I'm a non-American, but I still enjoyed the whole race. There's a bunch of cool vehicles in this picture and the drivers are a bunch of lovable eccentrics whose adventures we follow throughout the story.The Cannonball Run is an illegal race from Conneticut to California, with a $1 million prize to the winner. The film focuses on this contest and the various competitors in the race. Our main characters are Burt Reynolds as J.J. McClure and Dom DeLuise as his schizophrenic partner Victor. At times Victor dons a mask and becomes Captain Chaos, a would-be superhero and great race driver to boot. J.J., however, gets aggravated whenever Victor becomes 'Him'. These two enter the contest with a ambulance, pretending to be eccentric millionaires who go around helping people. They complete their disguise with a freakish doctor and a patient in the form of airheaded tree-hugger Farrah Fawcett, whom they hoodwink into coming with them. The other racers are a colourful bunch. They include Sammy Davis Jnr. and Dean Martin as a pair of unsavoury characters disguised as priests, a Roger Moore look-alike (played by Roger Moore) who likes to pretend that he IS Roger Moore, a crazy Arab shiek, a pair of jumpsuit-clad ladies who use their 'charms' to get out of trouble with the police (schwing!), a motorcycle tycoon and his overweight assistant, and a pair of Japanese racers in a computerised sports car. All of these guys get up to assorted mischief on the race. Meanwhile, National Safety Council jerk George Furth tries to do everything within his power to stop the race.The performances are reasonably good. But Burt Reynolds is a jerk for most of it (he's always giving Dom a hard time), and Farrah Fawcett is such a space cadet that it's unbelievable. DeLuise is lovable as Victor and his alter-ego Captain Chaos. Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman are both pretty good as the cunning Jill and Marcie, but I personally preferred Susan Anton and Catherine Bach who played these characters in the second movie. The others all do pretty well, but the Roger Moore joke got really old really fast. The car action is enjoyable, but the fist fight near the end is rather gratuitous (well considering the director was a stuntman, it makes sense why he'd want a big fight, and is is staged rather well, but maybe the film could have done without it.). Anyway, as I said before, I enjoyed CR2 more, but this film is still worth a look in.",The Cannonball Run
64,jamiecostelo58,Complete over the top fun!,7,2 January 2007,"This must be one of the most ridiculous movies ever made, but it actually works brilliantly! The Cannonball Run contains laughs aplenty, and is a wonderful over the top road race film. The storyline is highly unlikely and the acting not expertly carried out, but that's not the point! Upon first viewing I laughed out loud, and I still do, so many times I have watched it now! Released in 1981, The Cannonball Run has significantly dated and looks as if it was filmed in the 1960s, but because it's so lighthearted and fun, it doesn't matter. Burt Reynolds and Roger Moore are the main stars of the show, but everyone else takes part in just the same manner, and there's a whole host of TV and movie stars you can think of: Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Peter Fonda, Adrienne Barbeau, Farrah Fawcett (looking beautiful) and Jackie Chan to name a few! The Cannonball Run was Fawcett's first major successful film after leaving Charlie's Angels in 1977. Shame she had to wait four years...However, in a nutshell, The Cannonball Run is utterly over the top and looks significantly older than it is, but the sheer laughs and ridiculous moments you witness in everyone's objective to win this illegal road race across America is sure to be enjoyed!",The Cannonball Run
65,Ziglet_mir,Good Ole' Character Comedy,7,2 June 2010,"""The Cannonball Run"" is a very fun film. To start off, this film has a nice star-studded cast with the likes of Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise, Farrah Fawcett, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, and my personal favorite Jack Elam-- who all constantly throw out laughs. Everyone is excellent in their unique and very eccentric roles. There are amazing comedic duos who are wildly out in their prime such as Reynolds & Deluise, Davis & Martin, Bradshaw & Tillis. Plus there are great amounts of eye candy between the like of Farrah Fawcett and Adrienns Barbeau. The fact that this film is also based off of a real race makes me want to have seen it all for myself. This is a very character-based comedy and is nothing compared to it's more well known ancestor ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"". However it still makes it's mark in the rat-race genre. I highly recommend Canonball Run to anybody who hasn't seen it. Take a risk and see how you like another classical and loopy take of cross-country greed and chance.",The Cannonball Run
66,Shaolin_Apu,Documentary based on true events,6,25 May 2005,"I started to watch this movie as a joke. I don't remember whom I specially wanted to annoy with that, but after watching the film several times I began to like it. I expected nothing from it but it gave me pleasure in sarcastic way  I've seen many better films than this, but this one is also better than many 'quality' films.The film is all about some stars gathering together and having a good time. Everyone adds into the film his/her own ideas with nothing really to be taken seriously. Most people will watch this film because of Burt Reynolds, who is probably the best actor for this kind of films. He and Dom DeLuise are not really Laurel & Hardy, but are still funny. This may probably not be the best Burt Reynolds film, but will be one of his most popular works anyway.Many viewers will also like the bad guy of the movie, Mr. Foyt, who hates cars and is totally against the whole Cannonball Run. My favourite is however Farrah Fawcett who manages to produce some good one liners like ""Are you one of those volley-ballers?"" but will be corrected ""Cannonballers?"".I still keep watching this movie even if it remains for me as a joke. It's really not a good movie but isn't bad either. It's strength and cohesion lies in its harmless having-fun attitude without any special references. Some of the jokes are bit stupid but as nothing here is meant to be taken seriously, this film remains for me a portrayal of some easy-going early 1980's.",The Cannonball Run
67,filmbuff-36,All-star madcap race to California,8,2 September 2000,"This film is best summarized as a live action version of Wacky Races.  Burt Reynolds leads on all star cast of freaky drivers competing in a no-holds-barred race competition called the Cannonball Run.  The standouts in this film are Roger Moore who seems to enjoy spoofing his own James Bond character, Jackie Chan as a kung-fu foreign race champ, Jack Elam as the twisted doctor riding along in Burt's ambulance, and Jamie Farr as a mad sheik trying to show Islamic superiority by defeating his opponents.This is not a movie to be taken seriously, especially with Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. cruising around dressed up like priests.  There are a lot of good stunts and chase scenes in this movie, as well as a long brawl towards the end with all the Cannonballers against a gang of bikers, led by Peter Fonda!To quote the Brain Gremlin from Gremlins 2:  ""Check it out one time, won't you!""

He was truly great in Deliverance, in Boogie Night, and in his final film.But in that same great final film, he came to terms with his life and career. He regretted going for the easy cash in simple minded action films like this one.There was a backlash against Reynolds' films. Mother Against Drunk Drivers pointed to him as the worst example of films promoting reckless, often drunken, driving. The small town in Texas I grew up in the 70s had lots of teens trying to imitate him. That meant driving reckless when bored on the weekends. It also meant lots of accidents, injuries, even deaths.There are scenes that make you wonder why anyone thought they were funny. Martin and Davis shown throughout the film as drunk driving at 120 miles an hour. It's like telling kids it's fun to play Russian roulette.And some parts are pathetic. We are supposed to believe the same two Rat Packers, in their 60s and scrawny, can beat up a gang of bikers a third their age? It's as sad and desperate as hearing an aging rocker sing about high school. What a horrible end to great careers.Overall as action or comedy, it's so so anyway.

75,WOZ inOZ,Overgrown buddy movie on wheels.,8,15 March 1999,"Here was another fuel-injected fun vehicle for Burt Reynolds, amongst a handful of action comedy flicks that proved ever popular in the early eighties. It has all the elements that make a good pop-corn action movie; mad-cap characters, wise-cracking side-kicks, a handful of suped-up cars, some T & A, and a stunt at every opportune moment. It also features a well chosen, mixed bunch of respected Hollywood stars of that time, a few sports personalities and some personal friends of the director, making the film appear like an overgrown (and at times a little self-indulgent) buddy movie on wheels.The chemistry amongst the cast is the film's obvious strong point. Reynolds and DeLuise play a perfect double act while the late Sammy Davis Jnr. and the positively paralytic Dean Martin (who appears almost completely drunk throughout the entire movie,) provide ample rivalry for Reynolds and co. to bounce off. Roger Moore hams things up as the rich playboy who actually thinks he is....Roger Moore!?! Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman supply sexual sizzle as the sly babe competitors, while Jack Elam's unbalanced proctologist is irresistibly funny and fits seamlessly into the cartoon comedy.Stunt wise the film has it's fair share, but none are particularly eye popping, and most gratuitously run of the mill. Even viewers accustomed with Jackie Chan's phenomenal fight scenes in other films will be a little let down by the performance here. Surprisingly for a race movie there is actually very little racing going on, and the scenes featured are usually just a few brief ones with the protagonists often getting the better of the local 'smokey's.' For car chases you'd be better off catching 'Mad Max,' 'Bullit,' or even 'The Blues Brothers.'The end of the day The Cannonball Run is more about the personalities taking part than the race itself and despite cruising along without anything vaguely resembling a script the film manages to score on both points, right up to the end titles and accompanying out-takes, which surprisingly contain some of the best gags of the movie.",The Cannonball Run

It also includes Roger Moore driving an Aston Martin complete with all the goodies, spoofing his James Bond movies. Watching the out takes as the credits roll indicates that the cast and crew truly had a ball making this flick!

Some of the most talented people are in it, like Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, Roger Moore, Farrah Fawcett, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Mel Tillis, and more. It's like a big budget Love Boat. We are lucky to have movies like that. Not enough movies like this are made today. Everybody puts on a terrific show.

The drive they make is 3000 miles going from New Jersey to California and the cops are waiting to bust the ""Cannonballers"" at every turn. Let The Race Begin! All scores are out of a possible 10: Story: 6 - Its several stories with no real background, but very fun concept of everyone meeting up.Acting: 5 - Everyone is way over confident, yet slick and cool about why they're here for the race. Some shining moments have to be Roger Moore playing his James Bond part perfectly, regardless that its a totally different movie.Music: 3 - Nothing real catchy, but there is a funny Japanese jingle whenever Jackie Chan's scenes come up.Sound Mix: 3- Also not too impressive. The crazy doctor appearing gives a quick pipe organ sound whenever he appears, and all of the cars are revving with speed in it.Camera-work / Lighting: 5 - Chase scenes get pretty intense though you can predict what will happen. Some good aerial shots showing how close the cars get and long jumps over obstacles take place.Editing: 6 - Pretty easy to follow along with each character's scenario, but again there's a LOT of main characters so it gets a bit confusing on who's winning the race.Uniqueness: 7 - Rat Race, Cannonball Run 2, and others... this WAS the original so it was fine at its time. Now its just overdone.Worth: 7 - Definitely worth watching. its an all time classic. its just two decades old.Overall Score (Not an average): 7 - Worth watching. The sheer amount of 70's/ Early 80's stars makes it likable for anyone really. Its got a lot of quick funny bits and who doesn't love Burt Reynolds?!

This film, a decent comedy, doesn't zero in on the cars so much themselves or the geography and distance of the race or the test of endurance the competitors are about to go through. Nope. Instead, this film zeroes in on the bizarre characters undertaking that race. To be sure, there are some rather funny characters in the movie -- and rather brainless ones. But don't expect to come away having witnessed a good race movie; this is standard comedy. I kept wanting to know where the drivers WERE locationally and a good bit in to the movie after the race has begun we find out they are in New Jersey (though you never see a coast). A few minutes later, then, we see The Arch of St. Louis. But parts of the movie are rather refreshing, specifically the fact that individual relations between men and women don't end up in fornication or scenes of gratuitous nudity. In that sense, the men and women are respected for who they are. Made in 1981 and lasting about an hour and a half, this movie operates as something to pass the time, especially in certain quiet days of the year, like those hours of solitude leading up to Christmas Day.",The Cannonball Run
85,maixiu,Which one is the blooper?,10,13 June 2003,"There are three things which stand out to me.  The first is, as has already been mentioned, there is a huge continuity gap at the conclusion.  Since each racer has a punch card, why was there a footrace at the end, as if the first one to reach the clock would win?  Secondly, Jackie Chan's character is supposed to be Japanese, so why does he speak Chinese in all his parts? This becomes most absurd when he's on the talk show and the host speaks Japanese to him.  Jackie answers in Cantonese as if they're actually carrying on a conversation!  Later, during night scenes where the viewer can't see Jackie's mouth, they repeat the same audio track over two different scenes.  Thirdly, watch the end very carefully.  When Dom DeLuise comes up with the Capt. USA mask, there is much laughter and mirth; Burt Reynolds moves in and hugs DeLuise.  Yet later, we see that that scrap of film was culled from one of the bloopers!  They just changed the audio track and spliced it in.I don't know, this remains one of the more pleasureable of my guilty pleasures.

So rather than ask for my dollar back, I just got up and walked into the movie they were screening next door.

I already thought that Burt Reynolds was just about the coolest dude around (I wanted his black Trans Am so badly!) so the chances were pretty high that I would like it regardless of whether it was a good film or not. I ended up recording a copy off TV and pretty much burned out the tape watching the flick over and over again (Cannonball Run II as well). As I recently prepared to watch the film for the first time as an adult, I was a bit concerned that it wouldn't stand up to the high acclaim I had awarded it as a kid...particularly after noting the poor rating it has here on IMDb. Nevertheless, as I kicked back and turned it on I was immediately giddy with the initial scene of the Lamborghini chicks really putting the machine through the gears. While the humour is admittedly silly, that is what the movie is about - it's a silly but extremely entertaining movie with hot 80s chicks and fast cars.

96,mikeywuzhere,Popcorn Fun!,7,16 March 2005,"This may not be the greatest film ever made but it is certainly entertaining. Every once and a while this little gem shows up on late night TV and it's still fun to watch. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise were by far the best comic duo in their day and the supporting cast is equally enjoyable. Roger Moore spoofs his own 007 image to outrageous levels; Jamie Farr is downright hilarious as The Sheik; Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. play the perfect pair of disguised, perverted priests; and of course, this was back in the day when Farrah Fawcett was substantial eye candy.If anything, women should find this film delightfully amusing, considering that it repeatedly mocks the whole ""male machismo"" angle: men obsessed with beer, women and speed that spend all of ninety minutes trying to see who is faster, who gets the girl and who has the bigger (put your own thoughts here) when all is said and done.It's more or less an extended version of ""Smokey and the Bandit:"" hot shot speed demons trying to stay one step ahead of the law and dish out one-liners while shamelessly advertising Budweiser along the way.If anything, the outtakes at the end are worth sitting through the movie to see. Clearly the cast had a lot of fun making this film and it shows on screen. So just sit back with the popcorn and shut off your brain for a while...it's a therapeutic necessity.",The Cannonball Run
97,guggy,That's Okay JJ -- I always wanted to be ... Captain USA!,10,11 December 1999,Anyone who cannot enjoy the madcap antics of Victor and JJ should check their pulse to make sure they're still alive. Dom DeLuise at his finest. He captures the shy and loyal Victor and then instantly can transition to the bold and Courageous Chaos without missing a beat. What an actor! Stand up Mr. DeLuise -- you deserve it!,The Cannonball Run
98,The_Puzzled_One,"Hello, Jay Jay!",8,19 November 2003,"What? If you're expecting a serious comedy, then you will undoubtedly be disappointed.As far as comic-book characterisation and 80's chic go, this film is perfectly tongue-in-cheek.The chemistry between Jay Jay and Chaos is superb... still funny well into the 2000's.In line with a ream of other comedies of its time (""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"", ""Trading Places"" and ""Spies Like Us"" - all SNL spawned classics) and superior in its way to all clones made since.Que the music - ""tan-,tan-,taaaah!!!""",The Cannonball Run
99,bukster007-1,It doesn't pretend to be anything other than it is...,7,22 March 2005,"Which is to say, it's not high art and doesn't pretend to be. This film is like McDonald's. You know the food isn't going to be all that great and it isn't going to be good for you, but you still leave satisfied. The Cannonball Run is pure entertainment and, in the end, isn't that all you really want in a film is to be entertained? If you want a film to change the world then keep sending Michael Moore your money. this film is about star power, laughs, and car chases. Most of all, look at the fun the cast is having. It clearly shows on screen that the whole cast is having a blast and nobody is taking anything too seriously. If you have any doubts, just watch the bloopers that run during the closing credits to see how much fun they had. If you doubt me, I'll have to stick these rosary ""bleeds"" up your nose.",The Cannonball Run

101,warvegeta,Good Car Movie,9,20 October 2005,"I like car movies, so I am somewhat prejudiced, but this was a good movie. It was original, it had funny moments, it had those seemingly standard car jumps and wrecks for a car movie. I will admit that it has flaws, like the story does not explain why the Cannonball Run was started, or how it jumps between characters is a bit confusing, but I can live with that. It has a Lambourghini, a Ferrari, a couple of Trans Ams, an Aston Martin, a Rolls, and many other cars, so I enjoyed it. It is a pretty good movie. I liked seeing the various cars competing and even though the movie is a bit predictable, and sometimes the actors' lines seem cheesy, it is an enjoyable movie for a gearhead, a racing fan, or just someone who likes cars.",The Cannonball Run
102,wolleks-1,Cannonball Run rules!!!,10,12 June 2006,"Captain Chaos, The Rat Pack, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Tillis! Burt, Roger Moore, and Mr...um...Foyt! Some say this isn't a masterpiece, there are no digital effects or Oscar nominated performances. Please! It's just fun watching some of the greats who have passed on and some others who were in their prime having a blast doing a movie that makes little sense and that's just the way I like it. I promise you will laugh and you won't know why, but you won't care! Great movie for anyone who wants to have a beer with his friends and watch a funny, pointless, silly movie. Unfortunately, I also recommend Peter Jackson's King Kong for the same reasons.",The Cannonball Run
103,mpajewski,Fun Feel Good Movie,10,13 November 2019,"Its a fun movie to watch. Filled with bubble gum jokes, expensive super cars and gratuitous cleavage, it was everything i wanted when i was 13. The chemistry between Dom and Burt is sincere and comes across nicely. It may be the first film ever to include a gag reel at the end of all the bloopers/mistakes they made. Sometimes movies move us to change, sometimes they teach us history, some are fantasy about far off lands. This is a light comedy with a happy ending.",The Cannonball Run
104,CoffeeRules,A rip-roaring good time!,9,31 July 2006,"I think when movies are rated, their intended purpose should be taken into consideration. ""The Cannonball Run"" was never intended to be an award winner or a highly artistic movie and thus should not be rated against such movies. What it sets out to do - just be a cross-country riot - it does beautifully! The movie has an amazing cast, and just about every interaction leaves me in stitches! And to the poster who commented on the censored versions - I totally agree. The movie loses its edge with the mild profanity cut out. When I tried to get this movie on VHS, I only found the edited version. However, the DVD I bought is the original movie. Just FYI, the original IS PG. The profanity level is not high enough to be rated R. The other version, which for some reason was the only one I could find on VHS, was a made for TV movie, so even the mild profanity was cut.",The Cannonball Run
105,bowenw55,Weird event in the beginning,8,10 July 2009,"In the opening sequence, about 3 1/2 minutes into the movie when the Director of Photography credit is on..Both the Lambo and the police car are driving down a 2 lane road in the left lane for no apparent reason. Soon after, a car passes them going the opposite direction and therefore also driving in the left lane. Has anyone else noticed this? I've rolled back through this a number of times. I can't see anything based on the plot or even based on filming requirements that would explain the reason for running on the left side. Also, I wondered if maybe this was filmed outside of the US, but I don't see any reference to overseas filming locations.",The Cannonball Run
106,jrb-8,The Mother of all road trips!,7,1 July 2005,"Burt Reynolds, Hal Needham and crew capitalized on the success of the first two Bandit movies, threw in some hot babes along with recognizable stars for a blast of a film. Who needs plot with all the eye candy? Also, you can tell that everyone on screen's having a blast doing this movie which adds to its enjoyability. Having the original Rat Pack reunite in these films perhaps signaled a passing of the torch to the new Rat Packers of that time, lead by Burt Reynolds. Being from Pittsburgh, Terry Bradshaw's involvement fueled his fan support as this was made after he won his fourth Super Bowl. This movie inspired my friends and I to take off on two cross country road trips. Although we could not find any spandex Lamborghini babes we almost had as much fun as these guys!",The Cannonball Run
107,xcitats,The Cannonball Run: RATED R VERSION,10,12 April 2005,"Does anyone know why all the DVD/VHS versions are rated PG?! I bought this movie on DVD (have it on VHS, rated R) and began watching it...After a minute or so I knew something was wrong. Checked the back of the box and it was PG! The 'R' version is HILARIOUS, and the 'PG' SUCKS! There are too many instances to count. The only difference is copious amounts of swearing, but it makes the movie SO much more enjoyable/funny.""Nice car father...Thank you a$$hole."" Or the PG ""Nice car father...Thank you very much."" <---A LITTLE different. ""I can't see sh/t can you?! No problem man no problem!"" PG-""I hope you can see more than me..."" WTF?! I'm not going to list all the differences, but they are major. Anyone know where I can get the R version on DVD?! My VHS copy has seen better days, but I refuse to watch anything but the R version. Any help would be vastly appreciated.",The Cannonball Run
108,DavidToner,Keep on Moving,6,14 October 2015,"Burt Reynolds made a fortune in this area with these goofy ""chase"" movie. If these are the kind of movies you like, then you won't be disappointed. Cannonball Run had an all-star cast of Reynolds, his good buddy Dom DeLuise, Farah Fawcettt, Jack Elan, Roger Moore, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Farr, Jackie Chan, on and on....pretty amazing. Yet, as dumb as this movie can be at times, is does provide a lot of laughs and speaking of that, DeLuise's laugh always made everyone do the same. Sometimes the best part of these films were the outtakes at the end with DeLuise cracking up and Reynolds slapping him! To me the out takes were almost better than the actual movie. If your just looking for a few laughs and some 80's cars then this movie is for you. If your looking for plot and depth, then keep on moving.",The Cannonball Run
109,speedfreek16,Decent all around car movie,6,17 February 2007,"I rented this movie on a whim cause it had cars in it, and was about the Cannonball Run, plus an all star cast. I have to say i was somewhat disappointed with this movie, while it is a comedy, there wasn't much car based action and the best of it was at the start of the movie with the intro credits with the Lamborghini being chased by the cop car.The movie seemed to drag out in places, especially at the start, and not a whole deal of focus on the cars themselves. It's not all bad, the character interaction and the comedy was top stuff, enjoyable movie for that, but for a movie to do with an across country race it did lack in the action department with the cars, yeah there is a couple things thrown in here and there for good measure, but never really did much for me.Good comedy, but even that could of been better slightly, the doctor had so much potential but was rarely used. If anything Farrah Fawcet was one of the redeeming qualities, but even her character wasn't used greatly, not that it mattered as she was more eye candy *and also bringing the movie's rating up slightly for me ;) and she had her high beams on at the start of the movie too hahaha* Lastly, while Jackie Chan was in this movie, he barely had any interaction at all with any of the other castOverall a relatively enjoyable movie i could watch many a time, but had a lot of potential in many areas to be better. A classic? well that's purely for you to decide, but for me, i'm not so sure",The Cannonball Run
110,weathermanfr,Pure and simple fun. And lots of it.,10,15 September 2017,"Well, I am anything but a movie expert. I can barely recall movie titles and actor names. Watched this movie almost by accident. However, after watching this movie, I realized that I like this kind of comedy. Pure comedy with no limits, no political correctness, no seriousness. With today's standards, it may be a little immature humor, but sometimes, that's exactly what you want to watch.I am a man that doesn't laugh often. I may smile, I may have a good time, but I don't laugh out loud. Well, during The Cannonball Run, I laughed out so loud, I never imagined I could. So many scenes had such an unexpected turn, that made me laugh with tears.What's not to laugh about? Most actors are unique characters. Their roles are bright, alive, active. Something that I haven't seen in a comedy for years. The story is simple, but filled with so many nice details along the way. Funny men, beautiful women. A loud movie. Actually and metaphorically loud. But as with everything in life, in order to enjoy a movie, you need to empty your mind, and let the movie speak to you.I give this movie ten stars, because it was an honest direct comedy, that made me laugh out loud and keep many scenes running in my head for hours. Exaclty what I expect from a comedy.",The Cannonball Run
111,mrusis,Sickening unfunny - a stain on the medium of film,1,22 September 2006,"I was looking for a good 'car' movie at the video store when this caught my eye. The cast, writer and concept promised so much.I am disgusted.This movie makes me want to break things in my revulsion.I utterly hate it.A car chase comedy without jokes or car chases (or even any cars travelling at high speed, all that is done with sped-up camera work) is pointless. When it is executed this badly it could make impressionable types suicidal.The only reason I got the whole way through was the paralysing horror of the film rooted me to the couch. I was awestruck at the ineptitude of the humour and directing.For a movie about a cross country car race (an inherently exciting idea, I think) the plot revolves almost entirely around people sitting about in dingy gas stations and car-parks talking about racing.The humour is so broad and poorly written you could plant a flag on it and claim it as sovereign territory of laziness.This film made me angry, it made me hate, it fills me with rage. Show it to the Hulk and his shade of green would be so dark it'd be black.The only thing that could have made this worse is CGI.I am too enraged at the hideous abortion of a film that this is to write anymore. I am going out now to buy a copy and then I will torture it.The worst abuse ever committed to any media be it prose, poetry, film or music.",The Cannonball Run
