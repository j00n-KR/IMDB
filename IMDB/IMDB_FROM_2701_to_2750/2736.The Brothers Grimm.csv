0,TheLittleSongbird,"Flawed, but well-performed fantasy-horror!",6,17 June 2009,"Terry Gilliam's Brothers Grimm tells the story of the disappearances of several girls, and so enter the Brothers Grimm. Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are both excellent in the title roles, Ledger especially with a more sympathetic portrayal than expected. I liked Peter Stromare and Jonathan Pryce here too. The film is full of clever nods to their fairy tales. The production design is a wonder, with lavish sets and colourful costumes, and there is some evidence of some detailed direction, if a little too serious. However, I wasn't keen on Lena Headey's performance as the main female character, and the storyline is very daft, and sometimes in the middle half bordered on getting a bit too silly. The script was okay, but perhaps because of the story it was underdeveloped, and cheesy in some places, and it was further undermined by a rather anti-climatic conclusion, that left me a little confused. Still, not a bad film, not awful but not great either. It is well performed and well designed, but is let down by the story and script mainly. 6/10 Bethany Cox.",The Brothers Grimm
1,bkoganbing,Who Ya Gonna Call -- Grimm Brothers,6,29 May 2014,"Back when I was a teen there was a Cinerama production of The Wonderful World Of The Brothers Grimm that starred Laurence Harvey and Karl Boehm as Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm. It was a delightful film that had some biographical material, but was more an excuse to put on screen, three of their collected fairy tales. Even adults could enjoy the film and one can still enjoy it today, but it ought to be seen on the big screen.Half a century later and we get an entirely different view of the brothers in The Brothers Grimm with Heath Ledger and Matt Damon as the folk lore scholars. But reading the Wikipedia article on the brothers you will not get the view that this film gives us of them as a pair of 19th century con artists. These two make a living off the fears and superstitions of a lot of peasants. They go to places there rumor has it a local curse is on the place. The two with a pair of dimwitted helpers put on a show for the locals with methods that the Ghostbusters would envy. In fact up to this point the film reminds me of a combination of The Ghostbusters and The Lavendar Hill Mob.But one fine day Damon and Ledger come upon a village with a real curse and an enchanted forest. Since they are folklorists they have to call on a store of accumulated knowledge to defeat the forest demons.50 years later with much improved special effects with computer graphics we have a film more likely to scare and no doubt people go to films to be scared. Matt Damon and Heath Ledger head a fine cast and certainly the time and place of a disunited Germany occupied by Napoleon's troops is better displayed.Still the fantasy of the Cinerama film is to be preferred.",The Brothers Grimm
2,Leofwine_draca,Boring CGI mess,4,30 November 2015,"THE BROTHERS GRIMM is an example of Terry Gilliam trying to recapture some of the magic of his '80s films like TIME BANDITS and THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHASEN. That it's a misfiring mess of a film is obvious from the outset, as this attempts quirky breakneck character comedy and fails throughout.The fantasy world and odd creatures that inhabit it, alongside the kooky/bumbling performances from the two leads, bring to mind the work of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp in the likes of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, SLEEPY HOLLOW, and ALICE IN WONDERLAND, although that's hardly a welcome comparison. In other words this is a typical, Hollywood-feel, over-stylised CGI adventure film with no character or wit to make it one to recommend.Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are both indescribably bland in the leading roles and neither of them are very funny either. There are better actors in the supporting roles, like Lena Headey, Mackenzie Crook, Jonathan Pryce, and Monica Bellucci, but they're all given very little to work with. For the most part THE BROTHERS GRIMM merely offers up endless sub-par CGI spectacle with the odd good scene, like the living clay figure. It's a mess, as are so many of Gilliam's films when you start looking too closely into his career.",The Brothers Grimm
3,SnoopyStyle,"Gilliam-lite style, Too much anger",5,4 January 2014,"It's 1811 in French occupied Germany. Will (Matt Damon) and Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger) are two con artists who use mechanics and mirrors to fake supernatural occurrences. They go to fearful villagers, and pretend to rid them of their monsters. General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce) is about to execute them when they are given the chance to save the village of Marbaden. They would need the help of trapper Angelika (Lena Headey).Matt Damon plays an annoying arrogant pompous man. Heath Ledger is wrong as the bookish bumbling geek. Neither of them are likable. They are a hard duo to root for. Peter Stormare plays the wacky Frenchman Cavaldi. Lena Headey plays a very hard woman.It's all ugly. The characters are ugly. The setting is ugly. The arguing is ugly. It has Terry Gilliam's inventive style, but it doesn't have the awesome scale of 'The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'. It definitely doesn't have the fun.",The Brothers Grimm
4,claudio_carvalho,"In a World of Magic and Fairytale, They Bring Happy End",8,19 August 2006,"In 1811, in a French occupied Germany, the crooks Brothers Grimm pretend to fight against evil witches and monsters to make money. However, they are arrested by Cavaldi (Peter Stormare) and General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce), but they have a chance to redeem themselves in the village of Marbaden, where ten young girls have vanished. Will (Matt Damon) and Jacob (Heath Ledger) are guided by the local Angelika (Lena Headey) through an enchanted forest where they face the evil Mirror Queen (Monica Bellucci) that depends on the sacrifice of twelve girls in the eclipse to stay beautiful and young.""The Brothers Grimm"" is an underrated dark fable, homage to the authors of a great number of fairy tales, the Brothers Grimm. The first point that calls the attention of this make-believe story is the magnificent cinematography and special effects. The story is original, funny and full of action, but not recommended for children, since it is too dark and Gothic. The personalities of Will and Jacob are not well-defined, since they begin the story as despicable con-men and end like heroes. The screenplay could have developed them further. Lena Headey and Monica Bellucci are extremely beautiful, as usual, and they have good performances. I am a fan of Terry Gilliam and in my opinion the evaluation of his direction in this movie is unfair in many reviews. The high-quality and wonderful pack of the Brazilian DVD released by Europa Distributor deserves a note in my review, being one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Os Irmãos Grimm"" (""The Grimm Brothers"")",The Brothers Grimm
5,kosmasp,Terry light,6,2 April 2007,"After I watched this movie I was left unsatisfied. It wasn't that I didn't like the movie at all, but I was just expecting more. After all this is a Terry Gilliam picture ... and then one arguably about the most known brothers in writing history ...Grimm fairy tales have been made into movies mostly from Walt Disney. They were obviously made for children. Terry Gilliam wouldn't go for that, he would try to stay true to the (darker) original.That's what he did, but he clashed more than a few times with his producers. I don't recall all the details, you can read that somewhere else, but the Weinsteins did cut the budget. The sets are still good, but imagine what they could have looked like if Terry would have been granted to do his original vision.It's a shame, but still a better movie than some other directors would've made out of it!",The Brothers Grimm
6,classicsoncall,"""There is definitely money to be made in witches"".",5,4 September 2011,"Saturday evenings have turned into family movie night at our house, and ""The Brothers Grimm"" wound up at the top of the pile last night. Starting out reasonably enough, it looked like this was going to be a different kind of take on the traditional fairy tales of my childhood. It wasn't long however before my wife and daughter and I began looking at each other and asking if anyone was bored yet. Hoping against hope, we stuck with it, even past the part (can't even remember what it was) where it looked like the movie was over. I'm not going to torture myself anymore by trying to write a review here, as this will be the shortest one I've ever posted on the IMDb. In the words of my daughter about half way through the flick - 'This movie's so gay'.",The Brothers Grimm
7,gavin6942,Alright,6,6 March 2015,"Will and Jake Grimm are traveling con-artists who encounter a genuine fairy-tale curse which requires true courage instead of their usual bogus exorcisms.The best casting? Peter Stormare as Mercurio Cavaldi, Delatombe's Italian associate who originally has a grudge against the brothers, but eventually has a change of heart. Robin Williams was cast in the role before dropping out. Now, Williams has a history with Terry Gilliam and they work well together, but Peter Stormare is hard to beat. He excels at this part, just like he does with all parts.Roger Ebert called the film ""an invention without pattern, chasing itself around the screen without finding a plot. The movie seems like a style in search of a purpose, with a story we might not care about."" This is an interesting phrasing, and probably not far off the mark. Indeed, the visual aspect of the film is very appealing, but we are given very few reasons to care about the characters and their exploits.",The Brothers Grimm
8,jboothmillard,The Brothers Grimm,3,15 January 2012,"From director Terry Gilliam (Brazil, The Fisher King, Twelve Monkeys), at the time of release from the clips I had seen I could tell this wasn't going to be anything that would get critics excited, I watched to see what I would think. Basically the Brothers Grimm, Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jacob (Heath Ledger), are a pair of cons who trick people into paying money to get rid of their fake ghosts or witches haunting them, and they travel around Germany doing this. However when people believe that they really can get rid of these demons and monsters, they hire them to get rid of possibly real ones, only to be arrested for their crime of fraud by the French army, led by General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce). He lets them go on the deal that they do rid the villagers of these strange occurrences, including young girls, one wearing a red riding hood, kidnapped and taken into the woods, and a brother and sister following a trail and disappearing. As time goes by, and joined by a female companion, they realise that these creatures are indeed real and create threat towards innocent people, but in the end of course they are defeated, and the Wilhelm and Jacob go on to write great fairy tales based on their experiences. Also starring Monica Bellucci as Mirror Queen, Lena Headey as Angelika, Peter Stormare as Cavaldi, Mackenzie Crook as Hidlick, Richard Ridings as Bunst, Alena Jakobova as Red Hooded Girl, Martin Svetlik as Hans and Denisa Vokurkova as Greta. Damon and Ledger do alright with their English accents and good looks, you can recognise the moments from the real brothers' most famous fairy tales, such as The Frog Prince, Rapunzel, Hansel and Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood and Sleeping Beauty, and the special effects for the creatures and action seem fine, but that it is all you can say really, it is a pretty pointless and silly film otherwise, a disappointing period fantasy adventure. Adequate!",The Brothers Grimm
9,ma-cortes,"Spectacular fairy tale filled with action , adventure and fantasy ; being efficiently directed by Terry Gilliam",7,26 December 2012,"This is a fantastic flick revolving around the legendary German brothers Will (Matt Damon , Johnny Depp was originally set to star this character) including references to fairy tales (most recorded by the Grimms).

At a village to protect townsfolk are guided by the stranger villager named Angelika (Lena Headey , Nikole Kidman cast originally) they find a genuine fairy-tale curse in an enchanted forest with real magical beings .This is an imaginative , glamorous , chaotic fantasy based on the haunted journeys carried out by Brothers Grimm , though a little bit paced in fits and starts . Marvelous special effects are visually stunning and magnificently realized with computer generator . Slick narrative but sometimes confused , proceeded in a nimble pace . A lot of references to fairy tales are slightly different from the actual stories : Little Red Riding Hood is referenced only by her red cape, the heroic woodsman from ""Little Red Riding Hood"" is an evil henchman, the Big Bad Wolf is a large wolf instead of a diabolical personification, Rapunzel is an evil queen who locks herself in a tower to escape a plague, the Gingerbread Man is an incarnation of a mud monster, Jack from Jack and The Beanstalk becomes Jake, ""Hans"" and ""Greta"" are the original forms of the diminutives ""Hänsel and Gretel"" , Cinderella is really the Grimm Brothers as they scrub the floors , the evil queen is also the queen from Snow White, all the girls' fingers are pricked as they fall into a deep sleep just like Sleeping Beauty, the Woodsman places slippers on Sasha's feet as he prepares her for the crypt, and Jake tells everyone a story of an imp whose name they had to guess, a clear reference to Rumpelstiltskin . And the Mirror Queen using the blood of young girls to restore her youth is based on the legend surrounding Countess Elizabeth Bathory, one of the first serial killers . Starring a considerable cast of top-names performers as Matt Damon , Heath Ledger , Lena Headey , Monica Bellucci , Jonathan Pryce and Peter Stormare . Impressive sets and breathtaking production design , being filmed on location in Prague , Ledec and Sázavou, Czech Republic . This big-budgeted , appreciated film was a success at the box office . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by excellent director of photography Newton Thomas Sigel . Thrilling and evocative musical score by Dario Marinelli , though Goran Bregovic was Terry Gilliam's original choice for composer , when Gilliam decided to go with a more traditional score, Bregovic was replaced . The motion picture was imaginatively directed by Terry Gilliam , an expert on wonderful , surreal atmospheres such as Baron Munchausen , Twelve monkeys , Time bandits , Brazil , Fisher king , Jabberwocky and Heath Leger's last film : Doctor Parnasus .

10,moonspinner55,Not the fairest one of all...though with some marvelous compensations,6,22 March 2007,"Squabbling brothers in France-occupied Germany circa 1811 have manufactured a heroic image for themselves as witch-hunters and tall-tale tellers, but when a decrepit witch in an enchanted forest begins stealing maidens for their youthful blood, the duo find themselves up against real evil for the first time. Terry Gilliam-directed fantasy has incredible production values, cinematography and scoring (not to mention two appealing lead performances by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger), yet it takes a good hour to get this picture off the ground. The narrative is heavy-going and, while not a hodgepodge, the film could certainly use a bit more heart and soul rather than CGI effects. Gilliam's handling takes on a more robust, old-fashioned flavor in the second hour, and the movie improves tremendously as a result. The witch's palace (set atop a skyscraper tree) is dazzling, and the initial entrance into her raven-laden lair is deliciously giddy. Jonathan Pryce is well-cast as an evil general who attempts to torch the two men in an impressive forest fire, however the charm of the piece (and the glue holding the adventure together) lies with Damon and Ledger, and they are by turns wily, funny, strapping, childish, and heroic. **1/2 from ****",The Brothers Grimm
11,Quinoa1984,"Even with his biggest Hollywood budget yet, this is Gilliam through and through...",8,27 August 2005,"...and this is more for the better than for the worse. Director Terry Gilliam returns to familiar territory with what fans of his come to expect- a madman style of film-making and compositions (with camera movements that are sometimes mind-boggling), a delightfully over-the-top sense of humor with visual gags and performances unhinged, and something that is lacking in most other studio product- exuberance. Gilliam, like other uncompromising artists, doesn't just put up these images and strange sights for nothing at all. It suits the subject matter, which in a sense reverts back to his more lavish productions set in centuries past (i.e. Jabberwocky, Baron Munchausen), and brings fairy tales, both bright and very dark, to life. He understands as much how to use a conventional narrative as he does to try and subvert it. This, of course, means that this film won't be for everyone.Some may go to see the film for its stars, Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. I've always liked Matt Damon as an actor, even in lessor films he has a presence that prevails. Gilliam, casting against 'type' as he's said in interviews, has made Damon more of the headstrong and grounded one, while Ledger is more creative, and soon believing the dark fairy tales that come to life in the film. One might wonder if they, and other well-cast players like Lena Headly as the brave heroine, Peter Stormare as the kooky French officer (a call back to Cleese in Holy Grail, one might think, yes and no), and Jonathan Pryce as the main villain, might be upstaged by the elements around them. There is also a creepy turn from Monica Bellucci as a kind of wicked Queen, who adds a seductive kick to the story (and some much added suspense in the last act). There are many elements that Gilliam uses, and rightfully so they'll catch people off-guard: strange, cursed trees; a interchangeable wolf; a gingerbread boy; a giant castle, the list goes on (and I wouldn't want to spoil it). But the actors have enough ability to match up to the special effects (the computer effects, by the way, are not half-bad, a surprise considering Gilliam's professed dislike of CGI), and the script, although sometimes over-the-map, is coherent in the scrambled, fairy tale sense.Another thing I expected was the critical response; pretty much all of Gilliam's films (maybe excluding the Python ones) have been met with mixed reviews, who's main complaints are that he loses the sight of the narrative and the story while indulging with his visual ambitions and wild characterizations. This is not entirely un-true; there were a couple of times I wondered if Gilliam, like some conductor on a train, might derail off the line. But even for people who will go see the film not based on Gilliam at all (who is, being a maverick, not as well-known as a Spielberg or Scorsese), it isn't a lost cause. Also, I realized as I left the theater that it might have appealed to me even more as a child; there is something about fantasy adventures that don't take the usual routes with the visual aspects and the characters that had me hooked as a kid, wanting something to spur on my imagination. The adults, too, may feel this connection past the sillier parts of the film. It uses its triumphant production design, intricately detailed costumes, and artifice to get past anything really expectable (not that there aren't some typical elements). And beneath all of the big sets and costumes and weirdly funny moments and sights, there is heart behind it, which is another reason it could appeal to kids (maybe not young kids, some of the 'ickier' things may frighten them to death). In other words, leave your expectations at the door, and you might have a fun ride. Some may just not; in a way this is a hard film to recommend to some, and easier to others. One thing is for sure (and this is directed to other comments people have made on this site), it is no Van Helsing. Like all of Gilliam's films, you'll either like it or not. It's not a great film, but as a Saturday matinée comedy/adventure in the ""old-school"" sense it gives you well what you pay for. (strong) B+",The Brothers Grimm
12,wes-connors,Money trumps Imagination,5,13 July 2009,"Terry Gilliam's ""The Brothers Grimm"" is almost exclusively a special effects movie, with popular young leading men Matt Damon (as Wilhelm ""Will"" Grimm) and Heath Ledger (as Jacob ""Jake"" Grimm) playing the everlasting authors as a couple of early nineteenth century ""Ghostbusters"". The opening effect, involving the exorcism of a witch, establishes this fact promisingly; but, the storyline makes no further advancement. It plays more like a series of special effects than a movie. You can spot various ""Fairy Tales"" throughout the picture. ""The Gingerbread Man"" sequence, featuring Laura Greenwood (as Sasha), is a definite highlight and should have been more properly resolved - hopefully, ""Sasha"" lived happily ever after.***** The Brothers Grimm (8/26/05) Terry Gilliam ~ Matt Damon, Heath Ledger, Lena Headey",The Brothers Grimm
13,Coventry,Fairy-tale extravaganza!,7,10 October 2005,"Negative reviews and constant newsflashes about production difficulties led me to anticipate Terry Guilliam's ""The Brothers Grimm"" with caution, but in my heart, I never really doubted that I would love his movie about the two 18th century brothers, traveling from village to village offering their services as ghost busters. Their conceiving modus operandi involves raising fear among the superstitious inhabitants of random little towns, and then solving the terror with fake exorcisms and sorcery. The joke's on them when they're called to a town where there's really something supernatural going on! Young girls vanish in the nearby forest and it looks like an ancient witch is preparing her resurrection. ""The Brothers Grimm"" by no means is a great film, but it's definitely entertaining and it has both spirited acting performances and overall good visual effects. The best element is to see how all the different Grimm fairy-tales (The Gingerbread Man, Hansel & Gretel) are interweaving. Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger) supposedly writes down every adventure, and these notes would eventually become the famous Grimm fairy-tales. Apart from maybe Tim Burton, Terry Guilliam is the only director capable of delivering a fantasy-adventure like this and therefore he's still one of the most creative storytellers of all times. ""The Brothers Grimm"" is a charming and cheerful film, definitely recommended for all audiences. Some of the digital effects are really brilliant (the walking trees, the forest-fire) whereas others appear very fake (the man-wolf transformation). Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are both in great shape as the leads, but the supportive cast deserves mentioning as well. More particularly Peter Stormare (in another deliciously over-the-top performance), Lena Heady and the  of course  the ravishing Monica Belluci. Perhaps it's not as great as I hoped, but an average Terry Guilliam achievement still outshines most other movies that are getting released. Recommended for sure!",The Brothers Grimm

15,sunwarrior13,Great Visuals And Nothing More,6,8 November 2011,"The Brothers Grimm is a fantasy adventure film directed by Terry Gilliam.

However, the brothers eventually encounter a genuine fairy tale curse which requires real courage instead of their usual bogus exorcisms.The film also stars Peter Stormare, Lena Headey, Jonathan Pryce, and Monica Bellucci.The Brothers Grimm tells a story of two men who have made a career out of spinning remarkable stories.They suddenly find themselves bringing them to life in this inventive fantasy inspired by the creators of some of the world's best-loved fairy tales.

16,jotix100,Mirror mirror on the wall........,7,22 September 2005,"Terry Gillian is a man that doesn't mix words. We read how yesterday he called ""stupid"" to the fans that were deserting the screening of his latest film, ""Tideland"", at the San Sebastian film festival in Spain. It's notorious the director had his problems while making this film and feuded with the Weinstein brothers, and it shows. The film was released at the end of the summer without any fanfare to fend for itself, or so it appears.In ""The Brothers Grimm"", Terry Gillian takes us to the time where the Grimm brothers, Wilhem and Jacob, were roaming the land in search of their stories. Actually, the film doesn't even pretend to be faithful to any of the well known fairy tales we know so well, they have been passed from generation to generation, and are well regarded and admired.Mr. Gillian relies on a lot of special effects that at times work, and at others don't. The best, in our humble opinion, is about the Queen that was better known in the ""Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs"" story, who is obsessed in maintaining her beauty by checking herself in the mirror that always was king to her. We watch in disbelief when the mirror finally breaks and the mighty queen is reduced to smithereens.Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are seen as the brothers Grimm. The best thing in the film is Peter Stormare, who as Cavaldi practically steals the picture from the better known and probably highly paid stars. Monica Belucci makes an excellent and gorgeous queen. Lena Headey plays the beautiful Angelika and Jonathan Pryce is the cruel Delatombe.",The Brothers Grimm
17,preppy-3,"Offputting and very strange,,,but I liked it",8,3 September 2005,"Fictional tale of the real life Brothers Grimm who wrote plenty of fairy tales. Will (Matt Damon) and Jake (Heath Ledger) Grimm play charlatans in this. They travel from village to village in 19th century Germany staging fake hauntings and (for a sizable amount) get rid of the ghosts. However they soon find themselves face to face in a real fantasy involving an evil queen (Monica Bellucci) and helped by strong, hearty Angelica (Lena Hendey).VERY odd movie that I didn't want to see--every single critical review of this was negative. I was dragged to it by a friend. I can see why critics don't like this--there are no likable characters; the humor is VERY black; children are constantly being attacked and (in one case) graphically eaten. The story has HUGE gaps in logic (even for a fairy tale), doesn't pull together smoothly and I had more than few questions at the end. STILL I did like it.The special effects are truly incredible--it's worth seeing for those. The acting is good too--Damon (who I never liked) is actually not bad in this movie--if extremely unlikable; Ledger manages to pull out a good performance even buried under bad makeup; Hedey is full of life and very good as a woman who helps them. Only Jonathan Pryce fails--he's VERY annoying and unfunny as a French officer. We're supposed to like him but I hated him VERY much halfway through. Bad accent too.Despite the many faults i got caught up in it. There are constant references to Grimm fairy tales and the visuals are stunning. There's also an incredibly sick, but hysterical, sequence with an adorable kitten. But this is NOT FOR CHILDREN!!! Despite the PG-13 rating I would never take a child to see this. There were children in the audience I saw it with. They weren't too impressed and one told her mother she was scared. This is WAY TOO adult (and violent) for young kids.It's not for every one but I got caught up in it and actually enjoyed it. Again--NOT for kids. I give it an 8.",The Brothers Grimm
18,poolandrews,Looks great but lacks a little magic.,6,28 May 2010,"The Brothers Grimm is set during the early 19th Century in Frech occupied Germany where two brothers Wilhelm (Matt Damon) & Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger) travel from village to village conning the locals out of money by performing exorcisms which are elaborate fakes. Caught by French troops Governor Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce) decides to send the Grimm brothers to the small village of Marberg & investigate reports of missing children along with Lieutenant Cavaldi (Peter Stormare) & some French troops. Once at Malberg the Grimm brothers quickly realise that an evil queen inside a large tower in the middle of the spooky woods is responsible as she needs to sacrifice thirteen children to regain her life & youth & has the help of a Werewolf whom she controls. The Grimm brother find themselves in trouble as they try to defeat the forces of darkness as well convince the French to keep them alive...This English, American & Czech Republic production was co-written & directed by Terry Gilliam & as a dark fantasy based around fairy tales I wanted to like The Brothers Grimm more than I actually did, it looks great & it's a good film but it feels hollow like it's missing something overall. Forget everything factual that we know about the real life Grimm brothers since this turns what were two academic scholars into cartoonish con-men, the script suggests that the things they experience here inspired their fairy tales even though there are references to fairy tales not even written by them but as I said factual integrity wasn't part of Gilliam's remit. As a straight fantasy adventure The Brother Grimm is decent enough, it has it's moments for sure & there's a dark macabre edge to it although the themes of brotherly love & heroism do tire a bit as they are constantly referred to. For every moment like when the horse eats the kid there's one where the Governor sits down to eat a lush meal while watching the forest burn or when the roots & branches of the trees attack there's one like the prolonged climax as one brother tries to save the other or them cleaning the floor dressed as two Cinderella's. At almost two hours long The Brothers Grimm could have been ten or fifteen minutes shorter & Gilliam didn't really seem to know when to end it as I thought the climax went on for too long. The character's are alright but the cartoonish Grimm brothers & the ridiculously over the top Governor Delatombe do lower the film into childish slapstick at times which I didn't like & thought it would have been better as a straight dark fantasy with minimal comic relief.Plagued by production problems the notoriously difficult Weinstein's came on board with the money to make it after MGM pulled out in 2004 & they had constant rows with director Gilliam over the final cut & the entire project was put on hold for six months while Gilliam made Tideland (2005) before he went back & completed The Brothers Grimm. You can see the split, Gilliam obviously wanted a strong fairy tale like fantasy while the Weinstein's wanted a more mainstream friendly adventure & maybe this is a compromise between the two. The CGI computer effects effects vary, some are great while others are rather shabby. Various fairy tales are referenced including Little Red Riding Hood & the Big Bad Wolf, Rapunzel, the Gingerbreadman (in a bizarre seemingly random sequence), Sleeping Beauty, Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Rumpelstiltskin although Gilliam gives them all a slightly different slant here as he twists them into the story.With a rather hefty budget of about $88,000,000 this was filmed in Prague. Original cinematographer Nicola Pecorini was fired by the Weinstein's but The Brothers Grimm still looks good with lush production design & fairy good effects. Nicole Kidman, Anthony Hopkins & Robin Williams were all originally cast in roles but dropped out while Johnny Deep was initially cast as Will Grimm but again dropped out. The acting is alright, neither Damon or Ledger make much impact & are quite forgettable.The Brothers Grimm is a dark fairy tale fantasy that I wish was even darker & did away with all the light comedic touches & moral posing, this could have been great & an imaginative triumph but with studio interference it wasn't to be.

19,Bunuel1976,The Brothers Grimm ***,7,23 February 2006,"A typically elaborate and imaginative undertaking by Terry Gilliam to present, in his idiosyncratic fashion, the perennial German folk-tales - or rather the 'story' behind a few of them; here, though, the tone is decidedly tongue-in-cheek - if appropriately ominous when the situation dictates. As visually striking as one would expect from this director, but characterization (courtesy of scriptwriter Ehren Kruger) is certainly given its due: both Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are surprisingly engaging as the adventurous, tale-spinning brothers; Jonathan Pryce and Peter Stormare make for larger-than-life (if annoyingly hammy) villains; while Lena Headey and Monica Bellucci provide more than mere eye candy. A triumph of production design, make-up (particularly effective is the Witch's 'shattering' demise) and trick work...though the CGI-created werewolf, unfortunately, is an eyesore!",The Brothers Grimm
20,Calicodreamin,"Too much going on, no depth",5,4 October 2019,"This movie had no flow, the scenes were disjointed, the storyline jumped around the whole time. The basic plot was easy enough to understand, but there was too much focus on filler scenes and ancillary characters. The cinematography was actually quite well done, some of the scenery was quite beautiful. The acting was okay, but I don't think they had much to work with. I enjoyed the subtle nods to classic fairytales. But the flow just killed this movie.",The Brothers Grimm
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Should have been so much better,6,30 October 2009,"It's no secret that I'm not really into fantasy or adventure. However, I can imagine that those that are will be disappointed by this. The fact is, this should be a far greater movie. Think about it: A film covering those two genres and helmed by Terry Gilliam(whose creativity is one of the high notes of this), one of the most unrestrained(when he is allowed to be, which I'm not sure he was here) imaginations anywhere near Hollywood, responsible for many of the bizarre and/or grotesque sights that American cinema has seen in the last couple of decades. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it did. The production values are fine, not the best ever seen. FX are fairly well-done. The comedy has its moments, though the majority of the jokes and gags are standard material. There is a reasonably solid amount of Python madness, if it all lies in characters and dialog, and the overall form is entirely static. The plot doesn't hold up. It should be noted, as those who made this knew, that this is in no way a biographical piece. The numerous references to famous fairy tales will be either obnoxious or charming, depending on your disposition towards them, and/or references to them. You probably already know the plot. The brothers scam people. Then they have to investigate something, they team up with TV's Sarah Connor(she does just enjoy playing women who exude power and control, doesn't she?), and stuff happens from there. The acting varies, the children are poor(then again, I understand that at least one had to learn enough English to speak the lines, so that helps excuse that). Damon's playing somewhat against type, as is Ledger. Stormare plays a role you'll love or hate him in. The accents are overdone. I'd say that was intentional. This is less zany than you might expect. It is quite gross at times. There is disturbing content, some blood, violence and gore, and language is mild, and on occasion, moderately strong. The DVD contains a great director's commentary that is well worth listening through, two featurettes(a general making-of one, and one focusing on special effects), deleted scenes, and trailers, including one for this. I recommend this only to fans of those who put it together who wish to watch everything they've done, and/or those who aren't too critical. 6/10",The Brothers Grimm
22,view_and_review,A good mild adventure,7,14 February 2007,"The Brothers Grimm was interesting and good. Wilhelm Grimm (Matt Damon) was simply a con artist that set up fake ghosts and other fictional beings to fleece the common folk. He and his brother Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger) would take on the ghosts and poltergeists in exchange for money. Although he helped his brother in the cons, Jacob Grimm really believed in monsters & ghosts and couldn't wait to encounter real ones. It made for a good story, especially when the brothers had to combat a witch and her myriad of creature goons. The movie wasn't too dramatic or too violent. It was a mild adventure more for kids between eight and thirteen.",The Brothers Grimm

Terry Gilliam's under whelming turn on the world-renowned fairy tale storytellers reimagined as myth-busters is ultimately a disappointment in its execution sadly in need to find an appropriate tone (""Shrek""-like comedy? Too dark for its own good attempts? ) And the nowhere to be accounted for lack of chemistry between its two leads as the sibling authors all add up to an extravagantly produced mess.

It regards the dangers of fairy tales as Will and Jacob Grimm are forced to rescue several kidnapped virgin children who have disappeared into the enchanted forest. Screenplay is filled with brilliant imagery as expected from the imagination of director Terry Gilliam whose impressive visual resume includes Brazil and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are well cast as the heroes who earn a living by deceiving towns with false exorcisms. Ledger is the one who believes in fairy tales while Damon has grown beyond his youth years. Peter Stormare is hilarious as their arresting officer who fumbles at his job and is constantly insulted by higher powers who see him as an imbecile but he will conclude with greater perception. Lena Headey plays a gutsy archer with an intriguing back story regarding her father. Jonathan Pryce is amusing as a cruel French military commander who grows weary of Storemare's constant fumbling. Easily one of Gilliam's best films as he references fairy tales with parodies of The Gingerbread Man, Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood and other grim stories.

25,HotToastyRag,On the darker side,6,30 March 2021,"In contrast to the original 1962 hit, the 2005 remake of The Brothers Grimm has a darker take on the story. Instead of charming storytellers, the brothers (played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) are conmen. They have a troupe of actors they take with them from village to village, creating stories of monsters and their havoc. Then, the village pays the brothers to vanquish the monsters and save them from destruction.But what happens when they're actually confronted with monsters and magic? They can't act or bluff their way out of it, so they have to figure out how to defeat a witch, a curse, and other fairy-tale-esque features. Along the way, you'll see lots of clever inclusions of fairy tales, like the big bad wolf, a magic mirror, and a stack of mattresses to support a controlling queen. It would have been even more clever, however, if the screenwriters kept strictly to the Grimm fairy tales, rather than including others. If it's going to be about these fellows, why include Hans Christian Andersen stories?Part scary, part tongue-in-cheek, this isn't really for kids. It's for the adults in the audience who were always fascinated by the darker side of the fairy tales, rather than the shiny princess gowns and quests for true love. I'd prefer the original.",The Brothers Grimm
26,gradyharp,A Silk Purse out of a Sow's Ear? More the Opposite!,4,25 December 2005,"Few complain when writers and directors take a fresh take on an old story: at times the new approach even enhances the original. Sadly, that is not the case with THE BROTHERS GRIMM. Though Terry Gilliam is well recognized as one who makes magic out of old things retold, this time the magic seems to have been concentrated on costumes, weird head pieces, claustrophobic haunted villages, and animated effects. As a result the story is left behind and without a decent script, leaves little for the actors to mold into anything.This telling of the Brothers Grimm is more grim than fantastical. Instead of fairytale writers, these misanthropes are snake oil salesmen out to purge villages of their demons (all a part of show that pays them well). Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are the wily two and try their best to make the story happen. Interspersed in the derring-do are snippets of the fairy tales that came from the imagination of the brothers and they serve as sidebars of some interest, albeit distorted versions, intensely altered versions of Hansen and Greet, Little Red Ridinghood, etc.There is a reason this film took so long to make and ran up high production costs: the production company was trying to make it work and failed. Mildly entertaining but hardly worth the long hours it seems to take to tell it. Grady Harp",The Brothers Grimm
27,The_Void,Fun fantasy flick from Terry Gilliam,7,30 May 2006,"Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm sees the famous storytellers as conmen parading through Europe offering their dubious services to settlements with supernatural problems. However, they don't count on being made to save a town with a real problem... The film blends together many of the famous Brothers' tales, from Little Red Riding Hood to Snow White, and the idea behind this fictional account of their exploits is that the stories they wrote were based on the events depicted in this film. The brothers themselves are played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger, and the pair work together, as well as blending nicely into their respective roles. The central characters are definitely clichéd, with Will being the selfish womaniser of the pair, while the more subdued Jacob is open minded and more down to Earth than his brother. Basing a film on two very famous characters that not much is known about can't be easy, and so it's understandable that the duo follow these sorts of predictable character arcs. Besides that, the characters aren't nearly as important as the atmosphere and style, and that is the movie's main strongpoint.Terry Gilliam has shown his talent for making fantasy films already, with movies like Time Bandits and Brazil, and this film definitely shows that he knows his way around a fantasy flick. The visuals are superb, and while the CGI isn't always brilliant; much of it fits the film nicely, and seeing the forest come alive is great. The Brothers Grimm wasn't exactly met with a warm reception upon release, and that's understandable as the film definitely has its fair share of problems. The screenplay is good in that it manages to pull together several elements from the Brothers' most famous work, but it's not all that well paced. Far too much of it takes place in just one location, and the film really starts to drag towards the end as, given that the story has been sprung from classic fables, it's all rather derivative. Furthermore, the script doesn't find time to develop the characters; and the moments of humour mostly miss the mark. The supporting cast is good, however, with Peter Stormare giving an over the top performance, while actresses Lena Headey and the scintillating Monica Bellucci provide the eye candy. Overall, it's not a good idea to go into this movie expecting anything like Sleepy Hollow. The Brothers Grimm is a stylish and fun movie with some charged performances, but it's nothing like a masterpiece.",The Brothers Grimm
28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Brothers Grimm,6,15 September 2005,"Let me begin by saying that director Terry Gilliam's films are an acquired taste, and usually don't go down well with the average moviegoer, including myself. While films like Twelve Monkeys were easier to grapple with, general audiences may find cult favourites like Brazil and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen less palatable.And the Brothers Grimm however, falls into that less palatable zone. Visually spectacular like the rest of Gilliam's works, the trailer and first fifteen minutes of the film might resemble summer popcorn flick Van Helsing, which fused horror lore and characters into one big budget special effects movie.In this case, and if you don't already know, the Brothers Grimm Wilhelm (played by Matt Damon) and Jacob (played by Heath Ledger, watching my second consecutive film in which he stars) are the creators of famous age old classic fairy tales like Hansel and Grethel and Cinderella (yes, it wasn't Walt Disney). In this telling of their supposed origins, they are actually con-artists who goes around early 19th Century Europe to earn a living from exorcising spirits. As mentioned, the first fifteen minutes was good fun, until the cat was let out of the bag intentionally.As their rouse got exposed, they are blackmailed into investigating and solving some supernatural mystery involving lost female children in an enchanted forest (or so it was believed). Like the saying ""it takes a thief to catch a thief"", the brothers initially thought that whoever it was spooking the forest and its nearby village just had a bigger rag/con budget. Before you can chant ""Rapunzel Rapunzel let down your hair"", they realize that they are up against the Mirror Queen's (Monica Belluci) diabolical plot to bring herself back to life and being young and beautiful again.If you'd think, hey, that's an interesting premise, think again. The movie plods. And that's actually the strange thing. It has arresting visuals to entertain the audience, a credible storyline, good actors, but somehow the pacing felt wrong and it just moves along so incredibly slowly! There is some saving grace, and that's the identification of certain fairy tale characters or references, from Rapunzel to Hensel and Grethel, from Snow White to Cinderella, from Little Red Riding Hood to the Gingerbread Man. But this could distract you from the plot, and the novelty dies after a while, that you just beg to get on with the show.With so many releases this week, you might be better off with one of the other selections. If you really have to watch this, do so on a weekday, and bring along lots of friends to while some of the boring bits away.",The Brothers Grimm
29,siderite,In the spirit of taking good myths and turning them into techno action movies...,7,23 October 2005,"The movie was acceptable for its genre, that genre being action movie + myth + special fx = money. You can easily recognize the type, going from Indiana Jones and Alain Quatermaine movies and ending up with Van Helsing.However, from my point of view, it was a failure. The name Grimm and a few scenes relating to the famous children stories was the only thing that linked this movie with the fairy tales. Therefore, why put it there in the first place? The film is trying to mix horror with light comedy and action with romance. The result is total failure to provide entertainment for anyone with a decent IQ.I found the effects quite good, although there was a fair amount of them only in the end of the movie, and a promising horror atmosphere. If they would have kept this a strict horror thing, it could have been as cool a Sleepy Hollow. But they didn't. Matt Damon, while he wasn't bad, was not the proper casting choice for this movie, while Keith Ledger played the silly scholarly type brother with less hair and glasses. Why would anyone do that? When actors are trying to escape the cast they were molding by casting ( :) ) they find very good movies in which they play complicated roles that proves their worth. This was a bad move for Keith.Conclusion: watch it when you are in no mood for something else and you want light entertainment. The movie is also quite long. Try not to get annoyed by the French bashing or the weird guy that plays the Italian. He did the same role in Armagheddon, no? OK. Have fun.",The Brothers Grimm
30,JamesHitchcock,Stronger in Visual Effects than in Narrative,6,10 November 2005,"Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were eminent German academics who specialised in philology, folklore and history. They are best known today for their collection of folk tales, generally known in English as ""Grimm's Fairy Tales"". According to this film, however, they were also a pair of con-men who travelled around the country performing, in exchange for money, bogus exorcisms of non-existent ghosts, witches and evil spirits. (This is, needless to say, an aspect of their careers that you will not find in any respectable biography). After performing one such exorcism, however, they come to the attention of the French occupiers of Germany. (The film is set during the Napoleonic Wars). The French commander, General Delatombe, suspicious of the Grimm's claims, sends them to investigate the strange happenings in Marbaden, a small village where several young girls have disappeared. Once there, Jake and Will (the anglicised names used in the film) begin to suspect that they may be confronted with genuine supernatural happenings involving an enchanted forest, a huntress named Angelika (who also acts as the film's love interest), a mysterious tower and a witch-like queen who is trying to find the secret of eternal youth.""The Brothers Grimm"" struck me as having much in common with another Terry Gilliam film, ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"". Both are set in the 18th or early 19th century, the so-called ""Age of Reason"". Both are about famous storytellers. Most importantly, both have as their central theme the contrast between reason on the one hand and the imagination on the other. Gilliam's sympathies clearly lie with the imaginative side, because the villains, Horatio Jackson in ""Munchausen"" and Delatombe here, both represent an arid, unimaginative rationalism, whereas Munchausen and the Grimms represent the power of dreams and the imagination. To drive home the point, both Jackson and Delatombe are played by the same actor, Jonathan Pryce.It is, perhaps, not surprising that the heroes of both films are German. During this period of history there was at the heart of European culture a creative tension between the Classical and Romantic movements in the arts, representing respectively the rational and imaginative sides of human nature, but nowhere was this tension more strongly felt than in Germany, the original home of Romanticism. One senses it in the writings of Goethe and Schiller, in the music of Beethoven and in the work of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who as an architect designed chastely Classical buildings and as a painter imagined extravagantly Gothic ones. It is also present in the work of the Grimm brothers themselves, whose academic interests covered not only the imaginative, subjective worlds of myth and folklore but also the objective scientific discipline of philology.Although both ""The Brothers Grimm"" and ""Munchausen"" are based upon works of literature rather than the visual arts, both reveal a creative imagination that is stronger in visual than in narrative terms. Seen as a piece of storytelling, ""The Brothers Grimm"" is not a success. The plot is often over-complex, confusing and difficult to follow. The acting is not particularly distinguished, although Lena Headey makes a striking Angelika and Monica Belucci an even more striking witch-queen. Some attempt is made to differentiate between the brothers, Matt Damon's Jake being the dreamy introvert and Heath Ledger's Will the outgoing, confident Jack-the-lad, but neither is particularly well done. Pryce is not as good here as he was in ""Munchausen"" and Peter Stormare's turn as an eccentric Italian torturer, complete with odd foreign accent, was something that detracted from rather than added to the film.When ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" appeared in 1989, it was derided by the critics as a hugely expensive flop, and ""The Brothers Grimm"" has received a similarly negative critical reception. Yet for all its faults it has one great virtue. Terry Gilliam has, like Tim Burton, a highly developed talent for visual inventiveness, something that is in evidence in most of his movies, including this one. There is throughout a haunting sense of mystery, especially in the scenes set in the enchanted wood. Marbaden, for all the half-timbered houses on display, is no picture-postcard village, but a sinister, foreboding place when seen in gloom or darkness, and even more so when seen in an eerie, misty sunlight. Only at the end, when evil has been defeated, does it seem conventionally picturesque. There are some highly effective scenes, such as the cliffhanger on the roof of the tower or the one where the wicked queen shatters into pieces along with her reflection in a mirror. Although the plot is not based on any of the Grimms' tales, the film has absorbed something of their atmosphere, and there are occasional visual references to some of them, including ""Little Red Riding-Hood"", ""Hansel and Gretel"" and ""The Gingerbread Man"". Despite its initial critical and commercial failure, ""Munchausen"" today retains its own cult following. I suspect that a similar fate awaits ""The Brothers Grimm"". 6/10",The Brothers Grimm
31,StevePulaski,The brothers interesting and the plot muddled,6,29 March 2013,"If there's one picture I'd like to see a remake of, bearing the names of everyone involved and a different plot, it would Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm. There's a functioning film here, beneath the sub-par parts it features, and there is a terrific story that should be told featuring the title characters. The cast is unanimously good, the visuals, as expected, are enchanting and mostly appealing, and Gilliam assumes a confident state behind the camera.Now if only what was happening was of any interest to me. The story, which is surprisingly a challenge to follow, concerns Wilhelm Grimm (Matt Damon) and Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger), a pair of traveling con-men, who scam poor saps in French-occupied Germany circa the late 1700's. Jacob is usually the instigator of these petty crimes, where Wilhelm sort of just abides by everything and attempts to woo all the ladies. When their masks of honor are ripped off by Napoleon's right-hand man Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce), he informs the two men that they can prove their worthiness by discovering why so many children have gone missing in the ominous village of Marbaden. Delatombe sens his trusty torturer Cavaldi (Peter Stormare) to keep a watchful eye on the brothers Grimm so they can come back bearing the good news.What's a fairy tale without a love story, right? Here, it is the adventurous hunter Angelika (Lena Headley), who tries to warn the brothers of the haunted forest in Marbaden, where the children are suspected to have gone missing in. The final main character is Monica Bellucci's The Mirror Queen, who is as beautiful as she is skilled in the dreaded black magic.The Brothers Grimm moves at a pace slower than this. Much slower. It takes about twenty-five minutes before the plot actually gets going, because the film tries to set up character and plot in the way of allowing itself to roam around the village while nothing truly captivating occurs. Oh, well; at least we have some visuals to look at in the mean time. Gilliam has always had a talent for flooding his pictures with impenetrable visual flair, turning even the most collective story into a cacophony of hallucinatory beauty. The film offers a dark blend of twisted fantasy that doesn't come off as murky or dingy as much as I thought it would. It often remains lit by some of the brighter visual pieces (when I say ""brighter,"" I'm talking light green and maybe some red for good measure). Its style mimics that of Gothic intentions, and for that, the film at least merits a small look.The leads are among two of my favorite leading men. Damon and Ledger assume roles both a little out in left field for them, and equally show compassion and fondness for the material. Will's mixture of toughness/male-sensitivity is noticeable and a pleasant inclusion, and Jacob's obsession with con-artistry and ""fooling the other members of the team"" so to speak works well as a contrast. These two characters are actually two I wouldn't mind seeing in another film. They seem to be similar to The Road to El Dorado characters, Miguel and Tulio, as they are both con-artists, whose personalities begin to drift further apart as the film goes on.With that said, the lack of focus in The Brothers Grimm is what makes the boiling pot simmer, and for the last hour, give off nothing but disposable, quickly-evaporating steam. Its visuals are impeccable, with some very nice CGI-work, its leads entertaining to watch, but all of it is encapsulated in a narrative that takes too long to get going and takes its short, sweet time arriving at its conclusion - which I must also say is quite lame. Being that fairy tales are significantly difficult to capture on film, there are no doubt worse pictures than this one. Yet, the opposite can also be said.Starring: Matt Damon, Heath Ledger, Lena Headley, Johnathan Pryce, Peter Stormare, and Monica Bellucci. Directed by: Terry Gilliam.",The Brothers Grimm
32,Rainey-Dawn,An Underrated Fantasy Film,8,22 October 2014,"I personally believe this movie is a bit underrated, criticized harshly and unfairly. The Brothers Grimm is quite entertaining - yes it has flaws but so do many films. It is not a perfect movie but it's a pretty good fantasy adventure.What I did not like about this movie: The Mudd Monster (or whatever it was suppose to be) that was just too much for my taste. And I did not like the literal shattering of the wicked queen witch at the end of the film... the shattering mirror yes, queen no.What I did like about the film: Everything else. The story was fun. The acting is good. But my favorite part is the visuals - it is visually stimulating (costumes, sets, cinematography, and the action).Like others that have reviewed this film: I too was reminded of Pirates of the Caribbean when watched The Brothers Grimm. Hidlick and Bunst reminded me a lot of Pintel and Ragetti. Lena Headey as Angelika is much like Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann. The French Army is reminiscent of The Royal Navy.Interesting enough, the Wiki says that Gilliam's first choice for the role of Will Grimm was Johnny Depp. Which is odd since the movie (BG) reminds me of PotC just a little bit. Brothers Grimm is nothing like Pirates of the Caribbean in any way - just some of the characters reminds me of the PotC in a roundabout way.All in all it's a pretty good fantasy film.8.5/10",The Brothers Grimm

34,KineticSeoul,"Had ""potential"" but...",6,1 March 2013,"This movie had the potential to be great but just became average or below. Terry Gilliam is suppose to be this visionary and imaginative director but his trademark doesn't really show in this movie. It tries to combine a lot of the characters from the Grimm brother's folk tales into this movie. And it felt rushed without much development. In fact it's like one of those ""Kingdom Hearts"" video game. Where they tried to incorporate as many Disney characters as possible without it being all that well incorporated to the plot. So in this it felt like the story was just there to tie the folk tale characters together. At some parts it felt a bit clever but there just wasn't enough wits and development to it. Matt Damon plays Wilhelm Grimm who is the most practical and rational one in the group but a constant prick most of the way through. You know those guys that constantly nag at you for one past mistake. Well that is what he does most of the way through, which is nagging. Even if that mistake can be pretty big. Heath Ledger plays Jacob Grimm is the less practical one between the two and believes in the supernatural occurrences. And to me Jacob is more likable than Wilhelm. And they go around being fake witch hunters to make money from the town's folk. But kids in a certain village starts to disappear and they get forced into a mission to find the missing children by a french general. And the plot takes off from there after they meet a hunts-woman. If the movie was a bit more developed and clever with incorporating the folk tale elements this movie would have been awesome. Or what the brother's conceive to be real or the certain supernatural threat to the town wasn't really supernatural during the big plot twist. It might have worked better than the direction this one goes. Just an idea. Instead it goes in a pretty predictable direction that doesn't have much cool moments. Overall it's a below average movie but not all that bad. And it was kinda nice to go in areas where the Grimm brother's might have gotten there ideas for their stories even if it's fictional. Also Monica Bellucci is in this but she is hardly in the movie. It seemed like a cameo basically.6/10",The Brothers Grimm
35,Buddy-51,low grade Gilliam,5,13 July 2006,"In ""The Brothers Grimm,"" director Terry Gilliam and writer Ehren Kruger envision the famed storytellers as two snake-oil charlatans who roam the early 18th Century German countryside using their fame as writers to convince gullible villagers that they can eradicate evil curses (all for a small fee, of course). Their sleight-of-hand methods, involving ropes and pulleys and a whole host of elaborate disguises and primitive ""special effects,"" eventually count for naught when the boys confront an actual enchanted forest filled with mobile trees, diabolical insects and an evil princess frozen in time waiting for that crucial moment when the usurped lives of twelve young maidens will make her young and beautiful again.Gilliam has always been one of the most reliably imaginative and visually inventive of modern filmmakers, so much so that, even when the films themselves didn't amount to much, we could still find much in them to enjoy and appreciate. Here, however, our hitherto unwavering faith in Gilliam's talent suffers one of its severest trials yet. In many ways, Gilliam desires to have it both ways in this film; he wants to be iconoclastic in his approach by showing these beloved writers as being mere mortals with feet of clay, yet he also wants to make clear that he believes in all the fantastical elements of the tales by essentially creating one of his own with the Grimm brothers themselves placed front and center as key players. That might have worked had Gilliam been able to keep his narrative elements in sharper focus. Too much of the film feels subdued, rambling and disjointed, and although Matt Damon and a fidgety, hyper kinetic Heath Ledger seem to be having a great deal of fun in their roles, they are never able to break through all the nonsense and connect with the audience as characters about whom we can deeply care. There's some fun to be had in the conflict that develops between the cynical, pragmatic Damon, representing our modern times, I suppose, and the more fanciful Ledger, who clearly reflects the more imaginative time in which the story takes place, but that theme basically gets lost amid all the confused silliness and special effects-laden overproduction.Thus, despite all the talent involved, ""The Brothers Grimm"" turns out to be an empty, joyless, soulless film, a poor tribute both to the fairy tales it endeavors to honor as well as to the men who wrote them.",The Brothers Grimm

None of the deaths are violent and there's no blood, but it seemed like a lot of deaths not to be R.But the big mistake is attempting to turn this into a comedy, which it wasn't. At first, this seems like a mystery that two brothers are going to solve, then they start throwing jokes in. A few are funny, but most fall flat. Then the story goes back to serious then back to silly, with the Italian.And sound editing was bad. I had to watch this with closed caption to even get the plot.

The struggles during the first half of the movie in searching for the balance of Terry Gilliam and an evolving theme. The Gilliam idioms abound in this movie, some that capture the essence of the dark and dank fairy tale tradition and others that seem more distracting and out of place - an unnecessary trademark. Qualitatively, overall, the drama along with the good dose of humor out of Matt Damon and the more honorable Heath Ledger bring a salty and entertaining fairy tale to life. There is good heart in this movie, there is a rich, delicious visual and grimy appearance that suits the movie. Yet the soft landing ending, the lack of struggle between good and evil within a person, weighs heavily while the self-sacrifice, the harsh delivery of meanness along with the light-hearted humor makes this somewhat uneven movie nevertheless enjoyable and an above average movie that brings new meaning to fairy tales.

38,Dr_Coulardeau,Funny and slightly frightening,8,21 September 2013,"A very funny film which is nothing but a patchwork of Grimm characters and Grimm fairy tales, all mixed up and all crisscrossed together with some unavoidable details or situations, though there is no kissing of frogs, yet a little bit of licking a toad, and of course the kissing of a princess who is a witch and yet a princess and finally the kissing of a Grimm brother by the witch princess, or is it Veronica, and all that works.Nature is totally crazy with walking trees, burning forests and magic towers in the middle of a bewitched country. The Grimm Brothers are nothing but perambulating crooks that make believe they can kill or capture witches and other wizards and free villages of all the bad demons they can imagine. There are so many suckers in this world that the Grimm brothers or their modern equivalents can make a fortune and at the same time have great fun. Walt Disney or Miramax are the least offensive ones among those.But nothing is simple in Germany in 1811 under the occupation of Napoleon's troops. The frogs are no longer the jumping neobatrachias we enjoy in ponds and other lakes, but these strange human beings wearing tricolor feathers on their heads and advocating the non existence of fairies, witches and other supernatural beings inhabiting the minds of superstitious simple minded people. They are not afraid of what does not exist though they are ready to fight a real battle against that haunted forest.The Frenchies have also brought with them snails and they use them to torture good Germans who cannot stand snails of course, whereas Frenchies are eating them, generally cooked in some tomato stew. There are all kinds of tastes in this world but Frenchies sure have the most surprising – and disgusting – ones. Entertaining and never really humdrum because of the innumerable distortions performed on the tales we know they introduce at every single moment of the story. And they destroy the witch who believes she is the most beautiful girl in the world since her mirror is telling her so with the typical action dictated by the simple logic of a child: break her mirror and she will be shattered into smithereens.And then they can be happy finally like good boys and good girls and we will not speak of the children they will make because after all we are working for a family audience and in a world where marriage is for everyone and not only for those who can collect little babies in lilies or whatever other flower or accept babies delivered to them by some storks. Let the others adopt some orphans.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",The Brothers Grimm
39,Floated2,Confusing and joyless,3,8 September 2018,"The Brothers Grimm is quite a fairy tale fantasy film set in the 1700's. Having no knowledge of the source material, the film doesn't do too much justice as it was quite confusing and boring all around. The film's premise is promising. The film isn't about the real Brothers Grimm; it's a fairy tale within a fairy tale set during the early Enlightenment, when superstition and mythology still ran rampant. All together the film has decent visuals but the story is lacking and not in the least engaging enough.",The Brothers Grimm
40,johnnyboyz,Gilliam tries his hand at a period drama/psychological horror but falls short.,5,9 April 2007,"With Terry Gilliam, we've come to expect the odd, the outrageous, the unpredictable, the quirkiness of it all. He delivered with Brazil in 1985 and he also delivered with Twelve Monkeys in 1995. In 2005; Terry Gilliam delivered again with The Brothers Grimm but it was an entirely different delivery to that of the other two.Looking back, I think The Brothers Grimm was meant to be a comedy. That said, I only laughed once or twice which does sort of scupper my thought but I also think it tried desperately to break away from the comedies of our time such as the 'teen' comedy and the 'film spoof' comedy (ala. Scary/Epic Movie) and that it achieved; in fact the humour, albeit unfunny, was a breath of fresh air. It was like watching a live action version of a Shrek film. The Grimm brothers from the title are: Wilhelm (Damon) and Jacob (Ledger) and they act as the Shrek/Donkey partnership in an oddly familiar way. We have Wilhelm who acts as the leader and is the smarter of the two  he likes to get on with the job and has a relatively short fuse. Then we have Jacob whom acts like someone half his age, relying on getting into mischief to provide the laughs in his life.What this film relies on to get us to laugh is humour only Gilliam can really deliver and tempt us to chuckle with. Brazil was dark and disturbing at times but was also funny whilst Monty Python was out and out farce that worked reasonably well. Here, having people hanging upside down, whilst lowering them into some sort of lava pit and having snails crawling all over their faces whilst at the same time, having it done to them by Frenchmen acts as a typical example of the film's humour on display. It's bizarre and yes it's dark but it's not doing much for me.What it also relies on in its opening thirty minutes or so is various spoofs of fairy stories. Hansel and Gretel and Little Red Riding Hood both get the treatment as we see them swallowed up by some sort of CGI tree. The link here is that all three of them lived in a nearby town. We even get to see their parents later on. Funny, I always thought Hansel and Gretel's parents ditched them in the forest and now; they want them back. Maybe I'm getting my fairy stories muddled up.The film relies heavily on its mise-en-scene. Period costume, dark lighting when in the densely treed forest and wooden houses complete with other authentic things you'd find in towns and villages back then: (wells, stables, thatched roofs, etc.). It also makes a bit of a mistake in having most of the characters spend most of their time complaining to one another and sucking up to those whom are of a higher 'rank' than them. Jonathan Pryce's French general 'Delatombe' is the boss of the film and you get the feeling nothing goes without him first giving the word. I felt this not only anchored the film down, but slowed the story overall.You do feel throughout that only Terry Gilliam could get away with something like this. It's bold but it's bleak; it's dark but it's funny; it's bad but you know there is some good in here somewhere if you give it your full attention. Gilliam managed to blend all these things together in Brazil and Twelve Monkeys, giving it a Sci-fi. twinge to round it all off and keep it relatively light-hearted. In The Brothers Grimm, he fails to do that.",The Brothers Grimm
41,filipemanuelneto,"A good oportunity, missed.",5,20 March 2018,"This film is based on the tales of the Grimm Brothers, but also makes a completely fictional portrayal of the brothers who, in real life, were German poets, scholars and linguists, who dedicated themselves to collecting traditional fables from the center of Europe. So the first step in understanding the film is to realize, from the outset, that its pure fiction, based on the mere existence of these two brothers. Here, they're two gamblers, who make money cheating the villagers, casting out witches and demons that don't exist. So their first reaction, when they're called upon to investigate a truly magical phenomenon in which several girls have disappeared, is of disbelief, thinking that they're dealing with an elaborate scold.The screenplay is clever, in the way it approaches Grimm's fairy tales and rebuilds them, but it lost from the middle, with some ideas and options looking absurd. Equally positive was the performance of Matt Damon and Heath Ledger in the lead roles. The two actors are versatile, strong and worked well together. However, the same cannot be said of Lena Headey, who seemed to me a bit artificial and cliché. Peter Stormare is the most humorous actor and the most remarkable moments of humor are made by his character, an Italian torturer at the service of Napoleonic officials. Jonathan Pryce is the French general and was perfectly capable of becoming contemptible. Good costumes and sets, clever cinematography, good use of colors and light and shadow games make the film visually appealing and beautiful.So, this movie is good and has several quality values. But the flaws in the story, the several moments when the plot is lost and becomes idiotic, overturn the attempts of this film to become truly iconic.",The Brothers Grimm
42,leplatypus,Twelve (tediously) missing girls (rental),4,1 December 2013,"For now, i use my credits to complete filmography of my Pantheon. The first honored is Lena Headey, whom i discovered as the courageous Queen Gorgo. She has the delicious British phlegm and yet there's something mysterious, wild about her. So, she was a perfect choice to play this cursed huntress in that small village. With her, Ledger proves that he was indeed a great one too, as it's hard to recognize this brother, with the Joker or Mel's son in ""the patriot"". Beyond those two, my bad expectations have been confirmed: Damon still can't play a likable character and Bellucci is again playing on her looks! If the plot is original (to derive those fairy tales to from real fantasy or to fake them to make a living) and if Gilliam is gifted with a camera, the movie stills falls short: First, the French roles are totally irritating and slows the movie. They were like the parrot Iago in ""Aladdin"", funny for five minutes and excruciating for more. Another big problem was that the sets look totally fake: unlike ""Sleepy Hollow"", i didn't believe for one second in this village, its forest or its enchanted tower. It was the same feeling with some key-moments (the rock that breaks the mirror: what a shot!) and i must admit that Gilian's love for baroque is sometimes too much. Finally, once upon a time there was a great filmmaker but at the end, he didn't have so much amazing movies!",The Brothers Grimm
43,BaronBl00d,Where's Hans Christian Anderson When You Need Him?,5,28 December 2005,"Set in 1811 in Germany under Napoleonic rule, it seems that a forest has been kidnapping young girls. To the rescue are the Brothers Grimm, a pair of con-men that ride all over Germany to exploit the supernatural beliefs of peasant villages for profit. The supernatural background here though is no hoax and these two brothers, coerced by the French, must act to save the village and their own lives. Well, let me first start out saying that I am normally a huge fan of director Terry Gilliam. I adore Brazil. This; however, is not one of his best. It looks fantastic. It has some great sets, costumes, and even adequate acting, but it really misses the mark of a good film. Why? I am not sure other than the script is just not that good. The story is pure fantasy about a couple of brothers known for writing children's tales not for being adventurers or even con-men. Why call it the Brothers Grimm? They were that in name only. Matt Damon, a mediocre talent at best, and Heath Ledger play the two siblings with gusto - and it is needed to make any of this work. The cast also has a gutsy, funny performance by Peter Stomare and Jonathan Pryce giving yet another fine turn this time as a French general. Aside from watching Pryce and seeing some of the dazzling technical shots used by Gilliam, I found myself bored throughout much of this. It isn't a bad movie nor is it really any good either. Maybe, the film will take on a life of its own in later years despite its virtual death at the box office. If it does, it will because of Gilliam's hand at direction. I loved the way he visualized much of the forest, the huge tower, and some of the quirky scenes pertaining to a mirror. But the story just isn't up to his usually par.",The Brothers Grimm
44,digitalbeachbum,"Good casting, sub par story",2,12 April 2020,"It was OK to watch once, but the story is really lacking in any sort of moral lesson and it lacks Terry Gilliam's touch.The ending is flat, another self sacrifice scene, which does not serve a purpose other than to promote the desire of some studio suit. Action, special effects and big name stars are all that's found in this empty shell of a movie.I like Terry Gilliam, but this doesn't seem like a Terry Gilliam movie. It lacks his special touches of the surreal which would have really made this a great movie. I can tell that there was some one behind him pulling the strings and forcing him to do things their way rather than the Terry Gilliam way.Matt Damon and Heath Ledger work well together and I thought they make a good ""Brothers Grimm"" but again, because the story is flat and boring their talents are lost in a quagmire of stupidity from people who do not know how to make movies.Studios should level geniuses like Gilliam alone to work their magic. What a shame, such a lost opportunity.",The Brothers Grimm
45,funkyfry,"Well, I'm glad this movie exists....",7,18 August 2008,"Met by the public with indifference or confusion, Gilliam's biggest budget movie since ""Twelve Monkeys"" deserves a second or third chance just based on the quality of his career of work. And each time I see the film, I understand it better and appreciate it more. This film reminds me of ""Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" in the contrasts between the ornate palace settings and the mucky village that wouldn't itself look out of place in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" or ""Jabberwocky."" It's really fun to see Gilliam working in that medieval milieu again.What really works for me in the movie is the two lead performances by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. I think their rapport together (I hesitate to say chemistry since that has romantic connotations) is just excellent, almost in a way that harms the movie because they seem indistinct from each other. They truly feel like brothers, it seems when you're watching them that they have been together for years. It's unfortunate we'll never see them in a film together again. As for the late Mr. Ledger, this was the first film I saw him in and it was very strange watching it this most recent time and knowing that he's gone. It was also hard to believe this was the same actor I saw earlier this summer in ""Dark Knight"" -- he really disappeared into both of these roles. I found myself studying his face at times thinking, ""is that really Heath Ledger?"" That's an incredible performance for you. In some ways it reminds me of Johnny Depp in ""Fear and Loathing"" and Brad Pitt in ""Twelve Monkeys"".I also really enjoyed the pure fantasy sequences like the ""Hans and Greta"" bit and Little Red Riding Hood. The imagery is like something directly out of a dream/nightmare, and nobody can do it quite the way Gilliam does.I think this movie actually would have been better with a few of the deleted scenes put back in. The motivation of Cavaldi (Peter Stormare) ended up being unclear, while some of those deleted scenes made his superstitious nature more prominent. When I first saw the movie I didn't understand why he refused to kill the brothers in the woods, but I think a couple of those scenes would have made it work. The dynamic between Cavaldi and Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce) just wasn't as funny as Gilliam seems to think it is, not for me anyway. And the fact that they were used so often for comic relief seemed to rob the film of a viable villain, since we see so little of Monica Bellucci's impressive Queen.The movie holds together better than it should -- Gilliam is often criticized for not being able to focus, but I think in this case he did a lot better by the screenplay than it probably deserved on its own merits. There are too many underdeveloped elements in the script, particularly between the brothers and Angelika (Lena Headey). The whole bit about the ""magic beans"" flew past me on the first viewing as well -- I think there's a problem with the script's lack of emphasis on certain points, and certainly Gilliam didn't do much to try to remedy that because he likes the chaos.One final note -- there's a bit of a preview of ""Tideland"" here, in some similarities between Angelika and the character of Dell in that film. Notice the introduction of Angelika, ripping an animal carcass open. In her dress and mannerisms, she's like a younger sexy version of Dell. Always interesting to look back at Gilliam movies and see how he's pursuing a line of creativity from one film to the next.",The Brothers Grimm
46,jzappa,The Best Word I Can Use Is Fine,6,21 August 2007,"Really, the component that carries The Brothers Grimm is only the ironic casting of Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as the title duo. Having nothing at all to do with typecasting, one would expect Damon to play the airy, eccentric, naive younger brother and Ledger to play the domineering, tougher, stern and wary older one. Terry Gilliam cleverly casts them vice versa. It's the most interesting thing to watch in this film, and both actors impress here with a level of forthright versatility rarely seen in films nowadays than they do in films they've made that are several times better. They are very convincingly the opposite of their look and niche as a duo.The film held me tightly enough early on when it depicts intricate technical virtuosity in an elaborate confidence scheme in the medieval times. There's something else that it takes a level of imagination that's rare in films nowadays. But you know what? I didn't care. The film was simply too lightweight. Aside from my personal lack of interest in fantasy, the medieval times, wounded horses that look like it couldn't have been done in a fake manor, three things this film has, the story has enough token female characters to last the next twenty years in the James Bond franchise, a normal and formulaic path for which a potentially imaginative script to follow, and not enough Terry Gilliam flare.",The Brothers Grimm
47,FiendishDramaturgy,"Fine Adventure, Fun Fantasy, But Too Dark For The Kids.",9,3 March 2006,"I have to begin this review by letting you know right off that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I haven't adored everything Terry Gilliam has done, but I don't hate his style, either. Rather, I judge each movie by its own merits.This work is adventurous, exciting, and story-driven. Most would probably consider this work action-driven, but I find there IS a good solid story behind the action. It has moments of suspense, breath-taking imagery, and stylized humor. It is a great movie.A great movie, which has obvious flaws. Regardless of how much I enjoyed this movie, there was one element which nagged at me the whole time I was viewing this work. Mind you, I have not seen this on DVD, so I am unaware if they have created the DVD ""fix"" for this yet, or not. I could not help but notice, in several places, the editing seemed stiff. I am fervently hoping that this came from a paring down of those scenes. If such is the case, then I am also (just as fervently) hoping they give us (the US & Canada) a Region 1, 2-disk Director's Cut with those scenes edited BACK IN! I hate it when they include the deleted scenes outside the movie. Put those back where they belong!On the flip side...With the release of Underworld in 2003, the sub-sub-genre of Action/Horror has taken a turn at the box office. Just as, ""The Worst Witch,"" revived the interest in Magick and fantasy, and generated an audience for the later, ""Harry Potter,"" series, so did, ""Underworld,"" revive the Horror genre and the appreciation for the blending of Horror and Action. This work, ""The Brothers Grimm,"" as an Action/Horror, does not foot the bill. There is too little Horror and the action is sometimes a bit subdued. There are places where CGI and/or choreography is obvious thereby breaking the Spell so competently woven by the story and virtue of the characters. However, it IS too dark for the kiddies, and still quite enjoyable.I was not disappointed, but I was not elated over the final product, either. Here's hoping for a GOOD ""fix"" (and a timely release) of the 2-disk Region 1 Director's Cut DVD release.It rates an 8.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Brothers Grimm
48,elshikh4,Why This Movie Flopped ?,8,14 March 2010,"This is not a wonder-struck question. No, it's a question that I think I have its answers.First off, despite some major problems, I loved this movie. It's reviving and enjoyable. For all the time, it has astounding surprises, flying things on the screen, and unstoppable motion. Simply it's one magnificent pandemonium. I loved how the script didn't relay on the old stories to show some of them; instead, it ""recreated"" them, perhaps as what the authentic Grimm brothers did with the folk stories, through mixing and changing the characters, to make another new story where the world of Grimm meets the world of Gilliam fascinatingly. ""This is our story now"" as one of the characters said. But that surely can't suit all the parties; which leads us to the first in some problems that this movie suffers. The problems that could cause the $37,916,267 gross out of the $88,000,000 budget!It is in the changing of the events, or the characters, sometime for the opposite; like how the saver woodsman from ""Little Red Riding Hood"" turned into a vicious bewitched minion, Rapunzel the imprisoned princess in a tower turned into an evil 500-year-old queen.. going on and on. That shocked some of the lovers of the original stories (not me though). Let alone that many of the adult Gilliam moments made the whole thing not suitable for kids (Now I'm talking about me!). There was some violence and disgusting moments that include slaughtering a cat, sloughing off a bat, or cutting off heads. These very moments chopped off the innocence of the old stories, making the whole thing so disturbing for the kids; inside us or outside us. There were even bugging points for being bugging like the scene of The Gingerbread Man; which was completely aimless, having no end to it as well! But here's the part of Gilliam's world ladies and gentlemen. And it's a special crazy world that attracts many. But in the same time, I couldn't forbid myself of asking why he was that churlish and stingy to interdict the children of sharing this fairytale with their parents?!While Heath Ledger mastered the character of the geeky nerdy brother who believes in the imagination, Matt Damon was totally miscast as the debonair, clumsy in action, so realistic brother. When you recall a character of that type you must think; Brad Pitt or else. Plus there wasn't much chemistry between the 2 leads on screen. I know that I couldn't stand Damon all the time! And despite the great efforts of Peter Stormare (my first time to see the unique comedian in him) or Jonathan Pryce, still they looked creepy more than lovable; I can't help it, the child in me had spoken!Knowing that this movie is an UK, Czech Republic, USA production, the CGI wasn't showy like most of what we view in the Hollywood movies. Make no mistake, the special effects were kind of cheap, and the cinematography in the studio left its bad stamp. It's slightly palpable, and the editing did a wonderful job, but nothing could hide that it was less competent. This is something to blame the budget for I suppose. Which leads us to the last problem that this movie suffers; namely the weak distribution. Especially with its strange nature as family, eccentric, movie.There were some nice references to other famous stories or novels like the ring of Lord of The Rings, the old lady who sells the apples from Snow White. That made it like a tribute to all the magic of fantasy that came from immortal books. However that itself is something to really feel and be captured by in the age of childhood, so why it was made so ""Rated PG-13 for violence, frightening sequences and brief suggestive material""?!!I think the audience of the 2000s didn't have the inclination to accept this world. Maybe because it was a revenge out of all the harmless modern fairy tales of cinema at the moment like Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia, etc., or the superheroes' revival like X-Men, Spider-Man, etc. Anyway, it's cinematic to the max, and powerfully captivating in its own way; I believe if you wanted to sum up this movie's own taste, then you must remember its last line: ""And they all lived happily ever after.. or not!"". Maybe there will be a breed of children - the VICE CITY's one - that may prefer this killing during the folk stories, maybe it's a way to give only the adults a mix of their childhood dreams and their mature drastic reality, or maybe Terry Gilliam found the way all the fairy tales will be narrated in the future!Bottom line: I may watch it again, but with changing the channel while the bad parts, or when Matt Damon is speaking.",The Brothers Grimm
49,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,24 December 2019,"Does it deserve 10 stars? No, but I look at this as a thumbs up or thumbs down thing, and it's getting thumbs up, sooo...disclaimer there.I really liked this and I accept that I am in the minority. It has the Terry Gilliam comedic feel to it and it has the Terry Gilliam acid trip feel to it... and even at it's worst that is still absolutely entertaining and a pure joy to watch.Someone mentioned wide angle work before and, yes, it has a lot of that wide angle close-up work that can only really be appreciated by people that thought they could out Thompson Hunter Thompson in their youth... wink wink nudge nudge, if you know what I mean.The only real draw back is that Damon doesn't seem to fit in his role, and he doesn't really seem to fit in a Gilliam film...but surprisingly Ledger seems perfectly at home in that kind of world and you get the sense that he enjoyed acting the part as much as you are enjoying watching him act the part.And then here and there you get a joke, a sight gag, a little hint that reminds you that, yeah, Gilliam was in Python wasn't he? That's something that you'd see in the Flying Circus shoved in there. Almost to the point where you can't but stop and wonder if he was channeling Idle or Chapman for some of the dialogue and physical humor.It's a Gilliam film, made for adults, with Warner Brothers Cartoon violence. It's trippy and fun and it might not be your cup of tea, but I loved it.",The Brothers Grimm
50,Polaris_DiB,Fits just as well in his ill-fitting oeuvre,7,10 July 2009,"Terry Gilliam's imagination is such that it can hardly be confined within the movies that he makes. That's why you end up with the technically nonsensical but gloriously working ending to Brazil right beside the ADD lightshow that is The Adventures of Baron Munchausen; or why you sit through the eerily building perverse look at adolescence of Tideland after watching the paean to endless innocence of The Fisher King. Brothers Grimm is kind of like Gilliam's larger body of work: not everybody likes it, but it's just too Gilliam to deny its skills and its eye. That's partly because Gilliam's fetishistic love of wide-angle lens and fantasy storytelling pretty much fit decidedly into everything this movie is about, making it almost inevitable.The deal is, Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm become con artists that travel the German countryside creating horrorshow exorcisms for which innocent countrymen pay a fair pence. This is all during the French occupation of Germany, to set it into a poignant historical context (though of course all the Germans have English accents, and all of the French have Englishmen-making-fake-French French accents). While Wilhelm is in it for the money, Jacob is the hopeless romantic daydreamer who collects the countrymen's stories into a book. Then they get forced by the French army to look into a local village haunted by mysterious things from the forest. Mayhem and mock-ups of famously well-known fairy tale conceits ensue.It's fun, it's beautiful, and for the most part pretty well acted. If there's any singular problem the movie has, it's that Jacob and Wilhelm talk to each other like the brothers they are so well, that it's almost as if the dialog isn't there for the audiences, but for themselves. Thus while a lot of things are said, not a whole lot of it actually reaches the audience as they squabble back and forth and too many other things are going on. That's really where Gilliam's weakness is, his tendency to have too much going on. However, it does fully flesh out a dynamic world where the brink of adventure is constantly edging aside the characters' own comportment, so I don't find a problem with it.It also came out at a time when CGI was finally getting accessible enough for lower budget productions, but wasn't quite so good that it looked all that realistic. Considering a lot of the CGI that came out at the time, this is some of the better work, and you can almost see Gilliam's enthusiasm in this new way of pulling off special effects. The wolf changing is particularly spectacular.--PolarisDiB",The Brothers Grimm
51,dfranzen70,Grimmm indeed.,3,9 December 2005,"Like most people who grew up on stuff like The Minister of Silly Walks and Crunchy Frog, I like Terry Gilliam, and I appreciate his colorful imagination. I enjoyed Baron Munchausen and The Fisher King. Even when his movies haven't been terribly good (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas), they were interesting, to say the least.I really can't say for the unfortunate Brothers Grimm, a movie that simply has an identity crisis. Does it want to be a purveyor of broad (Pythonesque) comedy? Or subtle, sophisticated wit? Or maybe a melodrama, or a romance? I was never sure how to take the movie. And that's fine if the movie in question can pull off being in several genres at once, as with some of Gilliam's earlier works, but that's really not the case here.Jacob and Will Grimm (Heath Ledger and Matt Damon) are con artists in the 18th century; they take advantage of local legends and fairy tales, swooping in to save the day and make a boatload of money in French-occupied Germany. But then their scam is discovered by the French, in the person of General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce) who says he'll spare the lads' lives if they rid a village of a REAL problem, the disappearance of several young girls.But the village's forest, it turns out, really IS enchanted, and events that closely resemble folk tales (including the Gingerbread Man, Hansel and Gretel, and Little Red Riding Hood) unfold around the hapless con artists. They can't flee, because the French army wants to capture and torture them, and of course there's a love interest (Lena Headey) to keep them around.Gilliam's sets are, as always, quite inventive and fun to watch, but it appears he forgot about such nuances as plot advancement and plausibility. The Brothers seem about as intelligent as the Duke boys, if you catch my drift, except without any of the gregarious appeal. This is at least partly due to the ambiguity of the lead characters - are they supposed to be lovable buffoons, hoisted by their own petards, or all-around jerks only in it for themselves? Ledger and Damon seem to be miscast, as neither supplies the gravitas that the movie sorely needed. It's like watching a buddy cop film while heavily sedated; at nearly two hours, the movie plods along as if terrified of a denouement, even though the ending (and all secrets contained therein) were painfully obvious after the first hour).I think it would have been fun to see this movie as more of a Holy Grail homage, complete with toothless old hags declaring curses and such. But somewhere between that 1975 opus and this dreadful, toothless waste, Gilliam lost his sense of humor.",The Brothers Grimm
52,MaxBorg89,"...and they all lived happily ever after...Well, maybe not",8,19 November 2005,"Take the brothers Grimm and all their fairy tales, mix them together and finally add the essential ingredient: Terry Gilliam. The result? A really interesting fantasy/horror/adventure film which is hell of a lot better than, say, Van Helsing.The brothers Grimm we meet in this film are not the beloved storytellers we know today. Actually, they do use some kind of storytelling, which is lies and deceit: Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jacob (Heath Ledger) are two scoundrels who get paid to vanquish demons, which they have made up themselves. Unfortunately, they get caught by a French general (Gilliam-veteran Jonathan Pryce) who plans to have them executed unless they accept to investigate the disappearance of a dozen young girls in the village of Marbaden. While Will is firmly convinced another group of rascals is behind this, Jake, who has never really stopped believing in fairy tales, realizes they're in the middle of something big: apparently, there's a 500-year-old witch (Monica Bellucci) involved...Witty and exciting, the movie is filled with Gilliam's usual twisted fantasies, dark humor and extreme characters, most notably Italian sadist Cavaldi, played by an OTT Peter Stormare (same for Jonathan Pryce's performance). However, the film isn't as wicked and edgy as Twelve Monkeys or The Fisher King, in fact, apart from some sequences (the torture chamber, the enchanted forest) and the aforementioned ace actors, it's a fairly conventional movie. Where's the cynical, Monty Pythonesque wit we're used to with Gilliam? Even the leading duo, though amusing and talented, isn't a patch on the director's previous on-screen pairings (Brad Pitt/Bruce Willis, Jeff Bridges/Robin Williams, Johnny Depp/Benicio Del Toro et al).Nonetheless, The Brothers Grimm is a good film, and if you're a fan of the genre, you shouldn't be disappointed.

Acting by the support cast were equally impressive with a special mention for Stormare. Screenplay was uneven and doesn't have the necessary fuel to keep the movie going.The movie has some decent comic scenes in between but doesn't solve the purpose. Climax is predictable and boring.Overall the movie would be a disappointment for most of the viewers, kids could love the movie though.P.S - The movie isn't scary though horror is mentioned in the genre of the movie.",The Brothers Grimm
54,noralee,A Romp Through How Folk Tales Are Supposed to Scare You,7,30 August 2005,"""The Brothers Grimm"" is a delightful reminder of the power of folk tales for humor, shock and awe. Terry Gilliam accents the Python-esquire political jokes with eye-dazzling visuals that are both funny and scary.The film opens (and closes) with what feels like a loving tribute to the Bob Hope/Bing Crosby ""On the Road"" movies of a cheerful pair of regular guy con men traveling through colorful geographies, and there's more than one reference to ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" as these are thinkers not superheroes. While it takes a while for Matt Damon and Heath Ledger to develop on screen chemistry (I wonder if Damon's credited entourage had anything to do with that), Damon's wandering British accent fits in with the good-natured joshing.While the Yankee won with science, the philosophical debate here is Napoleon's foppish army, with its buffoonish Italian ally, trying to impose rational Enlightenment on a ""French Occupied Germany"" bound by superstitions, wryly hinting at their cultural affinity for ideological myths. Jacob and William Grimm are charged, under penalty of gruesome death of course, to prove that strange phenomenon have rational explanations. But Ledger's ""Jake"" actually believes in ""the magic beans"" and the film warmly supports the power of such notions (either that or, says ""Will"", ""They have a lot more funding than we do.""), much as does ""The Princess Bride.""The combination is reminiscent of ""Ghostbusters"" and Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow,"" but quite a bit more frightening than Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" (or any Disneyfication of folk tales)-- from girls in coffins, to lots of bugs, to horrific spells, to severed torsos, to medieval torture a la ""Young Frankenstein,"" which reinforces the original role of these stories, according to Bruno Bettelheim. We see bits and pieces for the inspirations for the Grimm Brothers and other compilers with scary elements of ""Little Red Riding Hood,"" (that's the most explicit child swallowing I've seen in awhile), ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Jack and the Beanstalk,"" ""The Gingerbread Man,"" ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin,"" ""Rapunzel,"" ""Cinderella,"" etc. (The toddler next to me at a matinée fell asleep after the first half hour so I'm not sure how small kids would react.)Most of the audience is far too busy keeping up with the ever morphing images to take note of the constant stream of verbal puns and euro jokes about frogs, other than Jonathan Pryce's and Peter Stormare's over the top foils and such broad visual ones with wigs, compared with Mackenzie Crook who is an amusing sidekick.The special effects are wonderful, with even a better moving forest than ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King."" The film is a bit slow to get to the finale, with the additional gypsy-flavored denouement, but it does all hang together at the climax.The women are notably not bland, from Lena Headey's feisty ""Angelika,"" Monica Bellucci's Evil Queen who may just be the fairest one of all, spirited young girls and a recurring old crone. It looks like every resident of Prague must have been involved in the production and is thanked in the closing credits.",The Brothers Grimm
55,slokes,Everything You Expect From Terry Gilliam...And Less,3,7 March 2015,"It's very difficult to replicate the magic of a Terry Gilliam film, getting right that elusive mixture of perversity, whimsy, jet-black humor, and spectacular visual design.It's even difficult if you happen to be Terry Gilliam.In the height of the Napoleonic Era, brothers Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jakob (Heath Ledger) Grimm make a shady living off the superstitions of their fellow Germans. Then French occupiers press them into service to discover who is stirring up spooky trouble in the dark forests around the town of Marbaden. The Grimms figure it must be a rival group of hoaxers, and, under duress, take on the job of exposing them. The job proves more than they expect.""The Brothers Grimm"" is clearly a callback for Gilliam, working in the same comedy-fantasy niche he created with ""Time Bandits"" and ""The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen."" But his inventiveness and humor are missing. Instead of inventiveness, there are a lot of over-the-top sequences barely connected to the central story involving bad CGI. Instead of humor, you have people falling down a lot and the Grimms being shown up as bunglers at every turn.Told the ""strapping young lad"" he has been complementing is in fact a girl, Wilhelm gulps and adds: ""And a fine young wife he'll make some lucky man.""Both Ledger and Peter Stormare as an Italian torture expert suffer from extreme overacting. Ledger plays his character with much eye- twitching and spectacles-adjusting, as well as a stammer reminiscent of Ratso Rizzo. Stormare seems to be channeling Timothy Carey with his constant eruptions and wild stares. After not very long they become extremely distracting.On another planet is Lena Headey as the love interest, who being the main female in this predictable film sees right through the Grimms and tries to make them appreciate the true gravity of their situation. She plays her role with a grim naturalism that keeps fantasy at bay whenever she's on screen.It's definitely a Gilliam film. You have the cynicism up front (""It's a short brutish struggle and then you die,"" Wilhelm says. ""Life's little subterfuges make it all worthwhile."") Cute characters are introduced in order to die horribly. What can you say about a comedy where the funniest scene involves a kitten being disintegrated? Certainly that's got Gilliam all over it.But the kitten scene isn't all that funny, and neither is anything else. The script seems to treat comedy as an afterthought, while using the Grimm fairy tales the same way ""Time Bandits"" used history, as the basis for various set-pieces. Yet the connections this time are witless and convoluted.You see a girl walking through the forest with a bright red cape, and think ""OK, it's Little Red Riding Hood."" But before anything else happens, she gets abducted and that's the end of her story. Or another little girl named Gretel walks through the forest with her brother, and is abducted. The most ridiculous of these is when a girl suddenly loses her entire face and is then abducted by a monster from a well. ""You can't catch me because I'm the gingerbread man!"" is the last thing we hear, referencing another fairy tale, albeit not one from the Brothers Grimm.Basically, the story doesn't need the fairy-tale dressings at all, it's just a parade of child abductions leading to an overbaked and nonsensical conclusion. But Gilliam and his team apparently needed the excuse to show off their CGI. They aren't good effects at all; ten years later you can see how poorly they were processed.One thing Ledger said in a supplemental feature sticks with me: ""None of us would be here if it wasn't for Terry."" The only reason ""Brothers Grimm"" got made was to give Gilliam something to do; this time it wasn't reason enough.",The Brothers Grimm
56,aharmas,What a Grimm tale this is...,5,26 August 2005,"While watching the movie, I couldn't help thinking how good ""Shrek"" was. There was the film that Gilliam tried so unsuccessfully to make. That film was populated by every fantasy character, behaving in rather unconventional and FUNNY, ORIGINAL, and INTERESTING ways. Here was a gorgeous mess, with a plot that wandered aimlessly and got lost among some very strange directorial choices. If this film failed, no one else is to be blamed but its director.""The Brothers Grimm"" is not a total waste of time; a a matter of fact, it's better than 80% of the remakes released this year. If you want true horror and a sick feeling in the bottom of your stomach, go see the remake of that TV series... which one? choose. ""Grimm"" offers nightmarish recreations of worlds that never existed. One can truly rely on Gilliam for designing and inventing whimsical universes. That is his major strength. What he fails to do is to rein his manic energy so that he can focus in making his not-yet-released masterpieces. He appeared to have every major element for a great film here, but I couldn't understand why Jacob Grimm was so hyperactive and confused, and God knows what the French army's role was in the movie, except to distract and spoil some terrific moments.There are sections in the film, particularly in its opening scenes and the last 30 minutes when one feels like crying because of what could have been. Monica Bellucci's erotic and bewitching portrayal of the Evil Queen was the epitome of a legendary villain. If only Gilliam had chosen her as the force the Grimms had to battle. Instead, we're treated to the rantings and ravings of a military lunatic that is more obnoxious than dangerous and who effectively derails the film every time he shows up. His troop is perfectly suited to him, as they function only as a waste of space and money.What one is bound to enjoy are the various fairy tales ideas and characters that pop in the film. The mirror in the Queen's suite is a perfectly realized prop, and when Monica speaks to it, we believe its powers and its magic. There are minor special effects in the magic ax, and to us it's wonderful device. We also are witness to a great depiction of a being who is the perfect hybrid of two completely different creatures, and who just happens to behave like a werewolf. In other words, the art direction, the music, and the photography are wonders to behold, and yet... the actors have no direction and appear misguided and lost.Now, if only all failures were this good... One thing I am grateful for is that someone still has some imagination left in Hollywood.",The Brothers Grimm
57,Jonny_Numb,"Put the cap back on the blender, Terry--you'll have less of a mess...",3,24 March 2006,"Wow...woah...what the hell...? ""The Brothers Grimm"" is yet another long-shelved project at Dimension Pictures that has gotten a less-than-flattering release on all counts. This tale of Will and Jake Grimm (Matt Damon and Heath Ledger), two brothers who go from town to town, staging elaborate supernatural stunts to extort money from hapless citizens has promising talent in front of and behind the camera (Terry Gilliam directs), but is ultimately a film as catastrophic as it is charmless.The green-screened special effects are very poor in certain scenes (as if background detail wasn't filled in), the plot (what can be deciphered, that is) is schizophrenic and generally disposable, and the dialog (delivered with mediocre-to-poor accents) is largely incomprehensible. And while these are trademarks of any Gilliam film, ""The Brothers Grimm"" renders such conventions with an indifference that is stultifying; the constant sense of ""huh?"" I got from the plot kept me from soaking up or appreciating any of the aesthetic qualities contained therein. Which is a shame, since--in a lot of ways--""Brothers Grimm"" is as brilliantly eye catching (minus the aforementioned green-screening) as anything Gilliam has done.But it fails...and fails...and fails some more. And it drags on for nearly two hours. While I appreciate Gilliam's work on a stylistic level, I find him easier to take in smaller doses, if only because of his trademark tendency to clutter the screen with bizarre events, items, and people at all times. ""The Brothers Grimm"" is too busy, too nonsensical, and too shruggingly presented to elicit a reaction (other than exhaustion and indifference)--an epic of visual brilliance and missed opportunity.",The Brothers Grimm
58,ShootingShark,Stylish Knockabout Historical Adventure Of Folk Tale Scribes Embroiled In A Real Fairy Story,6,26 January 2009,"In Germany in 1811, Will and Jake Grimm are storytellers, famed for their enchanting fairy tales. When the village of Marbaden is cursed by a haunted forest which steals their children, the brothers are coerced into fighting an all too real evil force This sly, darkly humorous fable of witchcraft and sibling rivalry is excellent material for Gilliam (if a little reminiscent of his debut feature Jabberwocky) and the theme of belief in magic - Will does, Jake does not - is a motif which runs through all his work. Its best feature is its gleeful recreation of the period, with terrific costumes, great sets by Guy Dyas, bizarre torture devices, strange props and everything covered in mud. The script is an intriguing mixture of three elements; the constant bickering and fighting between the scholarly Will and the pragmatic Jake, the main fable of the Mirror Queen's evil plot, and several clever subplots and anecdotes of mythological fairy tales (my favourite being the slimy Gingerbread Man). Ledger and Damon are both great, and Stormare and Pryce chew the scenery with aplomb, though the best performer is Bellucci - an excellent Italian actress who makes movies all over Europe like a modern-day Isabelle Adjani - who is wonderfully wicked as the Sleeping Beauty / Wicked Queen villainess. If I have one complaint with the movie, it's that its tone is a little uneven - it's a bit too cracked and nightmarish for kids, but at the same time the story and the humour is ideal for them - it might have been better as either a totally straight picture or a full-on comedy but it occasionally flounders somewhere in the middle. Shot in the Czech Republic, it had the typical Gilliam production blues (it was bailed out by the Brothers Weinstein, who tried to tamper with it), though it at least got made, unlike his previous film, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, which was scrapped during the first week of shooting. A sort of strange remake of an old 1962 movie, The Wonderful World Of The Brothers Grimm. Good goofy fun throughout, with a fine performance by the sadly short-lived Ledger, and a typically inventive visual style from the ultra-talented Gilliam.",The Brothers Grimm
59,truemythmedia,Heartbreaking,6,23 July 2019,"It is hard to underestimate how disappointed I was in this film. It is so close to being what I want it to be and being a truly brilliant Gilliam film but it strays just often enough from the mark that I find myself wondering if I will end up adding this title to my Gilliam collection or not.A film revolving around fairy tales, whether or not they exist, actors and whether they are merely pretenders or actual legends, and an enchanted forest which may or may not be the setting for truly miraculous events; I can certainly see why Gilliam was interested in this film. It seems right up the alley of the man who made ""Jabberwocky,"" ""Time Bandits,"" and ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.""In its best moments, the film really explores these ideas in interesting ways. It At its worst, however, it simply states things obviously and states them over and over.The opening scene of the film presents an alternate version of the famous Jack and the beanstalk story. In this film, Jake is sent to sell the cow for money to feed a dying mother but when he returns with beans, which are not magic but simply a con, his brother Will shouts ""Magic beans?"" at him as an everlasting shame upon his head.This would be fine if it came up later as particularly meaningful but throughout the film, Will yells ""Magic beans"" at Jake approximately 50 times. It is clearly something he has said many times in his life and he continues to cudgel his brother with it every time his brother even hints that something is magical.In fact, this brings to light one of the central things I did not care for it the film. Will's character is so slow to believe in magic that even if the forest itself got up and started walking around, he would still find obtuse and nonsensical justifications for why everything was perfectly natural about it.Again, this is the sort of thing that if the film were better written could have come across especially powerful but because it is simply played for humor and frequently overplayed, it ends up seeming stubbornly stupid as opposed to genuinely motivated by a brother who is tired of his siblings constant flights of fancy. If Will never happened to be around for the supernatural stuff or was only confronted with it towards the end of the movie much of the film would work better but there is too much, as usual, that Gilliam is trying to cram into his film.",The Brothers Grimm
60,davidmvining,Terry Gilliam works for the Weinsteins,5,23 March 2020,"The period between the release of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and The Brothers Grimm was when Terry Gilliam almost made The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. It's also the period when he almost made Good Omens. He had a lot of high profile stuff fall apart in those few years, and ended up working for the Weinstein Brothers. By all accounts, the relationship was strained from the moment Bob came in with money right before cameras rolled, all the way through production and into editing where Gilliam got so frustrated with the experience that he took a six month break and made Tideland. In terms of chaotic and headache inducing productions, this must have been something special.The end result is exactly what I think I would have expected from Terry Gilliam going Hollywood. He's too dedicated to his vision to break at a certain point, and putting him up against Bob and Harvey Weinstein was going to lead to friction. So, the middle point between them ends up feeling overstuffed and undercooked at the same time. This is the most middle of the road picture Gilliam made, still touching on his hallmark themes and carrying his signature visual stylings, but pretty obviously cut down from something longer. I would guess that Gilliam's original cut was 20-30 minutes longer (not even really taking into account the famous and very expensive opening scene that got cut), and I think the movie needed it. The stuff that disappeared would have provided more time with our central two characters Jacob and Wilheim, providing more time for their conflict of visions to play out, and with the Mirror Queen (who feels like little more than the ornate ornamentation that surrounds her) and Delatombe, the French military commander who appears in the last act as a major antagonistic force after largely being a background character for the first two thirds.Jacob and Wilheim Grimm are brother con artists, using knowledge of the local folklore in French occupied Germany to put on dishonest demonstrations that they fend off with flare and puffs of smoke after which they get paid for their services. Caught by the occupying French, they are sent to a small town where nine little girls have gone missing. The Grimm Brothers employ the help of a local huntress and begin unraveling a little fantastical mystery about the forest, a high stone tower, and the legends of a queen who desired eternal life.The two brothers are mirror images of each other. Jacob is the dreamer, a typical Gilliam protagonist, who wants his dreams to become his reality, while Wilheim is the realist who won't see anything but the harsh reality around them. This is all very much in line with what Gilliam had done before, in particular The Fisher King, but now they're in a mostly plot driven story that still manages little meanderings here and there while bringing in an outside threat late in the game that's meant to feel like a larger extension of the conflict of visions (pitting the brothers between the Mirror Queen, a fantastical monster, and Delatombe, a more realistic monster), but Delatombe feels so underdeveloped and his introduction to the final act so rushed and underexplained that I largely wish he had simply been cut from the film past the halfway point.And that kind of encapsulates my problems with the film. There are a lot of things in this movie, and very little of it feels fleshed out. Jacob and Wilheim, at the center of it all and the focus of the theme in dramatic form, get the most attention and come out good enough, but the story around them is so chaotic that it undermines the movie's efforts.In terms of how the movie looks, it largely looks great. Gilliam used his $80 million really well. The sets are gorgeous, the costumes detailed, the makeup convincing. The problem arises when CGI gets involved. This was 2005 and The Lord of the Rings had already gone through its entire cycle in theaters, and The Brothers Grimm looks like it was made in the 90s rather than the 00s. The CGI is cheap looking and never, ever convincing, and it's pretty prevalent throughout. I imagine that more was meant to be done practically, but it never feels like the effects and the practical realities around them are in the same place. It's an unfortunate and very noticeable flaw in the movie's generally very good visual aesthetic.I also quite enjoyed the acting. Matt Damon and Heath Ledger work really well together as Wilheim and Jacob. Lena Heady is a firecracker as Angelika. Peter Stormare is kind of hilarious as Cavaldi, the torturer and guard to the Grimm Brothers. Jonathan Pryce is also wonderful as Delatombe.The pieces were all there, but the script (which apparently was Gilliam's efforts on top of Ehren Kruger's spec script, writing that the WGA refused to give Gilliam credit for because they apparently hate him) really needed another draft or two. It needed to iron out the extra stuff and integrate Delatombe better. I imagine that a longer edit might have addressed these things, but I suppose that's just something we'll never see. Who knows? Maybe Criterion will get their hands on all of the excised material and give Gilliam the resources to assemble the cut he always wanted. I'm not holding my breath, though.",The Brothers Grimm

They sucker small towns into paying them to get rid of ghost and witches that they create. Although when a town has a real witch problem, The Brothers Grimm are sent. The only problem is, they have no clue what they're doing.After watching this film, I believe Terry Gilliam also had no idea what he was doing. The Brother Grimm is a film with so much potential that it could have been a marvelous eye-popping magical adventure. Unfortunately we have to sit through a long winded film with horrible dialogue and cardboard acting.Matt Damon is miscast in this Gilliam adventure, he tries to play his part with a sense of comedy. The only problem is the writing material isn't funny and Damon can't pull off comedy. Heath Ledger is Damon's brother, who's in love with the town cursed loon. Here Ledger is a bumbling, not too brave, child-like shy younger brother. Monica Beluccia has little to no screen time and only appears near the climax of the film.Gilliam is a great director and had a chance to take tons of fairy tales and make them into some sick twisted funny film. The Brother Grimm comes off too childish and Hollywood. Gilliam should have made the film darker, then it's comedic tone could really take off. The entire first half of the film is a total bore, I almost fell asleep, until the climax.The climax isn't very big or explosive in anyway, but it did somehow keep me awake. You know with every fairytale that in the end they live happily ever after, so there is no danger in whether or not any of the characters make it out alive, cause they will. Peter Stormare was the most annoying character throughout this entire film. His accent made my ears bleed, along with every other French accent in the movie. It was horrible to listen to, especially with such weak dialogue to boot.The special effects are too amazing at all, they don't even come off as campy, just crappy. Where Grimm does get it's points from is the great costume and set designs. Gilliam and his crew has taken us back to the 18th century and given us a wonderful world to marvel at. It is quite impressive. It's too sad to say that with the chaos going on on screen, it's hard to appreciate such beauty.Brother's Grimm had a lot going for it, and if Gilliam took another approach, could have possibly pulled off a really great film. It's too bad that the horrible writing and acting drag this film to become one of the worst of 2005. The Brother's Grimm should exterminate this film instead of evil.",The Brothers Grimm

I liked all the actors who did a fair to great job, especially Peter Stormare whose over-the-top stuff seems to fit right in. He's like Peppy la-pew from Loony Toons with his terribly think accent and theatrics. I started to look for him in scenes. The most memorable part of the movie will be him yelling, ""Grimmies!"" certainly. The story unfortunately is somewhat empty trying to hack from past fairy tales in an effort to be an original mix. It really doesn't work well. So without the pull of a strong narrative there's interesting scenes and visuals but not much to draw you in to the movie. It was similar to Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow, but without the familiar backbone of that the Burton movie stood up on. Additionally the forest seemed pretty artificial and the effects at times poorly executed or blended with the trees, bugs, elements or supernaturals Overall a bit of a disappointment compared with Brazil or Twelve Monkeys, but not too bad.

The on-screen couple, Damon and Ledger, are good. They interact with each other well. I should warn you that if you want to see this movie, kids and animals get killed.

Some fairy tale stories includes: Hansel and Gretal, Little Red Riding Hood, and the Gingerbread Man. This is my first time, ever, to see a Terry Gilliam film. I think it's an OK film. I was expecting more from this movie. I could compare this film to Van Helsing, another film that uses old monster movies instead of fairy tales.

I understand that the movie is not accurate about some facts and that the accents can bother people who has English as the first language, but even so, 5.9 is too low!Personally, I found the movie to be very entertaining, even with some disturbing scenes that people were complaining about(Like when the horse swallows the kid or When the kitten gets killed). What most people don't get is that usually,The Grimms Fairy Tales ARE very dark, and not the totally cute and happy thing that is known by Disney. And by the way, there are many cool references to fairy tales in this movie, like ''Little Red Riding Hood '','' Rapunzel '' ''The Gingerbread Man'',''Hanzel and Gretel '','' Cinderella '' and even ''Snow White''! The end of the movie is not totally happy as well( Angelika doesn't choose none of the brothers to stay, the 2 assistants were beheaded, etc) what I think is a good thing.The movie starts in the 18th-century , when Wilhelm and Jakob , the Brothers Grimm, are very well known in Germany as powerful and wise brothers who can defeat all kinds of strange and supernatural things. What people doesn't know, is that the Grimm Brothers are always setting up fake demons and monsters to trick gullible townspeople. But their secret doesn't last too much, and the french general Delatombe, with Cavaldi's help, decides that the only way they have to not be tortured and get their liberty, is to solve a case that is happening in a small town where the girls are missing.

68,Victor Field,"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the lamest one of all?",2,22 November 2005,"Once upon a time, in a magical land called Hollywood, there were two film companies - one was a creation of the powerful and avaricious Weinstein brothers, called Dimension Films. The other was called Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and it had once been one of the most glittering studios in Hollywood, but time had reduced the mighty roar to a mere mewl.One day Dimension and MGM discovered a manuscript with ""The Brothers Grimm"" written on it. Dimension leafed through the typed pages and was excited. ""I thought this would be a dry biopic, but it's speculative fantasy fiction! Two handsome heroes pretending to be ghostbusters, children in distress, magic, adventure... this could be a hit!"" Dimension chuckled.""Wait,"" the older MGM cautioned. ""Look on the cover - it says 'By Ehren Kruger.' You've encountered this man before; he is a name to dread.""""Ah yes,"" Dimension mused, reading it closely. ""'Scream 3,' 'Reindeer Games'... it's amazing he's ever allowed near a keyboard. Now that you mention it, this manuscript has all his trademarks - why is he working in 'Sleeping Beauty' references? Isn't that more famous through Charles Perrault? And this storyline... it seems to be cursed; it all goes pear-shaped towards the end.""""Pear-shaped?"" ""It's a British expression. Never mind, I know what we'll do - we'll hire Terry Gilliam. The script might lurch from one tone to another, but Gilliam'll hide it."" And so they enlisted the Wizard Gilliam to bring his gift for spectacular visuals to bear on the manuscript, forgetting that his magic had also dimmed with the passing of time, sending him from the heights of ""Brazil"" and ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" to ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."" Dimension and MGM then courted Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as the travelling siblings, and assured them that the problem of audiences laughing at their German accents would be solved by having them speak with British accents. And they decided that to bring home the period, French-occupied medieval Germany would be played by the Czech Republic, and all the key actors would be British.""Wait, what about the Wicked Queen?"" MGM spluttered. ""She has to be someone staggeringly beautiful..."" ""How about Monica Bellucci?"" ""But she's not German!"" ""Who is in this movie?"" And so the Wizard Gilliam summoned forth the sumptuous Monica, and cast a spell on her that caused her to behave as if she was enacting a slow, if spectacularly developed, child. The spell caused everyone else to behave as if they were in a Christmas pantomime, and caused the movie to transform from an unfocused comedy to a weak thriller. The wizards and warlocks at the Peerless Camera Company also fell victim to the spell, proving unable to save the proceedings. Worst of all, Gilliam's spell was bound by the scope of Kruger's script - the evil wizard had included many things, but had neglected to give Monica Bellucci enough time on screen for her to work her own brand of good magic.Watching and unable to interfere, Dimension and MGM cast an eye on the lineup. ""Mosaic Media Group... weren't they the ones who did the 'Scooby-Doo' movies?"" MGM groaned.""Alas, yes,"" Dimension sighed.And so, the two beleaguered studios fixed their eyes on what some would call the one bewitching ingredient in the movie - the beauty of Monica Bellucci - and it was released.

Possibly this is because he didn't write the script. That wordsmithing chore went to the screenwriter who gave us ""Reindeer Games"" (another watchable failure), ""Arlington Road"" (a fine exercise in paranoia), and the two ""Ring"" screen adaptations, along with garbage like ""Scream 3."" In this case, I suspect that the Hollywood suits exercised more than their normal share of meddling in the execution of that script. More's the pity. Gilliam has almost always been at his best working with his own scripts, ""12 Monkeys"" and ""The Fisher King"" being notable exceptions.Likewise, the casting of ""The Brothers Grimm"" is suspect. Damon and Ledger are both capable actors, despite the fannish backlash against their good looks and Hollywood stardom, but neither seems overly committed to their roles. Yes, I am aware that film is always rooted in the times in which it's created, and only rarely transcends itself to a position of timelessness, but neither Damon nor Ledger (nor most any of the other actors) seem to inhabit the late 18th Century in which ""The Brothers Grimm"" is set. They act like creatures of the early 21st Century; their anachronistic demeanor derails the otherwise near- seamless production values of the film.Regardless, ""The Brothers Grimm"" is not without merit. The direction is typical Gilliam. The cinematography is wonderful, and at times breathtaking. The sound is great, the score by Dario Marianelli (who did the one for ""V for Vendetta,"" which I have yet to see, but look forward to enjoying, as well as the next Harry Potter film, not coincidentally to be directed by Gilliam) is appropriate, and the scenic design, costuming, and so forth are all quite nice. Even the unGilliamesque CGI is fairly well done, if not technically up to its own audacious goals, cf. the moving trees (at least on my small screen).Be warned, though, as others have done; ""The Brothers Grimm"" is not intended for children, despite its fairy tale nature. Not for its gruesome imagery, which abounds in and is far more effective in the reader's or listener's imagination when absorbing the originals, but because the storytelling is fractured and confusing and inconsistent. As others have observed, the strict moral center of Grimm's fairy tales has been dispensed with; what is left is the typical relativism of a made-by-committee Hollywood product: all flash and little substance.Still, I look forward to seeing what Gilliam did with ""Tideland."" Everyone is entitled to setbacks now and again, and Gilliam's had his share.",The Brothers Grimm

71,cultfilmfan,The Brothers Grimm,8,27 August 2005,"The Brothers Grimm, is set in the 1800's and is about two young men named Wilhelm Grimm, and Jacob Grimm. The two of them fake exorcisms and ghosts so people will hire them to exterminate them and they make their living by doing this. One day they are caught by the French authorities and are sentenced to help out in a village where the children have gone missing due to an evil curse. Having faked everything before they will have to rely on each other to solve the mystery along with the help of a feisty young woman named Angelika. The film also ties in many fairy tales into the plot such as Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel And Gretel. The Brothers Grimm, has good direction, a good script, good performances by the whole cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration, good costume design and good makeup design. The Brothers Grimm, is a great looking and gorgeous film with great cinematography, production design, art direction, set decoration, costume design and make up (all of which are Oscar worthy). The film also has really good visual and special effects. The Brothers Grimm, is full of magic, it is inventive, entertaining, imaginative, playful and fun, original, enjoyable, engaging and is full of energy and is a lot of fun. The film's director Terry Gilliam, has brought us visually fascinating and very original and creative movies such as Brazil, and continues to work his magic here. The film also has a lot of dark humour and may be a little creepy to younger kids but when I was a kid I personally loved dark fairy tales and the darker they were the better they were. This film is like a giant fairy tale full of all the imaginative and fantastic visuals that we would think of in our imagination only brought to the screen in this great tale. One of the best films of the year and a great return from Terry Gilliam, who hasn't given us a film in seven years since Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. He also has a film called Tideland, coming out soon. I'am personally glad to have him back.",The Brothers Grimm
72,petra_ste,"A nice premise, squandered",5,24 May 2007,"Early 19th century: brothers Will (Matt Damon) and Jacob (Heath Ledger) Grimm travel around Germany conning villagers and pretending to defeat imaginary monsters, until they are forced to investigate a series of mysterious disappearances. At first they believe it's the work of a fellow impostor, but this time real magic is involved. With the help of huntress Angelika (Lena Headey) and mercenary Cavaldi (Peter Stormare), the brothers Grimm face an evil sorceress (Monica Bellucci) haunting the local forest.I really like the cast and the premise of the fake Ghostbusters clashing against a true supernatural threat. Sadly, the result is a disappointment.What's wrong with the movie? First, pacing is mortally off. It feels like a collection of choppily assembled vignettes (""Look, Little Red Riding Hood! Here come Hansel and Gretel!""). Scenes happen randomly and are not given enough time to breath; characters' interactions are perfunctory. For example, at one point we are told both brothers have feelings for Angelika, but nowhere in previous scenes this had been given the proper setup. Structure is a mess: we have three scenes with our heroes captured by the French, three scenes with them bumbling around the magic tower, etc. It's clunky, repetitive and unfocused - as if the screenwriters had this droll high-concept fantasy premise, wrote a first unpolished draft and called it a day.Also, tone. This is part fairy tale with Gothic elements, part slapstick comedy (Stormare's mercenary would feel at home in a Monty Python sketch). The more lighthearted material isn't particularly funny and the transition to serious scenes feels jarring. It made me re-evaluate Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow, which handled a similar cocktail between genres much more deftly.Strangely for a Terry Gilliam movie, The Brothers Grimm lacks personality.5/10",The Brothers Grimm
73,juliankennedy23,A Grimm result,5,4 December 2018,"The Brothers Grimm: 5 out of 10: Two brother's (the titular Brothers Grimm) travel the countryside fooling rubes into thinking that they have a haunting and the brothers are solving it. While in occupied Germany they are tasked with an enchanted forest and to the surprise of no-one who has seen a movie in the last fifty years the forest is apparently really haunted.The Brother's Grimm shares a lot of the same DNA as another movie I saw recently Van Helsing. Both are overstuffed and overlong. Both have lead actors that are much better than the material would suggest. Both deal with characters that are either in or adjacent to the public domain. Both have special effect failures that shouldn't happen in a movie with a release year that starts with a 2. Both have rather weak antagonists and both have very strong love interests.Yet I enjoyed Van Helsing a lot more than I did The Brother's Grimm.The problem that Brother's Grimm has is the underlying story lacks any focus. While Van Helsing is simply Dracula vs James Bond, The Brother's Grimm seems to be a family drama mixed with a love triangle, mixed with a historical description of the French being mean to the Germans (refreshing as that is it takes the movie off its actual point.), mixed with the do you believe in magic plot that makes my eyes roll right out of my head.The Good: The acting is everything from solid (Heath Ledger) to delightful (Lena Headey) only Jonathan Pryce as the bad guy seeming off and honestly that is more a miscasting than Mr. Pyrce's fault.There is a gingerbread man that is not just better than anything else in the film but is one of the most amazing things I have seen in years. It is almost worth the price of admission.The Bad: The gingerbread man as described above appears in the film for about two minutes. Nothing else comes close to the excitement, fear, and creativity of that creation. So much in this film is simply a call out to a Brother's Grimm story. So there are mattresses piled in a stack or porridge served in three bowls and I suppose we are supposed to feel smart recognizing a children's nursery rhyme. The problem with trying to fit all the Brother's Grimm stories in one film is that it becomes a hodgepodge mess. Does Rapunzel need a magic mirror and a girl with a red hood? Who knows? But she will get them here.The Ugly: I love director Terry Gilliam but he left his sense of visual style in another castle on this one. This is the muddiest ugliest film he has ever done. Keep in mind he directed both Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Brazil. Not exactly films that are known for colors that pop. There is a scene late in the film where Pryce leads the French in shelling the forest. It is a spectacular scene with bright fire and good effects. It really stands out from the rest of the film. Like the Gingerbread Man, it more serves to remind you that you have spent an hour and a half so far watching something much less impressive. Also, like the Gingerbread Man, it really makes no sense in relation to the rest of the story.
In Conclusion: With this cast and director, this should have been a much better film. Too bad the script is a poison apple that puts the audience to sleep.",The Brothers Grimm
74,TheNorthernMonkee,should have been the Summer Blockbuster,8,2 November 2005,"SPOILERS Come February 2006, yet again there will be a wide selection of films up for the prized Oscar of 'Best Adapted Screenplay'. Ultimately though, where do the original, eldest stories come from? 'Little Red Riding Hood', 'Sleeping Beauty', so many other stories, all originally are credited as coming from the imagination of two German Brothers. Telling the fictional story of what ""The Brothers Grimm"" did before they became writers, 2005's Terry Gilliam production is a dark and entertaining affair. Admittedly led by a miscast Matt Damon, the film is much more entertaining than other critics would have you believe. It has it's flaws that's true, but for the most part it's well worth a watch.Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm (Damon and Heath Ledger) are monster destroying brothers in French occupied Germany. Making money using their own imaginative skills, the two are master con artists. When the occupying forces send them out to a quiet town however, they come across a fairy tale more real than they ever could have imagined.Magnificantly shot by legendary Python Terry Gilliam, ""The Brothers Grimm"" is a dark and lively picture with some subtle and wonderful touches. In a film like this, the graphics are often the star, and Gilliam's usage of moving trees and crows doesn't disappoint. It's a remarkably vivid affair, just like his earlier work, and sadly it'll probably also go unappreciated too.There are reasons to be sceptical of the film's quality. Irrelevant of it's wonderful appearance, the acting is definitely a disappointment. Matt Damon as Will Grimm is a major piece of miss-casting while Jonathan Pryce as General Delatombe is infuriating with his tedious French accent. Pryce is, like most of the cast, hamming up his role, but questions have to be asked about why he should need to. So many of the film's cast adopt obscure foreign accents, but only Pryce manages to cause the audience to grate their teeth.For all the flaws in ""The Brothers Grimm"", it's still an entertaining tale. Brilliantly filmed by Terry Gilliam, it is a return to form for the constantly suffering director. As a final note, why was this film released on this date? In a year when so many of the Summer Blockbusters were below par, ""The Brothers Grimm"" could have been the big hit. Instead it is being released a matter of weeks before the new ""Harry Potter"". It's a strange decision, and one which will ultimately affect the success of the film rather than it's quality.",The Brothers Grimm

The production value is definitely there, and homages to various Grimm stories are definitely interesting to see.

76,johnstonjames,Wonderfully Grimm,8,15 November 2011,"this is such a great movie i should really give it more than a measly eight but i just can't seem to take it seriously enough for a nine or a ten rating. but i think eight is actually a very high rating it's just that a Terry Gilliam film, and a good one at that, probably deserves more. i don't think this is as awesome as a 'Time Bandits' or a ' Jabberwocky', but this is a pretty cool trip.the psychology here is correct and right on the mark. fairy tales are very dark and are all about fear. but that isn't exactly the deepest or most controversial or topical message now is it? as astutely right as it's observation might be. that's why i find it hard to take this film seriously even though it is so good and stylish and loads of fun.Terry Gilliam is one of my favorite directors in mainstream filmmaking. like Kubrick, or Ken Russell, Gilliam can almost always justify a large budget and polished filmmaking approach. a lot of big studio film directors cannot always do that. Spielberg can't always justify his large scale and budgets and Lucas and Cameron hardly ever can. i usually use up a lot of air preaching against the evils of wasteful extravagance in Hollywood filmmaking in particular, but once in a while there are films made with big budgets by big studios with big names that i actually like a lot. i've never seen a Terry Gilliam movie that i didn't think was just great. and i've pretty much seen 'em all. including the much maligned 'Tideland'.i loved 'TBG' and i loved the subtle, original approach of never actually using the traditional plots or using the iconic fairy tale images outright. this movie was also way ahead of the curve in predicting the current trendy fascination with fairy tales. it's also much better and more insightful than most things being offered in the current trend.the CGI FX were also very impressive here. normally i don't always like a lot of FX or CGI FX in particular, but the CGI here was very artful and whimsically done and done with more humour than the usual CGI treatment. things like the horse swallowing the little girl being done in shadow, and the hilarious (but spooky) image of the mud-pie gingerbread boy, are very imaginative and don't push for heavy realism the way most CGI usually does.if you like fairy tales you'll probably get a kick from this. even if you just like CGI fantasy action you might like it. you might like it if you are interested in Heath Ledger alone. anyway, i think it's one of the best fantasy films of the last decade and grossly underrated, so i think it's worth a look.",The Brothers Grimm
77,tomimt,Fairytale incomplete,6,26 December 2007,"The Grimm brothers journey around the lands, helping people to get rid of fantastical threats of trolls and witches. That's an easy thing to do, considering they have created the monsters themselves with a couple of helping hands and cleverly placed springs and pulleys. But after the french imprison them and accuse them of kidnapping several young girls they are mixed in a real threat of fairytale horror, even with an evil queen trying to gain herself the gift of eternal youth.The movie looks mostly gorgeous. The settings and the music is fantastic. Gilliam is visually as good as he has ever been. Only some of the CGI effects jump to your face, as they look like, well, cheap CGI effects. But in the grander scale, aesthetically, the movie looks and sounds great. But then we get into more problematic part. The story's first half doesn't work. It's flat and tame and mostly uninteresting. Only in the second half in which the situation is fully revealed to the brothers the story picks itself up and climbs from the pit of half woven scoundrel comedy and turns into a fantasy comedy, which it works better as.Overall The Brothers Grimm is pretty mediocre film. It has some elements going for it, such as the visual direction of the film and it has its share of good scenes. But mostly it has this flat seen this, done that feeling into it.

78,DonFishies,This movie should never have been completed,5,1 April 2006,"From a troubled production shoot, to an even more troubled final product, this is a film that should have stayed locked in the vault, and not printed onto any of the cast or crew's resumes.While the idea of the film is quite intriguing, and is quite witty in its final form, the movie is just a convoluted mess of ideas. You can see them all on screen, but they're all either half-baked, or they just don't work. Terry Gilliam is known for his sense of visual flair, and his writing, but you can't help but ask, what happened to the man who gave us Brazil, 12 Monkeys, or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Or even the man who gave us a piece of Monty Python. It's just that disappointing for a fan of his work. All I know is, he either is not here, or he just really should not have taken so much of a break from making movies, problems with productions or not.Matt Damon and Heath Ledger have seen better days (read: Syriana and Brokeback Mountain), but they make the most of their performances. While it was wise of them to change characters before production started, you cannot help but notice the pain in their acting. They just look like they are not having any fun making the movie. Monica Bellucci is an absolutely awful choice for the queen, and even the comedy of Coen Brothers favorite Peter Stormare is not enough to save this film. Jonathan Pryce was a nice addition, but his purpose wears thin way too fast.And yet, even with mentioning all that, I haven't come to the visual effects. They look absolutely horrendous. Think of the old Sinbad films from the 1950s and 1960s, and then think of something that looks worse. With all the developments in CGI, the crew couldn't make something that almost resembled good special effects? It looks like they took all the money for the CGI, and wasted it on booze and drugs, and then used the leftovers and pieced it together on a hangover. It just looks absolutely awful. After the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogies, you will be in absolute agony watching this.But even in light of this, it does look like some effort was put into the costumes and set pieces. Now that is where the movie shines. The look of the 1800's is there, from the gritty clothing, to the mess of bricks and sticks that resemble houses. It makes the film feel authentic, even in light of some of its horrible flaws.A movie that could have been, but wasn't.

They usually arrive in a village when they hear that villagers are being attacked. What the villagers don't know is that the pair are con men who stage the attack with their two cohorts.

Unfortunately for them, the French army, which is occupying Germany, discovers what they have been doing to the villagers and arrests them. General Delatombe (Jonathon Pryce) will let them go if the brothers help him find the people kidnapping young girls from one village. The brothers go to the village only to find that they have encountered a cursed forest with real magical spells and real evil spirits. They must battle the enchanted forest to get the girls back.(Comment) The movie is supposed to be about the stories the brothers heard during their travels, and the fairy tales they later wrote.

82,MichaelMargetis,"""I made the armor myself. It's not magic, but it's shiny. "" - Will Grimm",5,10 September 2005,"One thing you can say for sure about Terry Gilliam's adaptation of the incredibly bizarre 'The Brothers Grimm' is that it is the year's strangest film. That being said, I can tell you I had mixed feelings about it. It was funny and action-packed at times, and at other times it was just plain weird and didn't make any sense. 'The Brothers Grimm' offers some treats, but it is just mostly jumbled. Let's put it this way, if you like cool special effects or an off-beat storyline you'll enjoy 'The Brothers Grimm' if you like a standard easy-to-follow movie you will absolutely detest it. For me, I was kind of in the middle, but leaned more towards appreciating the film instead of loathing it. 'The Brothers Grimm' may just be unlike anything you've seen before.The movie like the story follows two con men brothers during the 1800s. They are Will Grimm (Matt Damon) the articulate and well-spoken older brother, and Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger) the younger, quiet but more intelligent brother. The two go around from village to village conning townspeople out of money for exterminating fake witches or ghosts. One day the come across a town that really is haunted by witches, ghosts and evil trees and they are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Since the town's children keep disappearing it's up to the Brothers Grimm to step up to the plate and save the day. Fargo's Peter Stormare co-stars as a French torture enthusiast and so does Brazil's Jonathon Pyrce (who you may remember as the 'Engineer' in the original Broadway production of 'Miss Saigon') as the greedy and cowardly French army general who hires the Brothers Grimm to stop the evil of the haunted town.The film has a lot of comic relief -- some funny, some unfunny and some plain sick and in poor taste. Matt Damon is kind of so-so in his role, while Heath Ledger is surprisingly pretty damn good as Damon's shy little brother. Peter Stormare is hilarious in his scene-stealing role while Jonathon Pryce is solid in his kind of nothing role. One thing that can be said is that Terry Gilliam does an amazing job directing this (as always). The film is jam-packed with awesome cinematography and that beautiful and brilliant Gilliam vision. Ehren Kruger's script is very mediocre however, and it drags constantly.In conclusion, I can't recommend this neurotic splice of cinema for movie theater viewing. However, I can recommend you rent it when it comes out on DVD though. But, I can't recommend the film if you have an intolerance for seeing kitties getting cut to ribbons. YUCK!

83,bregund,What a pile of junk,4,8 December 2008,"I just saw this on the telly and it was awful! What a terrible script, and a terrible story. The movie wanders all over the place. Heath Ledger was a very gifted actor, but here he just stumbles and mumbles all over the place, then to make it worse costuming and makeup give him a beard and nerdy eyeglasses. You can almost hear Damon say ""how much stuff can you put on Ledger's face so he doesn't upstage me, since I'm the star of this picture. Plus, make sure my contract says I get 50% more lines than he does."" Here Damon is definitely the better actor of the two, but I believe that Ledger wasn't given much to work with.The actor who steals the show is, of course, Peter Stormare. A brilliant character actor if there ever was one, his presence on screen becomes a visual anchor that rescues the viewer from the meandering storyline that unfolds. Jonathan Pryce is normally one of my favorite actors, but I just can't get past his awful french accent. So good in Brazil and Munchausen, so awful in TBG. I'm still scratching my head over that one.That gingerbread man scene was bizarre, even for Gilliam. I don't know who makes gingerbread out of mud, maybe Sara Lee. And a horse shooting spider webs out of its mouth? I don't recall reading that story in any of the Grimm fairy tales. Besides, what kid gets up in the middle of a freezing cold night to comfort a horse? Overall the movie just didn't make any sense, and you could easily get a headache trying to sort out what Gilliam is trying to say. It's quite a boring film actually, most of the time the actors are standing around discussing what to do instead of actually doing it.

This is not based on one particular story, but rather includes elements and characters from many stories, and even more references and winks to other stories that are seemingly happening/happened in the same universe!

It's still much better than what most directors can put up on the screen on their BEST days! The movie starts out a little weak but really picks up momentum in the last half (as I now recall, I was a little unsure how I felt about ""Time Bandits"" the first time I saw it, too... until about the halfway point). Heath Ledger and Matt Damon play the brothers... a pair of tricksters who travel around Europe ridding superstitious villagers of fake demons and witches. Suddenly, they are captured by the French army and forced into investigating a case of several missing children... a case that has *real* supernatural elements: werewolves, moving trees, evil queens and lots and lots of creepy, crawly insects. Ledger has a lot of fun with his role as the more ""book-ish"" brother... but Matt Damon seems a little cast adrift at times playing a love-em and leave-em type. Peter Stormare and Jonathan Pryce maybe play their roles a little *too* crazily... Pryce's character, in particular, might have come off better if he'd been more villainous and less silly. Monica Belluci makes a nice Evil Queen but she's hardly in the movie at all. Lena Headey as Angelika, the tough, hard-boiled trapper/guide seems like she should be in another movie entirely... maybe ""Van Helsing 2""? At times the movie does seem to be just going through the motions but then suddenly some moment of totally outrageous Gilliam-ness happens to shake you up and get you interested again, i.e. the gingerbread man.

They're making a good amount of money until they happen upon a situation that really does involve magic, something that they're not quite equipped to deal with.Despite an interesting premise, The Brothers Grimm is a dull and cheesy mess. The worst part about the movie is the script. Ehren Kruger does a horrible job of trying to mix comedy, action and some horror into this fantasy film. The different genres don't fit well together and you're left with a mess. Ehren was just the wrong guy for the job and he should stick with horror films. Terry Gilliam does a decent job behind the camera but he can't save the film. At least the movie looks good though and it has that interesting Gilliam style.The acting is pretty poor and no one gives a good performance. Matt Damon is a pretty talented actor but he can't save the film. He's clearly a miscast here but he does appear to be having fun and this helps. Heath Ledger plays neurotic poorly and he's also a miscast. Monica Bellucci has a small role and she doesn't really appear until the end. She gives an okay performance, nothing special.Besides for the two lead characters, the rest of them are all really annoying. I guess they were trying to be funny but it was way over the top and pointless. The dialog is cheesy and most of it is pretty stupid. There were some funny lines but they were few and far in between. There's not a lot of action so don't go in expecting a lot. The running time is about 118 minutes but it feels so much longer. They could have edited a few scenes and a few characters so it wouldn't have been as long or as annoying. I know this is the type of film that's made for fun but I wasn't having any. The movie had a bunch of cool and creative ideas but they didn't mix well together and the film ended up being a big mess. In the end, the Brothers Grimm may be the most disappointing film of 2005 and it's not really worth checking out. Rating 3/10",The Brothers Grimm
89,nobbytatoes,Gilliam returns but not with the best film,6,28 November 2005,"In the late 19th century, the two brothers Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm have been going around the french occupied Germany vanquishing witches and demons; though its all a con, They stage the ordeals and take money away from the frightened villages. When they are caught out by Cavaldi and Delatombe; leaders of the French army, they are sent to a village where ten young girls have mysteriously disappeared. The Grimm brothers say it is the work of bigger con men than they, but are soon to find its not a con at all. When they seek help from local outcast Angelika to help them navigate the enchanted forest where all the girls have disappeared, they soon see there is a magical presence at work. The trees move on their own accord, a mysterious wolf roves the forest and a tower with no entrance stands in the middle. From old folk lore they find that an old queen is in the tower, over five hundred years she been in there with eternal life, but not beauty. She has been taking the children to cast a spell to regain her youth and beauty to satisfy her vanity.The Brothers Grimm is based upon the old Grimm fairy tales, and a patch work of other fairy tales. The story is grim and dark, yet thats what all fairy tales are based upon. Fairy tales have that underlying darkness to them, and they are brought to the front by Terry Gilliam. He has created a dark and Gothic world for all these fairy tales to flourish, yet they don't get complete justice. The story jumps around a lot, not keeping a consistent flow. Though the fairy tale references are interestingly incorporated, it seemed to get bogged down by them, not letting the main story of the queen to take the front.Terry Gilliam is a great and very eccentric director. He does have a wild imagination. You can tell that this story is perfectly suited for Gilliam, yet it doesn't reach the same level as his previous films. At times it felt you were watching Monty Pythons Holy Grail; with the crazy villagers, but the comedy falls on its face. Not even the crazy old crone has much comedy appeal. But Gilliams imagination does sore in the sets of Brothers Grimm, it has that distinct feel of Gilliam. The forest is amazing with the moving tress, the tower holding the decaying queen is quite impressive and the village is also impressive with a hyper realism feel.While Heath Ledger and Matt Damon while not giving great performances work very well together, you believe they are brothers. Lena Headey is wonderful as Angelika, she did the best performance of the film. Monica Bellucci was perfect as the seductive Mirror Queen, though it was disappointing that her role wasn't that big. Peter Stormare's hyper eccentric performance of Cavaldi verged on irritating which was disappointing as he is a very good actor and Jonathan Pryce was good as Delatombe, not over playing the french accent.Its jumps around a lot and its not Gilliams best, but it can be said that he doesn't make a boring movie.",The Brothers Grimm
90,Cinema_Fan,"Beautifully shot, let down by Ugly script.",6,8 November 2005,"I have just left the cinema, here in England, after watching The Brothers Grimm. I could not wait. What a disappointment.I really do enjoy Mr Gillian's work. As we drove to the cinema, we were looking forward to his latest piece. In places, it does have the Gillian trademarks, such as needing to look over and beyond the characters shoulder for example. This story is like entering a sweet shop, a pick and mix, the bag contained a little bit of everything, but in the end, it just leaves the taste buds not knowing what they have just eaten or what else they could have had if they had picked better.The whole experience seemed pointless and shallow, in some places the flavour was just none existent, not so much as holes in the plots but plots with holes. Some seemed totally wasted opportunities. My wife even started to doze off, I wished I had put on my thermals because when you fall asleep your body temperature drops, in the end I could not wait to leave. The sceneries were exceptional and I think that Jonathan Pryce is a very good actor indeed. Nevertheless, this film as a whole just left me empty and unfulfilled.",The Brothers Grimm
91,rdjeffers,David Jeffers for Tablet Magazine,5,3 October 2005,"Disappearing maidens and a sinister forest of walking trees are at the heart of Terry Gilliam's latest film, ""The Brothers Grimm"". Gilliam's dark humor and brilliant art direction is still visible, but little of the storytelling magic found in films like ""Brazil"" or ""The Fisher King"" remains. Seven years after ""The Man Who Killed Don Quixote"" died in production it seems as though Gilliam has lost much of what made his work unique. While reminiscent of Stephen Sondheim's wonderful fairytale anthology ""Into The Woods"", ""The Brothers Grimm"" is a far less competent handling of similar material. The film does have its share of frightening and beautiful moments: the enchanting but cursed Mirror Queen high in her moldering tower, the image of a floating Ophelia-like beauty, and a young girl swallowed whole by a web spinning horse, but overall this film is a tremendous disappointment.",The Brothers Grimm
92,Quicksand,Gilliam's Lone Black Mark,5,26 August 2005,"This is the only Terry Gilliam movie that I would not recommend to anyone.It's not the fault of the actors, who are actually quite game and put in very good performances, with what they are given. Heath Ledger isn't usually the comic relief, and has some good moments, but they are few and far between as the movie rushes along at such a breakneck pace, there's time for zero character development.It's not the fault of the director, who has been amazingly consistent over his 20-year directing career, including his Monty Python work. One of his earliest, ""Time Bandits"" was clever, dark, and visually stunning, and found a way to balance each of those things for a result that was as weird as it was entertaining. ""The Brothers Grimm"" is all of those things, but isn't weird, and isn't entertaining. It's just loud.It's not the fault of the crew; not the fault of the costumers, the make-up artists or the production designer. I loved the score, it's a shame such memorable work was wasted on a bad movie. The cinematography was nothing special, note also that Gilliam's first choice of cinematographer was rejected (fired) by the Weinsteins; I thought replacement Newton Thomas Siegel had a wonderful visual flare in ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" but this movie just doesn't look like a Gilliam movie. There are maybe 1 or 2 uniquely Gilliam shots early in the movie, but the final 30 minutes could have been directed by anyone.Regardless of the Disney/Miramax breakup, I see no reason to blame the (lack of) quality of this movie on anyone other than the Weinsteins. Previous to this, ""Brazil"" was Gilliam's most famous ruined-by-the-studio debacle, but we have a new champion. Luckily, enough of ""Brazil"" existed on the cutting room floor for Gilliam to recreate his vision on DVD. But with Grimm's tiny sets, by-the-numbers camera work and lack of any character, quiet moment or even an intelligent thought, this movie should pretty much be forgotten as quickly as possible.I'm more often against Ehren Kruger (Scream 3, Reindeer Games) than for him (The Ring), but I think the reason ""The Ring"" remake was so good was because of its directors slow build, lingering camera, and quiet moments where we could see the actors ACT, which lends more character development than what's on the page. There's none of that in ""The Brothers Grimm,"" though I can understand why Gilliam would soldier on, after his infamous problem getting ""The Man Who Killed Don Quixote"" off the ground, and having not finished a film since 1998.Hopefully now he can get back to what he does best, away from Miramax and with his pick of screenplays. Because ultimately its Gilliam I want to see, not Bob and Harvey Weinsten and their fat fingers.",The Brothers Grimm
93,flingebunt,Oww,5,8 January 2006,"I am going to say something bad about a Terry Gilliam film, and so the sound of screaming you hear is the result of bitch slapping myself for each such comment.Terry Gilliam has made many stories about story telling, and it is an idea he seems to return to. I think it is because none turn to be perfect. The Brother's Grimm is perhaps his worst effort.In this story, Will and Jacob are really traveling con-artists using Will's scholarly knowledge of local fairy tales to create hauntings and then defeat these demons.Unfortunately the French (who occupied Germany at this time) recruit the brothers to tackle a real haunting.The resulting story is rather messy. Matt Daemon tries to copy (badly) Johnny Depps Captain Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean. Why, I don't know, maybe it was because the role was originally meant for Johnny Depp.In fact, of all the characters, on Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger) is bearable). The result is badly constructed, and when you consider a Terry Gilliam film has to be mayhem, without a good structure, it turns into a pointless mess.",The Brothers Grimm

What can I say. The password is WASTE. This movie was the perfect dish and than someone came in and sneaked dog food into the ingredients. I did not get this movie. It could have been a contender. It was just so silly and ridiculous. One dire situation was pretty much similar to the next dire situation. Of course being cliché , they had to throw a good looking peasant girl into the mix. The dialog was very simple . The direction seemed to go nowhere. I just found myself bored.

The acting was alright, except for Heath Ledger who did do an exceptionally good job. I had to remind myself that it was him, at times.Matt Damon, well, he played Matt Damon with a British accent...the C.G. effects were really not that good, and I was quite disappointed with the scare tactics. I'm sure if you're eight, the movie might be scary, but it's really not at all a dark film, and it's more boring than belief. It was slow, and painfully hard to follow, because it was so boring. The writing was terrible, and the direction was even worse. Had it been picked up a bit in movement, it probably would have been a much better film.The beginning really draws you in, because you think this is going to be a thrill-seeking ride, full of none stop adventures, thrills, spills and more...so not the case, though. It's bad, really, very boring.The set design, makeup, costumes, etc. were all excellent, and even the color and acting as I said before were good...but it wasn't enough to make the movie any better. It was a lot like 'Van Helsing', you expect so much more, but you receive so much less.I definitely don't recommend it, and can't imagine who would.",The Brothers Grimm
96,tburke85,The Brothers Grimm A Good Dark Fairy Tale Movie,7,19 June 2009,"The Brothers Grimm is a good dark fairy tale movie. It may not be the best film I've ever seen but it certainly wasn't the worst either. Matt Damon and the late Heath Ledger are solid as the Grimm brothers traveling con artists who encounter a genuine fairy tale curse. Director Terry Gilliam is admirable in making this movie that does have a slow pace at times but the good outweighs the bad in this one. The rest of the cast including Leana Headey, Peter Storemare, Jonathan Pryce, and Monica Belluci in a brief extended appearance are effective as the supporting characters but some of them lack screen time because most of the focus is on Damon and Ledger which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The movie does have humor, some suspense, cool special effects, well executed action, and the perfect location for this story of the Grimm brothers to take place. Despite some flaws with the pacing and character development, this movie really isn't that bad. Overall The Brothers Grimm is a decent fairy tale with some action, humor, suspense, impressive special effects, and good performances by the cast(especially Damon and Ledger) who make this film worth watching at least once.",The Brothers Grimm

Perhaps because the stories you know don't turn out the way they ""should"", but there's always a sense of disappointment in spite of the wonderful special effects and downright gorgeous look and feel of the film. I could use a more appropriate analogy, but for here let me say it's like when you are feeling like you're going to sneeze and go ahh...ahhh...but the sneeze never comes.

98,rparham,The Brothers are boring,5,28 October 2005,"After a seven year absence from the directors chair (lengthened by the abortive attempt at filming The Man Who Killed Don Quixote), Terry Gilliam has stepped back behind the camera to bring us The Brothers Grimm. While I applaud Gilliam's return in any form, it's unfortunate that The Brothers Grimm is the herald of his return. While it has it's occasional charms, Grimm is a grim affair for the most part, indeed. With a lackluster screenplay, glacial pacing and little character development to care about, Brothers Grimm proves to return Gilliam with a whimper, not a bang.The film creates a fictional reality where the Brothers Grimm, Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jacob (Heath Ledger), move from town to town, discover ancient legends of demons or witches for that region, and then create an elaborate hoax to then demand money from the residents of the area to ""take care"" of their problem. The brothers are eventually found out by a French general (Jonathan Pryce) and order to go to a small German village where children have been disappearing under mysterious circumstances. The general believes it to be the work of hucksters like the Brothers Grimm. Upon arrival at the village, the Brothers are led into the nearby woods by a local tracker, Angelika (Laura Headey), whom both Jacob and Wilhelm become smitten with. It is in the forest that strange happenings begin to manifest: trees that appear to move under their own power, a wolf that shows more personality than your typical four-legged beast and a giant tower that reportedly holds the spirit of a cursed Queen (Monica Bellucci) who desires to live forever. The brothers quickly reach the conclusion that this is no hoax, but a real haunting and try to solve the mystery of the Queen and the tower before the entire town is claimed.It's obvious The Brothers Grimm desires to be comedy and a romance, along with a fantasy. Unfortunately, it doesn't really succeed at being any one of them well. Yes, there are a few chuckles here and there, but nothing really outrageously funny. The romance is dead on arrival and while there are fantastical elements, there is nothing to really hold your attention. The Brothers Grimm's first problem is it's lack of character depth. None of the films characters really register at all. Matt Damon is a capable actor who has held the attention of the audience well in two Bourne movies, but here he is completely without depth or interest as Wilhelm. Heath Ledger's Jacob is even more of a dead weight than his on-screen brother. The film's romantic triangle between Wilhelm, Jacob and Angelika is completely without any fire whatsoever. I felt no chemistry between any of these characters at all and couldn't really care if any of them ended up with the other or not. As the film builds to it's climax, all I could feel is indifference to the on-screen events since I cared nothing for the characters.Gilliam is well known for crafting good-looking pictures, and The Brothers Grimm is not different. It's production design is remarkable and eye-catching. However, at least one key element of the film, a wolf that threatens characters at multiple instances, is one of the least convincing computer animated characters I have seen on screen in years. It is enormously cartoony and unrealistic, belying it's computer generated nature. When the wolf is on screen, you can't help but notice it's an effect.All in all, the Brothers Grimm is a listless fable that had some interesting potential to re-examine famous fairy tales, but doesn't deliver on any level. I have a feeling this is one fairy tale few parents will share with their children.",The Brothers Grimm
99,NJMoon,Fractured Fairy Tales,4,30 August 2005,"I guess it's no shock that a film titled THE BROTHERS GRIMM has nothing at all to do with the actual Brothers Grimm. After all, who wants to see a film about writers? Where's the action and adventure in that, eh? Instead, Director Terry Gilliam and cohorts contrive to make the famous fairy story scribes into something resembling 19th century Ghostbusters. Accepting this shoddy premise, the film begins with a promising flashback (something about beans) and then resolutely shies away from character development for the ensuing two hours. The writers have forged a plot that would boggle the mind of the most intrepid film-goer. Even the anticipated humor (expected due to Gilliam's comic lineage) falls flat. Despite nearly constant action, the film goes nowhere fast and never hits it's stride.Heath Ledger and Matt Damon struggle in vain to bring their flatly written fraternal figures to life but they aren't up to so great a task. Experienced Brit thesp Jonathan Pryce wields an obnoxious French accent like a weapon and Peter Stormare is just as unforgivably idiotic with his Italian dialect: a Brit and a Swede doing French and Italian accents in a Czech film about German brothers starring an American and an Australian. Do you wonder this film is a muddle? Gilliam - as usual - is much more at home with atmosphere than storyline and the film is often fascinating to look at. But it is overly long and the sightseeing trip through the enchanted forests of Bavaria gets old fast. Now if someone would just make a film about clever writers... that might be worth investing 120 minutes in. Who ya gonna call?",The Brothers Grimm
100,TheMovieMark,A fairy tale for adults ensues.,7,26 August 2005,"At no point in the development process of The Brothers Grimm did anybody set out to create a film that would one day air on A&E's Biography. Instead, Terry Gilliam has chosen to take the real life Grimm Brothers, wrap them up into the fictional, fairy tale world they created within their stories, and create a fairy tale about *them*.The result is a visually impressive story that follows the brothers' rise from frauds to heroes, all within the context of humor, fantasy, horror, and romance. If you're part of the growing number of moviegoers who constantly complains that nothing fresh and original ever comes out of Hollywood then here's an alternative. However, you might want to leave the children at home. Gilliam has delivered a somewhat dark fairy tale for an older crowd, and he obviously didn't bother himself with making sure this was safe for the average kindergartener. Thank goodness.The Brothers Grimm feels like it was made for those of us who grew up with Grimm fairy tales, so you need to pay close attention for the clever nods to characters from the original stories (particularly Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel & Gretel, and The Gingerbread Man). I've seen the movie twice, and I was surprised to find that I caught quite a few things the second time I saw the movie that I missed the first time around.A lot of the references are subtle and won't be appreciated by the average moviegoer who has no reference to the source material. I overheard one teenage boy at the screening sarcastically remark, ""What's next, the Big Bad Wolf? Why is the Gingerbread Man in this?"" Hey man, do you read much? Ever break away from action movies starring Ice Cube? No? Then try heading to the library someday, indulge in a little self-education, and broaden those movie horizons.Keeping in mind that Gilliam decided to let his off-the-wall imagination run wild every now and then, you might want to forewarn any friends that are animal lovers. I have one friend who doesn't mind seeing humans get killed left and right in movies, but she's reluctant to see any movie where an animal suffers fictional harm. Go figure. I don't want to reveal too much, but there's one scene in particular where I actually found myself audibly saying, ""Oh man."" I laughed, and I should probably feel guilty about it, but nah, every now and then it's healthy for us to allow the darker side of our sense of humor to prevail.Do things get a little goofy, a little cartoonish, and a little over-the-top at times? Of course! It's directed by the only American-born actor from Monty Python, so what else are you expecting? If you're willing to embrace a small amount of your PG-13 dark side, and you love letting yourself get wrapped up in fantasy and fairy tale worlds, then you very likely well find a lot to enjoy in The Brothers Grimm.",The Brothers Grimm

With the aid of Angelika (Lena Headey), they discover that the girls are being kidnapped in an attempt to revive an age-old witch (Monica Bellucci), who has been trapped in a tower her whole life.I appreciated how the movie took a different spin on the Grimm brothers and their fairy tales (including Hansel and Gretel, Rapunzel, the Gingerbread Man, etc.), but there was just something off about the film.

The special effects are abundant and there is a bit of humor that I liked. Damon and Ledger are really good as a team and play off each other very well. All the additional characters are fun and worth the laughs. Monica Bellucci is tantalizingly seductive as the Mirror Queen in a brief role. The script could have been tightened up a notch just to help the pace and some of the action and or special effects should have been curtailed. And if they focused a bit more on plot and character development the story would have benefited greatly. I for one wasn't offended too much by the mistreatment of animals, and I could have done without it. A little dark humor is sometimes permissible in action/fantasies. Overall: Decent.",The Brothers Grimm
103,arthera09,confused by the rating,8,14 May 2007,"I actually enjoyed this movie very much and I thought it was very clever. I thought the acting was exactly what it should have been. Heath Ledger was surprisingly funny and the only guy I did not like was the french dude. I loved the casting of everyone and even if the overall arch of the movie was cliché I thought it was very well done. The writing was extremely clever and it was a little more disturbing than I would have guessed going into the movie. Anything with kids getting kidnapped the tortured always makes me a little uneasy, but that was the desired effect. I knew the kids would be OK in the end, but it was still a little creepy. I didn't even recognize Lena Heady in the movie and I am glad I saw 300 before I saw this and it made her stand out after I realized who she was. I loved Monica Bellucci as the queen and any time you can cast Monica Bellucci as royalty you should. I think there was an inconsistency of the age of the sisters during one of the flashbacks, but I may be mistaken. Back to Heath Ledger I thought he pulled off the physical comedy very well. I thought the special effects were well done and some of the lighting go over the top (towards the eclipse), but since I was watching a pirated version of the movie I don't want to comment on the cinematography. I really liked the writing even if a lot of the stories did not quite match up, but I liked how the events of the story acted as inspiration for the stories we are familiar with.

They fake getting rid of the witches or whatever.

The wolf eating the girl especially, how awful was that? Some of the actors gave pretty good performances, but it's pretty hard to imagine after seeing this that Heath Ledger got an Oscar nomination in the same year.

108,samseescinema,feels disjointed and re-worked by many minds,5,7 September 2005,"The Brothers Grimm Reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comRating: 2 out of 4The Brothers Grimm is one of those films that was put through so many circus hoops in development that despite sporting one of the most impressive cast and crew this year, still managed to disappoint. Its spin-washed story, a tale obviously spun by numerous producers and studio execs and editors, feels dry and forced. But with the talented Ehren Kruger at the writer's helm, I find it hard to believe he would concoct such a convoluted story. Director Terry Gilliam has made numerous statements on the difficulty he had with the studio during production, particularly noting the firing of his cinematographer, a decision he claims to have been made by studio execs looking to minimize his control over the picture. And this studio trouble, I believe, is the problem with The Brothers Grimm. Similar to how Bewitched had a manhandled feel to its story, The Brothers Grimm feels disjointed and re-worked by many minds, never really congealing into one coherent tone. The film follows its title characters, the brothers Grimm, Jacob (Heath Ledger) and Wilhelm (Matt Damon), through their crash course in extinguishing the supernatural during 19th century French occupied Germany. Beforehand, they made a fine and famed living staging their supposed supernatural exterminator duties, hiring crews to pose as witches and ghosts, dreaming up elaborate combat choreography and conning the village people into a profit. That is, until they're hired by the government to investigate a poor village's mysterious kidnappings that just so happen to be real. The premise sounds simple and entertaining enough, but lacking in Grimm myth. To compensate, Kruger implemented Grimm's fables into the film's plotting. For instance, we witness the wolf's devouring of Little Red Riding Hood, the forming of the Gingerbread Man, and the kidnapping of Gretel. Also, the film opens with the tale of Jack and the Beanstalk, a running joke throughout the film. Although clever and well-imagined, these feel forced and poorly intertwined with the backbone story, only serving to distract instead of involve the audience further. Terry Gilliam's crazed style is widely known, particularly for 12 Monkeys and The Fisher King, as something both brilliant and insane. In The Brothers Grimm, Gilliam's style is blissfully relevant, it being the finest element of the film. And although Gilliam complains about losing his traditional cinematographer, The Brothers Grimm looks beautiful. Steeped in an impressive, fantastical atmosphere, the film looks precisely like the Grimm Fables brought to full, breathing life. Even the darker side to Grimm's tales is present, an element we can be sure Gilliam pushed for. But even the best atmosphere and cinematography in the business couldn't make The Brothers Grimm enjoyable. Matt Damon and Heath Ledger do well in their roles, offering some good comic delivery and chemistry, but the story never allows them to flesh out their characters. This even goes for the story itself. It seems the screenplay's too involved with incorporating more of Grimm's fables into its plot, but forgets to actually form the plot into something remotely decent. It all feels hacked together and clunky.In my opinion, The Brothers Grimm is a film that's played victim to Hollywood's development fickleness. It was filmed two years ago, and between the time since the wrapping of the shoot and theatrical release, Gilliam's had the chance to finish an entire other film (Tideland, to be released early next year). The Grimm Fables deserve a cinematic debut much better than this. Something developed away from studio pressures and financial concerns. And although this likely will never happen, I would recommend to pass this version up and wait for the unlikely anyway. -Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com",The Brothers Grimm

I wanted to walk out a half hour earlier but I strained and sat another half hour.The movie comes across as a comedy trying to be a fairy tale trying to be a horror movie trying to be a comedy again thinking no one would notice the inconsistent character portrayals and insults to the audiences' intelligence. And what was the story itself? If only I knew, but I think the creators and performers hardly knew themselves. It is a shame this took so much time to make this slop. Not even medieval audiences could tolerate this slap in the face.I went to see a movie about scoundrels who took advantage of the public by scaring them into believing fairy tales. I didn't want to see a movie that created scary creatures that seemed to do horrible things to children and adults only to have other characters appear to provide ""three stooges"" style ?""comedy relief""? while people and animals are being eaten, chewed up or tortured.WOW, what a mess this was. See it if you have to, but you were warned as best I could.",The Brothers Grimm
110,etsm92,Way better than I expected!,8,2 April 2006,"The Brothers Grimm/2005/***1/2Main Stars: Matt Damon Heath Ledger Jonathan PryceI know, I know. This film has been on OnDemand for a while now and yes I saw it a long time ago. But I decided to review it now. No problem. The film was better than I expected because I really did not want to see it. Don't ask me. I don't know why. Maybe because it's just I'm not a huge fan of grim fairy tales but this one really did catch my eye. It caught my imagination; it caught just about everything in me. The director, Terry Gilliam, is a talented artist especially in his career of the Monty Python series of TV shows/movies. So I was convinced to hear that he came out with this movie (that was after the thought of not liking grim fairy tales). So when I heard he was the director I prepared myself for not only a thrilling adventure but yet humor also. That's Terry Gilliam! What a nut! There were convincing characters. Even the French character, Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce), amused me because of his Napoleon-like acts. He was almost identical! The fairytale starts out obviously with the words Once upon a Time and then shows the year 1796 when the Grimm brothers (Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jacob (Heath Ledger) were just kids. Supposedly their sister was sick and needed curing so Jake (as they called him even though I don't think Jacob was nicknamed Jake back in that time) had brought beans that were supposedly magical (and is a symbol of the film somewhat) to cure her. Will (abbreviation of Wilhelm) got furious from the stupidity of his brother believing the beans were magical and punched him and they both went down to the ground and brawled. Next you see animation (most likely by Terry Gilliam) soon to engrave the words The Brothers Grimm as the title with a powerful brassy score in the background by great Italian composer Dario Marianelli. What exactly are the brothers trying to succeed in? What are their professions? Well they work together and are, in this film, trying to save Marbaden from the evil depths of the forest. Girls go missing, their parents worryThere consists of the witch in the tower with her servant hunting for her and helping her live. Will she become more beautiful? Younger? A conqueror? Well she's a witch, isn't she? She has power doesn't she? Find out. The movie goes on with stunning material and actually violent in some places. I surely loved the sets of the forest and village of Marbaden and the special effects to add in with the scenes. Matt Damon had an impressive fake British accent to give the film its British touch while Heath Ledger had more of an odd deep-voiced country folk accent. Jonathan Pryce also showed more acting on his part with the fake French accent. Different accents, different people, different tastes. It makes a film interesting and imaginative which this film succeeded in. Movie directed by Terry Gilliam.",The Brothers Grimm
111,cdelacroix1,Not Very Grimm,3,28 August 2005,"I went to see this movie yesterday, and was very disappointed. To be honest, though, I left after about 1/2 hour, due to sheer boredom; so my comments really only cover the first 1/2 hour. Maybe it got better later. But there seemed to be no hope of such when I left.I had anticipated something along the lines of Fantasy & Legend: this is named after the Brothers Grimm, after all. This movie really wasn't either. More of a huckster brothers tale set in period costuming with lots of mockery of the period. I especially don't like the latter on general principle: chronological snobbery is one of my most intense dislikes.I did like the richness of scenery, and the dark and gloomy feel. The scenes from the countryside early on in the movie were really lovely.Unfortunately, the humor and buffoonery cloyed for me very quickly, though, and I walked out. I frankly don't feel that I missed much. Alas.",The Brothers Grimm
112,Boggman,Grimm indeed!,3,30 August 2005,"I wasn't to impressed by ""The Brothers Grimm"". As a whole, this was not a very entertaining movie for me.The film certainly has an interesting concept: The Brothers Grimm (Matt Damon & Heath Ledger) are con-artists who go from town to town exorcising witches and demons and such from the local townsfolk. When they are recruited by a constable who forces them to battle the haunted forest of Marbaden to rescue several missing children (i.e. Gretyl, Little Red Riding Hood) they have no choice but to accept or be punished.The performances by Damon and Ledger are decent, and the cinematography is nice ""eye candy"" throughout the picture. The movie looks good, but it turns into crap less than halfway through.Clumsy direction, a weak script, faulty editing, & bad French accents, turn ""The Brothers Grim"" into a mess of a movie.Besides a few short but fleeting comedic lines, the ""Brothers Grimm"" was a real disappointment; and as far as summer films go, this was a total let down. You would think that after delaying the release of the film for a year (a clear sign of trouble) , they could have put something better together.Many people applauded in the theater applauded after the movie had ended. I am not sure if they were applauding because they liked the movie or they were just glad to see it finally come to an end.In the case of this reviewer, I'd definitely have to go with the latter of the two.",The Brothers Grimm
113,Movieguy_blogs_com,I would not recommend this unless you were are real die-hard Terry Gilliam fan,4,26 August 2005,"This is about the Brothers Grimm (Matt Damon and Heath Ledger). They are con-artists and have duped many in French-occupied Germany the Brothers Grimm can fight off witches and trolls. Truth is, it is all a con. Until one French General hires them to save a truly cursed town and they must battle for real.Director Terry Gilliam has brought his own vision to the screen of the Bothers Grimm. He has created a tale that draws from many of the Grimm's tales (Rapunzel, Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, etc.). However, I think he could have done a better job. It is certainly silly enough in true Gilliam fashion. But I think he had Matt and Heath perform too much improvisation that I do not think worked for this movie. What you end up with is just a bunch of different tales thrown together in a creative fashion that just does not seem to work with the cast.I would not recommend this unless you were are real die-hard Terry Gilliam fan.",The Brothers Grimm
114,Pasafist,A 4 Star Movie....With a Two Star Script,9,30 August 2005,"Some directors work best with their own material. They can use another persons' source material, like a classic novel or a newspaper article. But at the end of the process a film must bear the mark of the director. He must have many different credits. This is why many of the directors that most consider visionary best works come when they write, produce, and direct. This is the undeniable flaw of Terry Gilliam's latest film THE BROTHERS GRIM, it's got all the trademarks of Gilliam's brilliant attention to detail, it's whimsical, and full of life and color, and yet the screenplay is full of ideas that are not fully realized because they are so small in scope and Gilliam is too large in vision THE BROTHERS GRIM follows Wilhelm and Jacob (Matt Damon and Heath Ledger), the very namesakes of the title, two con-artists traveling around French controlled Germany in 1812. They have the whole countryside believing that they have killed trolls and battled all matter of evil thing, and it's not until they stumble into some real evil that the story gets going. Somebody has kidnapped 11 little girls and it's up to the Brothers Grimm to discover who's behind the nefarious plot. They are aided by Angelika (Lena Headly), a young woman who's two sisters were the first ones taken.To try to sum up the story any more would just confuse you. It's a story that is far richer in texture, Gilliam and screenwriter Ehren Kruger has bitten of a little more than they can chew. But they give it a shot and for the most part succeed. Some of the extraneous subplots involving the French Army are silly and stop the film cold. I could have also done without Peter Stormare's over the top acting, which at times was more grating than silly. I especially hated his thick French accent that render much of what he says unintelligible.GRIMM should be praised because what does work in the film works so well. I loved all the scenes in the tower. I loved every moment that the Brother's Grimm are in the forest. I love how Gilliam filled the forest with life. I loved the colors, and the drab textures and how they meshed together. I loved that the film made me laugh. It's so hard to find a film with such genuine and unforced laughs in it. I also believe the last twenty minutes of the film were breathtaking. Monica Bellucci was divine in a role that could have been played by any pretty little thing. In her hands and with Gilliam's attention to detail her final moments are as awe-inspiring as the dancing scene in THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN.As a matter of fact many will probably find many comparisons to the unfairly maligned film Gilliam made in 1989. Both films are rich in detail and try to handle too much at once, and yet both films are passionate and it's in their passion that the true beauty and wonder of our imaginations take hold. THE BROTHERS GRIM may have trouble finding a mainstream audience to embrace it. This is a film that will probably bore the masses and yet will find a cult audience that will eat it up. Like previous classics in the fantasy genre like LEGEND or Excalibur, GRIM is a film that will take DVD and cable to find its audience.I mast say the biggest disappointment is the ripped from INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM ending that felt tacked on and not needed. This film had a natural and far more interesting final shot before the film ends that I would have preferred but alas, I was not in the cutting room (but maybe I should have been).At the end of the day what doesn't work is the story which while layered takes very few risks. You can see what Gilliam is doing on the screen and how hard he's trying to overcome the weakness in the script and yet Kruger's script is far too small for Gilliam vision. I would have like to have seen what Gilliam would have done if he'd tackled the script as well. I see his personal touches on the screen. I just wanted a more personal touch on the story.All in all the BROTHERS GRIMM is satisfying. It's a good movie that will stand the test of time. There is an audience of people that will be receptive to it, even if the masses won't. It's a great concept film with a lackluster script.",The Brothers Grimm
115,fastmike,Like Black Forrest Cake!!,7,27 December 2005,"Talk about dark comedies! This is most certainly a 'fractured' fairy tale, with some scary moments, but really good special effects, some of 'which' might 'curl your toes'! Matt Damon and Heath Ledger, Peter Stormare and Lena Headey team up as 'spell-busters' to find the missing children of a village cursed by an ancient (once vainly beautiful) queen (Monica Bellucci), surrounded by a forest haunted and guarded by a really big really bad wolf. Ehren Kruger's screenplay and Terry Gilliam's Monty Python like direction use the famous Grimm's Brother stories to create a comical nightmare that 'weaves' together these bedtime tales into a wild, fast changing, non stop, and sometimes grotesque adventure. One caveat : this is certainly 'geared' towards adults, who will be reminded of those things that once frightened our imaginations as children! All in all : excellent entertainment!",The Brothers Grimm
116,I_Love_Spielberg,More could've been done do it,5,7 May 2008,"I'm a big fan of Terry Gilliam. I like his movies ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" and ""The Fisher King."" Quite frankly, I was very disappointed with ""The Brothers Grimm."" I felt that more could've been done to it, and it's not on the writer's part. I felt that the writing was great it was on target, but the direction was lacking a bit.Terry Gilliam didn't go nuts with the project, and I thought it was a great opportunity for him to just go nuts and come up with some completely far-fetched concepts, but he just stays too simplified with it. And that's where ""The Brothers Grimm"" fails to entertain.Now, one of the things that I did like were Matt Damon and the late Heath Ledger's performances. They were very good in the movie. Another thing that I thought was gross yet funny at the same time was were a cat accidentally jumps into a fan and gets completely chopped up. Then part of it lands on someone and the guy eats it. It was disgusting but it was funny at the same time.All in all, this movie didn't meet my expectations, but I'll still have respect for the director regardless. I hope ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" is better.",The Brothers Grimm
117,the_Poppuns,Pretty good,7,27 August 2005,"It could have been great but Matt Damon can't do funny. I think I knew that before this movie, so I'm not sure why no one else seems to notice. Now granted this isn't a comedy but I think you have to have comedic talent to be in a Terry Gilliam movie. I thought for a time that maybe Damon and Heath Ledger should have switched roles since Wlihelm Grimm seemed to be the larger role but then Jacob sort of took over and it would have been too much Damon either way. So what you wound up with was Damon not being able to handle the kitsch of Gilliam and Ledger being nearly wasted in the secondary role, which allowed Peter Stormare to steal the whole thing. The rest of the cast was fine. Monica Bellucci had a much smaller part than I thought, but that was perfect casting. There was another actress who I don't think I've seen before who was the lead, she handled the role just fine. Mackenzie Crook was in it for like half a second, which was disappointing as I'm a big Gareth fan.The story was good from what I could tell. It's difficult to get into a movie when you don't buy the lead actor so it took me a while to catch on. I thought the direction was great. Although I enjoy Gilliam's work sometimes there are patches here and there where he seems to go off track. Not here though. I thought the pacing and style were great. I wondered though if some of the more magical elements were cut out as it had fewer ""fantastic"" scenes than I anticipated. There were scary scenes involving children and I wonder if there weren't more that were cut out. All in all I'd say it was sort of like last year's Van Helsing, but good.It was definitely worth watching. And I'm sure that Gilliam fans and genre fans will enjoy it. But if anyone casts Damon in a lead role that requires comedic talent again, I'll have to put them in the comfy chair.",The Brothers Grimm
118,quiqueperezsoler,Missed opportunity. It either takes itself too seriously to be a fairy tale satire or has too absurd jokes to be a dark fantasy story,7,25 May 2020,"Could have been a Kingdom-Hearts-esque fairy tale crossover story but instead became a League-of-Extraordinary-gents-esque wasted potential one. The tones are so clashing they become almost mutually exclusive, one taking itself too seriously as a dark fantasy tale with more underneath that it leads on and the other stripping away the self-awareness of the story with jarring absurd humor and over the top performances reminiscent of the Monty Pyton but being too realised for it to fit in. It unfortunately never finds its place in any of the genres it's conveying and it's not a groundbreaking success of the mix because it feels disjointed. It succeeds in many things but are forshadowed by a damaging over-reliance onf CGI that now feels dated and caricaturesque humor. A pity really.What started as a well-realised setting with the inclusion of the Grimm fairy tales in not only the overall plot of the story with cameos or reinterpretations of the tales in fitting ways that concern the plot, but also in the backstory of the main brothers themselves; became a mismatched take on characters reaction to the world that surrounds them. At times being fully aware of the danger and delivering incredible dramatic performances only for the more humorous moments to fall flat for the over the top directed ones.It never uses the many tools and themes the gothic setting and the Grimm cautionary tales have as a potential horror take at them instead of the common light-hearted interpretation for kids. It feels as if it can't find a target audience because the gothic fantasy horror gruesome and gorish elements prevent it from being apt for kids but it takes itself too seriously to be a satire for the delight of the fans of Monty Pyton, of whose movies the director is famous for being behind of. Many narrative and backdrop elements are never exploited to enhance the story, like using the backdrop of the french occupation in as the antagonistic force to blame behind the horrors, kidnappings and mysteries. Like the russians were accused of being behind it all in 70s and 80s-based horror sci-fi movies, like Super 8 or Stranger Things.The dark visuals are in a way wasted, things like the pealing of hunted animals, the gorish and more grotesque aspects, blood and vermin. Or simply just played for laughs, to have a reaction of the people but never trully committing to one or the other, joke or dark creepy moment. It is something that is so incoherent and shocking, the audience would be treated to an increidbly well-captured setting or fantastic sequence, atmospheric and eerie , just to be brought down to earth with poorly acted humorous line deliveries. The tone is specially noticeable with the italian officer and the french, the rest are simply found in the many mannerisms of the lead characters, like Will flirtfully twisting the feather of his helmet while he listens to the female lead telling a haunting story to enhance the dark fairy tale setting, eeire fantasy music and all.It reminds of the tone in Tim Burton movies like Sleepy Hollow where there are some comedic and over the top performances or elements (like gadgets) in a backdrop of gothic dark fantasy. Unfortunately, this movie misses the mark because their actors, contrary to Tim Burton's, are never directed to give a characterization that doesn't take itself too seriously. In this film there are full on, dead serious faces and reactions from great actors like Lena Heady, Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. But they sometimes react so obliviously or self-aware that the story goes from bein well-realised and serious to an ironic light-hearted take on Grimm's fairy tale.It's not apt for kids unless it is meant as a cautionary movie but it never fully commits to that because the characters we follow are the main brothers and the story is that of a mystery. THe ending doesn't contain any glimpse of lesson learning or moral of the story, it only concludes the brothers' story which in essence it's what it should be.Nevertheless, credit where is due, while some of the CGI might be found dated it isn't as much because of the quality but really about the over-reliance on it. Some simple elements could have been done with practical effects but were instead recreated with special effects. The bond and relationship between the brothers is genuine and comes full circle in the end, their backstory shape their personalities which provide an engaging vessel to which experience the events that unravel and the conclusion, while predictable, is wholesome and emotes that brotherly love very well. Again, the acting on behalf of the three main leads is incredible.IN CONCLUSION, the movie is hard to recommend. It is adventurous but has some horror or grotesque elements that some might not like, it could qualify as a dark fantasy movie but the comedy falls flat and take you out of the eerie take at fairy tales; and it can't be considered a satire of the fairy tale genre because there aren't many ironic and humorous approaches at the fairy tale themes and it takes itself too seriously to be a self-aware movie. However, it has an engaging mystery story with well-portrayed characters and fantasy themes well fleshed out and reinterpreted to fit in the plot. It's creative and original in that sense, but that might just be its doom. You can't really put it in a certain genre of movie and the target audience is formed by open-minded flexible people.",The Brothers Grimm
119,Pingo-2,Disappointing,5,10 October 2005,"I'm quite a fan of Terry Gilliam and I simply love the Grimm-tales, so when I first heard that this was going to be made, with the Weinstein-guys producing and Monica Belucci in it, no one but me could be happier.However, they should've chosen a real screenwriter, instead of the hack Ehren Kruger. Sure, the story is kind of nice, and the script do have some nice things going on with mixing the Grimm-tales into a greater event.The comedy is, at its best, totally off and at its worst simply childish, silly and stupid. The dialog is terrible at some times. And all the modern references are quite embarrassing.Having a film about french and Germans where everyone speaks English is stupid by default. And it doesn't help with the boring accents.Everyone tries their best though, and Peter Stormare do make one of his best performances, so everything is not bad. Also, before mentioned Belucci is beautiful as usual.The effects are plain laughable sometimes, but mostly does its trick. This is more for people who wants to watch a movie to kill time, and not for cineasts who love to watch an intelligent story. Pure popcorn flick to be rented on DVD or caught on TV. I wouldn't pay much to see it though, it's not worth it.The IMDb rating on this one is pretty fair.5/10",The Brothers Grimm
120,Teknofobe70,Gilliam does Hollywood ...,6,5 September 2005,"Being a fan of both good old-fashioned fantasy movies and of director Terry Gilliam, I was really looking forward to this one. I was slightly put off when I heard Gilliam's complaints about the constant interference of the Brothers Weinstein, but the director does have a history of being dissatisfied with the production of projects which actually turn out pretty good in the end, so my hopes were still pretty high.Rather than being a historical biography of the famous authors, this is a fantastic make-believe story of the possible inspirations behind the stories of the Brothers Grimm. The brothers travel around Europe working as con artists, fooling simple peasants into believing they are witch-hunters and monster slayers. However, when they are captured by a French general and sent to investigate a town which is believed to have been targeted by similar con-men, they discover that there may be some truth behind the fairy tales. The very woods surrounding the town seem to be alive, a big, bad wolf stalks through the darkness and an evil power seems to emanate from a mysterious ancient tower ...So, Gilliam tries his hand at doing a commercial summer blockbuster. And the results are, well, interesting. Primarily he shows that he can produce some great action sequences, and there are some really great visual ideas here, many of which I'll admit are entirely thanks to top-notch CGI work. These are the moments when the director's creative magic appears to shine through, and there's enough of them to make this movie worth watching. Overall it does feel strangely derivative for a Gilliam movie, but I suppose that's to be expected when he sacrifices creative control to the studio. In the past I've heard that Gilliam simply sees himself as a ""hired hand"" on such projects.However, where it fails is in the mixture of action and drama, in repeatedly placing it's characters in peril whilst also making us care about them. Unfortunately this has been a problem in a lot of these big-budget fantasy/action movies lately, including last years equivalent -- ""Van Helsing"". The other movie with which this shares a lot in common is Tim Burton's Gothic horror ""Sleepy Hollow"", which was far superior to either. The main problem with the ""Brothers Grimm"" is that there's little to no character development in the first hour of the movie, and then almost all of the conflict between the characters is suddenly introduced in one scene. This is what we call bad pacing. And the way the characters are written seems somewhat inconsistent (although both Damon and Ledger manage to turn in decent performances all the same), and we never really get a ""feel"" for their personalities.For your average light-hearted Hollywood fantasy, this is perfectly fine. But from a director with a history of making fascinating, important works of surreal art, this is somewhat short of what you'd expect.",The Brothers Grimm

Good action with well placed humor.,The Brothers Grimm
122,cwrdlylyn,"THE BROTHERS GRIMM : Really Great, My Kind Of Movie...",9,4 April 2006,"THE BROTHERS GRIMM Terry Gilliam's THE BROTHERS GRIMM came out this past summer to lackluster box-office and reviews. It never got labeled an all out flop, but it was also never embraced by the public. It's a shame, b/c the film I saw was one of the most creative and visually engaging films I've seen in a long time.THE BROTHERS GRIMM (played by Heath Ledger and Matt Damon) are con-artists who convince frightened townspeople that they need the Brothers to rid them of evil spirits and fantastical creatures. However, all the hauntings are manipulated and created by the Grimm boys in an operation led in the business sense by Will (Matt Damon) and creatively by Jake (Heath Ledger).However, after getting arrested and threatened with death, the French Government hires them to go end another apparent ""hoax"" in a nearby village. When they arrive, they don't encounter other con-artists however... they encounter a very real curse being controlled by an ancient queen high atop a tower in the middle of the forest.First off, I must admit that I am a sucker for this type of film. I have always loved the traditional fairy tales and to see them re-imagined for a more adult audience and treated with utter respect is a sheer joy for me. The plot of this film includes little aspects from many different Grimm fairy tales... however, they are all taken out of context from the original fairy tale. Not only are we watching the adventure, but we are also watching what, according to this movie, were the influences for the fantastical stories the Grimm Brothers would later spread around the world.From a creative stand-point, this movie is perfectly geared towards someone like me. However, it has many other virtues as well. The imagery, cinematography, and art direction are superb. The film attempts to take the most artistic fairy tale illustrations and convey them to the screen while always embracing the looming darkness apparent in these stories... and it hits it out of the park.Also, the performances are very enjoyable. Matt Damon came off best in my eyes, perfectly playing up the bravada and arrogance of Will. Ledger is appealing as well, though at times he seems to be pushing it a little too hard to give a ""different/unique"" performance. Supporting players provide genuine comedic support, while Monica Belluci as the Evil Queen atop the tower is stunningly evil.Now I can see some of the flaws that critics pointed out at the films release. The film does have some plot holes, and a few parts really don't make much sense. However, these things didn't bother me. Despite some plot holes, I was still spellbound by the story while also captivated by the look of the film... and it provides some genuine chills along the way.In my opinion, THE BROTHERS GRIMM didn't get the respect it deserved upon it's initial release... and I strongly encourage any fan of traditional fairy tales to check this out if they haven't....

123,eichelbergersports,"""Grimm"" an interesting, creative and visually-intriguing film",7,25 August 2005,"Terry Gilliam, the only American member of the Monty Python troupe, and director of such quirky classics as ""Brazil,"" ""Time Bandits,"" ""The Fisher King,"" ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" ""The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen"" and ""Monty Python & The Holy Grail,"" among others, does it again with bizarre combination of Munchausen and Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow,"" with a little bit of ""The Village"" thrown in.This dark-humored film relates the completely-fictional story of the famous German brothers, Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jakob (Heath Ledger) Grimm, who created dozens of fairy tales and nursery stories for children in the early 19th Century. True to Gillian's idiosyncratic style, though, the movie plays nothing straight down the line. In this case, the brothers are con artists, traveling through the French-occupied German villages (remember Napoleon was big in those days) and playing on the fears and superstitions of their idiot occupants.Wearing goofy armor, shouting made-up incantations, and using hidden assistants, sleight of hand and other trickery, they fool these hicks into paying them big money, that is until they are finally captured by French forces, and sent to a town where several young girls have gone missing. The two arrive with little fanfare, as well as several French soldiers and Cavaldi (Peter Stormare, ""Birth,"" ""Bad Boys 2""), the evil Italian inquisitor of Gen. Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce, ""Brazil"") to try and solve the mystery. If they fail, they will be tortured and executed.Since, of course, they are fakes, they have no idea what they're doing but, with the assistance of a female trapper, they discover a crumbling tower deep within a foreboding forest. The woman remembers her father telling her the story of an evil queen who sealed herself up there to avoid a plague that was killing her subjects. It seems this tower and whatever now lives inside of it may be the cause of all the trouble.Borrowing heavily from ""Sleepy Hollow,"" the two have gadgets and inventions which were far ahead of their time (and thus completely illogical to those around them). Their efforts to solve the disappearances are clumsy and awkward, but somehow they stumble onto clue after clue. All the while they exchange silly and witty bon mots while trying to outsmart the bad guys and themselves. Even better performances come from Pryce and especially Cavaldi, who is evil, smarmy and pathetic.Always a stickler for historic details, Gilliam's costumes and set design are perfect for 1804 Europe (the film was shot in Prague), when Napoleon was at the peak of his powers and the continent was pretty much under French control.Weaved throughout the film are any number of the Grimm fables, including ""Cinderella,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Rapunzel,"" ""The Frog Prince,"" ""Little Red Riding Hood,"" ""Hansel And Gretel"" and ""The Gingerbread Man,"" among others, while the iconoclastic Gilliam throws in subtle and not-too-subtle jokes, dialogue and situations.Here, many who may not understand or appreciate the director's roots, may turn away and condemn the project, misinterpreting Gilliam's often-frantic camera-work and reliance on special effects as a metaphor for his lack of vision or ingenuity. Nothing could be further from the truth. ""Grimm,"" while certainly not up to the standards set in some of his earlier work, is nonetheless an interesting, creative and visually-intriguing film. Yes, it does tend to bog down every now and then, while the violent comedy, at times, is a bit forced, but, overall, that detracts little from the entire film.",The Brothers Grimm
124,myboigie,Terry Gilliam and Commerical Film-making,10,27 August 2005,"There is an unfortunate-viewpoint that cinema exists in some timeless-vacuum, unaffected by human-history and economics. This leads to extremely unfair expectations, and so it should be seen as a near-miracle that films such as ""the Brothers Grimm"" get made at-all.While the ""compromises"" between Terry Gilliam and the Weinsteins have been widely-reported regarding the Brothers Grimm, from my experience watching it last-night it appears Terry got his way in most areas. This should be good-news to fans of films that spark the imagination, and stay with one long-after a screening. This film succeeds in distilling the essence of the most cautionary fairy-tales our civilization is most-familiar with. It might sound funny, but I believe there hasn't been a film of this quality since the ""salad-days"" at UFA when Fritz Lang, Murnau and the rest of German Expressionism held-court.There are similar preconditions for the making of the Brothers Grimm that the classic German filmmakers had: a place with devalued-currency, namely Prague,in the Czech Republic. Prague is an excellent place to do any period-piece, and labor (much of it on the level of artisanship) is extremely cheap, and locations are numerous. This is similar to the situation in Germany after WWI, where the Mark was almost worthless, where supplies and resources were cheap, and where there was an abundance of skilled-labor. This is why only in the 1920s do we see such a flowering of German Expressionism and cinema, as it was a moment when cinema could flourish basically unfettered. Everything was new.Cut to now: the economic conditions are there, but cinema is not new, and producers have been running-roughshod over directors for the last 28-years unlike any other era since Hollywood's ""Golden Age."" Gilliam has been one of the few directors to fight this trend where producers have the final-cut, and almost total-control over the process, and this film is yet-another chapter in this battle. All this said, the film ""Brothers Grimm"" can also be seen as part of Gilliam's running-theme of the battle-between human-imagination (and empathy) and a modern, soulless-world of materialist philosophy where there is no magic, but only true ""disenchanment."" Life can be magical, but there is a cost.One can connect this film thematically to ""Time Bandits,"" ""Baron Munchausen,"" ""The Fisher King,"" ""12 Monkeys,"" ""Brazil,"" etc. . The Weinsteins can easily be compared-to the Burgomeister/Accountant in ""Baron Munchausen,"" as well as General Delatombe in Brothers Grimm who loses in-the-face of human wisdom and imagination. There is always this subtext to a truly Gilliam-based narrative, and this is why this film is so great, and a disciplined addition to the director's work. It is truly a great film in all-respects, and will be remembered while most films from this era will be forgotten. Michele Soavi's (Cemetary Man, the Church, the Sect and Stagefright) 2nd unit direction should also be mentioned as superb. Michele also did 2nd unit on Munchausen, another film that was unfairly-maligned, yet still shines some 16-years-later. You could do much worse than see this satisfying film this-summer. Treat yourself and see it! It is beautiful, and funny, despite Weinstein-meddling. They left ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" alone because they smelled-the-money.01.21.06 PS: A film that gets-better with successive-viewings!",The Brothers Grimm
125,lauraeileen894,Grim doesn't begin to describe it,1,6 September 2006,"This was easily the worst film of 2005, and certainly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. An overlong, uneven, visually ugly celluloid dung heap created by pompous, mainstream cult director Terry Gilliam. Gilliam, for the record, was the sole American of Monty Python and was responsible for those delightful and trippy animated sequences between skits. In a 2005 issue of Entertainment Weekly, Gilliam bragged how he should have directed the Harry Potter films, dismissing the first two, directed by Chris Columbus, as ""so pedestrian"". Well, that may be true of ""Sorcereror's Stone"", but ""Chamber of Secrets"" did ""Brothers Grimm"" couldn't: Columbus wised up and infused his second effort with lovely effects, a sense of humor and wonder, and, above all, heart. Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm (Matt Damon and Heath Ledger, respectively)... ooops, I forgot. In order to pander to young audiences, Gilliam has taken the liberty in changing their names to ""Will"" and ""Jake"". As if that weren't bad enough, Damon (not even attempting a European accent) and Ledger are so contemporary in speech and manner, the movie may as well have been called ""Will and Jake's Excellent Adventure"". Anyway, Will and Jake are actually a pair of con men who, using their own brand of special effects, dupe villagers into thinking that mystical creatures are attacking them and they pretend to defeat said creatures and run off with the reward money. Since Will is gruff and earthy and Jake is idealistic and dreamy, it's so far a rip-off of not only ""Ghostbusters"", but ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"". Now who's ""pedestrian""? But! One day! They find a village where supernatural events REALLY ARE HAPPENING! Didn't see THAT coming, didja?!!? It seems little girls are being stolen and possibly killed off one by one, and with the help of a moody huntress(Lena Headey, given nothing to do except look nice in red), they unravel the mystery of the woods where the girls seem to be being taken. Everything and nothing happens, and as if that weren't bad enough, no one gets the girl, we don't even know if they live happily ever after, and there isn't a trace of character development. A big fat nothing of an ending. The major problem is that the movie doesn't know who the hell it wants to appeal to. It's too long and ponderous for adults, but way, way too violent and disturbing for kids. Yes, I know the original fairy tales were actually pretty gory before they were toned down, but good Lord, the scenes here are enough to give any horror film fan pause. In one particularly lovely scene, a little boy's eyeballs fall out... let me repeat, A LITTLE BOY'S EYEBALLS! FALL! OUT! They land in the mud, and then all of a sudden the mud turns into a grotesque version of the Gingerbread Boy and jumps into a well. Say it with me: HUH!?!?! And then a horse is fed magic spiders (good thing PETA didn't see this), giving it an appetite for children, swallows a little girl whole, and then gallops into the forest, its stomach bulging with its victim's squirming body. Again... HUH?!!? As if that weren't bad enough, there are no likable characters. Not one. Will is an insensitive, greedy jackass. Jake comes off as a potential child molester with his ratty beard, filthy clothes, childlike belief in magic (Michael Jackson, anyone?), and incoherent mumble. Headey is just an empty object of lust and desire, much like Isabeau in ""Ladyhawke"" and Lara in ""Doctor Zhivago"". The whole damn thing is just a piece of unoriginal trash that isn't even good enough for the bargain bin. Please, don't feed Gilliam's undeservedly large ego... skip this one. That alone will be a happy ending for anyone.",The Brothers Grimm
126,pookey56,the brothers dimm,6,22 December 2005,"when i heard that Terry Gilliam was releasing a new film, with Matt Damon and Heath Ledger no less, about a genre that i love, i was over-joyed. I watched it in the theatres and then again on DVD, just to make sure my first impression wasn't off base. i'm not going to give away any of the story because there's nothing to give away. sure, there was Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Snow White, Hansel and Gretel, Rapunsel, all which led nowhere, except perhaps to lie in a stone coffin with brother werewolf's help all so that a five-hundred year old wicked witch could get her looks back. and mirrors, creepy mirrors, a familiar motif. and boy, she looked five hundred too. there was a dash of Sleepy Hollow, a pinch of Harry Potter, and the plot-line of Full Frontal only without the experiment. the art direction was OK and the period pieces were OK too. i'm struggling to find good things to say about this film because i have tons of respect for Terry Gilliam. Hence the six out of ten. my recommendation is that you wait until it comes to television. i wouldn't rent it. i think what Terry did best was somehow dumb down the sexiest guys around. they looked like extras from the town of dueling banjos. i didn't think that was possible.",The Brothers Grimm
127,Supachewy,Terry Gilliam's Fairy Tale,5,24 August 2010,"The fantasy film The Brothers Grimm is directed by Terry Gilliam and stars Matt Damon and Heath Ledge. The film takes place in Germany in the late seventeen hundreds.The film starts off with the brother Grimm, Will and Jake ( Damon and Ledger), as children in a small town in Germany. There other brother is very ill and Jake was sent out to purchase medicine but instead of getting it he instead bought what he believed to be magic beans. Then it goes several years into the future where they are grown up and are assisting a small town that has a witch in it. The brothers go and conquer the witch earning gratitude and monetary compensation from the town. But the brothers' secret is that they had their friends dress up as the witch and help with all the effects in order to scam the town. Then the French army, who occupied Germany at the time, retrieves the brothers and tells them that someone is pulling the same sort of shenanigans in another town and are kidnapping little girls. Little do they know that the other town is actually cursed...The plot for this film was weak. It is a fairy tale made up of all other fairy tales which was unique but a big problem with the film was that it was rated PG-13, and most of its target audience is younger than that. It probably would have made much more money if it was rated PG, it still wouldn't have been that good but it would have made much more money. Every comedic attempt in the film failed. They all just seemed awkward and injected into the script. Being that it was a fairy tale the plot was fairly predictable. Overall not the greatest screenplay by Ehren Kruger who wrote some exceptional films like The Ring.The acting in the film by the two leads was pretty good. Heath Ledger truly shined as the brother Jake being nervous, but confident in himself. It truly showed the range of Ledger by him being a nerdy guy when usually he is a tough, cool guy. Damon was fine, it was not a difficult part to play. I would have imagined a different casting decision for his part though since he was the older brother I would think that he would be bigger just to show his age. The rest of the cast did fine as well, no one was truly fantastic or stole the film away.The direction by Terry Gilliam was adequate but definitely not as good as some of his earlier films such as 12 Monkeys. The film just didn't seem to have his strange print all over it like most of his other films do and that is why I don't think I enjoyed it as much. It is also his fault that the humor did not work in the script. Overall he just made a normal fairy tale that was nothing special or memorable.The art direction and costume design in this film was quite good, everything looked like it was from the time period. The CGI did most of the work for the effects in the forest and that also looked fine. It was not Oscar worthy in any means but it got the job done.Overall I give this film a 5/10, everything was pretty weak but the acting which was mediocre. I think it was a big mistake not making this film for the PG rating, it would have been much more successful. I would recommend this film to fans of the fantasy genre.",The Brothers Grimm
128,mercuryix,Ehren Kruger - Why Was His Script Optioned??,3,27 May 2009,"This is probably the most incomprehensible muddle ever written. How it got optioned or sold is a bigger mystery than anything you will see in this film.Kruger has taken a piece of every Grimm fairy tale, and thrown it together out of context in a hodge-podge that has no structure, coherency or reason. Apparently, as a child, he was capable of seeing pieces of images from the tales, but never got the point of them. Terry Gilliam has proved that he genuinely does not care what or if his audience understands in his films. He has directed this to amuse himself, and that is enough for him. The dialog is not just unrealistic even for a fairy tale, it's incoherent. The characters' reactions to things are completely arbitrary and are not credible even in the sense of a disturbed cartoon. Example: The Napolean-like character of Delatombe gets splattered by body parts from a kitten that gets caught up in a machine; instead of being disgusted, he peels it off and eats it. Why? No reason. Just because it looks disturbing. The movie is filled with purposeless, arbitrary details like this, that detract from any kind of believable behavior in this film. It's impossible to review this movie, as there is no movie to review. The writer didn't care if his screenplay told a story, and the director didn't care if his audience understood it. The biggest crime in this debacle is that the screenwriter actually made money selling this. This is a quilt sewn together of pieces of better stories by better writers who had a moral and point to their tales; this ""story"" provides neither.",The Brothers Grimm
129,amethystwings32,A demented fairytale !,1,19 May 2012,"I love fairy tales, but this horrifying telling of the Grimms infamous tales. Was not one for children , when I saw the previews I thought wow this movie looks good ! But when I watched it I had a totally different reaction! It was awful , despite the special effects. The story behind it, was like walking into a really bad dream ! With every dark twist and turn the more disturbing it became ! And yet I found myself compelled to watch till the very end. Kind of like a book , no matter how terrible it may be! That was this movie , the only highlight of this grim tale. Was Matt Damon and the late Heath Ledger, portraying the masters of the macabre fairytale. Jakob and Wilhem Grimm , to sum it up this movie isn't for everyone ! If I want to watch a Gothic fairytale movie . It be Alice in Wonderland , Red riding hood or wait until Snow white and the huntsman is released. Before I would watch this again!",The Brothers Grimm
130,eched,Just plain sad,1,4 March 2006,"With the special effects that you would expect from a TV mini series, and the creativity of a six year old, this movie comes off very weak.The first flaw, like I kind of already said, is the special effects. The wolf is one of the worst cgi beings to ever step onto screen. The living trees only have moving roots, which they use to pull them around. The rest of the tree though stays completely still, causing the so called living forest to seem not so alive. In other films, like Evil Dead 2, the trees might have still not been done to well, but the whole tree moved, and was even given a bit of a personality, with this the trees move, and that's it, no real enthuses has been put on it, so it just seems plain.The tone of the movie is also all off. With it being in the country side with open settings, you would feel that they would steer the film in that direction. Instead the film tries to be claustrophobic with a dense set of woods and tight camera angles. But off course it seems very out of place with the film and just throws it off.Also, the film is painfully uncreative. About once every ten or five minutes a fairy tail will pop up out of the blue and it will be fallowed to a T, or change it in a 100% none logical way. One moment a girl is being taken to her death, the next she has suddenly turned into the ginger bread man, God only knows why. There's simply no logic put into the film as they try to cram every story there is into it.Also, try living threw the French stereotypes. Even if you're not French you'll be immensely insulted by just how typical and clichéd it gets.Lastly, and not least, is the film keeps on trying to be really dark, and then childishly goofy. To give you a good idea what I mean, they take a cat, throw it into a fan, have blood spray everywhere, and then try to turn it into a joke. It makes the film very unbalanced and you can't enjoy it on a horror or comedy level.So, in closing, stay away from the thing. After a hour and 14 minutes I couldn't take it anymore and had to turn it off.",The Brothers Grimm

133,scorfield-51711,Grim alright!,4,30 August 2016,"""Exactly what am I enduring here? Can somebody tell me who gave birth to this?""As in other Gilliam projects, this production was subject to a difficult birthing process, taking two years to complete, and having its release date pushed further and further back. When will it dawn on both the studios, and Gilliam himself, that his skills are far better suited to employment within art direction rather than sitting in the director's chair. No one can doubt that visually his movies are always resplendent. Yet, he often misjudges pace, and fails to attend to directing his cast to refine their performances. Overall, his movies can, and in this case certainly does, descend into cheap vaudeville comedy. The sole fact of his close proximity to the writing members of the Python team has not endowed him with their creative ability in terms of comedy, with many of the supposed jokes embedded within the script being nothing more than simple buffoonery. Much of the blame for the film's deficiencies have been lain at the door of the original scriptwriter, Ehren Kruger, and studio interference. Yet, Gilliam must be held to account for the rewrite he undertook - he and fellow co-writer, Tony Grisoni, (who had written the screenplay for Gilliam's last movie, 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas') having to be credited as 'Dress Pattern Makers' to avoid problems with the 'Writers Guild of America' - with a treatment which completely detracts from any of the dread and mystery of the original tales of the eponymous brothers. The premise behind the screenplay could have held great promise in the hands of a director who could have dissuaded members of the cast from treading the pantomime boards, and from adopting accents worthy of the worst of television comedy serials. In this film, the fairy-tale authors are recast as travelling con-artists playing on the suspicions of the rural indigenous population of French-occupied Germany at the end of the eighteenth century. The elder brother, Will, played with a strained British accent by Matt Damon, is an unapologetic pragmatist and ladies-man, while his younger brother, Jacob is a reserved bookish dreamer. In fulfilling the latter role, Heath Ledger, plays a nervy mumbling character who becomes a source of irritation, leaving many of his contributions indecipherable. One wonders if both would have been better served had they not jointly appealed to take on the role originally intended for their fellow co-star. The brothers are arrested and offered reprieve from the guillotine if they agree to unmask those responsible for a series of child disappearances within the nearby Black Forest. The French general who charges them with this mission is played by Jonathan Pryce, whose appalling French accent merely serves to reconfirm to this reviewer his true worth as an overrated ham. Meanwhile, Peter Stormare's agent should have really tried to dissuade him from adding his pantomime Italian sidekick to his CV. The only members of the cast to emerge with any credibility are the female contingent in Lena Headley, as the disinterested romantic interest for the brothers, and Monica Belluci, truly worthy of the epithet 'the fairest of them all'. In attempting to discover a rationale cause behind the disappearances, the brothers are forced to reassess their belief in sorcery and magic, while Jacob notes down much of what they witness serving as the germination for many of the Grimm's famous tales. As such, the plot is littered with clumsy attempts to incorporate as many of the tales' characters as possible, leading to ever more surreal and ludicrous inventions. The worst of these has to be the appearance of a gingerbread man, evidently made of mud, the CGI for which would suggest that this character was left on the cutting floor of a very early forerunner for 'Ghostbusters'. Though, the appearance of Damon and Ledger in frilly frocks 'a la Terry Jones' to incorporate reference to Cinderella runs it a close second. The final twenty minutes to half an hour rescue the production when the antics give way to the Belluci story-line which has the necessary Gothic atmosphere so lacking in the rest of the running time. This not only displays the undoubted talents of cinematographer, Newton Thomas Sigel but also the finer pieces of the film's score from Dario Marianelli.",The Brothers Grimm
134,zerogirl42,A Light Romp Through the Grimm Woods,9,7 September 2005,"My rating is based on my love of strange, unclassifiable films that make me laugh. There haven't been many films in the past five years that have an absurd, comedic element. The closest I can think of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but for these types of films, The Brothers Grimm delivers. There are touches of Monty Python humor and some amazing visual effects scattered through out. Gilliam captures the look of another time amazingly well. People have bad teeth, dirty clothes, messy hair and poor hygiene. This creates a great back-drop for the hauntingly beautiful actresses in the film. It's lighter than Gilliam's more recent films, but it had a wacky pacing more like Time Bandits. I like when a movie doesn't try to spoon-feed me. There's an interesting dynamic that goes on between the brothers and their relationship to magic. What other reviewers call distractions were entertaining and creative tangents that always had some element to help the viewer understand the characters better. It was so refreshing to see a film without product placement. Gilliam has a talent for creating a totally different reality. There were a lot of fun elements in The Brothers Grimm. It reminded me of eating a bunch of Jellybellies (lot's of variety, fun surprises like the red inside the watermelon flavor, and weird flavors like when you bite into a coconut one and get a popcorn one instead). Unfortunately, I know someone is going to compare it to Bertie Bott's Beans. Oh well.This film is not for everyone. There are some gruesome parts that are not for the squeamish (I'm an animal lover and had to cover my eyes for one scene, there's no sugar-coating). Also I would have changed or deleted the last five minutes of the movie. If you like fairy tales and fun adventures, this might be for you, but don't expect a deep film like Brazil.",The Brothers Grimm
135,kylopod,Does not do justice to its subject matter,4,8 October 2006,"People have a curious tendency not to notice how bizarre and gruesome children's fairy tales often are. Terry Gilliam's ""The Brothers Grimm"" does notice. Unfortunately, that's just about its only insight into the subject. The film shows no understanding of what makes fairy tales memorable and exciting, or why they have endured through the ages.A much better handling of the subject is the 1962 film ""The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm,"" which intersperses a realistic though nonfactual account of the brothers' lives with dramatic recreations of the tales they collected. I'm not saying that Gilliam had to do a retread of the same material. I would be very happy to see a remake with a radically new approach, as long as it respects the underlying subject matter. Gilliam's film does not. Its storyline is mostly a long string of fantasy and horror clichés that remind us far more of contemporary movies than of classic fairy tales. The Big Bad Wolf, for example, has been reduced to a standard-issue wolf-man (brought to life with digital effects that are just a tad too jerky to be excused in our age of high-tech movie-making).In this version, the brothers (Heath Ledger and Matt Damon, both inexplicably adopting English accents) are con artists who go from town to town posing as conjurers who can protect the local populace from evil spirits. A French general (Jonathan Pryce) catches on to what they're doing and forces them to work for him, on pain of death. But when they're sent to a new town, their old tricks prove useless against an age-old curse that really does haunt the woods.The movie belongs to the old genre where famous writers become characters in their own stories. It's a genre I've never much liked, maybe because it suggests a failure to comprehend the powers of human imagination. (""No one could have made up these stories; they must have really happened!"") But I have enjoyed a few films of this kind, such as the 1979 movie ""Time After Time,"" where H.G. Wells builds a time machine and travels to the 1970s in pursuit of Jack the Ripper. This type of story has to work hard to achieve the willing suspension of disbelief. ""The Brothers Grimm"" fails on that front because it changes its reality too often. In an early scene, we're shown an intense battle with an awesome-looking banshee. Then the whole battle is revealed to have been staged. And then, later on, we're asked to believe that magic really does exist in this world after all. These repeated shifts in the story's reality are profoundly disorienting.The source of disarray in the woods is an undead queen (Monica Bellucci) trying to regain her youth in an elaborate spell that will be completed once she sacrifices a series of children from the town. She resides in a tower in the woods, appearing as a skeleton on one side of a mirror and as a beautiful woman on the other. Her magical control over the woods serves as an excuse for numerous scenes of mysterious enchantment, most of which have a very tenuous connection to the central plot. The trees in the forest seem to have a life of their own, walking around when no one's looking. A mysterious creature lurks at the bottom of a well. The wolf-man is a servant of the mirror queen, using magic to ward off would-be visitors. But a coherent story never emerges from these elements. The screenplay seems to make up the rules as it goes along, inventing whatever is convenient at any given moment. Every now and then, some familiar quote is referenced--""Who is the fairest of them all?""; ""What big eyes you have""; ""You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man""--but always gratuitously. The movie's magical story is formless and convoluted, lacking any consistent narrative logic. It comes off as a series of elements arbitrarily glued together.As a result, the magical sequences lack payoff. We keep waiting for something wondrous to happen, then nothing does. In one sequence, for example, two children named Hans and Greta are making their way through the woods, leaving a trail of bread crumbs in their wake. We eagerly await the children's encounter with the gingerbread house run by the cannibalistic witch, or at least something of comparable interest. But just about the only thing that happens is a mysterious sequence involving a levitating shawl. Like many other sequences in the film, this one doesn't go anywhere and has only the faintest connection with the mirror queen story.No doubt there's an important theme at work in scenes like this. The movie is suggesting that the classic fairy tales are the result of accounts that have been embellished over time. But other writers have handled this theme much more effectively. Gregory Maguire's novel ""Wicked,"" for example, turns ""The Wizard of Oz"" into a sophisticated adult fantasy with complex character motives and sly social satire. In that novel, there is a definite implication that we are being told the ""real"" story, and that the conventional version is the corruption. But the novel handles this conceit by expanding on the story, not degrading it. There's no point in creating a revisionist fairy tale if it's going to be less fleshed out than the original.",The Brothers Grimm
136,miloc,Minor but fun Gilliam,6,10 December 2008,"Steven Spielberg is often accused of being one of those directors who try to ""awaken the child in all of us."" This accusation, unfortunately, is largely true; Spielberg's sentimental idealization of childhood has at times overwhelmed his considerable skill at depicting it. ""E.T."" may have brought magic to our youth, but if you've never balked at that movie's emotional false notes than you probably haven't seen it lately.Terry Gilliam, likewise, has set out to recapture childhood, but with a difference. Gilliam doesn't have Spielberg's craft, but he has a surer knack for catching a child's sensibility than almost any other director living. When, in ""The Brothers Grimm,"" a horse swallows a young boy whole, then opens its mouth to show the boy struggling frantically in its gullet, the image is so outlandish that it's both genuinely scary and genuinely magical -- the kind of wild nightmare your friends in school once laughed at you for finding terrifying. Throughout the movie you can feel Gilliam taking giggling delight in making fairy-tale nonsense real: a witch's hair snaking down from a tower, an ambulatory goon squad of trees, a hostile gingerbread-man, a fearsomely agile wolf to chase Little Red Riding Hood. Unlike Spielberg, Gilliam doesn't seek reassurance in youthful fantasy. He stays aware of its alarming ambiguities. Think of the boy at the end of ""Time Bandits,"" staring at two smoking holes in the grass. He's free to adventure his way through the Universe, every child's dream, but his parents have after all just exploded... so what now? ""Mum? Dad?""The images stay consistently inventive, and the performers seem to have fun dodging around them. Matt Damon is perhaps a shade too slick as Will, but he has star presence and does well enough. Heath Ledger does something rather interesting with Jacob. He has slightly mangled diction, like a teenager wearing orthodontic headgear, and quick, spastic hand movements. He makes himself into a scholar-nerd with bookish dash, and he's quite engaging. Peter Stormare and Jonathan Pryce get fun accents to play with, and a ravishing Monica Belucci hisses erotically as the villainess.Gilliam's flaws are undeniably visible here. As ever, he lets production design distract him from the narrative, which here and there falls limp. His characteristic weakness at developing strong adult female roles shows in Lena Headey's Angelika, who's allowed to be tough and unconventionally attractive but little else. (Gilliam's most effective female characters showed up in one of his weaker films, ""The Fisher King."")""Grimm"" is a minor Gilliam. It doesn't engulf you like ""Brazil"" and it doesn't haunt you like ""12 Monkeys."" But it deserves better than the lukewarm response it got from critics and audiences at release. It's lightweight, but it's as entertaining as any recent blockbuster and in general far more interesting to watch. Gilliam has suffered from his difficult reputation with the film industry, and he may be now suffering for different reasons with the rest of us -- when one of his movies actually makes it to the screen it's enough of an event that we feel cheated if it's less than transcendent. ""He could do better,"" we say; yet even a visionary is allowed simply to have fun, yes?",The Brothers Grimm
137,ElmStreetsLastBrat,"Stylish and Innovative, but didn't really catch my interest",5,19 February 2007,"The Brothers Grimm isn't a bad movie. I thought it was stylish and innovative and the cinematography was breath-taking, but I got bored with it after a while. But I'm also not into those fantasy/fairy tale type of films. I only decided to watch this film because there was really nothing else on and I had never seen it before. I just lost interest in this film after the first hour or so and it seemed to just drag on and on. I like Matt Damon and Heath Ledger and they were great in this film as the Brothers Grimm. They were perfect for these roles because they look so much alike! But all the adventures these brothers went through and being introduced to so many new characters became tiresome after a while. I'm not saying it's a bad film, I just didn't' care for it. It's creative and the cinematography is exhilarating to see but sometimes you can have too much! And it was creepy too! I don't care for films that make you feel like you need to shower afterwards or make you feel like there's something crawling on your skin. I hate that feeling with a passion!

138,TensersFloatingDisk,Wasted potential,4,31 January 2006,"What an unfortunate waste of a lot of talent. Terry Gilliam's direction is paper-thin here, partially a result of squabbles with the studio over commercialization, and you can almost feel a sort of visceral ""click"" between scenes as the plot and characterization jump from rewrite, to rewrite, to rewrite. The acting, even from remarkable talents like Heath Ledger and Jonathan Pryce, comes across as empty, soulless...half of Ledger's lines are mumbled into his scruffy beard as though he didn't actually have a written script, and was just told to wing something. Then ending, in particular, doesn't show the courage of its convictions.The real hell of it is that the premise for the film is absolutely stellar. I mean, a juxtaposition of phony fairy-tale milking hacks with a real magical background, set against a political fable? Should have been gold. Instead, for a movie which claims that substance,and words, are more important than imagery,what we get is a lot of colorful eye candy with little discussion, little explanation, and little reason.I wish I could go back in time and rescue this idea for a more worthy crew of filmmakers.",The Brothers Grimm
139,hugobolso-1,Where is Samantha Morton?,5,2 September 2006,"The story could be mesmering, but in fact there is one big (among others) mistake. The character of Angelika was original thought for Samantha Morton, but the Weinstein brothers replaced for Lena Headey. Even when Lena isn't a bad actress, hasn't the mysterious and soul of Ms Morton. And the movie flaw because of her. Monica Bellucci in the other hand, is very well cast, and save the movie for the total fiasco. The other thing is that there is not much chemistry between the brothers. Surprisingly Heath Ledger gives a much superior acting than Matt Damon. And finally, as a Terry Gilliam movie, Jonathan Price is there, and even when is a a big flaw, Gilliam pulse is always something interesting to see.",The Brothers Grimm
140,perlner,highly entertaining,7,29 August 2005,"Are you familiar with the Grimm fairy tales? Did you like the way ""Shakespeare in Love"" explained how Shakespeare might have gotten his ideas for ""Romeo and Juliet?"" Did you like ""Shrek?"" Are you a fan of Matt Damon or Heath Ledger? Do you think Monica Bellucci is hot? If your answer to any of the above questions is ""yes,"" and you are willing to suspend disbelief (because boy is this movie inconsistent if you actually think about it) this film will provide an entertaining diversion. It's funny, interesting, exciting, and even a little scary (so don't bring your little children if they get scared easily).The premise - Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are the Brothers Grimm, famous around French-occupied Germany for driving away demons, though they are, in fact, con artists with fancy gadgets and conspirators for special effects. They use the money they collect for their ""services"" to finance their operations. The French occupying government catches them and sentences them to death, unless they out-con the conman who is causing little girls to disappear in a town alongside the woods. In this town and the neighboring woods are the inspirations for numerous Grimm fairy tales, including Hansel & Gretel, Rapunzel, and Little Red Riding Hood.The characters aren't the most deep of film characters, but they are developed enough to be distinctive and convincing. Will Grimm (Matt Damon) is the brains behind the team, with a very realistic desire to protect his brother, even as he harbors a constant anger at him for blowing the only opportunity to save their little sister's life when they were children. Jake (Heath Ledger) is the dreamer, convinced that there is truth in legend, and that with courage and effort, any problem can be solved. Predictably but not boringly, the two of them provide the perfect team to fight what turns out to be a real-life, magical, evil danger.The special effects aren't the best; some of the cgi creatures move quite jerkily, but when they're good, they work. The sets are beautiful, and fit the Grimm fairy tale world well. The costumes are likewise gorgeous and apt.If you think about this film enough to ask questions like, ""if evil magic was real, how come the brothers are famous instead of having been discredited the first time they pretended to fight off a real evil presence and it continued to haunt people?"" then you will be disappointed. However, if you are willing to suspend disbelief, you'll be in for an entertaining summer popcorn treat.",The Brothers Grimm
141,Galagonya,Brothers Grimm awake your worst childhood nightmares.,10,25 June 2007,"I am surprised to find that this movie is so utterly underrated here. I have grown up on those tales, and I must say, Terry Gilliam really portrayed the worst of all the stories ever scripted by the Grimm Brothers. The plot itself is quite uncomplicated: the two Grimm Brothers travel around the land, pretending to fight evil spirits and witches they make up. The people are relieved and pay well. However, after their trick is found out, the only way they can regain their freedom is by encountering and fighting a true witch in a haunted forest that makes me shudder even as I think of it right now (no kidding). And believe it or not, Monica Bellucci is simply horrifying as the evil queen nurturing herself on the dead bodies of little girls of the village.The toad showing the directions is plainly hilarious.The gingerbread man is a blood-thirsty alternative for Shrek's pal.I think that everyone complaining about Grimm Brothers should stop and think that this is a generally not very twisted version of what kids get to read or what is read to them at a very-very young age (at least here in Europe). I think Brothers Grimm is, apart from being a really intriguing and spectacular horror movie, a very well-made and intelligent satire on the Grimms' ""children bedtime"" stories. Brothers Grimm is one of its kind.",The Brothers Grimm
142,jon2005,The Brothers Grimm,6,22 May 2006,"Director Terry Gilliam's latest film, made seven years after his last, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), retains his trademark visual style, and yet one cannot help but feel that he is beginning to lose his sense of what makes a great film. His earlier films, such as The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988) and Time Bandits (1981) have this style and a whacky sense of humour, but are fun films because of the atmosphere they create and maintain throughout. The Brothers Grimm, however, stumbles because it presents the audience with such a potentially awesome spectacle, but fails to deliver on its intended promises.Matt Damon and Heath Ledger play the titular brothers who travel around medieval Germany saving villages from curses. But unbeknownst to the villagers, both the brothers, and the curses themselves, are cons set up to make them money. They are soon discovered though, and sent to a forest to get rid of the pranksters doing the same thing there. However, they begin to realize that this ""fake"" curse is actually very real, and must find the courage to prevent the curse from being realized.The Brothers Grimm is a gorgeous film to watch Terry Gilliam certainly hasn't suffered in the looks department of film-making. The movement of the enchanted trees is superb, and the film does look like a moving fairytale. The problem is that it is such a mess story-wise. It's poorly structured, flitting from one scene to another with such confusing abandon of classic film structure. We are whisked in and out of the enchanted forest so often that it begins to lose its sense of tension, and starts getting predictable.There are some very good parts though. The way that characters and events from the Grimm fairy tales are inserted into the film (the premise being that the brothers write their fairy tales based upon their experiences in the real world) are inspired, and really could have only worked so well with Gilliam at the helm; he gives Tim Burton a run for his money in the 'best imagination' stakes. Also good are leads Matt Damon and Heath Ledger, whose constant bickering give some good comedy moments, and they carry the film well. The rest of the cast are fine, but not particularly noteworthy, with one exception: Peter Stormare as the Italian Cavaldi. Unfortunately, he is noteworthy for all the wrong reasons; he's the most loathsome creation to be put to film  every scene he is in is ruined by his over-acting, almost pantomime style. He really is unbearable, and as he is a constant presence throughout the film, he really puts a stopper in the audience's enjoyment.This is a shame as there was so much that could have been made of this film. It certainly has enough originality to ensure some good discussion after it's all over, but once again the film proves that looks are nothing compared to substance. There are many pluses to the film, and it can be enjoyed on many levels, but the few negatives are so vast that it stops the film being anything more than a distraction as we await Gilliam's true return.Rated: 6/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",The Brothers Grimm
143,RNHunter,Exceptional Fantasy,8,5 September 2005,"Imagine what if many of our favorite fairy tales were not in fact separate stories but part of the same larger tale? If you can imagine that and you are also interested in seeing movies that are fantasies, then the Brothers Grimm is an excellent bet.I have to give an exceptional grade to the director for this movie. The director treated the movie screen as his canvas to paint a fairy tale such as our inventive minds might come up with. He took normal subjects such as forests and villages and somewhat normal actors such as Matt Damon and yet created a fantasy atmosphere that was extremely creative. The appearances, the facial expressions, the speech methods by each of the actors and actresses leads one far from normal reality and into a fantasy world of early fairy tales and tickles the imagination.If you are into fantasies and have an open mind, I would highly recommend this as an exceptional picture and also somewhat as a work of art in the realm of fantasy.",The Brothers Grimm
144,jack_malvern,Not Gilliam's finest hour,5,2 November 2005,"""Nothing makes sense here,"" shouts one of the titular brothers Grimm during the film's finale, and he pretty much hits the nail on the head. Terry Gilliam's latest fantasy is not confusing as such, but it is arbitrary.Gilliam has crafted a warped fairytale with his usual flair, but a combination of odd plotting and an overload of caricature means that this is more akin to the director's excesses in Baron Munchausen than his successes with 12 Monkeys or The Fisher King.The story concerns Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm (Matt Damon and Heath Ledger), a pair of con men who fleece credulous rustic-types by offering to exterminate supernatural beasts of their own creation. They become unstuck, however, when a Napoleonic officer orders them to sort out an apparently genuine haunting.Part of the problem is that the haunting is obviously genuine, causing the plot to haemorrhage tension at a time when it should be building. Logic is also an early casualty - not unusual for a Gilliam film, necessarily, but damaging in a film whose fairytale base requires a lot of suspension of disbelief.In the final confrontation one of the brothers must break a spell. He has no idea how, and nor do we. The solution, like most of the plot developments, is plucked from nowhere.That said, there are beautifully conceived moments and fine gags that will possibly rescue the film for viewers who are not overly keen on plot. My favourite moment was when, at the mention of ""The Trapper"", everyone in the village spits. The chorus of gobbing continues for several seconds until it stops with a final ""ding"" of spittle hitting a spittoon.But I found there to be as many clunkers as laughs. The cast members act their little socks off, but by the third time the brothers traipse in and out of the enchanted forest I had concluded that this was no Gilliam classic.",The Brothers Grimm
145,royale_w_cheez44,"Great moments, overall disappointment",6,4 December 2005,"Terry Gilliam is a genius. Brazil is one of the best movies of the '80s and one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever, not to mention his involvement in Monty Python. I had high hopes for this flick. Afterall, it's been awhile since his last movie. I heard some bad news of production conflict and crappy script writing. I hoped for the best, and I was partially satisfied. However, in the end, this simply doesn't measure up to his past movies.The first half hour of the movie is Boring with a capital B. I almost fell asleep when I watched this part. It's incredibly slow and doesn't do much to make the story progress. It's not until a bit more than half way through when we get to experience some true Gilliam magic, although it doesn't save the film completely.Now, like I mentioned earlier, I heard that the script was one of the worst of the year. I don't think it was that bad, but it really wasn't all that good. The dialog lacked punch that usual Gilliam films have. the acting was satisfactory, although Ledger fits the mood and character much better than Damon. Peter Stormare provides some laughs, even though he sports the same accent as he did in ""Armageddon"" and ""Minority Report"". I was also a little disappointed that the film hardly made any references to The Brothers Grimms' fairy tales. just a few little homages showed up here and there, and I felt they could have used the source material for good.Visually, this film is pretty incredible. It was definitely worth seeing on the big screen for the crazy visuals alone. Some of the visual effects were kinda bad, though, such as the cartoony wolf and a ""WTF was that?!"" gingerbread man. There's some really marvelous and imaginative images, though. The best parts of the movie involve a horse and a kid, and a tiny little kitten. That's all I will say.In the end what you get with TBG is a commercial flick that still has a little bit of Gilliam's touch. I just hope Tideland is better (and that it gets released soon), and that he'll get started on films closer to his masterpieces. Even though the acting, writing, and such come up a little flat, TBG is still a visual feast that happens to get decent half-way through.",The Brothers Grimm

It looked like a live action version of Shrek, and it looked like it would be both funny and scary! How wrong I was! The plot is ridiculous and could have been written by a five year old, the effects are more shoddy than in the 1914 version of The wizard of oz, the performances are so ridiculous that it actually defies comprehension and the director is so incompetent that I wonder how he ever actually got a job in the industry!

147,flyingamon,Perfect combination of fantasy and horror,7,16 April 2011,"At first I wasn't sure about this movie. I love fairy tales of Grimm and was a bit scared that these tales would be shred to pieces by this movie. I am not really a fan of bloody horror but I can appreciate the more subtle genre. I think this movie manages well to please lovers of both genres. The idea that the brothers Grimm were indeed or at least one of them only interested in money, thriving on the gullibility of the people was a promising one. That they were crooks at first means they might not been interested in writing fairy tales at all. And although this movie has some really scary scenes it never becomes really horrifying. I thought some of the scary scenes looked actually quite funny. But it's definitely not a parody or comedy. It has scary moments, drama, fantasy and humor. Matt Damon and Heath Ledger (RIP God bless his soul)make a believable brother pair. Although it's not a portrayal of their fairy tales you can see references to a few of their characters such as Red Riding Hood, Gretl from Hans and Gretl and the gingerbread man who looks really scary.

149,morphion2,Rather Disappointing,6,7 January 2006,"""The Brothers Grimm"", Terry Gilliam's latest visionary creation, is a rather outlandish take on the legend of the famous titular brothers, courtesy of screenplay writer Ehrun Krueger (The Ring, Arlington Road). Set in French-occupied Germany during the 1700's, the film chronicles the adventures of Will (Matt Damon) and Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger), brothers and partners in crime, as they travel the country, defrauding naïve villagers by using stunts and lo tech special effects to pretend to vanquish demons and witches, and they are rewarded handsomely for their ""services"". Their façade, however, comes crumbling down when they are found out by the French royalty and sent to aid a town that has had its young daughters snatched away by the local enchanted forest for purposes unknown. Their only help is cynical French guard Cavaldi (Peter Stormare) and local 'cursed' girl Angelika (Lena Headey), who awkward, introverted Jacob is attracted to. It is under these trying circumstances that already antagonistic relations between the two brothers begin to fall apart, as they find themselves face to face with horrors they had only ever pretended to fight.There is a certain level of expectation that comes with Terry Gilliam, justified by such films as ""12 Monkeys"" and ""Brazil"", and while ""Brothers Grimm"" fulfills on a visual level, the story and the film in all tale-telling regards simply falls short. There is a sense of wit and irony set up in the premise that the movie fails to deliver on, and it also seems to overestimate its own capacities. Quite simply too much happens at once, and the audience is soon overloaded and ultimately bored, not to mention the film goes for far too long; over two hours. However, acting performances from the two leading men, Damon and Ledger, are quite good, particularly the latter. There is a sympathetic sensitivity to Jacob Grimm and his shy, simple ways that Heath Ledger brings out to a heartbreaking extent, and even Wilhelm Grimm's charm and good looks can't match that. Of course, Matt Damon is not a bad actor, but in this particular film he doesn't bring much to the role. There is also a kind of uncertainty that the film has about how it wants its audiences to react. There are many parts that are clearly supposed to be funny, but are dully predictable and surprisingly childish, while there are other parts that stay true the Grimm agenda by being very dark and a touch disturbing. This confusion only adds to a detachment from the characters and the story.Overly, ""The Brothers Grimm"" will probably be a kick for kids, who will be thrilled by the mile-a-minute pace of Terry Gilliam's adventure as well as the numerous fairy tale callbacks with which they will probably be more familiar than the adults. And maybe some hard core Gilliam/Grimm fans will find some entertainment in it all. But for everyone else, you will probably be left wondering how a director this artistically gifted, a cast this talented and a premise with such potential produced a film this lack-luster.",The Brothers Grimm
150,acs_joel,What has become of originality?,4,30 August 2005,"In the past five years, how may remakes and sequels have been shoved down our throats by Hollywood? And now, we are force fed some of our oldest, fondest memories. It is our dad, reading us a stewed, screwed and tattooed bedtime story. Why can't someone come up with a truly original idea? The writing in the Brothers Grimm is simply ridiculous.Conceptually, it has potential for greatness, but not by the low road taken.The visual aspects of the film are exceptional, but the lack of intellect gnaws at the viewer.I saw it with a date. About twelve minutes into the film, she let out a sigh. A few minutes later, another sigh. Finally, after twenty long minutes, I heard the third sigh.""Do you want to go,"" I asked.

151,oaksong,Fairy tales aren't good for children!,9,31 August 2005,"The worst problem with Terry Gilliam films is that they're too intellectual. For the audience that's not paying attention, the joke, as well as many of the references, go sailing overhead.With this one, the audience needs to be at least moderately well versed in the tales of the Brothers Grimm. Do parents read this stuff to their kids these days? Have they done so for the last ten years? It may only be those lucky children who have seen Steven Sondheim's (who?) musical, ""Into the Woods"", which has been broadcast on PBS - another channel not high on the list of the MTV or whatever generation, who will have enough information to get what's happening.So when yards of white hair are lowered from the inaccessible castle, who's going to get the reference? How old do you have to be these days? I've seen a number of critics complain about the plot. OK. Sorry. It's not straight from A to B, it's only revealed in bits. But there are significant clues all along the way, so if you were paying attention (Terry doesn't waste screen time, if it's in front of you, pay attention, it's important to the story) then you'll have a fair idea what's going on the second time you get to the village.The village is a marvel! It's pure brothers Grimm. At one point we see Hans and Greta (lost the l's?) in the forest dropping breadcrumbs and getting lost. Again, Gilliam has created a marvelously twisted version of the standard Grimm oeuvre, but kept many of the characters intact, just occupying slightly different territory.Oh, back to the plot for a moment...why are the children, girls, going missing? What is the terrible fate awaiting them? What is the engine below the surface that's driving this tale? All I can say is that not all the pieces are revealed in the first hour and a half, you have to stick around a might longer. The great news here is that you don't notice the time. I wasn't tempted to yawn once.As to Jonathan Price being annoying, I thought that was part of being a villain. And, given the storybook nature of the tale, some events are preordained (at least a little). 'Nuff said.So go see it. I'm going to see it again!

152,MadWatch,Interesting movie,6,29 August 2005,"****Spoilers in this review**** I was really eager to see this movie and saw it opening night. I am finding it difficult to come to a conclusion as to exactly what I feel about the movie, so I will just say this; The movie was interesting, had some really nice visuals and was entertaining enough to watch the entire thing without feeling I lost my money.On that note, the movie is just missing .....something. Something that prevents me from saying that it was a ""good"" movie, but, for some reason, I just cant deduce what that missing element is.The story takes place centuries ago in France-occupied Germany. Two brothers make a living by swindling townsfolk into believing in horrible, fairy-tale creatures and get paid for ""rescuing"" the townsfolk. After getting caught by the French militia, they agree to investigate a series of strange happenings in a nearby town. This leads them into a strange encounter with an enchanted forest and a variety of uncanny, enchanted beings and creatures, eventually finding the truth behind the bizarre events and releasing the town from the enchantment.The story and various individual elements are pretty decent and the visuals are really well done. I found that the acting by the main characters was decent enough, just not good enough to really grab you. Also, I found that the acting by Peter Stormare was problematic because his accent was so heavy that I could not understand his words half of the time. For most of the main characters, I could not discern what nationality they were from their accents and how they interacted with others. First I thought the brothers were British, then German, then French, then I just stopped trying to figure out their nationality.There were some bizarre elements in the movie, that when I reminded my self it was a Terry Gilliam movie (who also made similar ""bizarre"" movies like Baron Munchausen, Brazil and 12 Monkeys), then it made sense, sort of. You had to view some elements through a ""Terry Gilliam"" filter or they may just seem bizarre and out of place.**Spoiler alert** Even though I had no trouble following the story, it appears that other reviewers were confused by what was happening. The movie explains that the forest is enchanted and oozing magic and enchantments. The movie also explains that the Witch Queen is kidnapping young girls to steal their youth. So, why are people confused by things like the mud-creature kidnapping a child or the horse kidnapping a child or the children appearing in a pool to be gathered by the woodsman?? Answer: The horse, mudman and pool were enchanted to get the children to the tower.One part that *I* was confused by, however, was this: If the Witch Queen needed young girls to steal their youth for her spell, then why was Angelika used in the ritual? She was a full grown woman. Also, why did Cavaldi's character change so drastically? First he didn't like the brothers, he wanted to torture and kill them, but at the end he was saving them and dancing for joy with them. Odd.Conclusion (as best as I can): I was disappointed in the way the story was carried out, not with the actual story itself. The acting needed work. People may be turned off or even confused by the Terry Gilliam style of movies. Overall I give the movie a 6 out of 10.",The Brothers Grimm
153,a_filmcritter,enjoyed the second half,4,2 June 2021,"This movie is has all the elements you'd want in a dark-fairy tale movie but with a comedic spin. But for some reason the first half of the movie was hard to get into. I wasn't sure what was going on and the characters, although really greatly casted, seemed to be missing something. The forced scenes of fright also seemed out-of-place.However, the story and movie does pick up in the second half. There's more focus as to what's going on in the forest and the dark magic. Overall, if you're into mystical movies with magical creatures, it would be a good movie to watch.",The Brothers Grimm
154,oldgirl,Typically Gilliamesque disturbing fun,9,28 August 2005,"Brothers Grimm alternates campy romping good-times with the sort of darker chaotic silliness that we've come to expect from Terry Gilliam. He besets those familiar with his movies (and his earlier Python gigs) with a host of repeating motifs -- outlandish parodies of Frenchmen, cruelty to cats, muddy hovels, strange tortures, and a host of others seen again and again in his other films. He is endlessly inventive and ludicrously complex, and offers no mercy for dull-eared American audiences without the wit or training to follow many of the rapid-fire witticisms that abound in his films. And yet the triple-layered sensory surroundings of the film do not overpower the excellent performances of the two central characters. Matt Damon is surprising as the somewhat cowardly and overly dramatic Will Grimm (I never knew he had it in him), but Heath Ledger, usually so strong-jawed and mercilessly pretty, gained my everlasting respect by his portrayal of Jacob Grimm, the gullible and voluble hyper-romantic uber-geek. I almost didn't recognize him in this role! And that's the true draw of this movie. Nothing in it is willing to meekly submit to normal expectations. There are changes of heart where none are expected, danger where no one has ever seen danger before, and plot twists that corkscrew along paths that could have only been mapped by Terry Gilliam. Is it disturbing? Oh, yes. Several scenes are completely unsuitable for anyone under 11 or 12. Heck, one of 'em scared ME! And I'm sure that the irreverent mass infusion of dozens of barely recognizable fairy tales is going to confuse the heck out of any kid raised on typical American action movie pap. But is it fun? Dreadfully fun! And probably more than can be absorbed within a single viewing.",The Brothers Grimm

Honestly, I don't what they were expecting, because I thought it was very well done with a good story, excellent sets and very well done special effects.If there were two actors I would have traded up they would be Matt Damon (Wilhelm Grimm) who comes across as too American to fit and Lena Headey (Angelika) who comes off as too English to pass of easily as a rural German trapper. Peter Stormare (Cavaldi) fairly steals the show as the sadistic officer set after the two brothers and Jonathan Pryce (Delatombe) gives a creditable performance as the french general.The story moves right along, without dwelling overlong on anything nonessential to the tale.

156,FilmSchoolWriter,"Creepy, but clever",7,28 August 2005,"Hmmmm... I'm still confused about what I think of The Brother's Grimm. The first time I saw it, I was like, ""Aha!! Brilliant!!"" and the next time I was like, ""Okay, so this is incredibly disturbing."" And I guess that The Brother's Grimm is a combination of these two schools of thought.Since former Monty Python-er Terry Gilliam directs, you know that this is giong to be a *bit* off kilter -- which it totally is. He's the perfect guy for directing the dark and sinister stories that the actual Grimm Brothers actually wrote. Most people are familiar with the dolled up (and well loved) Disney versions of Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. But the Grimm's weren't so into the happily ever after with nothing bad really ever happening. Did you know that the original evil step sisters cut off their toes to fit into the glass slipper? Gilliam knew that and boy did he relish it!! Of course, Matt Damon and Heath Ledger totally stole the shoe, as they should. Their characters are complete polar opposites and they both played their roals brilliantly. Lena Headey does a fine job (nothing award winning, but it's fine) throughout the movie until the end, but that part is just horribly written so I don't think it's really your fault. The writers seemed to make the ending as surprising and twisting and inevitable and totally stupid as they could - with which they succeeded. I didn't feel like there was much of a conclusion there.Okay, so decide for yourself whether or not to see The Brother's Grimm. It's pretty cool, but not something I plan on watching again. I'm not really sure what to give it, so it's just an incredibly vague 7/10.",The Brothers Grimm

I won't give too much away, except to say that there aren't many surprises awaiting the viewer.Damon and Ledger are actually quite good as the Brothers, but the person I found most entertaining was the bungling French soldier assigned to them for most of the film.Certainly not the best summer movie, but well worth a look if you have nothing better to do.",The Brothers Grimm
158,youaresquishy,Terry Gilliam should be ashamed of himself,2,15 August 2006,"I am a Terry Gilliam fan. My favorite by him is Brazil, and my second-favorite by him was 12 Monkeys.For about an hour of this film, it was mostly a pleasant way to pass some time. But I ended up hating this film, and here are the three most important reasons why:(1) There are 2 clichéd plot-extending sub-plot-creating devices in this film that are just obviously and clumsily inserted into the overall plot. Either of these could ruin a movie. Both combined made me angry at Terry Gilliam.(2) Jonathan Pryce's French accent is horrid. No one talks like that. It sounds like that Pepe Le Pew (the old cartoon skunk). If meant to be funny, it just is not funny. However you look at it, it's really annoying. Every scene in this film that included Jonathan Pryce's character is ruined because of it. It pretty much ruins the whole film, especially combined with (1).(3) Heath Ledger was not believable. Given all the other things that went wrong with this film, I'm inclined to blame this on the directing.Terry Gilliam is entitled to make a bad one, sure. But this is no ordinary bad film. This one insulted my intelligence, used cheap and obvious clichéd plot tricks, and had really bad accents coming out of some of its primary characters. This one made me angry. And Gilliam has been dropped a couple of notches on my all-time favorite director's list because of that. Had this just been another bad movie, he would not have dropped those couple of notches.The story itself could have perhaps been done well. It just wasn't. Besides the glaring and obvious problems discussed above, there was almost no character-development in this film at the proper time with the exception of the character named Angelika (played well by Lena Headey). And the plot itself was just kind of, I dunno, I call plots like this ""overcreative,"" I guess. The plot itself did not have enough development though for the viewer to really ever catch on to exactly the nature of the historical background we are in and what exactly is going on.Now, Mr. Gilliam, I believe, has publicly stated that the Weinstein brothers (the co-executive producers) of this film were interfering with him, and of course I will never know how and to what extent they did, so it may well be the fault of the Weinsteins. If that's the case, I expect Terry Gilliam to disown this film at some point in the future.I might have recommended it for small kids, because the plot is non-boring enough for them, but there are a couple of scenes in this that could be extremely frightening and gory. If you're a parent, show this to your kids only if you'd also show them a slasher film like Saw or Friday the 13th or something like that. Or show it to your kids if you want them to be traumatized. I don't care. The point is that this was definitely not intended for kids, so it can't use that excuse.Bad stuff. If you're a Terry Gilliam fan, stay away. It will change your feelings about his movie-making prowess.",The Brothers Grimm
159,mcshortfilm,Oh brother...,3,28 August 2005,"When I first heard that there was going to be a film about the Brothers Grimm, I was excited with anticipation. The two German brothers are responsible for publishing some of the most famous and earliest known fairy tales in history; Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Little Red Riding Hood, Rumplesteelskin, Cinderella, Pinnochio and many others. Most people today are only familiar with the Walt Disney watered-down version of these stories but when they were originally published, the stories were often too dark and too creepy for most children to read. Modern psychologists theorized that these stories, often read to children during bed-time were about emotional angst, fear of abandonment, sexual repression and parental abuse. How these stories came to life and what influenced the Grimm brothers to publish these stories might have been an interesting biography.Terry Gilliam who is known for his wildly hallucinatory imagination did not want to take a documentary approach to this subject. I would not expect this from the retired member of Monty Python. ""The Brothers Grimm"" is an absurd fictional tale that uses the Grimm brothers as traveling con artists who journey through villages in Germany to show off their hokey magic tricks. The con artists are unmasked by Delatombe, Napolean's man in Germany and instead of punishing them he sends the Grimm's to a haunted forest to become ghost exterminators and find the missing children that have disappeared. Gilliam is not interested in showing off the fairy tales although some of them do show up in the movie, the point is really just a fragmented and non-sensical film. There are a lot of great ideas that could have been promising but the overall thread seems too sloppy and convoluted. It is not clear what Gilliam intended the Borthers Grimm to be. Are they a bunch of clowns? Are they supposed to be romantic heroes? They seem like phony magicians and other times their magic seems real. All in all, it does not seem clear. When I think of Terry Gilliam, I think of an ambitious director. He has created some of the most spectacular fantasy films of his time. His worlds are surreal labyrinths that take you on a crooked and sometimes dizzy adventure.""the Holy Grail"" ""Brazil"" and ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" are all amazing. I applaud him for his wild and creative imagination. This time, I think he needs to take a step back from the expensive production and concentrate more on giving us a cohesive story...even if it involves some biographical truth to the Grimm brothers which I would have preferred. That's just my opinion.",The Brothers Grimm

Sometimes it is hard to tell the heroes from the villains, and you have to pay attention to understand what is going on. On the other hand, its got a lot of 10 votes, from people who don't mind the kind of mumbled dialog that got Robert Altman fired from his first job and who do like to see things in movies that they've never seen before. Not as good as Time Bandits or Brazil, it is a whole lot better than Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

161,scorseseisgod-1,Anything but Grim,7,13 November 2005,"Don't expect the obligatory studio-damning follow-up documentary. For a change, over the top (and frequently over budget) director Terry Gilliam received final cut. His first completed film since 1998's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" Gilliam reportedly tinkered for two years while Miramax repeatedly shuffled opening dates. In wide release at last, ""The Brothers Grimm"" is a visually dazzling Byzantine blockbuster of a thrill ride aimed at, joy of joys, adult minds. Finally, a contemporary fantasy film that shuns the Hollywood notion that action and adventure must solely be geared for fourteen-year-old boys. Given their similarities and dark underlying preoccupations, Walt Disney is likely to be applauding horizontally in his cryogenic chamber.There are three types of people in this world: those who do not believe in magic beans, those who do, and the Studio Heads who capitalize on those who do. Not unlike their contemporary Hollywood counterparts, Nineteenth-Century hucksters Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger) track local villages selling counterfeit action tales (with great advance word of mouth) that climax in a bunch of slick special effects. They weave tales of non-existent monsters then offer to exterminate them for a hefty fee. Business is booming until the curse of a three-hundred-year-old queen (Monica Belucci) turns out to be the real deal.Not since Warner Bros. animator Tex Avery's screwball classic ""Little Red Walking Hood,"" in which Cinderella telephones Red from the Three Bears' cottage to alert her of the Big Bad Wolf's pending arrival, has a film had so much fun mixing and matching fairy tales. Cindy, Red, Snow White, Rapunzel, you name them and they're in the pages of horror writer Ehren Kruger's (""Arlington Road,"" the Americanized ""The Ring"" and it's sequel) gets-better-as-it-progresses screenplay.Damon and Ledger, with an emphasis on the quirky latter, bring a suitable second-rate thirties comedy team sensibility to the caterwauling siblings. Shemp and Larry minus Moe, but it works. Gilliam regular Jonathan Pryce's nefarious Delatombe deliciously delivers some of the film's funniest line readings. Favoring spectacle, Gilliam wisely tunes down a romantic subplot involving adventuress Lena Headey.It's Cavaldi, Peter Stormare's larger than life and stronger than dirt braggart that triumphs over all but the art direction. The only redeeming facet of the otherwise unclean ""Constantine,"" Stormare adds another miscreant to a long and impressive list of diverse, hopelessly repugnant supporting characters.With the exception of a Pillsbury Mudboy, the computer generated effects remain firmly anchored in their fantasy universe. This is especially noteworthy when you consider the film cost a mere $75 million to complete, almost a third of the price tags attached to either ""Revenge of the Silt"" or ""Bore of the World."" A master of scenic invention as a means of storytelling, Gilliam along with production designer Guy Dyas flood their Magic Forest with menacing surrealist details including muscular trees with relocating roots. Alternating scenes are designed in accordance to Gilliam's customary flair for wild shifts in tone, light and color.To hell with spielberg and lucas. This summer's intelligent adventure begins, continues and ends with Terry Gilliam's best film since ""Brazil.""",The Brothers Grimm
162,jack_thursby,A horrible nightmare rather than a fairy tale,3,11 March 2006,"Terry Gilliam backfired big time with ""The Brothers Grimm."" This movie illustrates the maxim that ""less is more"", because this movie needs less of everything instead of more. The film has incredibly bad pacing because there is too much happening on the screen in every scene, causing the movie to simply grate on your nerves after twenty minutes (and the film runs nearly two hours).There are too many crazy, wacky characters, too many bizarre camera angles, too much stuff in the sets, too many wacky situations, too much overacting, too many silly accents, too much loud music -- the list goes on and on. Every cinematic device you can think of is overdone and overused. It seems like Terry Gilliam had too many ideas for this movie, and instead of editing his ideas down and using only the best ones, he used them all and a result this movie is wildly disjointed, lacks any sort of pacing, and is just plain unpleasant to watch.The plot features Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as Will and Jake Grimm. They are the con-men of French-occupied 18th century Germany; scaring villagers by setting up fake hauntings, and then getting the villagers to fork over big money in return for the Brothers Grimm taking care of the problem. The tables are turned on the Brothers Grimm when a French General forces the brothers to investigate the disappearance of several young girls from a village bordering a haunted forest. The reluctant heroes travel to the village and then explore the forest, encountering all sorts of crazy creatures along the way as they solve the mystery. Most of the situations or characters they encounter have some connection with the famous book, ""Grimm's Fairy Tales.""This could have been a good movie had Gilliam taken his foot off the gas and allowed for more normality in the movie. As it is, its a testament to cinematic excess and makes you wish that the studio had cut his funding and forced him to make do with less.",The Brothers Grimm
163,OrdinaryDay,Uncertain movie can't work out whether it's a horror or a comedy.,6,15 May 2008,"This movie starts off as a schlock horror movie, mocking all the classical fairy tales and you think it is going to be a tongue in cheek fantasy throughout. Then suddenly it turns into a legitimate horror movie, abandoning all of the comical elements except for an awkward one liner here and there. It is a hybrid that doesn't work. Heath Ledger is exceptional in it, and I'm sure if he got the chance to do more comedy movies in his short career, he would have excelled. Matt Damon is good as well, but these two actors can't overcome the faults within the script. Overall, it is an enjoyable piece of escapism, but lacks any real substance to make it a movie worth remembering.",The Brothers Grimm
164,TheScottman,"Damon, Ledger, and CGI, oh my!",3,5 July 2006,"The beginning of this movie sucked me in and I really wanted to see how it all came together. As the movie went on though, I found it getting progressively worse. Everything that was a special effect in the movie was CGI and poorly done CGI at that. I could understand the wolf standing on two legs, but trees are CGI and spider webs are CGI. It just got so ridiculous I started to lose interest. Everyone's character is over the top without any point to it. The references to the grimm tales was really the only thing in this movie that seemed like they put thought into it (at first), but then they got sloppy with even that.The cast wasn't bad, but it was just seemed like there was no direction for this film. They wanted it to be a grimm tale, but with a modern way of telling it. The first five minutes like I said sucked me in and I was waiting for them to build off of that moment in Jacob's life. Then it becomes a whole other movie. I was happy I didn't spend any money to see this, I found myself thinking (after every CGI moment) ""What was I thinking?"" I still have no answer for that question.In my opinion this movie isn't worth any kind of fee. If you want to see it borrow it from a friend or find another (legal) way to view it without paying. When or if you see this movie don't let the first five minutes trick you, the movie will only get worse from there.",The Brothers Grimm
165,Vanyel,Grimm indeed,5,27 August 2005,"The Brother's Grimm cast includes Matt Damon, Heath Ledger and Jonathon Pryce, all directed by Terry Gilliam --- and I wish it were rare that this much talent was wasted this badly.From the previews, it looks quite good --- a comedy with the Brother's Grimm being con artists pretending to rid the world supernatural evil, until they run across the real thing and have to deal with it.It does have its moments, though mainly dramatic ones. For the most part, however, it just doesn't come together. For one, the entire element of France vs Germany, especially including Jonathan Pryce's character and underlings would improve the movie by not being in it. It's a ludicrous bit of farce apparently included to give the characters motivation to go into the forest, but just made me want to leave the theater every time that thread of the story was on screen. If you want the evil king and minions to drive the plot, go back and watch the Princess Bride again to see how to do it.The special effects are as good as one would expect these days...mostly. The wolf jerkily bounds about like something out of the 50's, and there was one early forest scene where they forgot to remove some of the wires. The trees are the high point here --- when they move, they really look alive. One more thing to thank the Lord of the Rings for, I suspect.As expected, they throw in elements of many of the popular fairy tales, but more as throw away gags than key elements of the story.Finally, at the end there is a scene that at first glance is stupidly homophobic. The action itself isn't so much so when you think about what the characters are doing and who they are, but when you think about why it's even in the movie in the first place (to shock the mostly straight audience), you realize that your first impression was right. Not that such situations can't be funny, it's just that in this case, it's sole purpose is to play up and reinforce the ""ick factor"" that two guys might actually kiss, however unromantically or justified in the situation. It is simply inexcusable today.I confess, I'm not that big a fan of Terry Gilliam's farces, and his fans will probably be happier with this movie than I was, but I am a big fan of Matt, Heath and Jonathon, and it's really sad to see them in a movie this disappointing.",The Brothers Grimm

Although I love fantasy subject matter and am a big fan of Heath Ledger, this movie is just not well written or well directed.Firstly, the tone is all wrong. The soundtrack, acting and characters are very campy, but it's too violent and too slow to be a film for kids, nor are any of the situations humorous. The story of two con artists dealing with a real curse could be exciting, but it just does not drag you in - the characters are not sympathetic or interesting enough.Not only are the major characters annoying, but the minor characters are one dimensional clichés. Monty Python ridiculous without being funny. The old crone with the overdone make-up, the ""creepy cursed"" woman who hates everyone, guts rabbits with a zombie face yet has a heart of gold, the torturer who seems to do nothing but torture people. No back story and no need for any other facets to their characters.Also we are in Germany, why do the poor have cockney accents? Why do richer people have upper-class accents and the French have French accents? Why do the heroes have American accents? Sadly, none of the talents involved can overcome this drivel.

170,Chicky5150,Terrible Film- Mild spoilers? Can you spoil a bad film?,3,28 December 2005,"Its debatable whether the worst films are utterly hopeless, or films with great moments that form a terrible whole. This is one of the latter. There are really interesting scenes, and good lines and laughs in this film, but in the end, it is so uneven that the effect is lost.The (spoilerless?) story is this - bickering one-dimensional brothers Grimm fake the existence of fairy tale monsters (using technology from our day apparently, they might as well have worn wristwatches) until a French General (a wasted Jonathan Pryce) sends them to investigate children disappearing in a forest until the watchful eye of a bumbling Italian (a wasted Peter Stormare) who can barely be understood. The children disappear in wildly varying ways, using a great deal of unconvincing computer graphics. This all relates to a mysterious woman (a wasted Monica Bellucci) in a tower in the forest. This was directed by an obviously frustrated (dare I say wasted?) Terry Gilliam, and written by Ehren Krueger.

171,limau,May be the worst film of Terry Gilliam,6,12 March 2006,"I am a fan of Terry Gilliam, a director who can create movies of lyrical beauty and enchantment, or moments of poetic fantasy or startling visuals worth seeing even if the film itself isn't great. There may be a few glimpses of his genius in this film, for example when the Mirror Queen shatters or the horse swallowing the child, but they pale when compared with Gilliam previous efforts.It could have been so much better, all the ingredients are there - a film suffused with imagery of fairy tales, an enchanted forest and an imaginative storyline where the real crosses into the fantastic. But somehow it never really gels, most of the scene simply don't work as well as they should, and some scenes simply grate. Perhaps it's the truly bad acting by Jonathan Pryce which must rank amongst his worst, if not the very worst, performances. Perhaps Terry Gilliam never really learned to trim his material - in his previous films his exuberance and imaginative genius compensated for his excesses, but here there aren't enough of what he does best to make the film works.Nevertheless, there are a few moments when you think he might do it - the entombment of the Pre-Raphaelite beauties, dancing piece of cloth leading children to a sinister end, but somehow they never cross into the sublime the way Gilliam's best can. The film is moderately entertaining if you don't expect much, but overall the film is a disappointment mainly because it falls well short of Terry Gilliam's capabilities.",The Brothers Grimm
172,terrors89,Not as bad as every says.,7,28 August 2005,"It is unfortunate that this movie is being overshadowed in the media that the Weinstein Brothers are releasing all of their movies that they did recently with Miramax before they leave the company in September '05. That gives a connotation that the movies aren't very good and in the case of The Brothers Grimm, that isn't true. While the character development and story had issues, the movie is still entertaining and the production design more than makes up for these issues.Will and Jacob Grimm, played by Matt Damon (The Bourne Supremacy) and Heath Ledger (Lords of Dogtown,) are two con-artists who take advantage of local folk legends to scare people into believing the supernatural and hire them to 'exorcise' the demons. The brothers are then captured by the French and are forced to go to a village in French occupied Germany, this story takes place during the Napoleon Wars, and help them find the con-artists who are stealing the little girls of the village in the nearby forest. Once the brothers get there and start to investigate, they realize that there is something more going on then a couple of hoaxers and have to put their minds together to save the children.Both Damon and Ledger do a good job with these characters even though their accents are terrible. To me it sounded like they were from England which makes me ask; why would the French allow these two to roam the country side when they are at war with England? If that is the case then the story doesn't make a lot of since. But assuming that it was just a bad dialect coach, both men were able to provide some stability in characters that were written all over the place.The best thing about the movie is the production design, costume design, and director Terry Gilliam's (Dir. Fisher King) imagination. The set is a pure period piece set in the early 1800's Europe. The town is dirty, disgusting and the wall around offers almost no sense of security at the forbidden forest just outside of it. The minute the movie enters the village, the felling of gloom is projected wonderfully. Hats off to Guy Dyas for doing a great job turning Gilliam's imagination into reality. The key to the success of the design is Gilliam. He has such a wonderful imagination that has been shown in his previous movies such as Time Bandits and Twelve Monkeys. He was perfect to direct this movie. This movie is pure fantasy and that is why he is right to direct. I also want to compliment Costume Designer Gabriella Pescucci. She has a gift when it comes to costuming Gilliam's vision as well as this period in European history. She won an Academy Award for Costume Design for the movie The Age of Innocence and was nominated for the same award for Gilliam's movie, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. I know most people don't stay for the end credits, but if ever see a period piece done well, I would bet money her name is in the credits.Ehren Kruger wrote this story and it is the weakest link of the movie. While nothing stands out as being horrible, the character development for the leads is weak. In the first minutes of the movie we are introduced to the young brothers, as they help their mother care for their sick sister. Jacob had run into town to get the doctor with the last of the money they had. Instead he came back with a bunch of magic beans, obviously being conned by someone. The term magic beans comes up time and time again as a crutch for Jacob. But I don't think he finished the story in terms of symbolism of the beans. Will was forced to believe in the concept in order to save the missing girls but at no time was Jacob's belief ever really tested. That was a flaw in their characters. Also the story dragged at the beginning and the end so it could have been tighter. I don't know why a writer known for his horror movie scripts, Scream 3, The Ring, and The Ring 2, was chosen to do this script. I think he lacked the imagination that the story required and only Gilliam's direction kept the movie in 'fairy tale' land where it needed to be. To be honest, this is an excellent story for Gilliam to write, but I can just assume that the script would not have been as well received in Hollywood as it was by the man who adapted The Ring. The last thing that needs to be said is that sometimes movies are affected by things the audience doesn't see and the director and actors have no control over. Much like Gilliam's lost Quixote movie, Grimm was plagued with problems. The movie was originally produced under the MGM label until it pulled its funding. The Weinstein Brothers at Miramax took over the project and made some changes with the movie that did not sit well with the Gilliam. They fired the original cinematographer Nicola Pecorini, who had worked with Gilliam before. Then the Weinstein brothers vetoed who Gilliam wanted as the lead actress. These things may seem trivial in nature but they do create problems between producers and directors that can affect a film. It is something to think about when watching bad movies, it may not be the fault of the talent on the film, but it could be because of money. I think you are making a mistake if you miss this film. It has a great since of imagination and is well acted and directed. It will make my DVD collection when it comes out. *this review and others can be read at www.bbmc.dockratent.com*",The Brothers Grimm
173,jediduck95,One of Gilliam's worst,6,27 August 2005,"Personally, unless you are over 16, or unless you are a huge Damon or Ledger fan, then this movie is not for you.Some of you might be saying 'Well, I'm a Terry Gilliam fan'. So am I, and I was disappointed. This movie is only mildly entertaining. Think of it as the bad version of Sleepy Hollow.The story starts out with an introduction of the two main characters as children in the late 18th century, which was introduced very briefly, and then we see them as adults 15 years later in 1812 in French occupied Germany. The two brothers (Damon & Ledger) start off by visiting a town which are in need of some ghost busting. The town supposedly has a witch and the famous brothers Grimm are their only hope for destroying her. It turns out that this witch is part of the scheme set up by the Grimm brothers and a couple of their scam partners so that they can make some kind of living.Jacob (Ledger) is more of a nerdy/naive character that is obsessed with fantasy and mythological explanations. Wil (Damon) is more of a scam artist that is in it for the money and is quite the ladies man. Wil is the leader of the group while Jacob only cares about the stories so that he can write the info in his book.They are eventually caught by a French soldier played by Stormare(Fargo) and brought the the French authorities to explain their many scams. The French soldiers are in need of men to go into the forest and retrieve children that have been missing.This is when the story falters and becomes increasingly boring. The Grimm stories that we know today are thrown into a blender and poured into this poorly written plot. Krueger tries too hard to try to fit in a lot of the Grimm stories into this thin story. The characters spend most of their time fumbling around the woods and back into town, then back into the woods while a few trees move around, and a wolf-man (which looks like its from the poor cgi from Van Helsing) lurks its prey. We are introduced to a semi-dead queen's background (Belluci) that wants everlasting life by using a spell (Heard of this plot before?) The Grimm brothers are led by a woman that knows the woods very well and they try to figure out where the children what the old queen has to do with these children.Damon and Ledger do a descent job of creating interesting characters but it's not enough to get past the poor writing. They play well of each other bu that's it. Gilliam is one of my favorite directors and I was hoping he would be able to lead an interesting big-budget movie unlike a lot of other directors who are able to get $150 million budget who have no vision. Gilliam and the actors try to create interesting characters from the story but they fall short. The sets look good and so do the costumes.If you're a Terry Gilliam fan then you will be disappointed. I believe that young teenagers will like this movie but there is a few very violent scenes.This is one of those movies that if you're 16 or older you will be entertained slightly by some of the character's odd behaviors.Hopefully next summer will be better.",The Brothers Grimm

176,monolith94,a strangely stretched vision of fantasy,8,27 January 2006,"Although the Grimm fairy tales are now studied in academia, one has to understand a fundamental truth: these are low stories. Which isn't to detract from their importance. Low art has a long and storied history, and can have as much value as the high. Bougerau was high, and has fallen over time to the likes of Renoir and Monet, who at the time were derided by the academic painters for their abandonment of the hidden brushstroke.This is important because it helps clarify the characterization, and why all the characters which surround the brothers are fundamentally stereotypes. The old, fat men have the lines and old fat men quality of a Daumier sketch. The old, nay-saying woman has the old, nay-saying quality of an exaggerated witch from an early MAD magazine cartoon. The peasants are fearful, ignorant and pitchfork holding because that's just what peasants do. Characterization isn't really the point of this story. All of these broad sketches of types are captured within a splendid cinematography which is rarely less than excellent, and which contains a few spectacular shots which completely enthrall, if perhaps for only a few moments. The editing is technically good in that the film flows well, although seems to be a victim of Weisenstein demands for the film to move quicker, and thus one gets the sense that important footage is missing. I suspect there will be a director's cut.The point with the emphasis on camera-work is therefore to capture the elusive quality of a Grimm fairy tale. It seems impossible to craft an honest fantasy nowadays - in this world of irony and criticism the pure can be derided for it's simplistic nature, which seems like boundless artistic cruelty to me. The twist ending is all, and dictates our stories - it is an unholy idol of cinema. Yes, there must be surprises, and there must be changes for art to imitate life in a manner worthy of the term art, but so much intense focus on an ending which one doesn't see coming leads to art out of balance, and a cheap immediate thrill which soon fades.So we have all the stories pressed together and a structure which tries to make sense of them. The brothers grimm as adventurers in a tale which could've been concocted by themselves. Only the tale they live could not have been. There is all this worry about whether they are 'living a tale', so explicitly stated, which is fundamentally modern. In a fairy tale, the last thing a character worries about is their own existential life.Does this modernism detract from the quality of the story, or rather make it palatable for modern audiences? I'd argue that the answer is neither - a story lacking irony does not necessarily lead to bad film-making, but still, the angst adds to what we see, and helps increase audience involvement.No, what hurts this movie is suspicious Hollywood dialogue, and a tendency at times for Hollywood conventional cinematography to squirrel its way into the story. I attribute both of these to the Weisensteins, who work in profoundly evil ways. The cinematographer was replaced in the middle of shooting, and the wonderful Samantha Morton was not allowed to be in the film - both decisions which, if reversed, would have helped considerably. And bad CGI.Also of note is the archetypes of the two brothers: the romantic scholar and the practical stud. There are only two types of men that boys truly wish to be, and that is either the former or the latter. When I was a child, I always imagined myself as the former, and had great disdain for the latter. I was Gringoire, and those who by some natural instinct understood the method for attracting women were the Phoebus's. In this film, Will is a Pheobus, Jakob a Gringoire. A very interesting romantic choice at the end is made by Gilliam, where the identity of the romantic winner is left a mystery. This is almost as much a movie about male territorialism as it is about fairy tales. It's to Damon's credit that he made this Gringoire sympathetic for his character of Will.",The Brothers Grimm
177,editor-92,Long winded and not very interesting,4,26 August 2005,"***May contain spoilers **** It's been seven years since Terry Gilliam helmed a film. As a fan of the director, I was very excited to see that he had a new project. Unfortunately, having just watched the film, I wouldn't recommend it to others.You probably know the story - the Grimm Brothers go from village to village as exorcists-for-hire. Then they get discovered by the French authorities and they must dispel a real magical curse or die.The film is populated by many characters and images from fairy tales, including Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel & Gretel, Rapunzel, the evil queen from Snow White, etc. However, it's really a mess. The story isn't very engaging and neither are the actors. The best ""role"" is played by Monica Belluci, who is the diabolical mirror queen. But sadly, she isn't in the film very much, maybe 20 minutes, if that.Peter Stormare who is usually pretty good in films - most notably the woodchipping lunatic in Fargo - is so annoying, I hoped that his character was a minor one. Alas, no.The accents are equally heinous. Jonathan Pryce's pronunciation is abysmal, and the film's overall depiction of the French is, once again, ridiculous. I guess they are the new demonized target of Hollywood these days, being depicted as cruel, careless and power mad. I'm quite frankly getting tired of it.The special effects are pretty good, particularly the flying witch during an early exorcism, and the frog licking is kind of cute, but this film never really knows what it wants to be. Is it funny? Is it fantasy? It's certainly excessive in length.My biggest gripe is that it doesn't even know what it's message is. One of the characters complains that Christianity was the cause of the destruction of the forest and, I guess, the people who populated the area with folklore - the kind that Jacob is trying to preserve. The French, too, stand as a symbolic of ""the Enlightenment."" After all, Jonathan Pryce's character wants to burn the woods and vanquish the myths. But in the end, he, himself, is destroyed because of a trick cross. So which is it? Triumph of folklore, the trees and myths or rational thought? I wish Ehren Kruger had figured out where he stood before he turned in his screenplay.More often than not, Heath Ledger seems attracted to stinkers. The Order is a great example of that, so I think if he's in a film, I might skip it. Matt Damon, I'll keep giving your films a chance. (I like most of what he's been in.) Mr. Gilliam. I hate to say it, but this film stunk. Back to the drawing board.",The Brothers Grimm

There are moments, mere moments in this dreck when I can see flashes of him, yet somehow this turd can't represent him as a director. I should state that I am not fond of Matt Damon as an actor, yet this movie is so terrible, I forgot how much I loathe him.There is no spoiler that anyone could ever conceive that would spoil this film. I've been greatly disappointed today, even going in with lukewarm to low expectations. I know that his past films have often garnered odd reactions, people not ""getting"" his movies, but this one stinks.Last summer, I felt that the box office had sunk to an all-time low with ""Van Helsing"". For that crud, there was too much CGI to destroy any storyline. Sadly, ""Grimm"" makes ""Van Helsing"" look like an Academy Award winner.Runtime suggests that this is nearly two hours of my life that I wasted today, not to mention money and brain cells.During the end of the film, I felt ill. Talking it over with my husband, we agreed it was not illness, it was bad cinema.I suspect that in a day or two, I will rethink my vote of 3/10 and wish I had gone lower, but for now, 3 stars seems fair for this drivel.My advice, if someone you know asks you to see this movie and your other choice is to play softball with overripe grapefruits that will squeeze torturous acid in your eyes when you hit them, wear sunglasses and ""swing away""!",The Brothers Grimm
180,donald-martin-175-873978,Boring and frustrating movie,2,14 September 2013,"This movie is very tedious to watch. The story is a ""mystery"" a 2-year-old could solve and the story could have been told out in 5 minutes. The movie amounts to a couple of hours of endless bumbling and plot conveniences and some really poor CGI effects. The characters are unsympathetic morons that no one could possibly give a crap about and the villain should have been able to be stopped at the first encounter if it wasn't for the pure idiocy of the protagonists. Damon and Ledger are only in it for the paycheck and show no special talent in their performances. The story is forgettable 5 minutes after viewing. A total waste of $80 million!

181,TumnusFalls,hated this movie,1,1 September 2005,"I hated - hated --- h a t e d -- this movie. Not because it was illogical beyond its needs, or because of wasted special effects, or humor that fell flat. I hated it most of all because of the way they wasted the lead actors.This was worse than ""Going My Way"" (and that's a terrible movie).Heath Ledger and Matt Damon have done excellent roles in other movies. I'm sure they were paid handsomely for this movie. But they should feel a little bit of guilt, for at $10 they were overpaid for the amount of acting effort required.The movie just spins out of control, and not in a pleasant way. Events just happen, as if script elements were scattered across the floor and the writers (so-called) pull them up randomly and pasted them onto a big page, where they then threw the pages up in the air to see if it would improve.If you like movies where Thuringian peasants in the 1800's dance the hora, then this is the movie for you.",The Brothers Grimm
182,kbenko,Not really much of anything,5,22 October 2007,"This was an OK movie. Not as good or as clever as I had hoped, although the special effects, costumes, etc. were great. Visually, it was an extraordinary movie. In terms of plot and characters (which are what I like), it was no big deal. And I do think that ""I think that went rather well,"" said after an unsuccessful conversation/negotiation/etc. is something no audience should have to sit through in 2007. Or ever again for a few decades until it has gotten so old as to be new again.I'm moved to comment on this movie mostly b/c I spent two hours watching it and hope that time could be put to someone else's use. I chose this movie b/c of Heath Ledger. In spite of the packaging, I thought that he would be sexy and there would be some sexy scenes in the movie. Well, he wasn't, and there weren't.

The idea of him doing a Grothers Grimm movie should be a slam dunk no matter how you look at it but this movie just doesn't have any of that magic. They just kind of plod along through with nothing special about this film at all. Very flat performances, jokes that don't really work and a lackluster story. Too bad too.",The Brothers Grimm
185,magratk,Just about the perfect movie,9,5 September 2005,"Been a long time since I saw a movie I enjoyed that much. A wonderful, whimsical, weird exploration of the conflict between the Old Night (with both its bloodiness and its potential for grace) and The Enlightenment (with both its bloodiness and its potential for liberation). With an affectionate nod towards the Catholic Church and its syncretic traditions. I really loved what Gillian did with the historical characters, the Brothers Grimm. They were linguists who were part of the creation of the modern Germany. They were both forward looking and deeply backwards looking. Utterly modern, utterly not. Here we have two brothers who pierced the veil; saw through the myth and manipulated it for their own purposes, until the myth stepped up and snatched them back into the dark forest, and not even the flames of the Enlightenment could liberate them. Only thinking through the stories. There were literal flames licking those forests. Napoleon's General (John Pryce; wonderful villain) tried to burn down the forest where demons lurked. Was going to burn the stories, burn the brothers, as well. But they were saved by an Angel  Angelica; the love interest; the tracker; the one who had been in the forest. Whose father was all the way into the story. She had the same twinned vision; an educated woman who knew the old stories. They too were educated men who knew the stories. And it isolated them both. The only other person who knew the stories was the general's torturer; the Italian dude. Who saves the stories. Syncretic, like the Catholic Church, pulling the old stories into its own matrix. It also had the oldest magic in the world; calendar magic. 12 crypts with 12 girls, their blood mingled to make a youth restoring elixir for an immortal queen who none the less aged. I'm a sucker for calendar magic. Months and moons and eclipses, oh my. The Empress sent her champion, the Emperor, (the huntsman; the wolf man, the man who eats his own children like time eats his own children) to collect the girls. He actually gets 13, but one is rescued by our heroes. 13 moons. 13 months in the lunar year. Contrasted with the 12 months of the solar year. The Brothers were both avatars of the archetypal Magician. The Magician as thief, story teller, and con man. They found a guide in archetypal High Priestess  in this case, a woman with a bow who guided them in and out of the trackless forest of the intuition; of the mythic imagination. The Empress was the Queen in the Tower  a dark reflection of the Queen of Heaven; the womb and the tomb. The Huntsman was also the Hanged Man, serving the Empress. And the General he General; the avatar of imperial authority. At last, it was a comedy, order restored with a kiss, even though there didn't need to be one. And it was so meta! The story tellers were con men, using stories to trick ignorant villagers out of money. Gilliam is a story teller, using stories to trick us into going to the movie. But the story tellers save the day because they hear the story behind the con, and know how to end it. And the number of fairy tales they wove in. Some were just tiny visual motifs, some were the entire thing. Cinderella (scrubbing floors, glass slippers on the girls in the crypts) Sleeping Beauty (pricked fingers) Little Red Ridding Hood (wandering through the forest, being eaten by a wolf); Hansel and Gretel (searching in the forest, trail of bread crumbs) . . . And older. Crows were everywhere. The Morrigan. Having Isabella Rossellini as the queen who won immortality but not eternal youth was wonderful. The allure and the horror of the timeless stories; forever young; forever retold. It begins ""Once upon a time,"" and it ends ""They lived happily ever after. Or maybe not."" I loved it. My kinda film.",The Brothers Grimm
186,soccer64,Every fairy tale gone wrong...,6,20 December 2005,"Put together every fairy tale you can think of, add a bunch of disturbing dysfunctionality to the characters, add Jack (from Jack and the Beanstalk-turned into Jacob) and a brother who are con artists, and you have The Brothers Grimm- Not that that's a bad thing. I definitely wouldn't recommend this for kids, something tells me they wouldn't want to imagine their favorite fairy tale characters as something evil. The special effects in the movie were certainly decent, however there were a couple spots in the movie where you could tell they cut the scene. The beginning was sort of jumpy, opening up pretty decently, but kind of confusing, then slowed down, then picked back up again in scenes in the wood.What I'd really like to know is why nobody ever just punched the General dude out since he was such an annoying idiote. I also thought the whole French/German thing, while possibly historically accurate (really don't know, really don't care, didn't watch the movie for a documentary-type thing), was really quite useless and only added some confusion in the movie.You could tell that this was a directed by Terry Gilliam (Monty Python and the Holy Grail) when the duck/witch situation came up, and when the kitty went flying into the rather large screwdriver thing.I was actually pretty disappointed with Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. While I haven't seen many (if any?) movies with Matt Damon in them, I think Heath Ledger was great in any I've seen, so I was not very impressed at all when neither of them seemed to show fear or concern when Jacob was on top of the (how many stories?) tall tower, and when they were being burned.Lena Headey was probably my favorite actress in the story. She kind of reminds me of a cross between Keira Knightley and a much younger Karen Allen. She seemed to be a little too...undecided for me. You know, can't seem to make up her mind so she has to kiss both of the brothers?Although I've definitely seen better movies, this one may very well be worth a shot, however I'll have to sleep on it to figure out an exact numerical rating.",The Brothers Grimm
187,mg!,I like chili and chocolate ice cream but I would never eat them together,5,2 September 2005,"Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!What the movie is about: Two humorous fellows who exploit folklore by conning locals they can banish witches, ghosts, and goblins. Hired by the French army, they seek out an evil presence located deep into a dark forest where encounter the real thing. By spinning together a variety of fairy tales ... behold a story of fantasy, courage, and heroism! It's a summer let down.At first impression, The Brothers Grimm is a present day Ghostbusters. It's a fantasy/comedy dealing with creatures taken from myth and heroes, mistaken or not as con-artists who tame such spirits at the request of politicians. Instead of a mayor from New York, it's a general in French-occupied Germany who hires the team to banish evil.There is where the similarities end. Essentially no character development exists save a reference to beans. And that didn't grow anywhere. The film jumps forth and back between humorous fantasy to all out spoof. Is it interesting? Somewhat. Is it clever? Never. It's ""Monty Python"" meets ""In the Company of Wolves"". I like chili and chocolate ice cream but I would never eat them together.Finally: the ""Gilliam factor"". It's difficult to find positive reviews who are not apologists mentioning the director by name. Are there those locking themselves in darkness while the sun glows ever so warmly outside ... stalking IMDb hoping the movie doesn't rate below six? Is Gilliam getting extra points because viewers fear meeting him in a party and don't want to offend him? The Brothers Grimm is an interesting concept pasted together from previous ideas. It's a typical summer movie let down by its quality based on the price of admission.",The Brothers Grimm
188,pdkm_,if Gilliam's commercial film is not as good as it should be - Blame the Brothers Weinstein,8,6 November 2005,"As a Monty Python fan, I enjoy following the members careers post-Python. While Idle and Cleese moved to the US to further their comedy acting careers, Palin went around the world for the BBC, Jones became a TV historian and Chapman went to meet the head of Light Entertainment in the Sky. Gilliam on the other hand, turned to directing.His films, though quite different, have always been identifiable as a 'Gilliam' film. Recently, however, he has run into a bit of problem. His dream project (Don Quixote) was cut down in it's prime, so we had to wait 7 years for another Gilliam film. Though this film was shot and practically finished 18 months ago, The Weinstein Brothers' interference has been far too much. They veto'd Samantha Morton for the role of Angelica, they veto'd his wish for Matt Damon to wear a prosthetic nose, all leading to post-production being shut down for a year.Personally, I've been waiting about 3 years for this film to come out. Some of the problems I had with are that, understandably, Gilliam doesn't dare to be himself on someone else's script. The script itself is questionable at times (Peter Stormare's character is utterly annoying), but don't forget that this was written by the man who wrote Scream 3 and, perhaps one of the worst films, The Ring (The US version). Other problems is that Gilliams use of CGI is amateur at best and that's because Terry Gilliam is NOT supposed to use CGI! This man is a cinematic legend, but he should never use CGI - it takes away the creativity and resourcefulness he found while making the Alien Ship scene in Life Of Brian.However, despite the problems I had I found The Brothers Grimm a highly entertaining experience (although slightly ruined by a group of 20 Welsh adolescents constantly making noise and running about... Bastards). This was your commercial film, Terry, so hopefully you'll go back and make a proper 'Gilliam' film, the one that i've been waiting for 7 years",The Brothers Grimm

It is dreadfully unwatchable and tasteless. It's like one of Monty Python's medieval sketches, drawn out to what seems like three hours and with zero humour. The actors mumble through their lines with accents more in place in 'Allo 'Allo. What passes for humour includes, (person A:) ""I've soiled myself"", (person B:) ""Oh, I thought that was me"", and a cat killed by being kicked into a revolving fan, then Jonathan Pryce licking the bloody remains that have been splattered on he face.It is an ugly, messy, tasteless piece of work, which I'm sorry I had the misfortune to sit through.",The Brothers Grimm
190,mrforgetful,Shrek meets Tim Burton,6,27 August 2005,"In the dark, muddy streets of french-occupied Germany, cheer is lost and the constant presence of napoleon's soldiers strikes fear into locals' hearts. In come two soaked and tired wanderers, desperately seeking an inn. Here starts the tale of The Brothers Grimm, brimming of tasty special effects and intricate set pieces. Here also ends the extent of creative wizardry in this movie. The Brothers Grimm is about two con artists, bros Jacob and Will Grimm (played rather well by Heath Ledger and Matt Damon). They travel Europe creating enchanted monsters and evil witches and demand a fee to vanquish them for good. What starts as a promising concept is lost in a confusing mesh of unoriginal plot details. This is one of those movies that involve so many details that one is constantly having to remind themselves who is what and why they are doing whatever they are doing. In the meantime, store somewhere in your brain where they are and why they are there and where they are going with this. By the end of the movie, you've just confused yourself enough to enjoy the rather light-hearted ending scene. Somewhat similar to the popular Shrek series, the movie takes bits and pieces of popular fairy tales and puzzles them together to create a seemingly new story. What worked in Shrek, however, is that it was more of a parody then a re-imagining, and didn't take itself too seriously. With the Brothers Grimm, there are too many fairy tales to follow and few of them are developed enough to figure out how much they really had to do with the story. Add on almost Burton-esquire (but also very good)set pieces, and you've got a very dark mix of children's stories. The Brothers Grimm is not without its merits, though. Terry Gilliam has created a vision that is a triumph in set design and art direction. The movie looks very good. The special effects are also quite spectacular. Never overbearing or impractical, they serve the story very well and are tastily done (my favorite is the shattering of the witch queen). The two leads are entertaining, but would have been more so with a better script. I enjoyed seeing an almost unrecognizable Heath Ledger in a role different than anything I've seen him in. The counterparts reminded me almost of the voices of Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline in The Road to El Dorado. Peter Stormare is fun to watch as well, even with his ever-confusing change of accent. Complete with walking trees, wolf people, and an unexplained mud monster thing, there is plenty of imagination in this movie but not enough glue to hold it together. The movie could have been much funnier too. I wonder if a revised script and simplified plot would have made this a much better movie. Actually I don't wonder, I'm pretty sure.",The Brothers Grimm
191,bornyesterdayandtomorrow,Hilarious,7,20 February 2006,"This was a hilarious movie. My favorite thing about it, though, was that a lot of the stuff was unexpected. Like the thing in the well--and weird stuff like that.I loved this movie. The feel of it is so...magical. I especially liked Jacob's character--and how he was pushed around because of the magic beans by his older brother, Will, yet he was the true hero of the movie.I think you should really watch this movie. The reason it doesn't have a ten is because of what they dress in--and some of the characters aren't realistic. Here's an example...Angelika is backed up against a wall by the weird French accent guy with a pitchfork. She can easily get away from him--but she doesn't. She's supposed to be a hunter girl too.I really like the movie, don't get me wrong, but the characters have problems. The best character is Jacob. It also has cute creatures, lines, and--well--it's just fun. This is suitable for teens--and some that are younger. I didn't see anything wrong with it.This is only a beefed up fantasy story. Scary (a little) and funny. Parents, just in case, watch the movie first--just to make sure I'm not lying. How bad could it be, right?

But I am very disappointed in this movie. Although the plot is very interesting, I think it is poorly developed. The film has all the Terry Gilliam trademarks. It is dark, mystical, imaginative, and it is well casted. But the pieces do not fit together well. Films like Brazil and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen are very visual, but this film has very few memorable visual elements. Twelve Monkeys had so many plot details that I pick up on new details each time I watch that film. Maybe that is what is lacking. I expected more depth. Also, I do not think the chemistry is there between Heath and Matt. I think the only strong performance was by Jonathan Pryce, a favorite actor of Terry Gilliam films.

While having certain affinity with Sleepy Hollow, you can see clearly the difference in approach.Of course I would love to see the first Gilliam, the troublemaker, but as A Man in La Mancha proved, the studios are not very keen of such projects.

195,jdgratz,Brothers Grimm lived up to this viewers expectations.,9,28 August 2005,"Going to see this movie with a friend who works in the film industry, I was a bit concerned. If anyone is ever critical about some things that most would take lightly, he is. There is no flaw to this, though. Clearly when you spend your life doing it for a living, you will be picky of every aspect.So we went to see this with different expectations. I went to see a movie made by one of my favorite directors, and he went to see ANOTHER movie made by a great director. In other words, he was expecting Brazil or Twelve Monkeys, I was expecting a cool fictional story that incorporated the many fictional fairy tales I was told as a child.I got what I wanted, however, my friend did NOT.I never find it a good practice to go into any movie expecting a director or even a writer that I like to be trying to make a movie that is comparable to whatever film or films made my like that particular individual.The thing about a director is that the movie is typically written by someone else. the base story is going to determine the outcome no matter how good or bad the director is. If you look at some of the movies that made Gilliam a household name for people that care (ie - Fisher King, 12 Monkeys, Brazil) his hand in writing is typically minimal (exception, of course, of Brazil).Brothers Grimm may be a bit more lighthearted than these movies, but what's wrong with that? So, some of Gilliams most memorable works were a bit more on the dark side of things when it came to the characters and subject matter. This film takes on the dark side of lightheartedness.The characters are a bit more easy going, the one liners a bit quicker and more direct, and the story a bit less fantastic, but from beginning to end, it was an enjoyable trip with a clear-cut beginning, plot, and ending.",The Brothers Grimm
196,TheFilmProf,"Gilliam's meta-fairytale, It's not Disney...and it's not too good",5,6 June 2006,"When it comes to serving up something completely different, you can always count on Terry Gilliam. This time his focus is on the Brothers Grimm, Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jacob (Heath Ledger), renowned collectors of folklore and fairy tales. In a radical departure from the familiar Disney renditions of their tales, Gilliam creates a meta-fairy tale suggesting that the brothers not only chronicled and documented folk legends, but were a pair of clever mountebanks as well, out to exploit the fear and myths instilled in an unenlightened and gullible society.Ambling through a Napoleon-conquered, French occupied Germany late in the 19th century, the brothers make their way through the countryside exorcising and expelling mythical demons believed to be living among the innocents. With the help of two assistants, Jake and Will stage elaborate and convincingly effective theatrics that simultaneously rid the towns of their witches and their riches. It's a lucrative enough trade, which goes quite well until they are caught by the French Army and the blustery governor, General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce). Facing torture and execution, the brothers accept Delatombe's offer to solve the mystery of several missing children in the town of Marbaden.If you have a strong appreciation for Gilliam's surrealistic/expressionistic visual style, there's a lot to like about this film, but it's achieved at the expense of a cohesive narrative. The acting is a bit uneven, and at times it's as though everyone is reading from a different script. Peter Stomare goes way over the top as Cavaldi, the Italian henchman of General Delatombe, and is more a buffoon than fairy tale villain. And Angelika (Lena Headley), Marbaden's most--maybe only--liberated woman and the object of affection of both brothers, is perhaps a little too twenty-first century, but still one of the strongest characters in the film. With two of her sisters among the missing, Angelika joins forces with the Grimms in a cooperative, if uneasy alliance, and becomes the catalyst who at first polarizes, but in the end unifies the brothers, who like most siblings have their differences. Will is pragmatic and cynical; not prone to believing in anything mystical, unlike Jake, who, although not thoroughly convinced that magic really exists in the world, surely wants to be. Metaphorically, the brothers represent the conflict between a residual ignorance from the middle ages and the intellect of 18th century enlightenment.Liberally mixing and matching various tales, Gilliam himself becomes a fabulist, weaving a hypothetical and imaginative fantasy that is marginally successful. At times dark and unwelcoming in its style, he often resorts to Monty Python-esquire slapstick humor and absurdity. Each time you settle into an imaginary, mystical past, you're jarred into a brief sitcom present. Anachronistic puns and one-liners interrupt the suspension of disbelief and break the continuity of the magical mood he's trying hard to establish. Though the film does sustain the obligatory moral outcomes inherent in fairy tales--good defeats evil; everyone lives happily ever after--it lacks the synergism that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts, and adds up to slightly less. Gilliam straddles the line between reality and fantasy without ever squarely deciding just which point of view he wants to convey. He aims high, but his ambitions fall somewhat short as the film never really gets revved up. It's not Terry Gilliam at his best, but there are worse ways to spend a day at the movies.© 2005",The Brothers Grimm

Technically, it's a beautiful film full of a lot of intense and great imagery. The script and acting, however, leave a lot to be desired.The production design borrows a lot from things like Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" and 80s fantasy classics like ""Dark Crystal"" and ""Labyrinth."" I was so caught up in watching the images and being drawn into this dark world that the comedy they kept trying to infuse was jarring. In fact, there are a couple of comic relief characters whom I wish could just be eliminated.I was really looking forward to this film.

198,D_la,Well worth a viewing,7,17 November 2005,"I really enjoyed this film, possibly because I'd read so many bad reports and people giving out about it. Okay, so it wasn't perfect, but it was more than entertaining. Ledger and Damon were good in their roles as brothers out to con their way through life. Maybe the Italian torture fella was a little over done, but I was in that sort of a mood and found him funny.I loved the way the film opened in French occupied Germany, we don't see that very often. Nor do we usually hear German peasants speaking with Northern English accents, but, weirdly enough, it works. Set in Napoleonic times the film contrasts the practical, sensible French with the romantic, gullible Germans. Will and Jacob have been pretending to fight magic and witchcraft across Germany, getting well paid for it, until the French catch them and send them off to capture whomever is playing their trick and stealing little girls.As you may be able to guess, the person stealing the children is not a conman, and and Grimms have real magic to deal with.Visually, I adored this film. The scene of the child sliding down the horse's throat. Genius. The forest is very creepy, and fits the dark humoured atmosphere of the film.",The Brothers Grimm
199,nettminder,An original twist and a good adventure movie!,7,11 November 2008,"When I first watched this movie I had to view it in parts because of my kids. Maybe that is why it did not click with me at first. After viewing it again and on a better TV I was really surprised with how much I enjoyed the story and the adventure that takes place. I think this movie is original how they worked in different parts of the Grimm fairy tales into the movie. Many people will not remember but these fairy tales were very dark in nature and ""child friendly"" at all. Damon and Ledger both do a great job and are at times humorous. The beautiful Lena Headey plays her role with some intensity and Monica Belluci is always great in small doses. The funniest character in the movie has to be Calvaldi played by Peter Stormare. Jonathan Pryce also has some good scenes. I really liked the lighting in this movie and the set pieces. It reminded me of a brighter Sleepy Hollow. This movie bombed here in the US but made close to double overseas bringing it to a $105 million gross with a production budget of $88 million. It definitely should have made more in the US but sometimes things are missed with our audiences in my opinion. Great movie if you take it as the adventure story it is.",The Brothers Grimm
200,tom_dimaggio,I probably was misguided by the cast and the trailer,1,16 October 2005,"The movie was not at all what I expected. Some might say that this might add to the disappointment. But most of the time when a movie is not what I expect I am surprised and end up loving it. This wasn't the case for ""The Brothers Grimm"".During the whole movie I was waiting for the scene(s) that would give it some sense. Well I left the cinema still waiting for that. It just didn't make any sense to me at all. The characters were not convincing , the story inexistent, and some moments were very cliché. Many situations that were the center of attention at a certain point were then just left aside totally unexplained.For me one of the worst this year",The Brothers Grimm

Slightly annoying accents.I won't be dwelling on the images for much longer than it takes to finish this review. I probably would have been disappointed if I had paid Ten Bucks in the theater but for the cost of a rental I'd recommend it. But this was not Brazil, Time Bandits, Fisher King, and especially not Fear and Loathing.What's up Terry?

202,vetmad,A visual joyride,9,10 September 2005,"I had seen the trailer and my expectations were accordingly high. They were fully met by an awesome, well and less well known cast, a rather unconventional approach to the whole Grimm Brothers universe and stunning visuals; Some of the CGI though I have to admit, struck me as sort of amateurish in a few scenes, compared to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. The overall impression though is really stunning with beautiful set decoration and lavish costumes. The story itself is somewhat old fashioned but entertaining and it's even more fun when you know about the Grimm's fairy tales beyond the usual Disney-stuff, since you'll be able to better appreciate all the tiny details woven into the movie's story. It's a mixture of ""Sleepy Hollow"" meets ""Signs"" meets ""Twelve Monkeys"", so if you liked those, go and enjoy this one!",The Brothers Grimm
203,gfast,"Not one of Gilliam's best, but still amazing.",7,1 February 2007,"As a fan of Terry Gilliam's films, (he and Tim Burton two of cinema's most inventive directors)I was looking forward to The Brothers Grimm. All you would expect from a Gilliam film, is here, but somehow the story (overall) is un-engaging and its like watching a dog chasing its tail; plenty of action, but it doesn't really get anywhere. Compared to say, The Princess Bride, also a fairy tale, this somewhat pales by comparison. However notwithstanding this shortfall, this is a must-see for any lover of real cinema. The art design, cinematography, costumes, sets, lighting and all things technical (except some dodgy CGI work with some of the creatures) and fantastical imagery are mind-boggling and this film must be seen on a large theatre screen for proper impact. Some sequences literally are jaw-droppingly good, for their sheer visceral appeal and absolute beauty. The Red Riding Hood sequences in particular a knock-out. A forgiving 7/10.",The Brothers Grimm
204,katyggls,Fairy Tales Gone Wild,6,12 September 2005,"I went to see The Brothers Grimm on Saturday night. I rarely go out to the theater to see a movie. I dislike the sticky floors, the smell of stale popcorn, the outrageous price of both the tickets and the concession stand, and the inability to rewind. Once in a while though, a movie intrigues me enough to venture out and see it on the big screen. I had seen the previews for this one and thought it looked promising.The Brothers Grimm is a tale that mixes history with fantasy. It portrays the Grimm brothers (who wrote such fairy tales as Hansel And Gretel, Rapunzel, and Snow White), as a couple of con artists (played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger), who travel around Europe separating the superstitious peasantry from their money by claiming that their villages are enchanted or inhabited by various monsters, witches, vampires, etc. They are then forced by the French army to confront the evil in a small Bavarian hamlet, which turns out to be all too real.This film has a few problems. It's a bit hard to follow, lacking any expository characters. The story changes locations a lot, and with few explanations it's hard to keep up. Many of the characters say things that make absolutely no sense, or that you can't make out at all. A fantasy, which this clearly is, has got to have a little logic thrown into it, or it makes no sense; with this there are no rules, no themes, and a plot that struggles to stay on task. I only vaguely know what Jacob Grimm was writing in his book the entire time, and have only a cloudy understanding of what allowed the Brothers to triumph in the end. Hell, I don't even really know who ended up with the girl! (Because of course there's a girl).There are some redemptions. It's a very good premise. Do you remember being scared of some of the fairy tales you read when you were a child? This film takes that fear, that essential sinister quality that most so-called fairy tales possess, and runs with it. There are some quite chilling moments (check out the ""gingerbread man"" scene) which definitely make this out of bounds for young children, in my opinion. The effects, while not awe-inspiring, are certainly entertaining.Overall, this film, like the authors which inspired it, seems to have a fantastic imagination that ran away with itself, leaving the audience in the dust, mildly entertained but more than a little confused.",The Brothers Grimm
205,demonslayer06,The most UNIQUE movie of the year!,8,24 November 2005,"I have finally seen a movie this year that has a refreshingly different sense of style! There hasn't been such a unique picture like this since I was a little kid. At least, this movie helped make me feel like a kid, in a very cool way! Terry Gilliam has an excellent way of combining inventive fantasy, with a powerful message underneath. The interesting thing, though, is that I got a different message than what was probably intended. Upon reading the comment made by Terry Gilliam about The Brothers Grimm, in which he said that the film was an attempt to break open the shell of the views that adults have on the world, I was reminded of what I got from the movie. I got that people should have faith. Faith is an important asset in the universe that we all could use more of nowadays. But, if you do not care to look at cinema in that particular way, then The Brothers Grimm can accommodate you in the funny, scary, heartwarming category as well! Enjoy!",The Brothers Grimm
206,sensons,"Terrible, alleviation and chaotic",1,13 October 2005,"Its a pity that Gilliam never arises above his monthy python level. Brothers Grimm has all the ingredients for a great movie , but Gilliam has just made it into a series of sketches that makes the movie very very childish and boring. Mr Gilliam should realize that the Monthy Pyton years are over. he mixes all brother Grimm fairy tails into a big complete chaos , the kind of chaos that was nice in M.P. but that is out of date and out of time.I wonder if Mr.Damon and Mr.Hedger where very pleased with the result. It was a big mistake to let Gilliam be the director of this movie. A waste of money and resources. I feel sorry for the people who made the terrific special effects . They are the only good thing in the movie. It could have be made in the same way "" a knights tale"" was directed. But I think that kind of humor is to difficult for Mr.Gilliam, who also seems to have problems to stay focused on a storyline.Don't spend money on brothers Grimm",The Brothers Grimm

There are going to be spoilers within here, so if you wanna see this mistake of a movie, stop reading. Not like you will miss much or find out anything interesting. That would mean that the movie would have had something interesting in it besides the beautiful Maria Bellucci. She made the movie as the Queen. Now, anyone who was a kid, that means everyone, has heard of the fairy tales... the Grimm Tales? Yes, those are good. Bad is when you take all of them, try to make one story out of them... I cannot make sense on how Hansel and Gretel and Little Red Riding hood have anything in common besides a forest? There is the key word... FOREST. That is all this movie is about. A forest, with moving trees and branches. Okay, sounds dull, well, keep watching... It only gets worse. Matt Damon has on so much damn rouge I couldn't tell it was him. My friend had to point it out to me. Heath Ledger is cute, as always... But at the end of this movie, it seems like the brothers are going to share the main love interest... Incest? I think so... I am trying to fins a decent part to tell you about, but all that comes to mind is Maria Bellucci. She is just beautiful. She may have been in the movie for 15 minutes total, but she made her mark. That Italian beauty. Please please please people! Spare yourself from this movie. This had to be the worst movie to film. So dull... hanging out in a forest for a month or however long they were on location. The movie literally takes place almost solely in the forest. Very Lame...

209,sfwriter999,A Grim Movie,6,28 December 2005,"Unlike some viewers, I found the effects seamless and I loved the look of everything. The problem was the Brothers were too much in superhero mode and there was no sense of peril. They joked and walked through everything effortlessly. The Italian Torturer was over the top and annoying. The French were annoying too, but not as much. Somehow I felt that Terry Gilliam thinks that over-the-top stereotypes of French and Italians are funny. Yeah, in little doses, but I think I OD'ed.The plot lacked direction. The characters aimlessly wandered from the village to the forest, to the village, to the castle, to the village, to the forest, etc. There was a lot of physical movement, but no movement in the story.There are some very nice scenes which reminded me of several famous paintings and those were lovely.

Some parts including the beginning were a bit hard to follow.When they introduced the brothers Grimm,I was simply lost for a moment.Though the film dosen't have much of a plot,it was still in some parts quite enjoyable.Matt Dammon and Heath Lodger are pretty good at playing the two silly brothers,the score was excellent and the landscaping was great.Parts in the movie were quite strange including the ridiculous but highly original sequence when the horse ate up one of the daughters.The film did have a humorous touch to it which also worked quite well. The film does deserve a 14A rating.There is plenty of gore to be watched.I think I have covered everything now.In my opinion,if the film was done done better,it would have been great.Tim Burton would have done a great job making this film.Like I said before,some people may find it perfectly enjoyable,others,a complete waste of time.It is kinda worth checking out.It's not terrible but it could have been done better.2.5/5",The Brothers Grimm

But now, that i have seen it, i can't accept a higher ranking than 3 (which is real optimistic).This movie is a mixture of plenty of Grimm brothers' stories, but badly modified. This movie jumps from one story to another (you will recognize their characters) without any logic.It's like seeing a movie for children but with plenty of harsh language and somewhat violent, so inappropriate for a child to see.Anyway, it IS inappropriate for adults to see, too. Unless you are a REAL fan of movies without a plot, nor action. It's like seeing a trailer instead of the movie.

213,bdx3,"Thank you, Mr. Gilliam",10,3 January 2006,"(w/one little itty-bitty spoiler, not in context) When I was very young, there were two off-beat literary moments that have stayed with me through the years. I am now um, 54, so this holds more weight as do I. The first was a hardcover book that my parents had on the shelf. They were big on reading and had quite a library - 'Mutiny on the Bounty'& 'Gone with the Wind' among others. This book hung out there but was never referred to. It was 'Grimms Fairy Tales' and one day I decided to read it, having heard so many references.Well it was not anything I had imagined fairy tales to be. Mean, terrible things happened and I felt scared just reading them.The other was a magazine I found in a store that sold Mad Magazine and others like it. In the same rack I found one called 'HELP!' It was different - really different. And hilarious. I had never seen anything like it - imagine a warthog as a superhero whose only weakness is lemon meringue pie, among other stuff.This movie combines the two. And whereas you might think this is all very personal, I am stating here and now that Terry Gilliam is one of the funniest artists ever. To me in the twentieth century, you had 3 top movie comedies - ""Modern Times"", ""Duck Soup"", and ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"".""The Brothers Grimm"" is a superbly crafted and memorable treatment to the art of storytelling - and you have story on stories within stories about stories here - all with the whimsical touch of a cinematic master. You have to sit back and relax for this one. The texture is rich and the colors tantalizing. The soundtrack (best in surround sound) is excellent - the crows in the forest bring you right into it. The superstitious townspeople in the bar, when a witch is mentioned, all spit on the floor and we hear every ptoui down to the last one which hits a tin cup with a decisive ding! To those of you who criticize the closeness of this with ""Baron Munchausen"" I admonish. This is not a minus but a plus. It's like saying ""A Tale of Two Cities is too much like ""Great Expectations"". This is exactly how I would have hoped a movie about Grimms fairy tales be treated. I'll have no trouble keeping both DVDs together on the rack (so to speak) and hope for many more.Thanks again Mr. Gilliam.",The Brothers Grimm

There are mere hints of fairy tales there. And some just seem tossed in there. Like suddenly, one child has glass slippers on. Huh? Some of the ways the children disappear are rather...um, freaky. The promo makes it seem like the violence would be more off screen. But...nope. Right there to see in twisted gory. Or glory, whatever.The film just seemed tossed together with no real plot either.

It just doesn't know what it's trying to be, so it dabbles a little in everything, and does nothing well. It has some great talent, and good directing, and a great premise, but in the end, it lacks a script to do justice to any of the elements. The script tries too hard to include too many of the Grimm's Fairy tales into one story, rather than picking a few good elements, and leaving room for a legitimate sequel. Frankly, I would really like to see Heath Ledger and Matt Damon in another picture together with a better script. Bottom line analysis: Too many elements, not enough cohesion, mildly disappointing, and not worth the eight bucks admission. See this one in the dollar theaters.",The Brothers Grimm

Then the kicking of the kitten into a fan where its pulverized and splatters all the onlookers to which the King licks the blood up-I mean come on.

219,hmckiel,Weird,5,23 September 2005,"Yes, The Brothers Grimm has good acting. They did a very good job of casting. Matt Daemon and Heath Ledger do as good a job as anyone could, maybe a little better, but I'm surprised they didn't have a silent ""what the hey are we doing?"" expression on they're faces somewhere near the end of the film.Anyways, the film is about these two con artists. They're brothers, they go around Europe tricking people into paying them to get rid of monsters that don't even exist. But they soon get themselves into a strange situation that requires authentic bravery rather then the bogus junk they usually do. I guess fake bad guys require fake heroism to destroy.The villain in the film is an evil queen of some sort who laid around rotting for the last 500 years controlling a wide variety of random fairy tale characters so that they can drag a bunch of little girls into the forest and sacrifice them to the queen so that she may return to the world of the living and cause a ruckus. Needless to say, The Brothers Grimm prove themselves to be true heroes and come save the day.All in all, this film is a jamboree of bad CGI, horrible camera work, and random jump scenes.

There was no character development, no good story line, very predictable dialog.The acting was decent, but there was no help from the writer. In my opinion, I would have had the writer direct as well, I think that it would have brought a more personable sense to the screen, and final product.Another horrible thing about the picture was the ending, it was just pointless, with no explanation.

221,mcdgames,Under-appreciated Surrealism,7,22 August 2006,"I enjoyed this movie to watch it a multitude of times; as the main comment suggests, it is much like Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" (which is one of my favorite movies).It's greatest strength is it's cinematography and Gilliam's fantasy vision he's known for in all of his films. It is colorful and somewhat convoluted (you need to watch it more than once to get the undercurrents).Heath Ledger and Matt Damon are interesting anti-heroes, and I found myself rooting for Ledger much more than Damon in this. Some other performances are odd and over-the-top, but there is one scene in which one of the villains (the killer from ""Fargo"") loses his toupee and goes into a panic attack trying to retrieve it. The main women of the story are breathtakingly beautiful, but I believe the Red Queen is a magnificent villain while the actress playing the huntress/guide was somewhat lackluster. Jonathan Pryce is good also, but he comes off too strange for a tension building adversary for our heroes as they blunder about.The artwork (as in ""Sleepy Hollow"") is the main thing to watch here. Some of the acting is disjointed, but I've never seen a movie by Gilliam that wasn't a tad off-the-mark.",The Brothers Grimm
222,pfgpowell,VERY curate's egg as we say in Britain,3,27 March 2006,"In Gilliam's Brothers Grimm is a good movie struggling to get out. It never makes it. Although the overall look of the film is consistent, this has the feel of several different movies being strung together. It's not funny, it's not scary, it's not intriguing, it's rarely entertaining and it's full of loose ends. Watching it with my son, six, and daughter, nine  I am 56  I kept having to ask them what was going. They seemed to know but I was, at times, baffled. We were taken down so many highways and byways which led nowhere that it was more like going on a less than magical mystery tour. Perhaps that's my stupidity. Perhaps not. Matt Damon and Heath Ledger do tolerably well given that both are cast against type, the sets are great, Jonathan Pryce and Peter Stomare simply seem to be content with enjoying themselves and to hell with the audience. There's no coherent plot, the romantic interest is vastly undercooked and the film can't make up its mind what it wants to be. We Watched on DVD and also looked at the special feature on the making off the film. Apart from the usual Hollywood mutual schmoozing about how great it was to work with the other actors (when will someone publicly say ""I hated the creep'? Never, of course, or at the very end of a career), I was amazed at the amount of computer-generation this film made use of. To what end, you ask, if the storyline is so hopelessly flimsy? I understand that Gilliam had his usual problems with The Suits, but on this offering, I'm inclined to feel more sympathy for The Suits. The Brothers Grimm is by no means all bad, it just isn't very good, either. There are references to some of the real Grimm fairy tales, but these never make sense, or, at least, internal sense. They are simply tacked on. I feel a jerk for criticizing Gilliam, because Hollywood and the film worked needs some mavericks such as him. But we also need films which we enjoy for themselves, not ones we give a sympathy vote to. I could imagine a Czech or Italian filmmaker making a far better first of this. As I say there is a good film in there somewhere, but you just get bored trying to track it down.",The Brothers Grimm

Jacob & Wilhelm Grimm have a job ""ridding"" towns of monsters, witches etc. but the thing is that the monsters are really actors that are hired by the Grimms, so they do it all for the money.

Another scene, a kitten (an adorable, bouncing, happy-to-be-alive kitten) is disintegrated up by a razor, disgusting! Anyway, the story is not that complex, it literally is like a fairy tale, but just a twisted one, so you'll see (if you want to, but I didn't like most of it) signs from stories such as Repunzel, Frog Prince, Little Riding Hood, Snow White, Jack & Beanstalk, Princess & Pea, and other hints here & there.The characters were not really lovable especially Cavaldi, he was a sicko, he was some kind of master of torture. the Grimms were humorous protagonists, Will was sort of a handsome hunk & Jake was a nerdy bookworm. Angelika seemed like the only moral person in the whole movie (though the GrandMother Toad scene was rather weird). The Mirror Queen was very beautiful (or at least she was in the mirror), but she was a villainess that was very scared to lose, so she wasn't that ""evilish"".I don't know if I can recommend it for you, I thought it was going to be good, but it was silly & twisted.

224,jeremyemmet,Not your usual Gilliam,5,4 January 2006,"I didn't realize this was a Terry Gilliam movie until the closing credits. I simultaneously reacted with shock, and slapped my for-head with an, ""Of course!"" The sense of wonder and imagination ever-present in Gilliam's fantasy films is completely absent here, but his characteristic style is all over the movie. Gilliam departs slightly from his staunch reliance on practical effects, and the film is weaker for it. A few instances of painfully obvious CGI pull the viewer out of the ""reality"" of the forest, and his traditional puppetry/cinematography techniques simply work much better. There is a very glib, almost disaffected feel to this movie. This ultimately works in its favour, since if it had taken itself too seriously it would have been impossible to swallow. The actors take to this style well, but are often working with weak, one-dimensional characterizations. Jonathon Price virtually reprises his role from The Adventures of Baron Von Munchausen, only with too much Napolean added (Napolean is not actually rendered in the film, the character is a French General). Peter Stormare does an excellent job of playing what is unfortunately a character of little value, a bizarre mix of cowardly thug and authoritarian hero. There is nearly universal praise for Heath Ledger regarding his performance, and I am no different. Jake Grimm is easily the most likable and best-written character. I also expected that Ledger had been typecast, and would appear is the stalwart fantasy hero yet again. I was delightfully surprised to see an entirely new side to his talents. Gilliam has made a film that is probably good for his career. As a big-budget summer adventure movie, this is above-average and watchable. As a Terry Gilliam fantasy, it is a disappointment.",The Brothers Grimm

Another scene, a kitten (an adorable, bouncing, happy-to-be-alive kitten) is disintegrated up by a razor, gross, gross, gross! Go to Heaven little kitten, live in the lands of your Heavenly Creator! Oh... Sorry, lost my head, didn't I? Anyway, the story is not that complex, it literally is like a fairy tale, but just a twisted one, so you'll see (if you want to, but I didn't like most of it) signs from stories such as Repunzel, Frog Prince, Little Riding Hood, Snow White, Jack & Beanstalk, Princess & Pea, and other hints here & there.The characters were not really lovable especially Cavaldi, he was a sicko, he was some kind of master of torture. the Grimms were humorous protagonists, Will was sort of a handsome hunk & Jake was a nerdy bookworm. Angelika seemed like the only moral person in the whole movie (though the GrandMother Toad scene was rather weird). The Mirror Queen was a venus (or at least she was in the mirror), but she was a villainess that was very scared to lose, so she wasn't that ""evilish"".I don't know if I can recommend it for you, I thought it was going to be good, but it was silly & twisted. The acting is pretty good, good for THIS film, but you probably think differently",The Brothers Grimm

She wipes it off, but her eyes were gone. The mud consumed them. Now the mud ends up consuming her entire body, and then turns into the ginger bread man. Now he eats his arm and jumps back into the well. I felt like hurting who ever's idea that was. Badly.

227,zdac,"A beautiful, amusing, frustrating mess...",6,21 December 2005,"William and Jacob Grimm are two young shysters in a Napoleonic-occupied Germany, who run a sort of charlatan-exorcism business by combining Jacob's genuine love of folklore and Will's knowledge of science and gadgetry. After bilking superstitious peasants by ousting fake spirits, they are apprehended by absurdly stereotyped French soldiers and offered a deal. They will be spared the guillotine if they expose a plot in a neighboring town where the locals are in a panic over disappearing children.Chaperoned by an outrageous, sadistic Italian mercenary, they set out to solve the mystery. Naturally, it turns out that there is more than mere subterfuge at work... the woods are truly cursed by the spirit of an ancient evil queen who resides in a rickety spire at the center of the wood. They are aided in their misadventures by a maverick huntswoman... a kind of grown-up wanna-be Keira Knightly in a fusion of both her KING ARTHUR bow-wielding-celt role and her PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 19th century feminist character.Normally I love Terry Gilliam's work... I find it amusing that an earlier poster recommended this film to those who like Tim Burton, since Gilliam's been at this for much longer than that.However this film was a muddled, chaotic mess. Frantic, but without the resonance of Gilliam's usual stuff. Rather unfortunate, since some of the magic was there. It was a very pretty mess, after all...Throughout the story, Gilliam's trademark baroque fairy-tale visuals are in full bloom, and at every turn, there are references to numerous Grimms' tales... some appropriate, some almost random. However the tone is inconsistent, the plot convoluted, and the characterizations hasty and absurdly exaggerated.Themes of folkloric narratives invading the ""real"" world, 19th century tall-tales, and the contrast between Doubters (like the shrewd womanizing Will) and Dreamers (the befuddled and hopelessly romantic Jacob) are not new to Terry Gilliam, but these ideas were much better exposited in earlier films such as TIME BANDITS and especially ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN, than here in BROTHERS GRIMM.I think it could have done with less CGI and more of his oldschool practical effects, but that seems to be par for the course these days, there were some great images overall... wacky, almost Python-esquire at times, while at others darkly disturbing.As a good fairy-tale should be I guess...And BROTHERS GRIMM is full of cool stuff... big bad wolves, shapechanging woodsmen, magical objects, carnivorous ambulatory trees, malevolent (and terrifying) mud-gingerbread men... so I hate to give it a total pan. Yet, it's at best an amusing failure by a creative and interesting director... perhaps not unlike Ridley Scott's Legend, I suppose.Worth seeing if these elements interest you, but prepare to sift through a muddled, slapdash mire of uneven acting, chaotic mood swings, and generally hastiness, despite it's almost 2-hour running time.

Gone were his wild swinging-in-close-ups, his over the top acting (which has suited his films perfectly), his fun and excitement, and his sense of humor. In its place are examples and glimpses at such traits that make Gilliam Gilliam, but smoothed over to make it look and sound more like a normal movie, which only makes for a jarring experience, and drains the life almost completely out of it. Fans of Gilliam never fear, I feel he still has it, he just ran into a few problems with the studio. Plus a very poor script didn't help much either, as it lacked subtlety and coherence. All in all, the film was a complete mess, and its saving grace, to my surprise, ended up being Heath Ledger with a remarkable performance akin to that of Johnny Depp's work, as you can't help but be enchanted by his each and every move. Damon was perfectly fine, but the other characters suffered from Gilliam trying to use them his way, with his amusing over acting, but the studio shunning him at certain moments, giving for uneven, and cringe worthy performances. Its a real shame through and through. But, I imagine Tidelands will be Gilliam back in form, and I just hope The Brothers Grimm doesn't hurt his reputation.",The Brothers Grimm

True, the brothers themselves were merely librarians and led fairly boring lives (okay, boring in our sense today, they probably found it spectacular), so this is obviously a fictional tale of their history and inspiration. But it was nonetheless enchanting in its own way.I applaud Heath Ledger for stepping outside of his normal boundaries and playing a wacky character. The constantly scrunched up face, the jittery composition, he was out of his usual bubble of acting. I was thoroughly impressed.And Matt Damon did a decent job of playing the ""wiser"" brother who is fed up with his brother's antics, determined to find the logical explanation and devious in his own way. It wasn't too far from Matt's usual line of acting.The story got a tad too heavy at times, there were some flashy scenes that didn't need to be done, but all in all, I only have good things to say about the acting, and the photography was brilliant. Whoever got the idea to create a false reality of the origin of these fairy tales and the authors that wrote them is a genius.If you like this movie, I highly recommend watching the musical Into The Woods.",The Brothers Grimm
230,Hoko46,Brothers Grimm... oh so very Grimm,5,28 August 2005,"Terry Gilliam, showes us his brilliance of writing and witty stories, with his credits in "" Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" and "" Fear and Loathing In Los Vegas."" he falls way to short for what we are use to seeing in The brothers Grimm. first lets ponder the story:This is a fairytale, that is short of being nice. the brothers Grimm, played by Damon and LEdger, come from a poor family and so in their later years would of coarse search and gain wealth. they get their wealth by going village to village, in a French occupied part of Germany, telling the villagers far-fetched stories of witches and ghouls. they then set out with 'in the dark' helpers to get rid of these fake enchantments, that don't really haunt these villages. the village pays up money for the useless help and the brothers Grimm move on to the next town. until they forced to help a town from an enchantment that has taken justice on eleven young girls. when The brothers Grimm discover, with the help of a female Trapper, a worn down tower in the middle of a fast moving forest they realize they are about to come face to face with a REAL enchantment, and its up to them to solve the mystery of the dead queen, and to save the day with their very un useful gadgets.the story sounds captivating and full of action, adventure and humor. but this unfortunately falls short. The story loses it's grasp on the audience towards the middle of the movie, and the actors never get a grasp on their characters. Ledger is wonderful to watch, but Matt Damen slows the movie down as the bossy and hot headed older brother. for once we see Ledger in a vulnerable roll, and is one of the only reasons to take a peek at this movie. ( video rental). some other problems were, scene to scene cuts were very confusing because the editing was way off from average. and Gilliam needed to spend more money on his special effects. the set was nice to look at, but he ruined his back rounds with his cheesy and sometimes choppy CGI. he also needed to look over his choices for the Itlain and French Deltobe played by Pryce, both these characters are really hard to listen too with their fake accents, un-funny antics and unbearable acting. the dialogs that were given to the ' comedians' of the movie was dull, slow, and sometimes delivered to quick to even get the punch line.Tery Gilliam's film is fun to sit through if you having nothing else to do or watch. it's fun to point out the fairy tales from "" Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" to "" The Gingerbread man."" and there's a lot to learn from , from the wonderful underlying meaning of the film, but Brothers will be Brothers. and these two were too Grimm. 5 out of ten. see it on video release.",The Brothers Grimm

So don't even think about that this film has much in common with their actual life.However the idea of the film is not bad, although it could have been made better. The acting is mediocre, the visual effects are looking at some places if they were from theater sceneries, also the storyline could have been developed better. But the film has many clever references to the fairy tales, it is fun and the action itself isn't bad either.The created atmosphere is not bad, but maybe this genre would be more suitable for Tim Burton, his style probably would have been more appropriate in recreating the fairy environment.Anyway, I recommend the film if you are seeking a light, one-night, popcorn movie.

It began too fast, and as such we never get to know the principal characters Will and Jacob Grimm (Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) well enough, before more and more quite frivolous and poorly edited scenes are thrown at us with careless abandon.It is certainly an imaginative film, and not two scenes pass without some madly inventive device being used, usually incorporating a facet of some Grimm fairytale or other, but due the film's lack of coherent structure, these ideas are lost.

233,jdavisbruin,Brothers Grimm Grim Indeed,1,3 September 2005,"A few weeks ago when I saw ""Asylum"" starring Natasha Richardson and Ian McKellen, I thought that it had to have been the worst movie of the summer. Enter ""The Brothers Grimm,"" which is by far the worst film I've ever seen. Granted, I haven't seen every film ever made, but I have seen ""The Wiz,"" ""American Wedding,"" and ""Reefer Madness: The Musical,"" and ""The Brothers Grimm"" was much worse.In ""The Brother's Grimm,"" an evil witch kills 12 beautiful girls in a small German village. They were the lucky ones. As I write this my a** still hurts from being raped out of $8.25. Yes, I got f***ed in the a** by Heath Ledger and Matt Damon and strangely enough did not enjoy it.This movie was chock-full of bad acting, bad accents, and very crude, unnecessarily violent images, most of which involved cruelty to animals. For me, a good time at the movies does not involve seeing horses being burned, fed spiders, or dropped from three stories up. Seeing a rabbit being skinned or a cat being cut to bits isn't fun either. Add some people being sliced in half, and the images here are more terrifying than a mud wrestling match between Bea Arthur, Eartha Kitt, Janet Reno, and Mickey Rooney.It's really disappointing that this film was such a dismal failure. I love hearing familiar fairy tales twisted into unfamiliar stories, but this was downright awful. While fairy tales should be used to educate and entertain children, the future fruits of my loins will only see this movie as punishment.

234,Starfiremyst,The Brothers Grimm: A Very Weird and Surreal Movie,10,9 May 2008,"Directed by Terry Gilliam, ""The Brothers Grimm"" starred Matt Damon and the Right-Now-Deceased Heath Ledger as they lead an all star cast, and brief cameo appearances by the Muppets Statler and Waldorf as themselves, and ""The Brothers Grimm"" is also released in 2005 as the world's most humorous musical movie ever yet.In this movie, Wilhelm (played by Matt Damon) and Jacob (played by Heath Ledger) Grimm, who are not only creators of the Fairy Tales we know, but they are also exorcists, who happened upon the village of Marbaden, where all the young girls are disappearing one by one. All of this happens to be the work of the evil (and humorously scheming) Mirror Queen (played by Monica Bellucci). It's up to Wilhelm and Jacob, with the help of Angelika (played by Lena Heady), to stop her before it's too late.Some of these scenes are very funny. For instance, Angelika is playing an acoustic guitar whilst singing a song called ""I Know A Demon Horse Who Swallowed A Butterfly"" (a retooling version of the song ""I Know An Old Lady Who Swallowed A Fly"") as a spiderweb unfurling horse swallows a butterfly, an octopus, a blue haired bird, a fox, a lion (after saying ""Come here, Simba!"" to the lion), a deer (after saying ""Come here, Bambi!"" to the deer), and an elephant, and when Angelika sings the line ""I Know A Demon Horse Who Swallowed An Elephant,"", the horse lets out an ear deafening scream of demise and explodes, releasing all of the animals that the horse swallowed, and Angelika sings the last line, ""He's dead, of course."" Right after that, Statler shouts, ""Wonderful!"" Waldorf then says, ""Yes, but I swallowed my gum."" Statler then said to Waldorf, ""How very dumb to swallow your gum?"" And even throughout that scene, when Angelika sings the first half of the refrain was ""But I don't know why he swallowed a butterfly."", the animal swallowing horse sings the last half for her was ""I guess I'll die.""In another scene, a shape shifting mud creature swallows a girl named Sasha whole, then turns into the Gingerbread Man, takes a bite of himself, and said, ""Mmmmm! That tastes good!"" He then shouts at the villagers, ""Run, run, run as fast as you can! You can't catch me! I'm the Gingerbread Man!"", and takes a dive into a wishing well.

235,Vulcan91,Watered-Down Gilliam Is Better Than No Gilliam,7,26 August 2005,"Rather than fight yet another war with Hollywood (see: ""Brazil"", ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"", and ""The Man Who Killed Don Quixote""), Terry Gilliam took off his gloves and allowed the Weinsteins and Miramax to force their will upon him. With his new film ""Tideland"" coming out soon, Gilliam chose to focus his efforts on molding it, while allowing ""The Brothers Grimm"" to go wherever the studio wanted to take it. The result is by far the most commercial film to Gilliam's name, but in this case watered-down Gilliam is better than no Gilliam, and his first film in seven years (""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" in 1998) is a fun one.""The Brothers Grimm"" certainly looks like a Terry Gilliam movie, loaded with extravagant visuals and wide angled shots, although the $80 million budget did allow for his first use of CGI (it really isn't too bad, though), and it does not have the incredibly surreal feeling to it that most Gilliam films have. It takes a bit of time to get used to Matt Damon (as Will Grimm) and Heath Ledger, moreso Damon, as Ledger is surprisingly good as Jacob Grimm. The film was much more humorous than I had expected, and has plenty of subtle Gilliam humor. Many will find Peter Stormare' Cavaldi character to be extremely annoying, but I thought he was hilarious, and one of the highlights of the movie. Jonathan Pryce returns to another Gilliam movie as Delatombe, and does a decent job, although his character was a little overly obnoxious at times. Lena Headey is good as Angelika, and Monica Bellucci also pulls off a good performance, although unfortunately she does not get a significant amount of screen time.The plot of ""The Brothers Grimm"" wanders a lot, and I actually thought the movie was winding down at around the 90 minute mark, but this works somewhat to the film's advantage, as it makes a fairly straightforward plot seem slightly less predictable. The film is much sillier than the promos may lead to believe, and that probably will not come us much of a surprise to big Gilliam fans. Unlike previous Gilliam movies, however, there really is no substance behind what we see on screen, so what we get is really the first 'popcorn flick' with Gilliam's name on it. Like all Terry Gilliam movies, the reaction will be mixed, and there will be some people who absolutely love it, and some who name it their worst film of the year. As far as I'm concerned, ""Grimm"" does not hold a candle to Terry Gilliam's previous films, but it is one of the better 'big summer movies', and I certainly felt my time was well spent watching it.3 stars (out of 4)",The Brothers Grimm

Given Gilliam's talent for the fantastic, I thought ""Brothers Grimm"" would be no exception.For imagery, it was. Audiences can enjoy picking through it looking for the beanstalk, the red cape, the bread trail, and the gingerbread man. Gilliam's eye for detail should be commended. As a story, ""Brothers Grimm"" was terribly lacking. The Brothers Grimm had a treasure-trove of material that could have been used, but it felt terribly wasted.I'd recommend ""Brothers Grimm"" for a lazy afternoon in front of cable or on DVD, but not a $9.95 evening showing.

Tideland, released in the same year, was hideous, but it had a coherent artistic vision and a message - although the content of the message is debatable. The Brothers Grimm is just a mess. It is a disorganised movie with largely indifferent and wasted acting, a clichéd and incompetent story, and unsympathetic characters. Gilliam has before constructed visions of the past (and future) that resemble heaps of decaying garbage with slapstick characters bumbling about on top, but he has seldom given us characters that have internal life and depth, let alone characters that we can care about. Those characters here that are not two-dimension wooden figurines are wild overacted caricatures, but they are still not funny. The story has no internal development or strength. It seems little more than an outline to hang images from. Gilliam is a powerful director who can impress strong images into the head, and he is a technical master, but the end result is just to share a vision of despair and horror, an alcoholic's nightmare. It may impress watchers who have not had much exposure to this depth of vision, but not those who have had exposure to a wider range of art. I will avoid future Gilliam movies.

When the director has no love put into the film, you can see it effect the actors and the rest of the crew. Laughs were minimal. There was hardly a chuckle from the audience.

However I fully stand by my claim that Gilliam shares the smallest of blame for this movie while %99.999 lies on the idiot who wrote the ""story"" (and I use the term loosely.) It's pretty clear when the parts that Gilliam devised appear on screen, as they have his distinct and slightly manic touch to them. These in and of themselves are good, not overwhelming like in some of his movies, but distinct, funny (in a dark manner mostly) and again, very good. Where Gilliam's personality shines, so does the movie in my opinion.The rest, is cookie-cutter garbage, and not very intelligible garbage either. I try to give movies the benefit of the doubt these days, as it seems to be getting harder and harder to be creative and imaginative, but that's no excuse to go in the opposite direction. The writer fulfills every cliché with only one or two having a slightly creative twist, and the rest of the story is forgettable and even confusing. You have to constantly remind yourself where you are, why this person is doing what and most of the time the motives behind the actions are a complete mystery. Another tip is that having the characters go into the woods, out of the woods, into the woods, out of the woods and basically all over half of europe does not make for an understandable (not to mention creative) story. The lines are made passeable by Damon and Ledger, but only a few moments are laugh out loud funny, and these are mostly due to the actors and not the actual words. Anything exciting/funny/suspenseful/dramatic comes either from Gilliam or Damon and Ledger.Maybe it should have been a tip-off that the writer of this script also wrote Scream 3.

However, the performances were awesome, especially by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. Monica Belluci is beautiful in it as well, and Lena Headey (whos bears such a resemblance to Keira Knightley, it's scary) is wonderful in it as well.

Absolutely great one!,9,5 October 2005,"I was really surprised by this movie, it was much much better than I expected it to be because of certain prejudices against Matt Damon and Heath Ledger, but they finally did convince me of their talent in this movie, though that doesn't mean I like them better now.The Brothers Grimm, Jakob and Wilhelm, are charlatans in this movie, they travel from village to village and stage fake hauntings and make a lot of money with getting rid of those 'witches' and 'ghosts'. However when they arrive in the village of Marbaden (which apparently doesn't exist in RL) they suddenly have to face real magic and real evil witches. Children have gone missing in the spooky forest of Marbaden and the Brothers Grimm made the promise to bring them back.The environment of this movie feels very creepy, it's like the childhood nightmares that are lurking under your bed. There are not any of the real fairy tales told, there are just a lot of hints and suggestions from which the Brothers Grimm might have created them. According to IMDb this movie was filmed in Czech, which is most definitely what it looks like. When I went to Prague by bus and saw all those landscapes there, it did feel like a creepy fairy tale, you were just waiting for the werewolves to jump out of the forest.However, as creepy (and partly even gross) this movie is, it's also hilarious. Jake and Will are a very funny team. I think a laughed more in this movie than the rest of the audience did. Peter Stormare was also hysterically funny, probably one of his best roles ever. He makes a great Italian for a Swede :) It's also relieving to see that there is finally a Hollywood movie where the Germans are NOT the bad guys (the French are), though there was a small 'insult' at the beginning (""How can you speak this language? Every word sounds like an execution!""). Of course one could also start everlasting argument about makes a 'German' movie in English with giving the characters British accents, but I suppose that's senseless. I think the audience is meant to think everyone's speaking German and we just hear them speaking English or something. Very complicated. But it's confusing again when they say those few words in German ('Guten Tag', 'Scheiße') but then start speaking English again. Thinking about those Hollywood clichés is giving me a headache. ^^ But the movie is definitely worth seeing, I enjoyed it a lot. You could call this a 'creepy comedy'.",The Brothers Grimm

They are studiously dishonest, avoiding the truth whenever possible. They apparently have no principles other than self preservation and ""working the con"". They spend most of their time screaming in fear, screaming at each other and begging for their lives. Good examples for kids they are not.Also, some of the scenes are way too scary for little kids.

The story was funny and not that hard to follow though I thought the ending was a little silly and could of made it a little better. Heath ledger and Matt Damon as the brothers were great and made you feel like they were actually brothers in real life. I think many people will enjoy this film as many classic fairy tales pop up quickly,you cant help smiling when they do.Basically if you weren't a big fan of fairy tales you might struggle to believe any of the story and kids might not understand it as well which might also come to them having nightmares of them being kidnapped in forests.all in all a very good/fun/for the sake of it film that most free minded people should see at least once.",The Brothers Grimm
249,jojairus,Grimm Hammer Horror at Sleepy Hollow,5,22 June 2006,"It's a well made film, with plenty of funny moments and clever tricks. If you know nothing of Brothers Grimm, well it might be a useful first introduction. But if you're expecting a good story about them, forget it. Kruger, the writer, seems to specialise in horror, and largely that's what this is, but funny light-weight horror as per Gilliam's requirements. For a film that's supposed to be a tribute to the Grimm Brothers, the story seems to pay tribute more to the old Hammer House of Horror plots than to the Grimms' Tales. I almost expected Dracula to show up. There are repeated brief references to characters from the Grimms' fairy tales, but their presence feels like ""brief commercial breaks from our sponsors"" - just to remind us that we're watching a film about those two industrious brother who collected all those folk tales for us - then it's straight back into the grizzly, unstoppable Hammer-style action. I like a good story, and being a fan of the Grimms, I was expecting at least to find that. It ain't there. This is cake, not dinner - enticing but unsatisfying. If you like Gilliam films, you'll probably like this. It has a lot of his clever fantasy world stuff. The old evil queen is terrific, and her disintegration is magnificent. It's not a masterpiece though, like Brazil. More daft and noisy, like Munchausen. I kept thinking I was watching a comedy version of Sleepy Hollow. Street theatre brought to the screen. Good fun for a family to watch. Enjoy.",The Brothers Grimm
250,rootieboy,It is a good movie,9,27 August 2005,"This movie was good. Good in every sense. Too many people are bitter because it is not Brazil, Monty Python or any of the other classics Gilliam has directed. It is something that is fresh and in its own style. In due time people will catch on. They are called colt classics because few people out of the billions love them and because they hold time value. I laughed the loudest in the theater because I got the jokes. My girlfriend cried at times because she captured the emotion. Our friends jumped because it was scary. You just need to learn how to open up to new things. I loved it. See it and make your own opinion about the movie.",The Brothers Grimm
251,jd7myers-1,Grim and Grimmer,3,27 August 2005,"Okay, will someone please tell Terry Gilliam that even in today's world well-written characters, good acting, and crisp plotting are still essential elements of a good movie?Now the ideas in The Brothers Grimm are outstanding. Jake and Will Grimm are a cross between 18th century ghostbusters and storytellers. It was indeed intriguing to see Gilliam's vision of twisted origins of our favorite fairy tales. Fascinating it was to see how daily events -- some dramatic, some mundane - led to elements of Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Rapunzel. Not to mention Cinderella, in the only truly amusing scene where Damon and Leadger scrub a hut in frocks and bonnets. And whenever Gilliam avoided CGI, the cinematography was (excuse the pun, but it's truly the correct word) ""enchanting.""Let's talk CGI, shall we? Awful. Completely takes over the movie. Sometimes it is OK. Sometimes it is so fake that you wonder if you're watching the Incredible Hulk again. The werewolf (yes, I said werewolf) in particular can't even compete with the its 1980's computer wizardry in such movies as the Howling. Also the use of swarms of CGI bugs was OK once....but repetitive after the third time.The acting was abysmal. If you have any respect for the actors Matt Damon and Heath Ledger (as I do), you'll be amazed at how flat they are. Ledger practically disappears into the exquisite scenery, while Damon tries in vain to project the wise-ass camaraderie that served him well in Dogma. Try to imagine the worst high school play actor you've ever seen and the worst French accent you've ever heard. Put them together and you pretty much have the prototype for all of the French characters in this film.Finally, Gilliam adopts a page out of Michael Bay's book. ""If you don't like this exciting scene; don't worry, another will be coming right at you."" Gilliam throws everything but the kitchen sink into this story which taxes the viewer to endure event after event. The Brothers Grimm should be studied in film school as an example of how to completely ruin a good concept. So now you're wondering -- why the 3 rating? Simply put, I've just revealed all that is good about this movie. How should we begin to describe its flaws?Let's start with the needless gore. This movie didn't need to show a torso missing its bottom half. (It's not Scream, for God's sake!) But even worse, there was absolutely NO point to include a scene where the heroine trapper skins a rabbit for about 2 minutes. And this next one should convince you to leave the kiddies at home...how do you like a cat falling into a spinning rotary torture device, getting splayed, being spattered across the room, having bloody parts land on people, and having one of them cheekily pluck it into his mouth. Ahh, what a delightful hor'dourve cat innards must make.Expendable, pointless, completely unnecessary. Now as a fan of zombie flicks and horror films, I am not a sensitive soul who cannot appreciate a bit of the visceral. But not in the movie. It only serves to bring you out of the story.",The Brothers Grimm
252,dsilverman,What's the point of this movie???,3,10 September 2005,"I kept waiting for this movie to make sense, but it never happened. Interesting special effects, but that's about it all it has going for it. It's supposed to be about the brothers Grimm...but not really. It's supposed to be fantasy...but not really. It's supposed to be funny...but not really. (The parts where people laughed in the theatre were clearly not the parts Gilliam intended to be funny.) It's supposed to be a period piece, but the lead actress is clearly from this century....a Chanel ad perhaps. The Germans have English accents and the French have comically bad French accents. I don't blame the actors...I think they were doing as told. One thing for sure....the French won't like it at all. For that matter, I'm not sure anyone else will either.",The Brothers Grimm
253,sschwa,Do people read any more? A folk tale for adults.,9,5 March 2006,"Like his Baron Munchhausen, Gilliam's Brothers Grimm has been horridly misunderstood by critics and public alike. What I get from the comments and reviews is the sense of thwarted expectations, although I have little idea what the anti-Grimms expected in the first place. People dislike the kitten scene because it's a cute kitten. This I find entirely in the grotesque spirit of the original folk tales. We've learned to take our fairy tales Disneyfied, apparently. I've also heard complaints about the quality of the special effects as sub-ILM quality. Frankly, that's what I liked about them. They *didn't* look like ILM; they looked personal. I admit I found the basic premise a cliché (two con men who make their living on the superstitious gullible find out that, in this case, the magic is real), but its working-out overcomes this basic flaw. This is a movie that shuns cliché. The brightest scenes, for example, almost always contain the greatest menace. Relative safety is drab, dirty, brutish, nasty, and short. Ledger gives an amazing performance -- I had previously regarded him as a Troy Donahue update. Matt Damon shows he has the chops to cross over from small ""indies"" to big performances in the old leading-man vein. Peter Stromare and Jonathan Pryce do a highbrow Martin & Lewis -- Stromare all over the place and Pryce coolly self-contained -- to hilarious effect. The faces alone in this movie are wonderful, hearkening back to the glory days of Leone. There are so many telling details in the background (""Bienvenue a Karlstadt"") -- let alone the foreground -- that show Gilliam's mastery. Harry Potter (which I enjoyed), Lord of the Rings, and Chronicles of Narnia are for the kiddies and show us worlds we can, with effort, control. Gilliam doesn't offer any such comfort, not even at the end. The sense of menace is overwhelming, and Gilliam achieves it without super-special effects, usually camera movement (the shots following Little Red Riding Hood through the forest made my jaw drop). A brilliant film, operating at a high level we don't see much of these days. Someone compared the movie to Burton's Big Fish, another film dismissed or ignored by critics and public. Although Burton's and Gilliam's sensibilities differ, I take the writer's point. The confident, poetic handling of myth and archetype in both astonishes.",The Brothers Grimm
254,Brie9,Great fantasy theme missed the mark a bit,6,3 August 2007,"The idea of the story is a great jumping off point for a fantasy however the development of some of the legends and characters is lacking and therefore the story is hard to get wrapped up in. The viewer doesn't gain an appreciation for anyone's peril or fear in the story, so that key element of the fantasy and of the fairy tales and stories that are supposed to be the eventual works of the Grimm brothers is missing. That's a key to this kind of the story the desire to be the winsome hero or heroine and fear of the villain and those roles are not fully explored. The way the literature on which the story is based is worked into the plot is interesting and reasonable, but not as thoroughly explained or displayed as it could be. It's not a bad movie, but not really great either. It certainly does not draw at all on the strong talent of the two major stars in Matt Damon and Heath Ledger.",The Brothers Grimm

Terry the writer of.... hang on, terry didn't write grimm, he directed it!Where to start? I expected an adventurous and historical type of movie, instead I was rewarded with an impossible mixture between horror and humour. So how to react on this movie?On one hand you see the quite scary witch, decapitated bodies and corpes,on the other hand you are supposed to laugh about silly stuff which in particular the younger brother (heath ledger) commits. What is the writer of this filmopgrahpy thinking?!? You can't combine a scary halloween type of movie with a monty python one!In the end I left the movie with mixed feelings. I liked most of the acting but am disappointed in the lack of history about these brothers.If you like monty python humour give this movie a pass, it might be too scary. If you like horrors, give this movie a pass, it contains to many jokes to be scary. If you like history, give the movie a pass, there isn't much in it.I don't think terry is to blame, but the writer surely is! Because the acting and the landscape are done well, I still give it some stars, but this movie will NOT join my DVD shelf.",The Brothers Grimm
256,muffingoddess38,So there is a use to enchantment!,9,2 September 2005,"I don't think myself overly literary for reading Bruno Bettelheim's ""The Uses of Enchantment,"" but forgive me for being obscure. In his book, Bettelheim analyzes common fairy tales for their underlying psychological and cultural meanings. He makes a great argument for the telling of fairy tales, even if they are slightly (or more than slightly) graphic, which is why I am partly able to explain my fascination with this film.It's not really overly good really, as you've probably seen more of a seven out of ten, but yet it fascinates me. Perhaps it's the psychological element between the two brothers (which is done quite well) about the importance/existence of magic, or the surreal score peppered with Brahms and Dario Marianelli originals. (I have no idea who this guy is, but the soundtrack is so weird that I want it.) Perhaps it's the horror invoked by the fairy tale images of our childhood, brought horribly to life in the (thankfully) twisted mind of Terry Gilliam.Oh, a little note about Terry Gilliam. You're going to have to forgive him because his pace can be a little bit feverish, and he tends to lose the viewer that's not paying attention. (He did make ""Time Bandits"" and ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" and you know how much of THAT made sense.) Do not question how the Grimm boys get from one end of Germany to another so quickly. Your head will explode.Basically, this film makes me happy for a couple of reasons: one, the dialogue. It's strangely antiquated one minute, then purely Hollywood the next. (Don't worry about the anachronisms they're supposed to be there, they're funny.) Two, his name starts with Heath and ends with Ledger. Now, I didn't used to like this guy. I thought he was just a deep throated Aussie, but the boy's got range. I didn't know he could lack confidence so well. (Now I'm teasing, but really, he's quite good.) Damon was wonderful as always, proving over and over again that he may not be the prettier, but he's the smarter half of ""Ben-att"". Three, they're fairy tales in their ghoulish, bloody glory. Wait till you see both Little Red Riding Hood scenes, you'll totally freak out. It's nightmarish in such a way that you can't take your eyes off it. It's not morbid fascination, like a car accident, but something deeper, the sense of childlike wonder that make kids watch the most disgusting thing (like insects or TOADS) for hours.What is the point? You might ask. Why should I see this piece of rubbish instead of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" for the 6th time? Or, in the long run, rent ""The Princess Bride""? (You should rent both by the way, it'd make a lovely double feature.) Well, I still can't watch the waxing scene, but here's the real point: Fairy tales have a purpose. They give us comfort when we are in crises, and delight and frighten us when we need to have fun. What we see in Ledger's character (Jacob) is the child who shelters himself with fairy tales. What we see in Damon's (the older, Will) is the adult who wants to take him away from him. And as Bettelheim says, fantasy is not nearly as cruelly unforgiving as reality, so let him keep them. I still need a little Sleeping Beauty now and then. There's something strangely comforting about waking to true love's kiss.",The Brothers Grimm
257,Professor_Marvel,Another dark triumph for Gilliam,7,24 February 2006,"It's a shame that this film did so poorly at the box office, because it might keep the great Gilliam from continuing to weave his sinister and magical fairy tales.Grimm is another in the long line of eerie, fantastic pictures that Terry Gilliam has brought to the big screen. Surely it lacks the depth of Brazil or Twelve Monkeys, the decadence of Fear and Loathing or The Fisher King, and the wit of The Holy Grail or Time Bandits.What it has is enough of each quality to create something unique for Gilliam, a big and entertaining Hollywood film that cements him as a strong and influential filmmaker. After all, where would the Burton's of the world be without him? Beyond being beautifully shot, the film is wonderfully cast and sharply written. Damon may have been a stretch when he was cast but he was strong as the domineering Will Grimm, albeit overshadowed by Heath Ledger's portrayal of brother Jacob. I've never been a big fan of Ledger's, but he is genuinely charming in this effort.Despite these strong performances, the supporting cast steals the show. Gilliam mainstay Jonathan Pryce is fantastic as the Napoleonic general Delatombe. Peter Stormare equally compelling as the fiendish henchman Cavaldi, and the stunning Lena Headey is hypnotic as Angelika.With luck the foreign and rental markets will make this movie a success, which is richly deserves to be, and encourage Gilliam and his ilk to continue to make movies what they are supposed to be...a world of fantasy and excitement.",The Brothers Grimm
258,jcomins,Christophe Gans is probably fuming,6,15 September 2005,"This film, though certainly a pleasant and engaging spectacle with a few good characters, has one fundamentally devastating flaw: it is an identical remake of a well-known movie made three years ago. Without giving the identity of this other film away at all (ahem), note the themes of brotherhood, and the nonsensical presence of a wolf, in Gilliam's film. Not only does Gilliam use strikingly similar camera techniques, color washes, characters, pacing, action, dry humor, French locale, royal summons, mysterious menace, sinister sidekicks, and tribal guide as Christophe Gans, but many of the scenes, especially those with Jonathan Pryce, are flat-out lifted from Gans' 2001 French-language action film whose name I have not mentioned. So much of The Brothers Grimm is occupied with faithfully replicating Gans that there is only a few brief minutes at the beginning and end for Gilliam to do his own, Grimm brothers-related scenes. This is to say neither that The Brothers Grimm is a bad movie nor an unenjoyable one. It is well-known that Gilliam has made a fruitful career out of making backhanded remakes (compare 12 Monkeys, the Fisher King, and The Man Who Killed Don Quixote to They Might Be Giants (1971 George C Scott) or The Ruling Class (1972 Peter O'Toole)). Gilliam holds The Brothers Grimm together in a way that, it might said, Gans did not. Last point: this is the first Gilliam film since Jabberwocky that has scenes that really feel like Monty Python. Coming off of Tidelands (I have not seen, only heard about) and his several attempts at making Don Quixote, this is probably him blowing off steam by being silly. Works for me.",The Brothers Grimm
259,clevelandrocks,Enhcanting,8,29 August 2005,"True Gilliam fans will be pleased that Terry hasn't lost his magic, while those looking for a scary thriller (it's PG-13 by the way) will be somewhat disappointed and the boys simply looking for a shot of beautiful Monica Belluci will be sadly disappointed. The movie follows the Brothers Grimm (Damon & Ledger) as they are young adults struggling to make ends meet by feeding on simple peasants' fears of old superstitions, ghosts, fairy tales. The backstory behind the elder Wil (Damon) and Jacob (Ledger) is that Jacob had caused their younger sister's death (not a spoiler, just the background given in the first 5 minutes) by giving away money that should have been used for a doctor in exchange for ""magic"" beans. Everything to Wil is simply ""magic beans""; there are no fairy tales, just ones they create. Eventually, the Brothers Grimm's escapades are exposed, and in order to save themselves, the French commander (the French are occupying Germany) demands that they solve another case of fake witchery in a nearby town. Little do the Brothers Grimm realize but the town is cursed by a queen who was granted everlasting life but not everlasting beauty. She curses the town to restore her youth. The beautiful Monica Belluci plays this Succubus-type demon. The Brothers Grimm are aided by a woman (Prochazkova), very much in spirit like Milla Jovovich from Resident Evil, who has been cursed. The weaknesses are the occasional poor CGI (a girl's flying cape), the character Cavaldi who is asked by the French to watch over the Brothers Grimm, and the score. However this is a solid film for the PG-13 crowd but probably wait for the video.",The Brothers Grimm
260,willuknight,"One of the best fantasy movies i have ever seen, excellent in all areas",10,25 December 2006,"When i starting watching this movie, I was immediately in awe of the authenticity and realism of the sets and props. The scenery and backgrounds just ooze detail and really help set the tone for the story and entice the viewer into it's world.Everything about this movie felt natural, and perfect. Although there were a few obvious CGI effects (after all, the movie was made in 2001) they are used sparingly and appropriately and fit the feel of the scene. I'm the first one to complain usually when watching films when something doesn't feel right, or if the plot isn't realistic enough or moves to fast. For this movie, I have no complaints, in that or any other regard.The movie is long, but the pacing and development is perfect. The ending isn't really that much of a surprise, no sudden twists, but how the story gets to that point, is really the rewarding part. This is not a static clichéd film, but an imaginative and glorious example of how to creatively weave a story.This movie pays homage to many of the classic fairy tales, but does so in a fresh and interesting way. Many scenes allude to their older origins but the pattern is natural and doesn't feel forced at all.The actors all fit their parts superbly as well, and clothing is authentic and most fitting.As i said before, i have no complaints about this movie, other then I wish i had watched it sooner, and on the big screen, and that i hope there will be a sequel, or at least more films with the same richness in story that this one possesses.",The Brothers Grimm

262,notsotame,"Why, oh why did it have to be this way?",7,26 November 2005,"The movie is pretty, fast-paced and, altogether, quite fun. It's a fairy tale, but, thankfully, definitely not a Disney version. It's dark, sometimes gruesome, but still fantastic. The lead actors are hot as hell. Now, the flaws. Uhm, it might take a while.I didn't really expect that much. I knew it would be no 'Brazil' or '12 Monkeys'. In a way, I was even glad. 'Brazil' and '12 Monkeys', for all their brilliance, also stand for a pretty heavy watching. They were examples of a convoluted mind-game with the audience, that you have to stay focused non stop on, so you don't lose track of the plot. With 'The Brothers Grimm' I expected a light entertainment, but still with a Gilliam-esquire bite. Technically, I did get just that. I was disappointed, nonetheless. Three factors.One, the plot. It wasn't so bad, at first. I was even intrigued, the concept of the brothers being nothing more than clever crooks, ripping off the poor farmers, was very promising. Namely, it promises a fairy tale, but with a deliciously devious reality check. The moment they set foot in the cursed village, though, the movie starts getting more predictable with every passing minute. I know it's supposed to be predictable, it's a fairy tale, after all, but I hoped that Gilliam would twist it somewhat more. Every time I waited for the next, already obvious, plot stage, I expected something, a little yet ingenious change, that would make it special, different from all the others fantasy stories. More often than not, the hope was frustratingly futile.However, the predictability isn't the plot's biggest flaw. After your movie count has passed the five-hundred mark, the prospects of finding one that would truly surprise you start to grow more and more dim. Originality becomes a welcome bonus, instead of a requirement with a deal-breaker condition.'The Brothers Grimm' has has a much more serious crime on its record. The lack of sense, the ultimate transgression. The last hour seems to be just a frantic onslaught of images, with one not necessarily being a logical consequence of another. It appears as if Gilliam rushed things too much, didn't leave enough room for backstory and explanations. Especially Monica Bellucci, as the Mirror Queen, gets the short end of the stick here. The woman really can't be blamed for her caricatured performance that much. Her character is, by far, the most cartoonish, and she simply doesn't have enough material to work on.The movie would greatly benefit from an additional half an hour. It just begs for an extended DVD edition. While I usually don't approve of movies longer than 100 minutes, the big-budget epics have a lot of leeway with me.Two, the characters. The brothers Grimm themselves are pretty nicely thought out with interesting personalities and motivations. They both turn into quite standard action heroes at the end, but, I suppose, that was inescapable. What's just as important, the actors are positively drool-worthy. Matt Damon's never looked better. Heath Ledger is bone-meltingly hot. He also emerges as one of the few actors that can pull off the facial hair (not the Ned Kelly beard, though, no no no). The problem is, they both seem miscast. Well, Matt Damon, as pragmatic, opportunistic, swaggering womanizer Will, is actually passable, even though he isn't your first choice for such a character, but his role is much simpler than the one Heath Ledger got. I adore the Aussie, I truly do, but I just couldn't ignore the fact that his Jacob Grimm, the sensitive, shy, idealistic, slightly neurotic scholar, was overplayed quite a bit. All in all, too much flailing and wailing.I have this nagging thought that everything would have played out OK, were they just given each others' roles. On the other hand, Wilhelm Grimm is a role much more suited for a star than Jacob Grimm, the star in question being, of course, Matt Damon. *snort* As for the female characters, Monica Bellucci were made a big disservice here, the reasons listed above. The trouble with Lena Headey, playing the plucky tracker lady, is not bad performance - she's pretty decent - but the fact that her character appears to be taken directly from 'How to make a top-of-the-box-office adventure movie. Hollywood edition'. She's a generic tough girl, who combines the role of a sidekick, love interest and damsel in distress. Every fantasy movie gets one. Doesn't mean, though, that every fantasy movie needs one.There are also Jonathan Pryce and Peter Stormare here. I didn't notice much about the quality of their acting, though. I was distracted. And said distraction brings me to another point.Three, wacky accents. English is not my native language, but from what I understood, the Germans in the movie speak British. Heath Ledger, an Australian, and Matt Damon, an American, included. The only major character, who is played by an actual Brit, that is Jonathan Pryce, is French. Peter Stormare, a Swede by birth, struggles valiantly, but not really successfully, with an Italian accent. An Italian - Monica Bellucci - speaks with a bizarre and totally confusing drawl/moan. Was it Gilliam's nefarious scheme to bewilder the audience even further? If that, was it really necessary? Me, not impressed.I don't know if the culprit in this whole mess is Gilliam himself, or the studio that constrained him. Most likely, they are both to blame. The fact remains, though: 'The Brothers Grimm', one of the autumn premieres that I awaited the most, didn't live up to the expectations. Pity.",The Brothers Grimm

265,BMFcast,Hard to believe this is Gilliam,3,1 October 2005,"I don't fault Terry Gilliam for what I thought was a complete failure of a movie. Nor do I fault the actors or most anything else that that was seen on screen as this was a beautiful movie visually. No, this is what is brought about by a complete lack of talent in screen writing. Scenes were pieced together with about as much thought as one would organize their shoe collection. I felt like there were several scenes and bits of dialogue that actually were as awkward as wearing two left shoes. This movie would be utterly forgettable if it weren't one of the apparent few offerings of Terry Gilliam that we'll receive in one lifetime. With a director who takes as much time between movies as Stanley Kubrick always did one would assume each one would come out a sparkling masterpiece, but sadly this is not one of those. I went in thinking I was to witness a return to the fantastical journeys of past films like Time Bandits or Baron Munchausen, but was treated to something on par with The Mummy Returns. Hopefully Tideland will restore some shine to the Gilliam name because after a mucking like this, it needs it.",The Brothers Grimm
266,everyonesacritic-1,Not nearly Grimm enough for me,7,31 March 2006,"OK, enough with the bad puns. ;)This could have been a fantastically creepy little fairytale. The visuals certainly were ripe with promise. I was expecting something like the Snow White movie with Sigourney Weaver as the evil stepmother, but better. Bigger. More of everything! Yeah...I think the first mistake was to make it too kid-safe. I almost went into insulin shock when in the end scene all the little girls jumped up from their crypts. Yay! What a glorious day! Let's go make daisy-chains! Please.Apart from that, the plot was full of holes, and there were things that just make no sense. For example, what's the deal with the hole in the cave wall with all the bugs crawling out? Didn't get how it was relevant to the plot. It's always as entertaining to watch a movie and see all the stuff that was added in 'just because they look cool' and have absolutely *nothing* to do with the plot.The accents... I have nothing against a fake accent as long as it's called for and isn't so bad it puts my eardrums out. But why in the name of movie magic did the crew spend so much time to try and teach little Czech children to pronounce perfect English, when the movie could have benefited from their own accents? Frankly, the whole thing with the British sounding English went over my head. Why was it so important? The Grimm Brothers were German, for Pete's sake! They would have spoken English with a German accent if anything.And some of the 'scary' things made me laugh, they were so silly. Like the gingerbread man. Holy CG batman! Note to Terry: A girl's face disappears - Good, creepy, effective. A computer generated image of a happy gingerbread man jumping up and down - Bad, stupid. Reminded me of Shrek. All that was missing was the Donkey singing Rawhide.The opening scene in itself should have been a warning sign: the poor Grimm family huddled in the middle of a large, empty room, with the fireplace lit in the far end, lamenting on how cold it is and that there's no wood left to burn anymore. My first thought: Move closer to the FIRE! Seriously!There were lots of little things like this that annoyed me.OK, on to the Good Stuff:The leading actors were funny at times (in a good way), and they did a decent job. I can't help it, but I think their best moments were the ones where they either were humiliated or scared. The heroism thing really didn't work that well. I guess I go for cheap laughs, since I thought one of the best scenes was the floor scrubbing scene with Damon and Ledger dressed as wenches, bonnets and all. Peter Stormare had some hilarious moments (when he wasn't so loud it was annoying). When he played it down, he was much funnier. And as I said earlier, I loved the look the movie had. Lush, yet faded colors. Old and creepy with a really well done fairytale feeling.I craved for more darkness and a plot that wouldn't have felt as much like flipping through a scrap-book. And the ending, honestly. Pure syrup.It's worth watching once though, for just the atmosphere and setting, IMHO.",The Brothers Grimm
267,wcnmaverick,"It's so sad, because it could have been so good.",1,27 August 2005,"I went to this movie not expecting anything more than to be entertained. It started slow, but hey that's okay lots of movies do, but by the fifth time I checked my watch in the first hour I realized this was a bomb. I couldn't decide if the intent of this movie was a comedy or horror. Most of the ""comedy"" fell flat, either cliché or just not funny. The random acts of violence on animals made even my hard heart cringe. Every character in the movie was poorly written. Some of the characters were out of bizarre comedies and some of them out of poor horror movies. They didn't fit. Probably the worst character was that played by PETER STORMARE who was supposed to be funny I think but never rated much above sigh from most the audience. I think the thing that bothered me the most about this movie is that it could have been great. SPOILER: In on scene a child's face is stolen by some sort of monster that then uses the face as its own. There is on blood or anything, it just really creepy, and that's the best part. It got bad again when any of the main characters got involved. Overall this film had so much potential, but I wish I had taken the queue from a few movie patrons around me and spent my time taking a nap instead of watching.",The Brothers Grimm
268,bringa,"Understand that you are watching a fairy tale, and you will love this film.",10,2 December 2005,"This is one of my two favourite films of 2005, next to Serenity.Terry Gilliam is a special film maker. He doesn't do normal stuff. In some way, this might be his most accessible film, but still: there is that Gilliam magic.This film indulges in fairy tales; I guess that's the best way to put it. One of the first books I had as a child was a huge tome with the Brother Grimms' fairy tales. When I read them as a child, I remember that there were many things I didn't understand, but what I did understand had a beautiful magic to it. I've recently started rereading random stories from that book, now almost an adult, and I discovered an entirely different layer in them: something much more sinister, subtly lurking underneath those cute moral tales. Gilliam weaves both aspects into his film: the fairy tale magic, and that something else, that sinister force.The visuals of this film are magical. Often nothing short of jaw droppingly beautiful, always indicative of the current mood, and sometimes truly surreal.There is some humour in it, of course; this is Gilliam. Even his dystopias are funny. But most of all you're getting a great story. He never yields to the temptation to make this film anything but a great story; he doesn't moralize about brotherly relationships (even though, of course, the topic permeates the film), he doesn't turn it into the retelling of any one specific fairy tale, and he doesn't just use the fairy tale background as arbitrary scenery to tell an unrelated story: everything fits.The magic of this film is that it understands fairy tale magic: it understands that these stories are evil simply because people are fascinated with evil; it understands the attractions of that other world; and it understands that you cannot transport this world into the world of film unless you do it a 100%. This is not a modern movie sprinkled with fairy tale references; this is a cinematic fairy tale. If you realize that, if you accept that from the first second on, you're in a different world and that this is not going to be a historical film with some fairy-taleish aspects, then I believe you'll really enjoy it.",The Brothers Grimm

I loved the incorporation of all of their fairy tales into one big one! Contrary to what all the other people say (Who obviously have their panties in a wad for no reason)this is a great movie! So, instead of listening to all of these whiny people, go see for yourself! I'm sure you'll love it! There's definite Gilliam in every scene, lol, especially the beginning credits! While this movie may be incomparable to 'Monty Python', you have to think of it as an entity of itself, so, try not to compare it to something as great as 'Monty Python' especially since nothing could ever be as great as that.

270,jonthegreat72,Interesting,4,28 October 2005,"Interesting is the only word I can think to describe this film. I do hope we weren't meant to take it seriously, because I couldn't stop laughing at the horrendous and wooden acting and the shocking stereotypical French accents. I would have hoped for better from someone like Matt Damon, but at least he was slightly more convincing than many others in the film. Lena Headey as Angelika did very well and almost saved the film for me, but it may have been doomed from the start. Horror, action, drama? What exactly is this film trying to do? I do not buy the comments saying that children are not best suited to go to this film in case they get nightmares, neither am I at all inclined to believe that this film has any subtlety; it is predictable in the extreme and highly artificial in the mixture of fantasy stories it brings together.Thumbs Down I'm Afraid",The Brothers Grimm
271,petr-17,carved out of wood through a colour lens,5,28 August 2005,"Although the film is not overall that bad, it does fall short of expectations for a Terry Gilliam film. Contrary to published critics, the story is alright, nothing spectacular and a little above average for a mainstream film. Although it references well known tales, it breathes a welcome bit of originality into the reinterpretations. Kruger's horror writings give it an edge not really touched by any previous Terry Gilliam film.Terry Gilliam fans must see the film.Unfortunately the dialogue cannot make up its mind between Terry Gilliam funny (we can definitely see his touch in those) and boring wooden formulaic sentences (obviously from Kruger.) Heath Ledger is fantastic as an actor. He has progressed from absolute teen drivel vehicles to a wonderful performance in Lords of Dogtown and this film. Matt Damon, usually a reliable artist, acts like puppet who cannot move until having said his lines. Either he lacked direction or had not fully formed his character.Peter Stormare does a valiant and almost successful attempt as the half crazed Italian/French soldier, but does not have the extra oomph required to make his character truly funny.Lena Headey unfortunately does not provide the love interest to make one's heart ping. You do not care about her character at all, and the mild confusion to which Grimm she is attracted to is meaningless. She also loses her potential tomboy nature by sporting a unimaginative haircut, bad costume design (with pants) and too uncharacterish girly (with dresses). I feel that some behind the scenes decisions killed any promise of her delivering a great character and the final result is probably not her fault at all.Jonathan Pryce is professional as always, but some silly editing seems to have ruined his expression delivery (of which he is a master.)The cinematography (Newton Thomas Sigel) shows none of the promise as seen in Three Kings, and has an overall flat look. The film is also sometimes so strongly tinted (red, yellow, blue) that its almost like looking at a coloured black and white film. This could be a post production effect that went awry. In fact there is almost hardly any colour contrasts in any shot which always favour heavily a particular colour.The set and character design, usually a Terry Gilliam strength, seems to fall short of expectations. The tower is not as majestic as it appears in the illustrations, and the village seems a little stunted and unfinished. Also the monsters are given much too little screen time which I believe is due to editing to give it a wider audience appeal. The Mirror Queen's costume is nice, but is only seen in its full glory in only one shot with her long hair interwoven with the boomerang crown.The audio and music is as expected and fulfills its function. Some dubbing and audio omission is evident in certain scenes.Terry Giliam has delivered a mainstream product. A little amusing, a bit creepy and a happy ending. His usual elaborateness seems to be missing (even in the Mirror Queen's chambers) and his off the cuff and wall humour gets toned down by the dialogue and editing. Basically a Terry Gilliam film with little emotion and a lack luster delivery.The DVD or director's cut is much anticipated as the theatrical release is flawed.Side note (1): A favourite past-time of the main characters seems to be repeatedly trying slide open the same coffin/crypt lid.Side note (2): The best Monty Pythonesque character, the cackling old woman, seems to have had her audio wiped at the very end. I eagerly await the DVD version to see what she really had to say.",The Brothers Grimm
272,moonstarly,not bad,7,26 August 2005,"Well, my friends, I have just returned from the earliest possible showing of ""Brothers Grimm"" in my area, and I can assure you it was well worth getting up a few hours earlier than usual to watch. However, I would caution anyone who doesn't like Terry Gilliam's work, Matt Damon and Heath Ledger, or the REAL brothers Grimms' stories that this is not your average fantasy. The story is set in french-occupied Germany in the 1700s, a real time in which real people actually lived. Even some of the magical aspects of the story are explained by real events (I won't spoil it for you). So quite a bit of the plot deals with the realities of the day and age along with the fantastical aspects of the forest and its inhabitants.That being said, the story also deals with the opposite side of unreality-- the dark and unnaturally gruesome. This is where I think the writer hit on a brilliant point; while the real brothers' stories have happy endings and some lighthearted moments, most if not all of their stories involve some degree of blood and gore. My hat is off to Ehren Kruger for being true to that aspect of their work.The only aspects of this movie I disliked were the unresolved ending (which I won't spoil, either) and some of the acting. Lena Headey's performance did not impress me, but it could just be lack of material to work with (a very overdone character) and the fact that I've never seen any of her other work. Matt Damon is interesting to watch as usual. Peter Stormare and Jonathan Pryce are wacky to the point of annoyance as an Italian torture specialist and a French general. The only truly wonderful performance, however, is that of Mr. Ledger, whose bumbling, scholarly, tag-along Jacob was both a sympathetic character and a side we rarely see from this multi-talented actor.This is not a movie for everyone (I wouldn't bring children with the tendency for nightmares or irrational fears, for example). It's not a movie you'll learn from or probably want to see hundreds of times. But for the moviegoer looking for beautiful cinematography, a few good laughs, and a fairly suspenseful story, look no further.",The Brothers Grimm
273,TheRetroCritic,A not bad but somewhat disappointing Gilliam creation.,6,7 November 2005,"Once upon a time Believe it or not it's been 7 years Terry Gilliam (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Twelve Monkeys) hasn't made a film.With the exception of his documentary Lost in La Mancha in which he told us the tale of his doomed project The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,which sadly never saw the light of day. Now, movie wizard Gilliam returns with what promises to be his comeback.This time, he takes on the fairy-tales of the Brothers Grimm and creates an original story in which the Brothers, who con poor villagers into believing they can drive witches and demons away. Meanwhile, children are being mysteriously abducted in the nearby woods and the Brothers Grimm are ordered by an evil French general (Pryce) to go and find the missing children. Turns out the forest is genuinely haunted by a scary wolf, dangerous moving trees and a vain, decomposing witch who lives in a tall tower. So Will and Jacob Grimm find themselves in a rather ""grim"" adventure which presents to them plenty of great ideas for fairy-tales.Actually, the best thing about this film is seeing how Gilliam has managed to brilliantly include references to the famous Grimm tales such as: Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, Rapunzel, Snow White and the Gingerbread Man. Much like Sleepy Hollow was a pure Tim Burton project, this is a pure Terry Gilliam project. The film starts off promisingly with a great score and a superb title sequence: from the offset, you know you're going to have a good time and that you're in safe hands. Indeed, there's much to admire in The Brothers Grimm. Heath Ledger and Matt Damon prove to be a surprisingly good double act and their discussions and girly screams provide most of the laughs. Gilliam has clearly not lost his magic touch: his admirable swooping camera and the spooky atmosphere he's created are both delights. The best scenes include Little Red Riding Hood's creepy walk through the forest and the frankly disturbing horse-swallows-kid scene.Having said all that, The Brothers Grimm is probably Gilliam's worst effort. He is let down by many things. First, the CGI special effects which, for some reason, are absolutely dire (the wolf and the Gingerbread Man are amongst the worst). Also, the panto-esquire performances of Stormare (as Cavaldi) and Pryce (as the general) are unconvincing and overdone (their Italian and French accents are pitiful). And the whole thing is very messy and just gets more and more confused as we rock back and forth between the woods and the village. As the film ends, you can't help but feel short-changed by the usually inspired Gilliam. The Brothers Grimm is not a bad film but coming from the man who had the balls to do the expensive masterpieces Baron Munchausen and Brazil this is a bit of a disappointment. This is a film that's overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time, impressive yet unimpressive, enchanting yet frustrating: The Brothers Grimm is a big contradiction, it's Gilliam at his best and worst. Overall, I recommend this film but be warned, if you're expecting the ex-Monty Python's big comeback, this is not it. The Brothers Grimm may be a flawed, slightly disappointing mess but admittedly it's great fun, very entertaining, stylish and has some enchanting and pretty scary moments.",The Brothers Grimm

First of all, they took a really good idea and wrecked it with horrible acting, horrible writing, cheesy dialoge and weird directing. I normally like Terry Gilliam, but he made some strange choices.Then there was an Italian character who was so annoying, you just wanted to see him die a horrible death (he didn't however).I think that the most unnerving part of the movie is that it was cheesy to the point that only a child, or a person who hasn't seen a lot of movies in their life, would think it was good.

275,Plecostomus,"Interesting story, but poorly edited...",4,4 December 2005,"(Yes, it has a couple spoilers) First of all I must say the main story in this film is quite interesting, however, it had a happy ending (completely straying from the original Grimm fairy tale style).The acting wasn't bad with the exception of some of the children. Believability of the characters is pretty good, with the following exception:For some reason, characters in this story take a random 360 degree personality change and become an entirely new character altogether (the Torturer becomes a loving friend to his victims, the undesirable animal gutting hunter becomes a fair maiden worth kissing in the end, etc). It left you with a feeling that critical parts in the storyline were dropped in the editing process.The computer graphics in this movie were, for the most part, unbelievable (like the kid in the horse). If you've seen this movie and remember that part, I shouldn't have to continue on this point. They definitely needed more time and money for these instances.This brings me to the most disappointing part of the whole film, the editing! The story was extremely disjointed and lacked a steady flow (even for an action/adventure). If they had to sacrifice sections of the film for time's sake, they did a very poor job at combining the remaining parts. The tempo of the action changed back and forth so quickly (and in conjunction with the character flaws) you really don't know what result you were hoping for in an action packed event.Four out of 10 stars from me.

The impression we got from watching the movie trailer was that it would be a comedy with some horror and drama tossed in for good measure. When the movie turned out to be primarily a horror with some drama and comedy thrown in, we were surprised in not the best of ways. While there were amusing scenes, movie overall seemed to be a tad tedious and somewhat boring. Character development definitely lacked and while the Italian henchman sent to keep watch on the brothers Grimm was entertaining, he would have been far more interesting if developed past one dimension. The story premise overall would have been far more entertaining with a bit of horror and more comedy and a tad bit of drama, in that order. Two actors, Heath Ledger and Matt Damon are quite adept at delivering comedic cues but it seemed in this movie that they were way over their heads.

The previews appear amazing, and they are, however the movie is atrocious. The entire use of the French government and that horribly acted Cavalli are needless and annoying. The movie could have been made on the premise that the Grimm brothers fooled many and then became entrapped in a real magical problem. However this relatively simple and enjoyable plot is complicated by the French in the movie. Was there an editor? If so that editor should never again be allowed to work. The plot (if there is one) is filled with holes that are filled with crazy scenarios not appropritate in the slightest. Take for example the kitten that is shredded or the horse that eats the child. Where the heck did that come from? I liked the idea of mixing Grimm fairy tales, but never expected it as botched as this.

And I walked out 20 minutes before the end, I just couldn't bear it any longer.What was this film trying to achieve? I can tell you that the jokes were too childish for adults or teens, and the horror was probably to gruesome for little kids so this movie really didn't decide on a proper audience.

There were bugs and trees everywhere, it made me feel like I was watching some Animal Planet documentary.And I just felt so sad for Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. What were they thinking? They're wonderful actors but they must feel so ashamed right now for this movie. I won't be surprised if it earns a razzie.And the saddest part is; this film had so much potential but it was just all ruined by everyone trying too hard to make it live up to that potential.",The Brothers Grimm
294,BrianTheDog,An utter mess....not the worst film I paid money to see,1,1 September 2005,"but the worst I've paid money to see since The Avengers. I like Gilliam's previous works, particularly Brazil and 12 Monkeys but absolutely nothing in this movie works. I've read that there was much internal drama between the producers and Gilliam which led to the unattractive release date and a break in filming, but there has to be more I'm unaware of.I'll start with the good: Gilliam is a great director and many scenes shine with his visual style. Unfortunately that's the only good.The problems: No character development. I recall the empathy I had for Willis' character in 12 Monkeys and Pryce's character in Brazil, and the complete lack of understanding or even desire to care for any character (good or bad) in this film. Every character is a caricature (some so bad for words) that could be conjured by even the most novice writer. Cavaldi = awful, unfunny character. Pryce = well, just awful. Grimm Brothers = are they clowns are heroes? They go from one to the other and back again. The lead actress = strong character or damsel in distress? The movie doesn't care to characterize these characters so why should we? The editing. The worst I've seen in a long time. Scenes bounce back and forth with complete disregard for developing a story or even an interesting diversion. I'm convinced that this is NOT Gilliam's doing and that a director's cut on DVD will be much different. The ending is pure dreck with sloppily untied plot devices.The ""big picture"". Is this a horror movie? A slapstick comedy? A drama? Nothing wrong with mixing genres but typically when a film does so it does methodically, not thrown into a blender-enhanced concoction.There are other problems. The CGI is NOT 21st century quality, the attempts at humor mostly failed, the attempts for action scenes were not titillating and the attempts for horror weren't scary.I saw this film at the Lincoln Center theater in Manhattan. The auditorium was filled to about 50% capacity. In addition to the most people taking bathroom breaks that I've ever seen, I witnessed about a dozen leave the film early. At one point towards the end a viewer proclaimed ""oh my gawd"" at a cringe-worth scene that was the highlight of my experience.I won't begrudge Gilliam fans not to see this. A blockbuster rental isn't that expensive, but this is certainly the most disappointed I've been with a film in a very long time. I've only given the 1 star treatment to a select few films, but this one certainly gets it.",The Brothers Grimm
295,scottevil76,A bit of a mess but it has one hell of a spirit,4,23 November 2005,"Brothers Grimm could have been a great movie. But it falters a lot. Don't get me wrong its a fair movie. It has wonderful spirit that makes all fairy tales fun. Its loads of fun to see these fairy stories played out on screen. But there is a reason movies like this flop, take the Ridley Scott Legend for example. What you end up getting is a visually breathtaking movie with a week plot and characters. So that is what troubles Gilliams Grimm. Its a visually breathtaking movie with spirit but its a bit muddled in the structure department of it. The performances are fair. Ledger is a hoot while Damon is the week link. Monica Belluicii is by far very underwritten. I always found myself intreged with her character and wanted to know more about her and see her in more of the film. I think above all if the story and plot would have been more focused on the story with the wicked queen it would have felt on sturdy and not as busy.",The Brothers Grimm
296,max-grant,Enjoyable Gilliam,8,26 August 2005,"Since my analysis requires me to reveal items integral to the plot, I'll put it up front: DO NOT READ FURTHER unless YOU WANT THE PLOT EXPOSED! That said, this movie is kind of like a 1700's Galaxy Quest. Two Real Fakes run into the Real Thing. In the intro, a young Jacob Grimm is given the task of buying medicine for his dying sister, but instead brings home a sack of useless ""magical"" beans. His brother berates him and blames him for the pending death of their fair sister. 15 years later, we encounter Jacob and Wilhelm (or Jake and Will) in French-occupied Germany, circa 1796, quoting prices to a frightened small town mayor for the exorcism of a burned witch. It turns out to be a witch they've hired and put in place, but not after an exciting fight sequence nearly convinces you that the witch is real. After being rooked by a patent-medicine fraud in their own childhood, they have mastered the rookery business themselves and become full-time charlatans.Immediately after splitting their spoils with their two hired stage frauds, the Brothers are captured by a French General who has discovered another snake-oil charlatan working in a nearby village. With the logic that it takes a fraud to catch a fraud, the Brothers' aid is extorted out of them, and they proceed on to hunt in a dismal German forest for eleven kidnapped girls.Except that the forest is really haunted, and a freeze-dried Monica Bellucci is squeezing the juice out of 12 young ladies to restore her youth. Jacob is the one who figures it out -- it seems his lifelong academic pursuit of fairy tales to exploit for show has also given him the keys to understanding how to defeat the witch. Elements of almost every fairytale you've ever seen are threaded through the story.As is typical with Gilliam, less is more. Without overwhelming the film with weird special effects, he manages to create believable illusions as much out of the performance of the actors as any digital trickery. Which is as far as I can tell limited to the morphing wolf-father of Angelika.I in particular sought this movie out because so many critics had panned it -- I've noted that the more the critics hate a movie, the more I tend to enjoy it. I wasn't at all let down by this one.",The Brothers Grimm
297,LokiWasAnAmateur,"Enjoyable, but flawed",7,1 October 2005,"Terry Gilliam's absence from film for the last few years has been truly disappointing (stupid Quixote project), so when I saw his name attached to this, I was genuinely excited.And make no mistake, this film feels like a Terry Gilliam; a little noir-ish, low visiblity, dry humor...should be great, right? It's hard to articulate what went wrong here. First of all, the humor in this film simply didn't come across as it was supposed to. Gilliam seemed to apply his timing sensibilities to material that didn't warrant it. Matt Damon and Heath Ledger were actually pretty believable as brothers, and the family mechanic was apparent, right down to the ""magic beans."" In many respects, I enjoyed this movie. But there were so many jarring attempts to squeeze in as many ""wink & nod"" Grimm references that it became hokey, and, during the gingerbread man scene, just plain stupid. Add to this a predictable ""bid bad wolf"" pseudo-twist and I could understand why some people dislike this movie.That being said, I actually cared about the plot line. It took elements from so many different fairy tales that the result was, paradoxically, a unique tale unto itself.Visually stunning, and I love Terry Gilliam, but maybe this should have been a Burton vehicle.",The Brothers Grimm
298,SenshiKid,Brothers Grimm,4,10 September 2005,"This movie was pretty lame. On the other hand, I just wanted to get out of the house and see a movie, and-hey-i got my fix, what can I say?The scripting in the first hour of the movie just SUCKED. I could follow the plot slightly, but the onslaught of fake British accents was too much to sift through. Seriously, an Italian with a British accent speaking German and screaming Italian phrases. Americans with British accents. Germans with British accents. French with funky french accents(rolled r's and such) speaking German too. It was just weird and a substantial hit to the script. I dozed off instead of trying to understand it at one point. It got interesting when the queen came into the story. You know, there was actual lighting at one point and all. Um, she was like a zombie or something. But don't think I'm totally ignorant. I was actually into the whole fairy tale allusion part of the movie.Heath Ledger, I'd have to say, was the only actor in the movie. The lead female was hot and saucy, also well-fleshed out what with her father being the antagonist. Matt Damon should just like fly off to Europe and take his little boy looks to a modeling agency. I don't like him in any role and I don't think I will. The Italian torture ""artist"" was so hard to understand when he was just speaking. You caught some nerdy jokes and then he just looked all huffy for a while. The french sergeant(i think was his rank) was played by an actor I've seen before in something else, which gives him an ounce of credit in my book. He had a flat character though, so I didn't want to know anything more about him in any capacity.Favorite scene: The little girl turns into the gingerbread man. SOOO random, but so totally weird and hilarious at the same time.Least favorite scene: just...like...yeah, the first hour and the last one too. I wanted this movie to be the Legend sequel or something, but it just wasn't. Not funny, not scary. Just fleeting sensations of weird and interesting.Fav character: I'd say a tie between Jake and Angelika. Both had the only rounded characters and attractive roles in the movie. That's my opinion! Suck on it.",The Brothers Grimm
299,dyanordakowski,love,8,24 November 2014,This movie creatively incorporates children's fairy tales into an intriguing story of two brothers trying to rescue the girls who were stolen from their homes. All the fairy tales have a darkness to them instead of them being represented as the happy children stories that you read to kids before they go to sleep. This is what makes the movie so interesting. Heath Ledger adds a wonderful touch to the movie because he is an attractive and talented actor. The action and adventure in this movie keeps the audience intrigued. There is not one boring part of this creative and imaginative story. The way it is set up in the older days makes the twisted fairy tales more realistic and creepy. This movie is both enjoyable and a little spooky. It even has a little comedy thrown in which makes the perfect balance.,The Brothers Grimm
300,dulnar2003,Decent,7,30 August 2005,"This movie was what I expected it to be. Decent. I give it 7 out of 10 because it was a C movie. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular with this title because I knew the director's work and I saw the previews.Now, the good things about this movie are definitely the very dark humor, and Heath Ledger's acting. He really surprised me with his performance in this movie. It's been a long time since I actually felt somewhat sorry for a character in a movie. But you'll understand why. He's submissive because of a terrible mistake he'd made when he was a young child and his older brother played by Matt Damon. Matt Damon's performance was good (not great) and he did disappoint in some areas. The humor was quite good and the gore from this movie fit the stories. So that was all good.A bad aspect was probably the timing of the movie. It would have been a good Halloween movie or it would have been a good movie to show in less dark times. This year calls for ""ROFL"" comedies, unfortunately, and the dark, gory nature of this film just isn't timely. That was my main complaint. That and a bit of a lack-luster ending in which it seemed they lost a lot of energy and just sort of shot it. Besides that, I recommend this movie. It was a decent flick, just not too timely.",The Brothers Grimm
301,morningview1955n,Not worthy of all your hate,7,30 August 2005,"Don't believe all the bad stuff people have been saying about this movie. It's simply a matter of taste and it just doesn't float some peoples boat. First of all, don't listen to anyone gripe about this movie that has never seen another Terry Gilliam movie. The man has an incredibly unique method of story telling and if you went in expecting anything else, you probably walked out confused as hell. Which leads me to my next point. This movie doesn't make the most sense ever. You just kinda gotta go with it. People think that ""12 Monkeys,"" (another Giliam work) is a great movie and it's even on the top 250 here and that movie doesn't really make sense either. Then there's the acting. Gillium always has at least 2 twitchy characters and this movie is no exception. For many, the performances of Peter Stodamire and Heath Leger are just a little much but if you think about it, so is the rest of the movie so they fit perfectly. The there's Matt Damon, whom I've heard nothing but bad things about since the movie came out. HE'S THE GLUE OF THE MOVIE!!!! He's the only sane character and without him, the movie would have gone completely haywire. He doesn't deserve and Oscar or anything but he took a hit for the team and took the ""boring"" character and saved the film. Lastly, people seem to be upset with the random scenes that are all over the movie that don't really tie in. They're funny!!! They're pointless, confusing and just plain silly. Stop trying to make sense of everything. If you are a person that needs things to make sense, do not see this movie. If you like unique style, visual direction and just general originality, don't listen to everyone that hates it. Give it a try",The Brothers Grimm

It's not a really great movie, not one of those films that cast a spell on you, but it's fun. Don't expect anything but the basic amusement, and you'll enjoy it.Matt Damon and Heath Ledger play their main parts well, although I found myself slightly annoyed by them in certain points of the movie. Again, though, they played their parts very well. The supporting cast does an equally wonderful job.There are some pointless subplots in the movie, little details that are pretty but have little connection with the outcome. Still, the idea of the script is a good one - it's a light, fluffy fairytale that leads one to believing there is more.Trust me, there isn't.The soundtrack is eerily familiar, the melodies of well-known nursery rhymes changed into frightening tunes. There is no excessive use of computer graphics, which I take as a good thing. The costumes are well into the time period, although I hardly thing peasants could afford dentists to keep up such white teeth. The accents annoyed me a little, from the French fakes to the 'German' English. But those are little obnoxious details - nothing to worry about. Just sit back, turn off your brain, and relax.Two stars out of five.",The Brothers Grimm

The Napoleontic is willing to spare their lives if this time they confront a real demon. In a faraway and dark wood innocent children keep disappearing. And they have to solve this problem. If not, they will be killed. This film is smart, funny, dark and light together. Unususal to see such a strange mixture work very well. I thought actors as Matt Damon and Heath Ledger were never better. Leana Heady is a revelation and Peter Stormare and Jonathan are skyscrapers compared to actors who try to be buildings.

304,ranwulf,Utterly disappointing,3,29 August 2005,"I'll rate this disaster at a 3, with only the sets and costuming saving it from being a total loss. Don't mistake me - I loved Brazil, Jabberwocky, and Baron Munchausen. The Fisher King was a masterpiece, and pretty much everything Python is near mythic genius. But this latest effort fails to ever come together. A mish-mash of every fairy tale ever known (and then some) this film wastes its huge potential in a writhing morass of plot twists that never come close to cohesiveness. Virtually at no time is it clear what the hell is going on and who's doing what. Several characters (especially Cavaldi) are completely extraneous and do little more than detract from the story (such as it is). Things happen that have little to do with anything else going on in the film: Angelica's father/were-wolf/Woodsman feeds spiders to a horse that in turn eats a little girl; the whole scene where viscous, black well-slime sucks off the mouth and eyes of another child and turns into - I'm not making this up - the Gingerbread Man; or the occasional girl-floating-in-a-pond-for-no-apparent-good-reason motif. And what's with the bugs? My strongest objection to the story, besides the fact that there isn't one, is that the evil and dead Thuringian Queen who seems to be causing all the trouble is never really all that evil. Considering the depicted state of affairs in that part of Germany at the time (Franco-Prussian War, I think), rule by an ageless hottie with substantial cleavage (Monica Bellucci) would be much more preferable to that of the occupying French general Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce). The film's major failing is its effort to include references to seemingly the entire collection of Grimms' Fairy Tales, regardless of relevance to the oh-so-thin plot. The story loses itself before it can quite get going, and never recovers from its resultant downward spiral. Overall - a chance to make a great movie from great source material ends up looking like the unedited first draft of a film school student on acid - and the acid is the only thing even vaguely original. What a shame for Gilliam.",The Brothers Grimm

Please, for the love of god, don't watch this movie. It even defies any ironic enjoyment, it's not so bad it's good; it's just bad. God, this movies is repulsive.",The Brothers Grimm

A lot of people are ripping this movie apart for not being written by Gilliam or not being ""Gilliam enough"". I'm going to guess those same people also dislike the Fisher King. If you do not understand where I'm coming from with this statement. Buy the extended version and watch the making off.Yes the CGI was not normal for him; it did not ruin the movie. The ginger bread man scene was hilarious. Jonathan Pryce playing a very similar role as Baron Munchausen was very entertaining.Two Gilliam movies with Tideland later this year, I cannot wait.",The Brothers Grimm
308,Natt,"If I could give half-stars, it would be 7.5...",7,16 November 2005,"Right. Before we get started I should say that I love Terry Gilliam's films. Fear and Loathing, Brazil, Twelve Monkeys, The Fisher King, Jabberwocky, and Monty Python and the Holy Grail. If you don't have a serious soft spot for one of these movies, then you probably have woodlice living where your heart should be.I had heard some terrible things about this film, though, and was prepared for disappointment. Fortunately, it wasn't provided.This is a truly funny film, the first hour or so is one of the most darkly inventive comedies of 2005. Matt Damon is positively good, and Heath Ledger is eminently passable. The supporting cast is, generally, superb, and Gilliam's world is here in force.It is a beautiful film, a well-performed film, a funny film, and one that asks important questions about whether we should be ruled by our heads or our hearts. So, why just a 7? First, there is the problem of the accents. For those not from England this will probably not be a problem, but it immediately marks out the Hollywood actors 'slumming it in an artfilm, desperate for some indie kudos' from the wonderful supporting cast. And Monica Bellucci's, which is mercifully brief, is almost unlistenable to. Still, this is not a huge problem, as they still manage to get the jokes right.The third act is a problem, however. Far too many things are set up, and then resolved at length. Before you remember that there's still more unresolved. The protracted climax sequence seems to go on forever, and, being simple action with none of the charms of the rest of the film, makes forever seem very noisy.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. I truly, truly did, but Gilliam's warm humanism and passion seemed to be missing from a setting that could have been written especially for him.I understand that Gilliam must have felt the desire to make a commercial film after the disappointments of Don Quixote, but we seem to have lost the Gilliam character through whose eyes we can see the world, and have had him replaced with Matt Damon and Heath Ledger (!) Unfortunately, they cannot bring the depth a Michael Palin, a Jeff Bridges, Jonathan Pryce, or even a well-directed Bruce Willis or Johnny Depp can. All of these performances suggested characters who were at odds with their world to some extent. Heath Ledger's range doesn't stretch that far. Whilst Gilliam has got the comedy out of his leads, he has failed to get much else.That is probably overstating the case. They're not bad. But they're not the great, career-high performances Gilliam has got from his other actors. This is a really good film, it just won't for me sit with those I listed at the beginning of this review.",The Brothers Grimm

Well, I'm a real fan of the brothers Grimm and i think the movie was an excellent way to mix a bit of the Grimm's real life and their stories, now known around the world. Heath Ledger and Matt Damon had a very good performance and really had the chemistry that normal brothers do.

Definitely see Brokeback Mountain for Heath's shining moment, or even The Order, it was better than this. The Brothers Grimm is mind-bendingly awful on every level of film making. It is actually worse than Van Helsing and less watchable than Alexander. This is one of the very few movies that I could not make it through. Matt was paid $10,000,000 for this film.

Why is it that, as we are an English speaking society, our heroes should have English accents? The French general has a French accent; the Italian torturer has an Italian accent; however, the heroes Wilhelm and Jakob Grimm are German and yet they are portrayed with English accents. Not just playful accents, but blatantly English with hints of Cockney, at times.Second, the first time I saw this I swore I had seen it before... where... oh, yeah! Peter Jackson's 1996 movie ""The Frighteners"". Not a whole lot of a re-make, but some elements were lifted with subtle undertones: lead characters are con artists who make money by ""exorcising"" ghosts, an Italian torturer in Grimm is an insane FBI agent here... etc.Finally, Terry Gilliam fits into one of those roles as a director who is truly under-appreciated. I love most of his movies, from Brazil and Time Bandits to Brothers Grimm, however even though he has a reputation for going waaaaay over budget, I wish he would have been given a larger budget for this movie. The ""gingerbread man"" sequence is comical, but the scene where the stable girl is swallowed by the horse is as fake as it comes. Hence, a couple million more would have made it better. On the other hand, the walking trees are awesome.I say the effects are great, but I'm lost on the acting. Angelika, played by Lena Headey, sucks. Not only did Matt Damon and Heath Ledger dislike her, her acting sucked. The lack of the German accents and the obnoxious Italian Cavaldi brought the movie down even further.

The visuals the film left my mind reeling and swimming in thoughts of my childhood of both my fears and my excitements of a fantasy world.I loved how the different tales were mixed together and made you think back to those stories you were told for years by your mother at bedtime.

317,blue_blue,Don't get sucked in.,1,27 August 2005,"This movie was a huge mess of bits and pieces of what was mostly garbage. The pieces that weren't total garbage were in such tiny fragments that they had hardly any impact at all. To call this movie ""complicated"" would be a compliment of which it is totally undeserving. A landfill is complicated, but not really worth worrying about. You just want to avoid it. Quite similar to this movie. I'm not saying that the acting was terrible---although I don't understand what was wrong with Jonathan Pryce. It's hard to believe that mess was caused by direction alone, but it's the only excuse I can think of other than the unlikely possibility that his acting has seriously and surprisingly declined. I can't stand Matt Damon, but he was perfectly fine, as was Heath Ledger, and the very pretty Lena Headey. The rest of the cast ably fulfilled their roles, though it seemed like a lot of them had some trouble in looping. And of course the special effects were well done. If only there was some reason to watch those special effects, things would be much better. But as it is, this seems like a school play-level script written by a bunch of teenaged boys into extreme gross-out gore, paid for any snippet of any fairytale they could shove into it, whether or not it made sense, mattered, or added anything at all. Oh, I forgot---they also had to set it in French-occupied Germany, and throw in bizarre relations between the conquering French and the oppressed Germans. For history class, I suppose, since it didn't perform any significant function. Or maybe just to include wretched fake French accents. I don't know if they were supposed to be funny or what, but they certainly weren't. I'm also confused as to why the ""Germans"" had British accents. The ineffective, embarrassing caricature of the political/historical angle is actually one of the more attended-to aspects of the film: a sad commentary on how little anything else is developed. As for the fairytale aspect, it seems like whoever wrote this is the one person who either doesn't remember fairy tales, or thinks that they're better off when horribly mutated or debased into freakish, meaningless, repulsive, bastardized, sludgy bits. Mixing up a few fairy tales might be a good idea. It sounds like it. Even a heavy dose of fairytale references could come together in a witty and cohesive way. But if that is the goal, especially if you don't have much material apart from that, you have to actually use enough of a fairytale or character to make sense or tell a story in some way. Taking what amounts to a particle from each and indiscriminately throwing them into a blender on HIGH makes. . . this movie. It takes atoms of fairy tales and smashes them to create some sort of black hole of a movie that warps them and itself. And you don't get anything out of a black hole. It basically just sucks.",The Brothers Grimm
318,everybodysdifferent,An overall pleasing movie,10,27 August 2005,"This movie is full of adventure, humor, family love, fantasy, and a few scary moments. I decided to see this movie after looking through a national geographic on the brothers Grimm from several years ago. I also decided I would see this movie because of the fantasy in it. I went to the movie with high expectations and came out extremely pleased. I love how the director tied in at least 10-15 fairy tales in the movie and how one of the brothers kept track of all of the stories. This movie reminds me of an adult fairy tale that was well worth my seven bucks to see it. I do recommend, however, reading all of the Grimm's fairy tales before seeing this movie because some parts need the assistance of a fairy tale to be understood. I would recommend this movie to fantasy lovers anybody who wants to see a great movie and be touched by the love two brothers can have for each other.",The Brothers Grimm
319,ten_blue_crows,You can't spell manslaughter without laughter.,7,2 September 2005,"Anything directed by Terry Gilliam is, of course, hilarious. When I saw Fear and Loathing for the first time I stopped laughing by the end of the movie simply because I just couldn't laugh any more. The Brothers Grimm completely lives up to T.G.'s previous works. It's intensely quotable, shockingly gruesome, creepy, freaky, and funny to tears.You can't spell manslaughter without laughter, and the Brothers Grimm prove that. If I were made to describe this movie, I would have to say that it's like the Sleepy Hollow, Shrek, and Monty Python all rolled into one.PS, Don't take your kids to it, it's a bit scary, too.",The Brothers Grimm
320,marclapointe2003,Not the Terry Guilliam we know and love,6,26 August 2005,"I must admit that Tery Gilliam's latest effort was quite a disappointment for me . Through the years, I have come to expect great things from him, things that were clearly missing here. To me, Gilliam is the creator of unreal and bigger than life characters, settings and events. True, this is a fantasy movie with a hint of Gilliam's touch. Some of his characters are reminiscent of the Gilliam weirdos ""extraordinaries"" we are used to. But it's as if he sold out. This is one of his most commercial efforts I can remember, if not his only one. Gilliam die-hard fans will be disappointed: this is truly meant to be a family flick. And judging from the on-going flow of questions from the little girl sitting behind me (Who's that? What are they doing? What is it?), it's not for everyone. I still give this movie a six, but there are some nice elements: Photography is nice, the music is pretty good and the actors (including Matt Damon) give good performances. A weaker Gilliam film is still a Gilliam film.",The Brothers Grimm
321,joxmongoose,Don't waste 2 hours of your live on this one.,2,27 August 2005,"I went to this move with a group of 10 people, so I know that I wasn't the only one who had this opinion: The Brothers Grimm is nearly impossible to follow, and easily one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. Here are the biggest reasons why this movie is a waste of money: 1- Many of the characters have such thick French accents that you can hardly understand half of the dialogue 2- The plot doesn't make any sense. The story is an awkward combination of fairy tales that were never meant to be combined. The combination makes the entire story very confusing.If you think that this is a children's film, you are mistaken! This is the kind if movie that will give children nightmares. If anything, they won't be able to follow the story.I did give this movie 2 stars. One because some of the special effects and scenery are cool. And one because the Evil Queen was hot.Not only is this movie not worth paying for, but it's not even worth seeing (even for free on network TV).",The Brothers Grimm
322,Lovely_Drama,once upon a time...,7,27 August 2005,"Once upon a time... Not so long ago... A group of three friends embarked on a journey to the movie theater to view the story of the brothers Grimm...A evil queen, a big bad wolf, a child in a little red riding cape.. a trail of bread crumbs, and a magic mirror... sound familiar?? This movie was a good concept.. A very good concept and I am not going to knock it and say that it was bad.. Nor will I say that it was the best film I have ever seen.. I will say this... The movie was enjoyable..It is a bit slow moving when it begins..but it has a good story to it.. It has mystery, excitement and a gingerbread man... I would have liked it better if it was more fast paced.. In my opinion it should have been an hour and a half and not two hours..Now that I think about it.. this concept would make a great TV show... It needed time to develop each character .. All in all I say this For the movie... It is a renter..BUT if it were a TV show.. ( with a one year story line: kinda like Babylon 5 had a story line.. ) it would be a great thing to watch...Feel Free to disagree with me..",The Brothers Grimm
323,mbuck-1,Bettelheim helps,8,30 August 2005,"Many people, viewers and critics alike, are panning this movie. As a Gilliam fan, I wanted to see it for myself. As it happens, I liked it a great deal. I think that part of the issue for those who don't like it is that this is not an example of linear storytelling. In fact, later in the film, realism is totally eliminated - the story moves into the realm of the symbolic.I think that reading ""The Uses of Enchantment"" by Bruno Bettelheim would enhance the enjoyment of this movie for many people. Gilliam's use of the symbolism from many of our most famous archetypal fairy tales had my head spinning (that's in a positive way!)OK, maybe it sounds like a real drag for someone to suggest that you read a book before you see this movie. Actually, I'm not suggesting that - most people wouldn't be interested in doing that, anyway. It's a shame, though, because ultimately I don't think there is a large audience for this movie. I feel that it will achieve ""cult status"" (as so many of Gilliam's movies have before).It really does help to have the background in the archetypal aspects of ""Hansel and Gretel"", ""Little Red Riding Hood"", ""Rapunzel"", ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Snow White"" and others that the Bettelheim book provides, though - with that knowledge, this film can be seen as a really exceptional piece of entertainment.",The Brothers Grimm

It was a battle to get me to go see it but I was glad by the end of the film that my friend dragged me to see it. The visual effects were amazing and I found the story line extremely good but also easy to follow.I found the characters were portrayed very well by the people filling the rolls (plus a bit of eye candy for the girls)] Overall I found the film very fun to watch; it was exciting and enjoyable I think that anyone could sit down and watch this film and enjoy it, I would gladly go see it again.",The Brothers Grimm

I went in expecting a buddy-movie meets horror, and instead got a buddy-movie meets horror on STEROIDS. Acting was okay. Plot was okay. But were the film really shined was the ACTION.See it.Now.",The Brothers Grimm
326,Frodo_Goop,Not Your Typical Fairy Tale,6,5 December 2005,"This movie was, in one word, interesting. The plot was original, what with two men who made it their lives to trick people into hiring them to perform exorcisms. And then these men get thrown into a real life enchanted forest with real witchery at work. I loved how the movie managed to marry together all sorts of fairy tales that all of us have read as children and are very familiar with. Some of them are a little strange, however, and that is the reason I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I would have otherwise. For example, the movie would have been complete without throwing in the story of the gingerbread man. I enjoyed how they led up to that part, but it was just strange. Overall, the acting was fairly good, I loved the scene at the beginning when Jacob was drunk in the tavern. It was amusing and very over the top, which is what the writers were going for, I suppose. In that regard, the movie was excellent. If you want to see a movie that takes all your favorite childhood stories and adds a bit of a twist to them, this is the one for you.",The Brothers Grimm
327,louverture,Could have been magical...,6,24 December 2005,"The Brothers Grimm could have been a truly wonderful Terry Gilliam film. If you watch the movie, then watch the deleted scenes, then watch them again with the director's commentary, it becomes clear what the original could have been. Not only was Gilliam's version more nuanced, it also cleared up big plot holes that the theatrical version left. The scene with Sasha rising from the casket is crucial because the audience has invested so much with her. It is not only cuts; it is also additions. The scene in Angelika's house between Jacob and Angelika and then Wilhelm and Angelika clearly does not belong in the film. It looks entirely different from the rest of the movie: the light is different, the costumes look different, and the mood itself is different. It is a jarring note in the middle of this troubled film.All in all The brothers Grimm is a popcorn movie, but it could have been a better popcorn movie if it had stayed a Terry Gilliam film, not botched up by committee. As Gilliam himself says in the commentary in the deleted scene section of the DVD, maybe someday we'll see the director's cut.",The Brothers Grimm
328,zimmered,"What an awful film, how disappointing...",1,28 August 2005,"I went into this film expecting lesser Gilliam based on the mediocre reviews I had read and what I had seen in the trailers. I was deeply disappointed to discover - almost from the first minute of the film - that ""The Brothers Grimm"" is instead a very terrible film. Bad acting, terrible dialogue, virtually no plot, choppy, amateurish editing that only serves to confuse and disorient the audience, and virtually nothing at all happens for the first half of the film. Wooden, 2-dimensional characters never develop (except one, who manages a total transformation into an entirely different character at the end of the film with no impetus given for the change), and surprisingly enough, the jokes aren't even funny. Unless, of course, you find the abuse, mutilation, and very gruesome, bloody death of a kitten funny - which apparently Gilliam does, since it is played for a joke herein. Nasty. What a total waste of time and celluloid - Terry Gilliam owes me ten bucks.",The Brothers Grimm
329,verite98,Not the best movie to see,4,11 September 2005,"***BIG SPOILERS!!!*** This movie was fun and excellent in special effects. But that's about all it had.The acting was terrible - the accents of the characters were so incredibly off and changing every other minute. The French characters had Italian accents and if they were in fact Italians, I couldn't even understand them. Some characters got incredibly annoying - but I have to say, kudos to those actors. Especially Matt Damon's Wil, who was incredibly annoying.The best actor/character in the movie was Heath Ledger. His character had substance, had a reason and a motive to act the way he did. And he portrayed it effectively.Matt Damon's character was developed but was lame.The movie was sometimes a bit too long and yet rushed. It was like Terry Gilliam was trying to cram as many fairy tales into one movie; it might have been a little more effective if it didn't seem so rushed and there was more dialogue to explain what on earth was going on. I didn't even understand what they were trying to do because it wasn't explained enough.The ending was so unsatisfying, and that little hint that there'd be a sequel (I hope not!) didn't make it any better. I wish the ending was a little more resolved, because I did favor Heath Ledger over Matt Damon, and yet the ending didn't resolve on who gets the girl! Oh yes, and the animal cruelty - yes it was quite disgusting and scary - definitely not suited for little kids under 13 no matter what. But then again, it was all special effects and quite excellently done. So no, I doubt any animals were killed or hurt in this process in any way.",The Brothers Grimm
330,richboysellincrick,Extremely enjoyable,10,22 September 2005,"'The Brothers Grimm' takes us back to when we were little and heard stories about Hansel and Gretel, the gingerbread man, Rapunzel, and other childhood favorites. It features great acting and stories you already know with surprising twists.In addition to having fun going along with those old stories, the acting is superb. Heath ledger and Matt Damon as well as everyone in this movie are extremely convincing and keep you on the edge of your seat.If you haven't seen this movie you'll enjoy watching and guessing what happens next. Sometimes what was in the story could be completely wrong. You just have to wait and see.All in all I think the movie had amazing acting, a great plot, and some interesting twists and surprises. If you are taking kids I recommend 12+.10/10",The Brothers Grimm
331,nomadr666,Tim Burton does this better,6,6 March 2006,"Well, Terry Gilliam is a good enough director not to spoil completely the story, as most of others would probably do on his place, but he is apparently not good enough for this kind of tasks. Comparisons to Tim Burton are inevitably appearing in mind while watching the movie, and these comparisons are not for Gilliam. No, the movie isn't bad at all, one simply sees in almost every frame, that it could be done better, if would be done by Burton, it's simply his territory, territory, where Gilliam is a stranger. Everything - acting, photography, even special effects (what is quite surprising nowadays) lack authenticity. Nevertheless, still quite entertaining story.",The Brothers Grimm
332,p-a-pelphrey,Gilliam...but not quite...,5,27 August 2005,"I'm as big a 'Monty Python' fan as anyone else but my expectations for 'The Brothers Grimm' were not met. Sure, it was funny at parts. Even classic Gilliam funny but the funny parts were few and far between and filled in between was a fluffy cheesy CGI created world full of children-eating werewolves and grotesque queens. Sure, its well made but for those comparing this movie to the classically terrible 'Van Helsing' I can now see the resemblance. The characters in 'The Brothers Grimm' do approach their situations with more tongue-in-cheek humor but it still just doesn't quite work. You're left leaving the theater thinking 'ok....what am I supposed to come away with.' The movie is worth a rental but not much more than that.",The Brothers Grimm
333,puppylovehz,Worse than I expected,1,11 January 2018,"Even though this is supposedly a historical fiction film, its fantasy undertow drains all of the comic relief into something absolutely stupid. The plot of the story makes no sense and it took me quite some while to figure out who was who in this movie. And to be honest, this is a story about legendary icons of folklore such as Cinderella, Snow White, The Little Red Ridding Hood, etc, but it brought my hopes rapidly down. Another reason being that given Jacob is the oldest boy in the Grimm family after his father died, he would be more likely logical than Wilhelm. Vis-a-vis, Jacob shouldn't be obsessed with magic beans. Also, my hopes were shot down once again when THE ONLY FEMALE LEAD IN THE CAST turned about to be a random girl named Angelika rather than Henriette Dorothea Wild, Wilhelm Grimm's actual wife.So, when all is said and done, don't watch this movie.",The Brothers Grimm
334,nilsson-5,Not really worth it.,2,9 September 2005,"I really looked forward to this movie, as I love the theme of fairy tales. And this does have its good points. I could have gone along with it, if there hadn't been those parts that really made me cringe, and several times want to walk out of the theatre. If I hadn't gone with someone else, I would have left.Some scenes were just too disgusting, to no real purpose. I can't see that a cat being kicked into the spinning blades of a torture machine (and then someone eating the bits that splashed on his face) really furthered the plot. The same for the rabbit-skinning and the horses being set on fire.Other images were a bit more than I wanted to see - like the horse that was given the spiders. I don't consider myself all that squeamish, but there were things that were a bit too much over the line for me.Other than that, I think they could have cut out a lot about the torturer, and I couldn't understand a lot of what he was saying anyway.It wasn't a horrible movie otherwise, and I think I could have enjoyed it if I wasn't constantly wondering when the next disgusting thing was going to happen.",The Brothers Grimm
335,charles_roe,great fun magical fairytale adventure,8,6 November 2005,"Brothers Grim is a surprisingly witty and fantastical blend of social history and fairytale magic. The film cleverly uses extracts from several of the best known fairy tales of modern times, and fuses them together to form a wonderful and twisting narrative that keeps you glued to the screen. With a sense of realism thrown in with the historical events of 1700s french-occupied Germany, and the fantasy element of many mysterious and magical goings-on, the narrative comes together to prove highly effective and very watchable. With some great cinematography and effects, as well as settings that do justice to the magical feel of the story, brothers grim is technically a very well put together film. I was impressed with both Matt Damon, who is always interesting to watch and the performances of Peter Stormare and Johnathan Pryce as the french general and sidekick ,but most of all heath ledger who has really shown his flexibility as an actor in this film. Brothers grim is not a film that can be easily classified as one single genre. With a comical feel, many one-liners and comic performances, this film is not your average fantasy. I would highly recommends this film to anyone who enjoys seeing great camera work, great effects and being thrown into a good old fashioned fantasy adventure story.",The Brothers Grimm
336,human_remains05,really worth a look,8,25 February 2006,"The Brothers Grimm is a funny black comedy that mixes some really macabre moments of violence with other scenes of fairytale joy and splendour. This makes for a really fun ride and a movie worth watching. The performances of Heath Ledger and Matt Damon as brothers Will and Jakob are so different its almost surreal. Heath Ledger instills in his performance just the right amount of nervousness and dreamlike qualities that Jakob possessed and does so well in the role and Matt Damon turns everything around and plays to type as the brave one who has not time to think things through. All the performances in the movie are excellent especially Lena Headey and Monica Bellucci doing her most evil role as the Mirror Queen with Mackenzie Crook from The Office providing some of the laughs. I really couldn't take my eyes off the screen throughout the Brothers Grimm adventure and i'm so glad that Terry Gilliam has done such justice to this story. The imagery, performances and overall comedic and action qualities of the film combine to create a fantastic, hilarious and often surprising film and it certainly marks a welcome return to form from Terry Gilliam.",The Brothers Grimm
337,akimon,Deranged fun not for everyone,7,2 September 2005,"Not as good as Twelve Monkeys, and may not take with some people, but still, for me it was a highlight of the very grimm summer season at the movies. It may be too much for kids, PETA activists and people allergic to dark humour, but I loved watching it, and I still find myself giggling joyously when I remember certain scenes- the kinky interaction of Willhelm and Grandma Toad alone is worth the ticket price. The violence is there, but it's in line with the spirit of the times- for all its fantastic and fantasy sequences, this movie gives us nicely rounded portrait of the dark and semi-dark ages; the horrible fate of Little Kitty is, well, horrible (I would certainly not let my cat watch this movie), and Jonathan Price and Peter Stormare go for broke and play it completely over the top and sharply to the left. Ledger's and Damon's acting is right on the money, too, even when they're covered in mud or wearing home made armour. Monica Bellucci looks delicious, and the whole movie looks spectacular, with special note of distinction to the team that designed the Gothic/Turingian scenes. The CGIs are incredible- I did not expect such digital riches from Gilliam, this is up and above LOTR level- and while the movie takes it slow at first, it finds its flow and picks up the energy, and proceeds to dance to the crazy rhythm of the Klezmer meets Baroque music that saturates its soundtrack. And, if like me you actually grew up reading the tales, you will pick up many delicious puns and twists on the old tales. Once upon a time, there was this Grimm movie that brought joy and lots of mud to the world...",The Brothers Grimm
338,verosabrian,Too much fairy tale,3,5 June 2006,"This film has great comedy acting from two typically non-comedy actors, Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. The film is worth watching for that point only. The rest of the film is too ambitious in it's effort to cameo countless fairy tales. One particular fairy/folk tale that's referred to in this film is so grossly animated, albeit animated with skill, that the remainder of the film loses all respect, artistically. This movie makes a strong case for the criticism of ""trying to hard."" Even Peter Stormare who is typically effortlessly strange and prickly comes off as overly dramatic in a way that comes close to silly caricature.",The Brothers Grimm

Throwing in just about every major Grimm theme in the most unexpected places, this is fictional account of the brother's fight against a real supernatural force after years of conning innocents for money. Damon and Ledger are believable as the brothers in their black slapstick role. Pryce is excellent as paranoid pompous French general, but Peter Stormare deserves best supporting actor for his hilarious turn as the paranoid Italian torturer in Pryce's employ.This black comedy is in no way for children, but if you have a taste for Gilliam's black humor and some macabre laughs, this may be the perfect Halloween film for you this year!",The Brothers Grimm

I love traditional fairy tales, and I have adored many other interpretations of traditional Brothers Grimm stories - ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror"" (1997) was excellent.

I saw in him a beginning of reflection or subversivity.

So I was utterly disappointed when I saw this travesty. It had some recognizable Gilliam features, such as the bizarre lighting, and wide-angle shots. But, whereas in the two movies I mentioned above, those effects were put to good use, here they were pointless. The special effects were awful -- about a 1980 level of technology. As a result, the forest scenes, which were supposed to be scary and intriguing, were just plain boring. Peter Stormare's awful Italian accent didn't help anything.

I happen to appreciate the work that hes done. 12 monkeys was the reason i started watching movies, and I've seen Brazil countless number of times. but this is absolute crap. I thought it had an interesting premise from the previews, and the first 20 mins were really good. And then the whacky and zanyness that is Terry Gilliam showed up. At several points in the film, you will find yourself asking ""where are they going with this?"".Matt Damon and Heath Ledger have a good on set chemistry, but they seem to be ad-libbing most of their lines and after a short period of time, it gets redundant. and if you like Peter Stormare this movie will kinda make you think twice as he is one of the most annoying things about it.The brothers grim holds up pretty well in the first couple of minutes, and slowly takes a nose dive down to Bombville. i still hope it does well because i like the director. but i think it was being advertised as a movie that was going to give the audience something new. on a whole i can say about this movie is that ""its been done before"".",The Brothers Grimm
345,kingoftheducks,A Real Grimm Fairy Tale...,8,6 November 2005,"It's been a long time coming. Not only because Terry Gilliam's last feature film was 1998's 'Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas', not only because his next project became the world's first unmaking of 'Lost In La Mancha', and not only because 'Grimm' itself has suffered the usual hiccups and seen its released date pushed back from October 2003, to 2004 to last Friday. For Gilliam fans this has been a marathon of endurance, but has it been worthwhile? Sometimes when a film with a troubled history reaches the screen you can't see the scars, but others the cuts and bruises are all too apparent. With Gilliam's 'Grimm' there is most assuredly a sense of compromised Gilliam, but, heck, most directors wish on their best days that they had the wit, verve and imagination that even Diet Gilliam contains. For the Gilliamite 'Grimm' is somewhere between 'Jabberwocky' and 'Baron Munchasen', for everyone else it's like 'Sleepy Hollow' meets 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. Will (Matt Damon) and Jake (Heath Ledger) Grimm are con-men, going from village to village, exploiting the local bogeymen to earn a nice sack of gold. But the invading French army, lead by Delatombe (Johnathan Pryce), have cottoned on to the Grimm's scams and force them to do a little work for them. They send them off to a forest that just so happens to be actually enchanted! This simple yet wonderful premise gives Gilliam full license to throw in every idea he has as soon as it comes to him; we've got living trees, werewolves, mud monsters, spider-web vomiting horses, it is a feast of imagination. He keeps the plot alive with a healthy smattering of gags, from the dry to the broad. The principle cast members seem to be having a great time, Damon and Ledger spark off one another excellently and Peter Stormare gives a performance that some may find shameful and others, like myself, delightfully lunatic. The only weak link is Lena Headey's Angelika, never giving her character the edge it requires, but this may have something to do with both Gilliam and Damon being over-ruled by the Weinsten brothers (executive producers on the film) and not being allowed to cast Samantha 'In America' Morton in the role. Visually the film is beautiful, dirty and dusty, full of life and then we enter the forest and are treated to some truly gorgeous views that look straight out of the finest landscape painting; atop the Queen's Tower is both breathtaking and nerve jangling. However, the editing at times is a little slapdash, and a few plot points are mishandled leaving the audience double-taking in confusion, and some emotional/comedic/action beats aren't punctuated quite as well as they should be; a problem I've had with quite a few films this year! Nevertheless, the film moves along at a cracking speed, and a scene or idea never outstays its welcome. Plus, everything is held together, and propelled along, by Dario Marianelli's absolutely superb score, picking up the musical invention and wit that Danny Elfman seems to have long since lost and injecting it with a sense of adventure not heard in a score since John Debney's swashbuckling themes for 'Cutthroat Island'. In the end you find yourself with an odd feeling. You know you've seen something wonderfully imaginative, it's made you laugh, made you jump, made you grip the arms of your chair, it's made you go ""Wow!"" a good few times, but you also feel it could've been so much more. You can hear the Weinstein's muttering in the background, you can practically see their grubby fingerprints scuffing up some of the scenes. On the one hand we have to be thankful that they stumped up the money to get this film finished, but on the other we have to wonder why they couldn't have let Gilliam make the decisions he wanted to? Still, compromised Gilliam is better than no Gilliam at all... and this film has more imagination than most of the others clogging up the release schedule. It's the kind of film you would've watched as a kid and grown-up to remember with such adoration, one that you long to show your kids in the hope that they'll laugh, hide and be in awe as much as you were.",The Brothers Grimm
346,deanajo,Entertaining though dark,8,5 September 2005,"This film combines elements of many of the Grimm's fairy tales. It isn't award winning but it is entertaining. Unlike a previous commenter, I found nothing boring about it. I thought Matt Damon was allowed to ham it up a little much and I'd hope the Heath Ledger character would get the girl - but I went to see it with my twelve year old and she and I both felt it was eerie, funny, scary and entertaining all rolled up into one. The ""French"" actors were at times difficult to understand and the lighting/sets were very dark. However, for anyone familiar with the Grimm's fairy tales it was appropriate - these are not happy little stories like Walt Disney movies. Part of the fun is identifying which fairy tales are being drawn on.",The Brothers Grimm
347,jollybard13,"Well, I rather liked it",8,26 August 2005,"This is a film that assumes nothing. It doesn't assume you've come to the cinema to see any one particular kind of film. It doesn't assume you're even going to enjoy the film. But, if you walk into it expecting nothing, something magical happens.This is a film about magic; the magic of Grimm fairy tales coupled with the magic of Terry Gilliam. There's a magic in the way the tales piece together, in the way the brothers act, and in the way the story develops before your eyes.Yes, there are funny little bits thrown in, but life is not serious all the time. Sometimes the funny leads to the bizarre, but more often it's the serious bits that do.For the most part, the film is beautifully shot, and the animation is seamless. The score is truly wonderful; I would see it again just for the music. Heath Leger and Matt Damon provide very good vessels for the characters of the brothers Grimm. And for those even somewhat familiar with Mr. Gilliam's work, his distinct character is visible all the time.I will not say that this film is a cinematic masterpiece, but it is to be appreciated for what it is.",The Brothers Grimm
348,ZCunha,"""The Brothers Grimm"" is worth watching.",9,28 August 2005,"The new Monica Bellucci movie, ""The Brothers Grimm"", is out, and most definitely worth watching. The movie is clearly from the Monty Python school of acting, and the whole crew, including Damon, Ledger and Heady do a pretty decent job of hamming it up.Some of the characters weren't quite enough over the top, especially Peter Stormare's Cavaldi, who does a decent crazy gangly Italian but not quite to a high enough level for full comedic effect, and while the French were generally pretty funny, they didn't quite reach ""Fart in your general direction"", levels of hilarity.Monica Bellucci looks gorgeous as usual, and does an excellent fairy-tale style evil Queen. Of course, my bias for her means that her presence alone was worth the price of admission, but the movie is a nice comedic fantasy story.",The Brothers Grimm
349,the_whyte_spyder,"Whimsical, Magical, Without Direction...",8,27 August 2005,"When I had first saw the trailer for this movie online some 2 months ago, I was skeptical at first. While the concept seemed to be a bit out there, I later found out that the legend of comedy both light and dark Terry Gilliam. Surely, I thought this film will be amazing, and with Gilliam behind it, my anticipation grew, and I wasn't disappointed.The Brothers Grimm was well envisioned, and even masterful to imagine. Throughout the entire movie, you see numerous events that are taken from their fairy tales (I'm assuming this is to say that these events shaped their fairy tales). Despite most people's comments on here, the Brothers are not ""Super Combat Scientists"". In fact, they are clueless con men thrust into a real life ordeal, with nothing but their tricks and lies to keep them alive. This of course laid to rest mine and many of my friend's thoughts that these two we're going to save the world with two hand tied behind their back (as some of the trailers mislead you to believe). However, the actual plot is lacking somewhat due to the fact that is jumps around a little too much, and the fact that those bastard producers had their way with Gilliam's vision. Not to say that there is no plot, it's juts a bit weak at times. But what the plot lacks, the visuals and soundtrack more than make up for these lulls in the plot. One can only wonder how much better it would have been had Gilliam been given free reign eh? Overall if you want to see a decent fantasy movie, with a few interesting plot twists and scenes that will make you raise out of your seat and ask ""Did that really happen?"" than I'd advise you go see The Brothers Grimm today.",The Brothers Grimm
350,mrpaul1112,Just like Van Helsing,2,27 August 2005,"This movie is utterly ridiculous. They added elements of practically every single Grimm fairy tale and try to make a coherent story out of it (and of course, fail miserably). I couldn't help but think of the the movie ""Van Helsing"" when watching. In that movie, they tried to incorporate all the classic monsters (werewolf, Frankenstein, Dracula, etc) into the movie and came up with pure random crap. The Brothers Grimm accomplishes just about the same. Some people may like the randomness and think it's cool how they can recognize all the fairytale references and maybe even think it's interesting how they incorporated all that into a single movie. But come on, EVERYTHING WAS RANDOM and NOTHING MADE SENSE!",The Brothers Grimm

I wouldn't recommend taking any kids that are younger that 13. It's rated pg13 for a reason. But all in all this is a movie that I will definitely buy. I found it to be funny, serious, and well done. Also something that doesn't hurt is that this movie has two of my favorite things, the Grimm brothers stories, and Heath Ledger.I highly recommend that you see this movie. Just make sure to screen it before you bring your younger kids. That is unless you want them to see people skewered by trees, bitten in half, shot, tortured, and stabbed.",The Brothers Grimm

The acting is decent and Matt Damon, despite his occasional suckage does not. From the previews I thought that it was going to be more of a horror film which it was not. There are some comedic bits and a running homage to the brothers Grimm Fairy tails which was to be expected. The effects are outstanding and do not detract from the feature. It wasn't as good as I had hoped considering this is the first film from Terry in 7 years, but a solid **** out of 5 stars.

I just didn't get this movie at all, and I'm generally a fan of the Monty Python/Terry Gilliam school of movies....Until now.This movie had one redeeming feature for me, and that was the fact that it ended. At some points during the movie, I thought I had woke up in hell. It was just painful to watch at some points.Matt Damon...this could be the start of his Ben Affleck style slide into mediocrity. Both of those boyz need to contact Kevin Smith for some career guidance, maybe even making a good movie together.Heath Ledger...was smart, since he was pretty much in disguise.

While I like some other mind-numbing movies (""Van Wilder"", love it!) and some other Terry Gilliam movies (""Fear and Loathing..."" and ""Monty Python"" come to mind), this movie was both trivial and irrelevant. Before you ask, I was dragged there by my friends who insisted I go out and have a good time. Boy, were they mistaken...Well, without giving away the plot, here's some of what's wrong with Hollywood and this movie: 1.) Every fairy tale the Brothers Grimm ever wrote was forced into the movie at awkward times (you'll see what I mean, but not if your smart), 2.) Turning the Brothers Grimm into scoundrels from the beloved storybook writers is sacrilege, 3.) The characters (especially Matt Damon's) were very 2D and not easily lovable or identifiable, 4.) The one-liners and quips were, not only lacking humor, but expected well in advance, thus killing the punch line. From the genius who helped direct the ""Monty Python""'s, I'd expect more, 5.) I loved ""Fear and Loathing..."" which was a mind-trip in itself, but this was, by far, Terry Gilliam's most bizarre movie, and honestly is his worst film by a long shot.This film will be forgotten quicker than his well-documented attempted at Don Quixote, which was honestly sadly brilliant. This will go down as Matt Damon and Heath Ledger's ""Catwoman"", as it was HUGE budget and their worst movie by far. It couldn't keep my attention for most of the movie, except when Monica Bellucci was on, who not only is hot, but probably did the best job out of this haphazard film.The only other plus was the CGI, which was good, but could be spotted by a blind man at times. Don't waste your money or your time. If you want a good Terry Gilliam, check out ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""; it's cheaper than a ticket to the theater and much more entertaining.*** of 10, just for the OK CGI and Ms. Bellucci",The Brothers Grimm
355,arminta,Dumb self-indulgent mish-mash of old fairy tales,2,3 September 2005,"Visually stunning at times, with a dark & frightening forest & a wonderful terrifying witch. Unhappily, it all goes to waste with a confused, stupid plot that tries & fails to fuse several dark fairy tales together. The premise of the brothers being old-fashioned ""witch/troll-busters"" was a good one, but the movie executes the idea miserably. Full of depictions of animal cruelty (horses set on fire, a kitten slashed to pieces), human brutality (decapitations), a very frightening scene in which an enchanted horse eats a small girl...this movie is not for children! Or for anyone else. And it's too bad, because it shows potential that is squandered by a poorly written, meandering script. Fairy tales are full of dark and frightening creatures and cruel acts, but there is always a reason for the darkness and cruelty - an exploration into the dark, dangerous, & uncontrollable aspects of life and the hidden aspects of human behavior. This movie is good for a matinée to waste a couple hours, a few bucks - but do not take the kids!!",The Brothers Grimm
356,havanese,What?? Baron Munchausen !>?,7,15 February 2006,"Good Story. Fun adventure. But still The Adventures of Baron Munchausen was a much better story/tale by Gilliam underrated and yet in this almost 2 decade later film he uses Jonathon Pryce in the Same anti tale/fable role as the rationale ""Age of Reason"" character against fairy tales and mystery.? Not only the same actor but in the movie he almost quotes verbatim the same lines!!!!! Enjoyed but really enjoyed more the reminder of The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen Much Much Better!!! Great Story telling as Gilliam has is still dependant on new ideas or old ideas newly revealed. Why does he regurgitate an almost complete quote from an old movie? Same idea, same working upon it, but no new idea to make it new, no new quote!? I fell in love with Baron Munchausen years ago it is the near perfect telling of a Tall Tale . Brothers Grimm is a shallow response to a lower tale told lower.",The Brothers Grimm

However, while watching it I was just confused. There were bits and pieces of various fairy tales mixed up and blended and cut and pasted together into one confusing concoction. Occasionally I found myself just thinking ""what the crap?!"". Really bizarre, with the occasional real freaky parts and comic relief.Overall I would say its a decent one time movie (actually probably better as a rental, cause then you can watch it twice, in the hope that it might make more sense the second time). It had an interesting premise, but I think it could have been carried through better.",The Brothers Grimm

The movie started out slow, it was kind of hard to grasp the storyline at first as well, but it picked up about 15 minutes into the show. It's a bit predictable, given you know fairy tales well...I figured out what would ultimately happen about half-way through the movie. I hated the Italian-guy-turned-Frenchman in the movie. He came through in the end. The ending...I wanted the other brother to get the girl, he was in love with her, but the other prevailed. There was a bit of gore in the movie, a lot of birds, I jumped a few times...darn birds. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good fairytale.

Set in the Germany of Napoleonic France, the Brothers are set a task by the Delatombe (Jonathon Pryce), the Brothers find themselves inside an enchanted town beset by a supernatural evil that they must overcome despite interference by their French watcher and the French Army.

You must remember these are supposed to be about fairy tales. The characters will be rather daft and have a sort of stereotypical quality... This is what Disney was making films off of after all, of course they'll have irritating qualities that make them just plain stupid. I wish their had been more character development but it seemed like it would have been hard to fit it in anyway. The side characters I felt were fine and dandy. They were loopy and a bit on the stupid side just like in most Grimm tales. (take the snails for instance if you ever get to read the book and no this has nothing to do with the movie) I felt a little unfulfilled by some of it. I wanted more explanations for why things were the way they were. What had happened to make those certain things happen? Why hadn't this happened? Etc. etc. All in all... If you wanted a horror, this is not for you. I honestly thought it would be darker, but I enjoyed it anyway... But this also inst for you who are looking for a comedy.

The film is too dark. By that I mean that you can't see any details. It's like watching the movie as it occurs at the back of a cave which is very frustrating. Matt Damon's accent is good though you can tell it's fake in several places. Yet, he is no Robin of Nebraska. Jonathan Pryce does an absolutely horrible French accent and seems to stumble over every line as he attempts to hold the accent together. Such a shame for such a wonderful dramatic actor. It's wholly unbelievable when Matt and Heath show up in correctly filthy clothes, stand in utter mud and filth that befits those times yet when they smile and their teeth are pearly white and all there. Good tooth care is not a British trait especially in those times. Lena Headey does an okay job but her costuming is ridiculous. Here she is living in an 18th Century English back woods village but her character is cheapened by wearing beautiful dresses while she'd gutting rabbits and hunting in the woods. I expected so much more from Terri Gilliam. He's such a good director. But he seems to be trying too hard to include every nursery rhyme ever written while missing the details.",The Brothers Grimm

So I, along with one of the other managers, ran this movie and watched it with the kids. It was, by far, the worst movie I have seen in several years. By the end of the movie, only 15 people out of 40 hadn't left. The story can only be described as incomprehensible idiocy. Even thinking back, I can't actually figure out how many of the events that took place in the movie fit together. It seemed like someone walked on the set one day after most of the movie had been filmed and said ""You forgot to put these fairy tales in, I don't care how you do it or whether or not it makes sense, but put them in.""

However, as xenophobia has become almost compulsory in American cinema, the role is being taken by others. The worst stereotypes apply mainly to the Italian character - a cruel coward who reminds me of Nazi propaganda on the Jews - but the French are not spared either. They are scarier than the witches and the monsters, but are not more realistic than them. German occupation of France during WWII would look like liberation compared to French occupation of Germany in 1796 as depicted in the movie. Fortunately, Jonathan Pryce is excellent and makes ridicule a form of most precious art. Would you like some more quiche? Ah, by the way, I must add the movie makes many allusions to fairy tales - Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella (with the glass slippers), or Sleeping beauty - that were in fact written by Charles Perrault (1628-1703), a Frenchman.",The Brothers Grimm

I love fantasy films, I love black humour, I love good jokes, I love irony and sarcasm - and ""Brothers Grimm"" had it all - marvellous! The film had a lot of switches, often plays with my expectations of how it was going to go on and always kept me excited for the whole length - I wished it would never end!

The acting is also appalling, Jonathan Pryce does a weird kind of French/English/German accent and Peter Stormere overacts to the point of annoyance, but the worst acting comes from Heath Ledger who I've always thought was quite good, he seems to overactingly mumble his lines all the time. The only alright-acting comes from Matt Damon but he is also rather embarrassing.The CGI creatures look like cartoons so they are embarrassing as well.

369,phat_crighty,A Very Disappointing Movie - Read Before Viewing,1,26 November 2005,"The Brothers Grimm, is by far, one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. The plot revolves around two con artists, Jake and Will Grim, both relative protagonists, who travel mindlessly to random villages vanquishing mythical creatures and saving the unsuspecting townships from their own stupidity. As the movie progresses it becomes ever apparent that not only are the characters lost in the script, but so is the audience. I believe this movie was intended for younger audiences, there is however, no way that anyone under fifteen years would understand the victimization and apparent sketchy outline of what the movie was supposed to be portraying.Although this movie was enjoyed by a lot of people in the screening on opening night, I really feel that this movie is over-rated and to be blunt, a cinematic flop. Special effects, although all right in times, are clouded by obvious mistakes in others. To make matters worse, if that's possible, the actor's accents change, and the metal axe used can be seen to bend whenever swung. Obviously no movies complete without a gorgeous optimistic loner, who manages to write all wrongs with a simple kiss. Not only does this movie lack momentum, it lacks heart. Terry Gilliam, although noted for his view on creativity, notably, has let his audience and fans down. But then, that's to be expected when business suits take over.This movie left both my friends and myself scratching our heads and looking down gloomily at where fifteen dollars had been only a few hours earlier. To sum up this movie, go and see it if you enjoy fantasy/action movies, and are willing to part with your money knowing clearly that you might well regret it after. * I must admit though, one of my friends enjoyed this movie and does however, recommend it if you're a fan of this genre.",The Brothers Grimm

Blood gets spattered on one of the characters faces, and he proceeds to lick it off and say ""mmmmmm."" There is seemingly no reason for this scene. It has nothing to do with anything that's going on and is just plane sick. Other than that and another horrifying scene involving a bunny's skin being ripped off, the movie just plane sucks.

It's sad because such fertile ground could have been made into something much more entertaining and interesting. The acting is generally spirited but the dialog imprisons the actors, who also fall victim to this production. The few glints of humor surface as breaths of Terry Gilliam's direction wafting through the movie. The special effects are nice, but they appear glued onto the plot. The plot is convoluted, and feels like something written by a committee... a committee of SoCal narcissites that met at a poolside suare and drank too much white wine.

373,LOTPMaster,One movie that actually showed love and horror/violence,3,2 April 2007,"Basically, I can sum this movie up in one word. Weird. It is definitely not for the faint hearted. Now, I don't say this because it's gruesome. I say it because, it's, very showy. It depicts children being encased in webbing and swallowed alive by horses (very disturbing image). There are also many cases when it actually shows people being stabbed in the heart. Also, this movie has an interesting plot. It's very hard to follow because half the time you can't even understand what the people are saying. I mean you can piece the plot together easily enough but you can't actually get the entire thing. Jonathan Pryce's performance was well done yet I honestly didn't understand a word he said. This is because he was speaking in a heavy French accent and very softly. This is the same with other actors in the movie.And as far as a summary goes: what I got out of the movie is that two brothers, William and Jacob Grimm, are con artists. And, as punishment for their crimes they are sent to find the 10 missing girls. Somewhere along the way they fall into a fairy tale and have to battle their way through a bedtime story and get back to a reality they know and love.Finally, while I thought this movie was weird and depressing, it did have some interesting twists that kept me entertained. All the way throughout the film, stories like 'hansel and Gretel', 'sleeping beauty', and 'repunzal' were tossed it. I enjoyed looking for these little things and seeing how they were incorporated into this film.Over all, a good movie. It was well made (with a few animation errors), it kept me entertained. It shows both sides to movies, horror/violence and love. That is what makes a movie. And that was what made this movie great.",The Brothers Grimm

378,stumblebum-1,What a piece of utter garbage,1,1 February 2008,"I don't see many movies at the theater, preferring to wait for home video. This one I missed, but I've noticed a few times that it's been on TV, and the scenes I saw looked OK.I finally got a chance to watch the whole thing on a borrowed DVD, and I wish I had the time back.I wasn't looking for Disney here, I wanted something darker, but this is simply trash. The acting was terrible, the special effects forgettable, and whoever wrote this pile of dung should be shot.I've even seen some idiotic reviews here that claim that it will be better on the DVD, with Terry Gilliam's ""brilliance"" unleashed. Well, I can only feel sorry for those who spent actual cash to see this turkey.In the past, Terry Gilliam has been known to produce monumental flops like ""Baron Muenchausen"" and ""Time Bandits"", and this one is unquestionably a worse movie. It looks like this one actually made up for it by making some money, so maybe Terry Gilliam can spend the cash he made on this to produce his next piece of garbage without ""interference"" from a studio. If the studio wanted to do some real interference here, they should have simply canned this project as soon as they saw the first dailies.",The Brothers Grimm
379,JamieDurrant,Beautifully shot fairytale.,8,12 October 2005,"Whilst I was watching this film, I was reminded of 'The Singing Ringing Tree', a cult 60's German film made in East Germany in 1958. It has this otherworldly appeal which is both familiar and frightening. The lighting, cinematography and the dark, twisted play on established fairy tales will help enormously to place this as a film as another one of Terry Gilliam's classic movies.The sequence where a child is splattered with mud by a drowning crow, only to discover she has not only wiped away the mud from her face, but also her own features leaving a blank, expressionless face is genuinely horrifying ! As with all Gilliam's films, the attention to detail in the sets and the effects is second to none. Layer upon layer of grime, insects, debris and general decay abound in every scene.Definitely recommended !",The Brothers Grimm
380,prase007007,Worth Watching,7,20 May 2010,"When I first heard about this movie I thought it would be worth a try....well, it did not disappoint me. It isn't very much a director loving film, it is a flick with good comedy, thriller, star cast with some extra juice in it. Matt and Heath have put up a great show with some extra special effects and it may not suit children, as there are dark humors in plenty of scenes. Overall Terry has done a splendid job to maintain the fun and thriller throughout the movie and given a good touch to the romance with Lena.In short, you will love the movie if you are just after a good comedy flick with some thriller and star cast and if you are not too perfectionist as a cinema lover.",The Brothers Grimm

I don't know how this slipped past the people who are supposed to stop things that suck from hitting the big screen, but regrettably it did. This movie failed in so many ways. The writing and acting are atrocious. The film fumbles as it tries to decide what mood it wants to establish. Is this farce comedy, should we feel genuinely empathetic with these characters (enough with the blasted magic beans!). This was Hollywood film-making it its worst. And not its big explosion no plot worst but simply its bad storytelling worst. Don't make the mistake of seeing this.",The Brothers Grimm
382,Gelsomina629,Pleasingly Grimm,8,12 September 2005,"General criticism seems to be a bit unkind to this film. I liked it very much. I loved the interweaving of the Grimm stories with the narrative trope of the brothers being a cynical theatrical group that pretended to solve the superstitious problems of small town people, until they are confronted with actual magical forces. The film is clever, funny and scary. There is a note on IMDb, as a goof, that the Brahms lullaby is used as a leitmotif, even though Brahams lived later. I think this is a petulant comment. The leitmotif is brilliantly used, even in the hum of the insects. I'm sure it is there to remind us Anglo-viewers of our cribs, and makes an excellently creepy effect. In all, I would say this is a pleasing and imaginative film. I'm sorry if critics would give Terry Gilliam short shrift, as he is a unique filmmaker, with an unusual voice. Like the film, or don't, but, he should be encouraged to continue making films in his voice.",The Brothers Grimm

I went to go see it today and I found the experience to be an enjoyable one. My only gripe with the movie was that I felt the characters from the fairy tales were thrown in a bit haphazardly, but I suppose it was okay. The comedy within it was great, I found myself laughing quite a bit. I liked how it was shot, it wasn't over the top with visual effects because it didn't need to be. I didn't like how there wasn't an overall plot... but it didn't need one to be entertaining. I would recommend this movie to other movie-goers.

Of course it isn't one of Terry Gilliams best movies (compared to Time Bandits, Brazil, Fisher King or 12 monkeys..)and it's obvious that the production company has tried to restrain him - but you can still see his handy work in a lesser more subtle way..the crazy characters, the mud & filth and the tilting houses of the village...and of course the ever lasting theme of the human fantasy/imagination in conflict with strict authority and rationality.I expected peter Stormare to act crazy so it didn't bother me at all..Go and see it..it's worthwhile",The Brothers Grimm

This was another Van Helsing, though Van Helsing was actually better, believe it or not. Without giving away any spoilers I will merely say that this wasn't a bad movie, but it sure wasn't a good one either. I love Heath Ledger and Matt Damon in many of their movies ... The Bourne movies, The Four Feathers,Oceans 11, Good Will Hunting , etc. This is one of those ones you can recommend people to rent, but not to buy, but still better than being one of those movies you can't recommend under any circumstances ( Gigli comes to mind) Kind of like for me Gladiator is one to buy and Alexander one to rent . It was a likable movie and never dragged or was boring, but at the same time you got the feeling like it could have been so much more but somehow fell short. The setting was great, the acting par, but the story lacking . The same can be said for Van Helsing which had 2 of my favorite actors Hugh Jackman ( who we all love as Wolverine ) and Kate Beckensdale whole I loved in Underworld. But just like the brothers Grimm that one has a nice setting, great actors but crappy follow through . If given a choice, I would recommend you see Red Eye or The 40 Year Old virgin instead . Overall I give this one a C + .",The Brothers Grimm

I thought he did an excellent job or portraying the ""storyteller"" or dreamer, and Matt Damon as the scientific money making propositioner. The props were and animation was wonderful. I do feel that the insert of the fairy tales, such as Litt Red Riding Hood and others, could have been better, but over all the movie was extremely enjoyable and I will be the first at Walmart to get the DVD.

You have to give it a chance. I actually enjoyed the characters, especially Heath Ledger's Jacob.Yes, the plot was sort of predictable, but how many movies don't have some predictability? My complaints, however. The opening scene should have played a bigger role on later events, instead of Will just spontaneously yelling ""Beans!"" at Jake. Their sister should have been mentioned more than once. Also, they really ought to have gotten rid of the French. It was annoying and unnecessary to have them just running around, always obstructing the plot line.It's not a magnificent movie and leaves you feeling like it's not really complete, but you should give it a chance.

Despite a soundtrack that occasionally wants to overwhelm the dialogue, and some anachronistic tendencies, the film is Gilliam's best since Baron Munchhausen. Damon and Ledger are, surprisingly, well-matched and equally excellent in their roles as the realist and the fanciful heroes, Gilliam's oft-reworked themes. The female leads are both excellent, and the environment correctly (and not as so many reviewers complained, overtly) dark. This is a Grimms for the ages!",The Brothers Grimm

I'm not a big fan of his, so coming from me, that is a total compliment. I was sitting there the whole time not believing it was him! Heath Ledger is great too.

He was really able to pull off being the naive younger brother. And the beginning was definitely heartbreaking. It really pulled off putting fairy tales into reality! It brings out the kid in all of us. The special effects were really great. And I loved how it added in some gore too. I loved this movie from start to finish, and I will be seeing it again.

At least the Mummy series were more entertaining.Besides Monica Belucci's stunning beauty, the Brothers Grimm is a big failure. The director started out with the good material that could have been interesting; there's a good deal of twist that could've been fun.

394,lanzar-1,Grimm better than critics say it is,8,28 August 2005,"All: I saw Brothers Grimm today and after seeing the film and reading several critics' reviews I have to say that the movie is better than the critics say it is. The critics are complaining that the film bounces around with no clear direction. OK, so it does. But this IS a Terry Gilliam film, after all. What exactly were the critics expecting? Linearity? The IMDb lists the ""genre"" of this film as "" Adventure / Comedy / Fantasy / Horror / Thriller."" Sometimes two or three of these are going on at the same time, actually. That is exactly what makes this movie lots of fun and exciting to watch.I had the opportunity to attend an interview with Terry Gilliam at the 2004 Toronto Film Festival. Yes, Mr. Gilliam is as odd in person as people say he is, but also has that definite air of brilliance about him. And he makes odd and brilliant films. So just go with it, I say.Bob Weinstein, being HIMSELF, didn't just go with it. According to the entertainment sheets Mr. Weinstein had Terry Gilliam's long-time cinematographer, Nicola Pecorini, replaced after six weeks of shooting (he's still in the credits under ""additional photography by..."") and he also hand-picked the leading actress, Lena Headey (she is actually good in the role) over Samantha Morton. I can only imagine that this would have been an even better film without Bob Weinstein's fingerprints on it.Anyway, just go see it.Lanzar1",The Brothers Grimm

I kept waiting for his old pal Ben Affleck to show up and let us all in on the joke. Ledger was just forgettable.

I love Terry Gilliam movies, so I was excited to see this, but there is very little Terry Gilliam-like about this film. The jokes (although constantly attempted) are never funny, and the script in general needs some serious help. The movie starts out well enough with the Brothers Grimm as con-artists, duping townspeople into paying a small fortune to have a witch vanquished. It could have been a very good movie if it continued along this path. Instead, it degenerates into a plot of loosely thrown together bits of fairy tails and amateurish acting. The whole tough-girl-who-knows-what-she's-doing-but-still-needs-to-be-rescued thing with ""the Cursed"" is so played out and tired that it's almost sad. And the townspeople call her ""the Cursed"" because her father and sisters were killed? That hardly warrants spitting after saying her name (another tired joke)!!! The worst is saved for last with a happy ending that is SO not out of a Grimm fairy tale. It makes you wonder... has anyone working on this movie actually read any of the Brother's Grimm's work?

They slaughtered the kitten, it is obvious that the kitten was not harmed in real life, it was all made by digital effects, then who cares? It was just made to be funny, but what sickens me is the whole idea of making fun of such vile act, killing for fun an animal is NEVER a fun topic, it should not be, and the only thing that that scenes makes, is to encourage people to keep thinking animal abuse is something to laugh about, I really detested this movie for such stupid idea of fun, and anyone making fun of it should think of the background behind the act.",The Brothers Grimm
400,dave-1424,Grows like a fungus!,9,29 August 2005,"I have been a Gilliam fan since I first saw Munchausen so it comes as no surprise that Brothers Grimm (being the first film he's directed since 1998's Fear and Loathing) was one of my most hotly anticipated films. Walking into the theater with hefty expectations is a recipe for disaster and as such I was initially disappointed by what the Brothers Grimm had to offer; hokey lines and dorky concepts. However, along with the childish and all-too-passé bits a fair amount of explicit violence, gore and adult imagery. A layman might say this is the hallmark of a schizophrenic feature film; a genre just out of reach and unsure of what exactly it's trying to say, but upon further assessment I realized that it is precisely this eclectic style that makes the real Brothers Grimm stories as great as they are. Violence and depression run rampant and hand-in-hand with child themes. Now I need to see it again to really watch it for what it is and not for what I expected it to be.Beyond that it must be remembered that Ehren Kruger, the 'genius' (sarcasm intended) behind the tour-du-force that was Reindeer Games, was the screen writer. Terry Gilliam added the wonderful Gilliam touch to what was undoubtedly a fairly so-so Hollywood screenplay.",The Brothers Grimm

I guess this serves to remind us why movie critics do what they do - they couldn't get jobs doing anything else!It did come across as a bit anti-French - who are now the epitome of all things 'cultured', anti-American and socialist - so maybe that is why the critics hated it. But it is an excellent movie. One is captivated from start to finish.I went into this as open minded as I could. True, Terry Gilliam gave us all Time Bandits and Brazil, and for those accomplishments alone when he dies he will go to movie heaven and become a legend.

But I do have some comments about some of the critics writing that The Brothers Grimm had a ""muddled plot"", as well as being too exhausting for Roger Ebert to watch. He didn't even get the year it takes place right. I feel as if movies are watched lazily; too much sophistication renders some people lost on the subjects shown. Unless it's about gay cowboys eating pudding. (See South Park, Season2, Episode 9 Ang Lee). The Brothers Grimm was complete fun to watch. I was really trying to see what the critics hated. I couldn't find the flaws. I loved the fact that so much was happening on the screen at once. Maybe one must have a higher degree of perception to keep up with Terry Gilliam's hyper-storytelling skills. For me, the plot flowed smooth. I caught all the comical nuances. I was very entertained.

Sure it was not the best movie to come out this year, and I have read some pretty dodgy reviews, but it wasn't all bad. The dialogue fell a little flat in some areas - and towards the end there were a few too many try-hard funny lines, but for most of the film, it was witty and well written. I thought the acting was well done. The general was superbly evil in a sweet kind of way, and his goony side-kick was a brilliant, bumbling bully.The story plot was well done, although there were a few vacant spots in the middle. The big example for me was when the general recruits the Grimm brothers - I missed WHY he was hiring them and so when it was commented on again later in the film, I didn't follow. But I loved the ending, and the sly references to more Grimm fairy-tales then I could count! The special effects were perfect. They seemed childish, and a little unreal, but for me this just added to the whole appeal of the film - it really is based on children's stories.So overall, I thought this film was pretty good - a little dodgy in some areas, but still pretty good. But then again, how could a film with Matt Damon and Heath Ledger not be pretty good?!!",The Brothers Grimm
406,pobox32n,Great Fun,8,21 December 2005,"First, Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm isn't for everyone. To fully appreciate the film you must have a particularly twisted sense of humor. If you find the following things funny, this movie is for you:1. A cat getting chopped to bits by a fan.2. A young child being eaten by a horse.3. A young child feeling sympathy for a dead crow he pulls up from the bottom of a well, just before the crow springs to life and throws mud in the child's face.To many, these things are gruesome and disturbing. To others, however, these events are absolutely hilarious. If you belong in the latter group go buy this movie right now, because this kind of thing doesn't come along very often.I should also note that this movie only becomes better with repeated viewings. The first time around you may find that it has a few good chuckles but is far from being a constant barrel of laughs. When you see it again, however, you will begin to notice things you never did before. This is the genius of Gilliam. Most of the humor in this movie happens behind the actions of the main characters. Especially while our heroes are engaged in a dramatic scene or are discussing philosophy. This juxtaposition adds a sort of depth to the humor that you don't get in most Hollywood Comedies.This brings me to somethings else you should know about Grimm: this is a Fantasy-Comedy, not an Adventure Film. If you come expecting Indiana Jones you will be grossly disappointed. There a few good sequences of good action and adventure, but not enough to carry you through a 2 hour running time by their merits alone. Nor is this a Horror Movie. Although there are a few creepy scenes, you won't find anything in here that will keep you awake at night (although I still wouldn't show this to kids under 10).Bottom line: this movie is grossly misunderstood by many people. It is primarily a twisted comedy, just like the original fairy tales from which this is based on. And just like those fairy tales, it does have action and scares, but not enough to simply define this as an Adventure or Horror movie. I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate the humor, or can at least stomach it, and is able to accept a film by its own merits, not by the predetermined associations given by the marketing campaign.I give this film an 8 out of 10",The Brothers Grimm
407,Aries257,WOW this movie is bad. Sorry.,2,26 August 2005,"I really thought this movie was going to be good. Matt Damon is an extremely talented actor/writer and I always love Heath Ledger. They do have very good chemistry as the brothers Grimm, but their noble efforts were not nearly enough to compensate for the rest of this film. I firmly believe anyone who honestly thinks this was a quality movie is either blinded by love for one or both of the main actors or just has terrible, shallow taste in movies. I'm not the kind of person who just walks out of theaters, but this was an awfully close call.Script = abominable. It's difficult to develop any empathy for any character because nothing can be taken seriously. As there was very little character development--one short opening scene serving as the entire background of the Grimms' relationship--lines that could have been very poignant were huge, laughable nothings.Cinematography = eh. Nothing impressive. There was only one laudable shot that I noticed; most were full of bad CGI. There was none of this ""dark beauty"" people talk about. References to well-known fairy tales were brief and basically added nothing to the movie or my interest in it. Continuity also seemed a bit of a problem, as one character suddenly reappears after she was supposed to have been abducted into the woods. I'd say it might be a mistake on my part, but the rest of my little company was just as baffled.Humor = nonexistent or painful. Okay, there might have been a few genuinely amusing occasions. Very few. There were certain parts which I THINK were supposed to be funny... they were not. Embarrassingly not. As long as we're on the embarrassing and painful tangent, I'll mention the accents. Matt Damon and Heath Ledger--two thumbs up. As for the others, well, I'd honestly rather listen to fingernails grating on a blackboard for 2 or 3 hours than to Jonathan Pryce's French accent. The entire movie was full of stereotypes, overacting, and... not-funniness. Oh yeah, and my favorite part-- using the brutal death of an animal as the butt of a joke! Real cute, guys.There was ONE redeeming scene in this film, and that's not because it was good, but because it was so bad it was absolutely hysterical. All I'll say is this: Gingerbread Man. I honestly don't think I've ever laughed harder. So if you want to see something 100% ridiculous, by all means see this movie. That's really all it's good for. Please, save your money, spend it on ANYTHING ELSE.",The Brothers Grimm
408,micahjw,DO NOT see this movie,2,27 August 2005,"Why? This is one of those movies with a deceptive trailer. There are a couple of funny moments and lines in the trailer which make you think the movie might have more, but no. That's it unfortunately for this film, the funny lines in the trailer were the only funny parts in the movie. Very disappointing since Damon and Ledger are such excellent actors. Also, Peter Scomare is extremely annoying as Calvaldi. The plot is ridiculous, at times sickening and grotesque, not entertaining, too predictable, too dark and evil and just plain not very good. Definitely not for kids. If you enjoy horror movies AND silly shallow plots, then yes, this movie is for you.",The Brothers Grimm

The horrible, terrible reviews from every movie website you can think of, including the likes of sites like Yahoo and MSN. Did I let that stop me? Well, almost, but not quite. As it turned out, I thought the flick was pretty entertaining.

This is a mixture of fairy tales -- folk tales to be exact -- and even a not so bright watcher can spot several known motives, twisted and turned as if in a weird looking glass.There is Red Riding Hood (Cape!), the wolf, the sleeping beauty (beauties), the evil queen, the Rapuncel and Hans and Grettel. And many more, naturally. The brothers Grimm, making their living of hoax and fraud, have to come face to face with untamed magic, something they used for their scams, but never truly believed in.A fairy tale convention is efficiently used to bring together most known folk tales -- and those known only to a few. And for those of you who squirm and say there is far too much cruelty and brutal scenes in this movie -- read a true Grimm fairy tale. Not a version adapted for kids. There is slicing, there is dicing, there is decapitation and all other sorts of cruelties inflicted... Trust me, the movie is mild.",The Brothers Grimm
411,hahaufelldown,Fun Time,10,26 August 2005,"Let's be honest not any Oscar-darling or anything but surely a really good time. Not Gilliam's best but definitely good. A Touch of Monty Python humor (OK not quite as crude or witty but still funny), meets a Lord of the Rings type surrounding.Matt Damon who is believable as the womanizing Will Grimm, and Heath Ledger (who has had constant flops in the past few years) is lovable as the clumsy Jake Grimm. I'm glad for Ledger too who actually did this film justice, good for him. As for Damon he's a great actor anyway, but he does good with his accent, considering he's from Boston.The plot can get confusing at times but nothing really that gets you lost or thats to hard to track whats happening. Either way it's so worth an 12$ ticket fee to go see this movie.",The Brothers Grimm

'The Brothers Grimm' is a brilliant film, with amazing special effects and attention to detail, setting fairy-tale fantasy next to bloody realism, and (in the opinion of this viewer) none too long at 118 minutes. But having been a fan of Gilliam's work since my childhood, I was not at all surprised that there was also stomach-curdling horror, moments of sheer horribleness, familiar stories turned on their heads, and nothing predictable. For example: the story is set in war-torn Europe, but in French-occupied Germany (during the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century) rather than in the familiar German-occupied France in the 20th century. There are scenes of great beauty and a fine musical accompaniment; there are sequences that are entirely appropriate (trees that move when you're not looking? Of course!) and there are also moments that most viewers would prefer to forget. But remember that it's a fairy tale, and that's what fairy tales are like. My son says that although he enjoyed the film he is in no hurry to watch it again; but I could watch it again and again and again ...",The Brothers Grimm
413,Barachan22,A Summer of Craptastic Movies...And Now For Something Completely Different.,9,18 January 2006,"What I can add to the previous praise of this film, is to make a short comment on the performances of Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. As Director Terry Gilliam admits himself, this movie is chock full of plot and ideas. Each scene is saturated with intricate detail. For such a project to work well, it needs strong performances from every cast member. This was especially true with the fraternal connection Damon and Ledger were able to create. Damon plays Will, the older and more realistic of the Grimm brothers. A delightfully dramatic con-artist, Will nevertheless endears himself to the audience in his obvious love for and complete commitment to protecting his younger,eccentric brother, Jacob (Ledger). The opening scene cuts straight to the core of the brothers' relationship. Using the story of 'Jack and the Beanstalk', we see a young Will and his mother tending his fatally ill baby sister in their poor home. Will reassures his distraught mother that Jake would be back soon with a doctor, who's services would be paid for by the proceeds of selling the family cow. When a euphoric Jake returns, bearing magic beans instead of money or a physician, totally convinced that magic will cure his sister and make them all live 'happily ever after', Will erupts in a Pythonic display violence which is oddly appropriate in its comedic tenor in the midst of a tragedy. The tension between Will and Jake throughout the rest of the film stems from the trauma each brother received from the even. At first glance, Will appears to be a controlling, domineering bully who fails to give his younger brother any respect. Jake might seem completely consumed by fairy tales and fantasy. But the 'magic' of this film is how,without words, Damon and Ledger are able to convey the inner demons driving their behavior. Will's tone and body language in his constant critical invective of 'beans Jake, beans"", his silent anger that bubbles under the surface when Jake promises to bring Angelica's sisters back alive, each are subtle evidence of his fear Jake's naiveté will get him killed. Likewise, with the emotion Ledger loads into Jake's line ""I need to do this, its not beans, Will"" shows use part of Jake's obsessive investigations of folk stories is to atone for causing the death of their sister and to prove both to himself and to Will he's not crazy to believe.I could go on even longer about the subtle grace of their acting, but I'll stop now before my rambling gets in the way of your enjoyment. Watch this movie, several times if possible, and take a moment to observe the high caliber performances going on underneath the nifty special effects.",The Brothers Grimm
414,jandsdoss,Not a bad movie....fun to watch.,8,27 August 2005,I saw the film last night. The special affects are stunning. Visually the film is great. The story starts off strong. After the beginning however it is well into the film before the story picks back up. You do not really understand why the children are being taken until about an hour and a half into the film. The music was fantastic and I loved how bits and pieces of nursery rhymes were added to the score. Don't expect an Oscar film but it is an enjoyable watch.Matt Damon and Heath Ledger work well together on the screen. The French sidekick does become annoying but redeems himself at the end with a comedic laughs. Both female costars play their characters well. No Oscar performances but like a said above the film is fun to watch.,The Brothers Grimm

Take a movie that was in dire straits to begin with, a director who by his 0wn admission is notorious, and producers whose pulse stopping hands on attitudes/constraints and shake well. Sounds like di saster to me.But for my money Terry Gilliam pulls this movie off.I liked Damon & Ledgers performances. The graphics/cinematography were great, and everything I like in a Terry Gilliam flick.Yes it's dark,but it is a grim fairy tale by it's very definition.

I believe I will wait to see it and hope the DVD is wonderful! Does anyone have a word on info to do with this thought? By the way, no one has spoken a word about Monica Belluci's role in this! How was it? and Why was it so awful? Just because it was slow, or unfunny? On the other hand...according to others.. Why was it so great? Let me know (and all other people) still trying to decide on this movie... Oh, and just an opinion before even seeing it... Could Tim Burton not have done a better job with material like this?

I was forcing myself to laugh at jokes. Matt Damon was doing okay, but Heath Ledger wasn't even trying to be funny, or even trying to be in character. I never really cared for the Monty Python movies, which this film was set in the same time period as Holy Grail, so if you love those films maybe you will feel differently. But my gosh, I highly do not recommended this film to anyone. Worst Film this year. It goes down with Gosford Park, which I think is the worst film ever made.

The whole time watching it you will feel like it could break into greatness, but then comes another line that makes you cringe. If they couldn't find an adequate way of making a lighthearted aspect to this tale, it would have worked wonderfully as a more serious film. It does well when it takes itself seriously. Still easy to recommend, but would be even better if you could watch the film with no dialog...If nothing else I hope this film will do well enough to allow Gilliam more freedom to create what he wants in the future.",The Brothers Grimm

I rented this film because I thought it would be a fun adventurous story, not a butchering of rabbits, horses, and kitty cats (killing the kitten is when I turned if off). This movie made me sick. Yes, physically ill. If I wanted to watch that kind of stuff I could rent Faces of Death or Tintorera (which is worse because REAL animals are actually killed). The thing that bothered me the most about these animal murders is that they weren't even necessary to the plot. And the fact that they are used for comedy is mortifying.

The plot was pretty obvious even though I believe parts of it were meant to be a surprise.The special effects in this movie were decent enough to make it worth your $10 to see it at the movie theater. This movie is a far cry from being the best that we have seen Heath Ledger or Matt Damon in. I think I would much rather have seen A knight's tale again.

But, boy, I love the interpretation.Maybe, for those 'serious movie watcher' that note down every plot and logic and reality in a movie, this is an awful movie. But remember, this is a fairy tale. A dark an interesting one.I sit back and absorbed into the fairy tale-ish world of this movie. I let the not-so-logical moments away, just for the fantasy feeling. It's how they mix the real world and the fantasy world, that absorbs me. And there come the fairy tales cameos. Little red riding hood, Hans and Gretel, Cinderella, sleeping beauty, gingerbread man, enough to evoke the memory of my childhood, and mix it with the memory of the adult me, clashing it like the way Will and Jacob clash. My point is, watch this movie with a light hearted mood, and wide open mind. And enjoy the fairy tale",The Brothers Grimm
423,matthewUK,grim,1,17 November 2005,"this is such an awful movie that it doesn't even motivate me to write a detailed review about it. This movie is a feast of absolutely horrible acting to begin with. It's soooo bad it makes you feel awkward just watching. The only exceptions are the women actually. Lena Headey as Angelika and Monica Belluci as the evil queen seem quite confident and deliver a good performance, actually they seem like academy award winners by comparison with the rest of the cast. Peter Stormare is sooo bad in every way that I wouldn't know where to begin my criticism whereas Jonathan Pryce is laughable, and not in the way he intended it to be. Damon and Heath look like they should be on second hand circus somewhere as amateur clowns for very young children. just awful. There another feast in this movie: that of extremely bad accents. it's almost offensive to pretty much everyone: italians, Germans, french, British...sheesh! don't know which accent was the worst portrayed. the script is almost revolting. The writer actually have the guts to turn real historic figures, intellectuals who made a big mark in history , into con artists!! That's the premise. need I say more? I suppose one could look at it as a no-brainer computer graphics feast and try to enjoy it that way, but unfortunately it doesn't even deliver in that sense. the graphics are nothing spectacular except for a few scenes here and there which were well done. In fact, I think the best effect really is the evil queen's make up which from what I've seen this year so far does deserve at least a make-up nomination in the awards.In short, this movie is a feast...of really bad food and will cause you indigestion depending on the price you have to pay for you ticket and popcorn!",The Brothers Grimm
424,Nobula,The little director that couldn't...,1,27 August 2005,"The Brother's Grimm is no fairytale. This film (as released) is one of the most disappointing and painful experiences I've had to endure. It was Shrek without the wit. What we have, instead, is the tale of a Studio's might stamping out the passionate flames of a brilliant director.Terry is plagued by rotten luck when it comes to shooting a film or even getting one released. This bad luck has also cost him the clout needed to maintain creative control. Without that control, the film manages to break through the guard rails of good storytelling and plunges into the abyss of mediocrity. I am a long-time and die-hard fan of Gilliam's work. I consider him to be a cinematic visionary and a master of wonder. All of his films bring a heart, warmth and depth outdone only by their lush characters and deep visualsexcept this one.If there was something to be salvaged from this poorly cobbled script, I honestly believe Terry did it. I also believe that what magic Mr. Gilliam may have weaved was lost on the studio's cutting room floor. In Hollywood, most tales are interchangeable and generic enough that you can rewrite, slice, dice and splice them together many different ways and get wholly different films from the same footage. Not so with Terry's workmachinations so intricate that removing a scene, requiring him to change some dialog or simply asking if the 'tone' of the piece be altered can bring down the entire house of cards.I hope that Gilliam will be allowed to re-cut the film for it's DVD release. Perhaps then I'll be able to see how much he was able to accomplish with the little room (or script) he was given. I don't blame Gilliam. I blame the studio. It is painfully obvious which scenes were battles lost and where fragments of soul were blindly removed from the story. That the man continues to try and tell enchanting tales in the cold hard reality of the Hollywood machine commands nothing less than awe from meDon Quixote could not have appointed a better spiritual successor.I'm not going to discuss the film as I don't think we've seen it yetjust a faded shadow of what Terry Gilliam intended.",The Brothers Grimm
425,landstander24,Gilliam and Grimm,7,27 August 2005,"Just what you'd expect from Terry Gilliam, a uniquely bizarre tale entwined with humor bordering on the absurd. Like Burton, Gilliam has a style that's truly his own. You either love and embrace it, or you hate it and wish they gave refunds for having to sit through something so weird. I personally love the direction Gilliam has done since his Monty Python days, and his latest is no exception. Brothers Grimm is a tale of two traveling brothers named Grimm, who con superstitious townsfolk with theatrics and timing. From the very beginning you see each of the brothers motivation. One is trying to right a mistake made as a child, to find some truth behind mystery and magic. The other has his feet firmly planted in reality and logic, and feels a personal duty to separate fools from their money. Heath Ledger and Matt Damon play these roles surprisingly well, especially when considering the difficult task of delivering Gilliam's brand of humor to the screen. Though the best at doing this was Peter Stormare. As memorable as his performance in Fargo, and completely at the other end of the acting spectrum. A darkly amusing fantasy worth your ten dollars. Perfectly paced and wonderfully acted, it's a visual work of art with only a couple scenes of imperfect computer graphics. The writing is the true gem, blending in all the classic fairytale's of childhood. Enjoy it for what it is, and might I suggest not bringing your eight year old child. It's PG-13 for a reason.",The Brothers Grimm

Terry Gilliam must have had a grudge against the producers of this movie, and quite probably against the actors. Usually his work is interesting and above par, but this movie was boring...boring.

Up until the encounter with the French general, I had little idea of what was happening in the story. However, as the Grimms set out on their quest (to find missing children and in turn save their own lives), the story does get far more interesting. The cinematography, I must admit, is brilliant. The sets were fantastic. Just looking at the film made me want to continue because it was so beautifully done; I have a feeling this film would be an artist's dream. It was an incredibly creative writing job, though parts of the plot were a bit clumsy in the beginning. It is inadvisable to watch this movie if you don't have some comprehension of various fairy tales. Fairy tales are tied together beautifully, with some incredibly haunting lines, good reoccurring themes, and fantastic (although rather disturbing) images.

I thought they did a good job casting the movie also. The make-up artist should get an award, it can't be easy making both Damon and Ledger look that unattractive.

It really saddens me to see all the people trashing this movie, even though, I was sitting in the theatre thinking 'this movie is going to be so very under apreciated. And I was right.Personally, I enjoyed this movie very much as it had everything I like, witty dialog, quirky characters, beautiful costumes, rich set design and lovely cinematography. I thought the pacing was just right, I didn't look at my watch once during the movie. I laughed (mostly at Cavaldi), I was spooked (mainly by the creepy gingerbread man scene) and I thought 'what a wonderful movie to write fan-fiction for'.I can understand why a lot of people didn't like it. It was fantasy, but it wasn't epic, and it didn't deal with big, or weighty themes, the was Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter did/do. Despite being dark, the movie was a very 'fluffy' movie, it aimed to entertain, not to teach, which is probably why I enjoyed it so much. I may get hanged for saying this, but the movie reminded me a lot of 'The Princess Bride' only a little bit better and fresher.Yes, the characters were archetypal, but, at least In my way of thinking, they weren't stereotypical. Yes you had the brash, good looking thief, the dreamy and fretful scholar, the wild and beautiful amazon, the half-crazed comedy bad guy, but they were all well portrayed, and and done without taking themselves too seriously, but without being directly satirical of themselves.I think this movie understood what it was, and didn't try to be, or pretend to be anything else. It was a well written, well acted, well directed escapist fantasy, that aimed itself at adolescents and adults who haven't lost themselves to cynicism and fairy tales.This movie was for the Jacob Grimms of the world, and I'm proud to say I loved this movie!",The Brothers Grimm
431,luke_david_brown,Heads up,3,21 March 2006,"I would like to begin by saying that The Brothers Grimm looks absolutely fantastic. Whilst the cgi effects are laughable, the overall look of the film is Gilliams saving grace. Apart from this I found the film to be a sorry mess that descends into farce long before the credits roll. The plot is pretty much non existent. Whilst it hints at good things with the integration of various fairy tales, it rarely uses this concept to good effect. What we are left with is a series of chaotic scenes, some of which seem both confusing and self indulgent. (The mud monster being a prime example of this) The characterisation is even worse. Damon and Ledger are truly awful throughout but Ledger just about comes off worse with his lame portrayal of a bumbling idiot causing me to cringe whenever he was on screen. The attempts at humour are just as bad and the movie can never seem to find a consistent tone. This felt like the longest 114 minutes I have ever sat through, mostly because I did not have a clue what was going on half the time. I was bored and confused and just wanted the whole sorry charade to end. I do not doubt Gilliams talent as a Film Maker but in this case he should have displayed greater discipline or at least provided us with a coherent storyline. Truly, truly awful.",The Brothers Grimm
432,twain237,Very Clever,8,27 August 2005,"I hold Terry Gilliam as one of my most favorite directors, his style and visual sense is fantastic.Now I will say that The Brothers Grimm feels a lot like Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow, a very clever take on children's fairy tales, but Gilliam brings a lot of his own style to this marvelous film.Now mind you, I have seen all of Gilliams films and they are all unique like the man himself. I would compair this film to The Fisher King, a very good film that is unlike Gillam but has his stamp all over it.I found it very clever how the story gave references to stories like Red Riding Hood, Sleeping Beauty, Hanzel and Gretel, The Gingerbread Man and Cinderella.The visual effects were very good and I found the acting was done quite well.I saw this film in a theatre of mixed ethnicity, sexes and ages.

433,black_rabbit85,Critics suck,8,28 August 2005,"For some reason the critics have panned this movie as schlock and I really can't see why. Every element that has ever been criticized was actually the complete opposite to me. The acting was extremely good, with Heath Ledger actually standing out, which is really surprising that this is the same person that starred in Knight's Tale. Matt Damon did respectably as well, and Jonathan Pryce and Peter Stormare did excellent character work.The story wasn't really amazing, but probably because it contained bits of all-too-familiar themes within the actual Brothers Grimm fairy tales that might affect your judgment.The script was brilliant. The dialogue was just hysterical and I wish I could provide an example without giving it away.The imagery was beautiful as well. Examples like when Red Riding Hood walks through the forest, her cape glows against the trees or the landscapes of the German villages the Grimm Brothers go through... It produces a dramatic use of color that hearkens to the lushness of Girl With a Pearl Earring.My only complaint, which is very small, was that the CGI wasn't really very good. The frequent budget cuts in this film and discord with the distributor probably made that, the final touches of the film, suffer. It isn't insufferable, but you can tell the effects are dated.Overall, it's a brilliant film. Ignore the critics. It's just as good if not better than Baron Munchausen and Time Bandits, and follows the legacy of each so well.",The Brothers Grimm
434,sjsgf7,"Fresh, Intriguing, and Very Compelling",10,27 August 2005,"Though I fail to understand why it is that this movie has a mere 5 out of 10 right now: {begin sarcasm} I can certainly understand how the American public at large dislikes an original plot with interesting characters and compelling screen action. {end sarcasm} However, to be serious, one movie-goer in front of me was so enthralled by the film that she noted to her husband after the movie that she thought she might be having her baby a little early but she didn't want to miss the movie (needless to say, she only got the last part in as he made an exclamation and rushed her out of the theater and through the general hustle and bustle).This movie is undoubtedly one of the most original and farthest from standard clichés that I have seen in quite some time. While it may not follow the original stories exactly, this is a beautifully done interpretation of the story and I cannot recommend it enough (especially if you have found yourself growing tired of the general drool we have been getting lately with a few notable exceptions in recent months). The acting is superb although the film's humor tends to be on the dark side (though the humor is never obscene or idiotic as is common these days) and you can easily get the impression that Pryce is enjoying his role in the film just a bit too much. Damon is a real surprise and brings some much needed life and flavor to the screen seemingly at all the right times. You really get attached to the characters without any drawn-out drama clouding up the movie's atmosphere.I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone as it really is a must see if for nothing else than the fact that it stands out as movie with something to offer for everyone in a family. The movie is pretty intense and the plot line is not predictable or abstract, but displays a continuity you can seldom find in movies with any kind of action in them. It seems action flicks have become scatterbrained and only strive for slow-motion shots of their actors racking up cool points as they blow baddies away.Horror, drama, action and all: this movie is one for all.",The Brothers Grimm
435,mcnuttju,Corny,4,2 September 2005,"The movie could have had potential, but instead got worse and worse and more corny throughout the film. There was also no attention paid to detail in this film. The French had French accented English, but the Germans in the film had a sort of British/Aussie accent going on that ruined any sort of hope for authenticity. I understand German accents are hard to form and so in that case no accents should have been used by anyone in the movie. Other authenticity issues are as follows: if I am not mistaken, The Brothers Grimm wrote their stories about the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) and not some forest in Bavaria, as the film stated. Secondly, the Brothers actually lived in Marburg and the film suggests that they only visited there. I understand that the movie is meant to be a ""tale,"" but if you are using people who really existed, why not try to bring elements of their life into the film. That way, people may actually learn something about 2 of the most influential writers that the world has ever known.

437,rogets_suds,Some Gilliam delights...but i still need a director's cut....,7,17 April 2006,"I sat down to this movie with a knot in my stomach, the knot i get when i think that one of my movie idols is about to throw at me some garbage that will ruin my view of them forever.When the first 20-25 minutes began, the knot didn't loosen much...although i could see that there could be some spirited performances from the leading ladies, and there might be some fantastic production design, the pacing and editing was just thrown out of the window. I had little idea of what was going on (what is this whole thing about beans got to do with anything?), and it just seemed very thrown together. No character development, no....anything really. I was a tad distraught. But i think i should explain.Gilliam came to this movie knowing that he would have to capitulate to what the studios wanted, and he thought he could do it. Although, when he added all of his little quirks to the script himself, it became his baby, and he just couldn't let the weinsteins touch it. However, unlike his other movies, they had the ultimate decision on what was to happen. There was cast squabbling, script squabbling, design squabbling....in the end, Gilliam was fighting so hard in the editing room for the film he wanted to make, he had to sacrifice continuity. It's not an excuse, it's a reason.However, to my utter delight, when the movie reached its main point (in the enchanted forest), and there was not a particular need for a linear storyline, Gilliam finally beat the weinsteins and we began to see the movie that he wanted to make.Everyone gives decent to above average performances, although Stormare can sometimes be a little irritating as Cavaldi and Damon's accent did waiver at times. However, it's Mr. Ledger's bumbling Jacob that deserves special mention. Ledger played outside of his usual leading-man comfort zone (10 things, Knight's tale) to create a truly endearing character, even if he only gets the screen time he deserves in the last ten minutes.However, saying all of this, there is much that needs to be changed. However, i have faith in Gilliam, and if he can somehow get a director's cut out there, this movie could be a bit of a gem...",The Brothers Grimm
438,silk121,Simply awful,1,26 August 2005,"So much potential wasted here. The movie starts out strong, with the two brothers Grimm working as supernatural con-men, ""saving"" towns from fake witches, ghosts, etc. However,after the initial 10 minutes there is little to smile about.The story is incredibly weak, and I've yet to understand why some things happen (example: a possessed horse attacks and eats a child, a kitten is ripped apart, and a child is swallowed by mud which then turns into the Gingerbread man).Do yourself a favor and save your $10. I'd compare it to the recent travesty ""Van Helsing"". Stay away from this one.",The Brothers Grimm
439,Methoes,Excellent. Go see it.,8,26 August 2005,"All in all this was an excellent movie. Some would say that it is very predictable. But what do you want for a story that is taken from fairy tales that we all have known since childhood. With that said, they still took some liberties with the fairy tales, and there were a few surprises. This is an excellent telling of how The Brothers Grimm collected their fairy tales. As I stated some elements were predictable, but with a story like this, there is going to be predictability due to the well known origins of the stories. I felt that they put the stories together in a well organized and well told story of 2 con artists who get what is coming to them and overcome their hardships to get what they want out of life.",The Brothers Grimm
440,swissdeanne,Waste of time,2,26 August 2005,"This movie was pretty much pointless nonsense. The whole movie I found myself saying ""what the heck....?"" It had the potential to be a cool movie, but the storyline was pretty pathetic and I'm quite surprised that such exceptional actors would do a film this cheesy. And the ending doesn't make much sense, but neither does the rest of the movie. Not a real winner, unless you enjoy making fun of movies. Then I suggest gathering a bunch of friends and popcorn and doing a running commentary. It was kind of funny when the mud blob with eyeballs came along, he was kind of cute and looked a lot like ""flubber"". For those who were wondering if this is a really intense, scary movie, don't worry. Although there are a few creepy and weird scenes, it probably won't give you nightmares. Trust me, I'm considered one of the squeamish!",The Brothers Grimm
441,cpottebaum,Avoid this movie,1,26 August 2005,"Avoid this movie unless you enjoy scenes of cruelty to animals. There are two scenes in which horses are mistreated and one scene where a kitten is killed merely for comic effect. These scenes are disgusting and add nothing to the movie. I waited through the credits to see a disclaimer (no animals were harmed), but never saw one. Even if none were hurt, using realistic scenes such as these is beyond bad taste. Some one at Dimension Films is in serious need of help. If these scenes had been left out, it would have been a decent film. Please do not take children to this movie. All animal lovers should boycott it. Btw, the ten line minimum limit on comments is rather annoying.",The Brothers Grimm
442,magusemeraldus,Dreadful.,2,26 August 2005,"Honestly one of the worst movies of the Summer.It was hard to tell where exactly they were going with this film right from the beginning! I still couldn't tell exactly what genre it was aiming for, comedy, fantasy, horror? There was no plot! Even when it did aim a bit for comedy, the jokes were fit for a children's movie, which this is not.Half of the time, characters were *out* of character, and villains were ambiguous. I got no feel for any of the characters on account of the fact that their personalities kept changing. Most of the Grimm's ""Fairy Tales"" were mutilated and stretched. They tried to fit too much into a short movie, and it became riddled with gaping plot holes. Too many things made no sense. The background/set CG was gorgeous, but the little stuff was poorly done. On top of all this, the actors' accents were horrible, too. I had a lot of hope for this movie, and it was a total waste of time and money. I'll just stick with ""The 10th Kingdom""~!",The Brothers Grimm
443,wickedrachel379,Intricate and Interesting,8,27 August 2005,"Having watched Brazil just last night, I can say that Terry Gilliam has produced some good works that aren't for the faint of cinematographical heart. There are some points that never quite come clear, but I was enthralled. Fairy tales have always intrigued me, and the way they are portrayed and woven through the story held my attention. People wanting to see a simple horror film shouldn't watch this. People wanting to watch pure fairy tale shouldn't watch it either. People who want to see a Monty Python film shouldn't watch it. This is not a funny movie, it is dark and sometimes subtle and sometimes thrilling. This film is for the child within who is surprisingly mature for his or her age.",The Brothers Grimm
444,lauren-183,So exciting! Worth going back!,8,27 August 2005,"Oh my goodness! I just got back from seeing this movie! And I gotta tell you...it was great! The special effects were beautiful...maybe not as good as some other movies in the past but nothing to be disappointed at. The actors were funny while providing the audience with some great acting. Though the story was a little sketchy at times, the humor and thrill of the movie was steady throughout. The subtle hints towards all of the Grimm fairy tales were smart and interesting. This movie is worth sitting through AND going back to catch anything you might have missed the first time. I know I probably missed a ton because I was looking at all of the scenery...and Matt Damon...cough! Go see this movie! Highly recommended!",The Brothers Grimm
445,starla110_,terrible movie,1,27 August 2005,"this movie was awful - we left in the middle or the beginning, maybe the end - we weren't sure since it seemed to go nowhere slow. Matt Damon is so disappointing, Heath Ledger was fine but he did himself a disservice by teaming up with that ding a ling Damon. The movie seemed very disorganized and choppy. Again, Damon seemed off cue on many parts. When a chuckle from the audience seemed the aim - it didn't happen. We are huge movie fans and have withstood the worst - never leaving during the movie, but this is king of crap. I wish I had saved my money and stuck needles in my eyes for a far less painful experience. my advice - don't bother~!",The Brothers Grimm

I'm begging you, if you have wisely put off seeing this movie, continue to do so, stay home and stare at your four walls, you'll be glad you did. Scrub your toilets, clean out those week old leftovers in your fridge, anything, just don't go to see this movie.This movie is the straw that broke the camel's back. I'm done with Hollywood, they have stolen from me for the last time. My time, my money, my sanity. Brothers Grimm indeed!

447,bpoe19,WOW...Didn't Expect Something This Bad,1,27 August 2005,"I honestly can't come up with a review bad enough to describe this movie. Matt Damon, do you not listen to your buddy Ben Afflek and heed his advice when he tells you of his string of bombed movies?!?! Had this disaster come out a couple of years ago, Gigli might have had a shot at an Oscar.There's no way I want to write 10 lines minimum worth of review for this movie as this site dictates, but here goes:R E A L L YB A DM O V I E",The Brothers Grimm
448,A_Dixon,Its pretty Grimm,4,28 August 2005,"While it has its Monty Python parts and dark humor... it still isn't that great. Don't get me wrong, I like these kinds of movies like ""Time Bandits"" - another Giliam film.. but this kind of sucked. What is sad is it could have been better, it had all the potential in the world. Lets just say, in the theaters, about a dozen people left in the middle of the film. It would have been better if it had the Monty Python crew actually in it, or perhaps had been more focused on the dark humor. I didn't enjoy a bit.Not a bit.Save your money for something better.",The Brothers Grimm
449,jkirkbride03,Enjoyment for Everyone,9,29 August 2005,"The acting was very good. I enjoyed the subtle humor of the characters. My husband, who does not usually enjoy these types of movies, actually liked this movie. The film was very entertaining. I am a teacher and many students today are not familiar with traditional fairy tales. This movie showed background to fairy tales and how some of them began. I enjoy the background, the history of the subject. This is definitely on my top movies of 2005. The contained comedy, action, drama and romance. I always enjoy watching Matt Damon on film. I feel he is an excellent actor. It was great to see Heath Ledger playing a sensitive and funny role. I felt Damon and Ledger were cast very well together. I would like to see them together in another movie as well. They compliment each other. I laughed when Matt Damon did a high pitched scream. At one moment he seems strong and macho but then quickly shows a weaker, more human side. The characters grew and changed by the end of the movie, not dramatically but they did evolve.",The Brothers Grimm
450,nickrunneraca,A Rainy Day Piece of Scary Moment Fantasy Fun,4,29 August 2005,"OK, so, if your planning to go see 'The Brothers Grimm', skip the first, oh say, thirty minutes of it and then I think you will enjoy it. It isn't that the movie starts out slow, on the contrary, the editing and camera work is dizzying, and to no effect. The premise is intriguing though. Will and Jake Grimm are traveling con-artists who encounter a genuine fairy-tale curse which requires genuine courage instead of their usual bogus exorcisms. Finally, somewhere around reel 3 a plot, almost as far-fetched as why Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are in this film, starts to develop. After an ending that was scarily close to going too long, I wasn't sure what I just watched.At some moments, you are sure you are watching a comedy, but not an American one, a Monty Python, anti-French kind of funny. Probably because the director is the one who brought us all those hilarious irreverent animations back in those Holy Grail days. Other times, it really wants to be an action film, but even with all the nice effects of moving trees and demonically aged women, the plot is to muddied, more so than the peculiarly constant mud covered set. It is labeled as a fantasy, but it tries, and surprisingly succeeds to be more of a horror flick, during the absolutely chilling Gingerbread man sequence, and the Spider/Horse/Childeating business. But it never really picks up one of these genres and runs with it.The actors in the film are used more as props for action set pieces by director Terry Gilliam than characters, making it hard to understand why the talents of Ledger and Damon were drawn to it. A majority of their lines consist of, 'Did you see/hear that?' or a variation on that theme. As for the writing, the entire French General was a great idea with possibilities, but ends up dragging the story down with the subplot, and Jonathan Pryce is trying his best to hold the French line, but in the end, that entire part of the story is slush, but slush with a few lovely period costumes.In the end, I realized that this movie really was a dynamic journey, not so much for the characters in the film, but for me. I went from really wanting to like it, to almost walking out, to being terrified by a glob of walking mud, and coming close to cheering for the heroes at the end, even the lieutenant with the overused hairpiece bit. I would say its a great kids action flick, but it goes to far into scary land, it is by no means your traditional date flick, although the date movie looks are to be found in Monica Bellucci, Matt Damon, and Heath Ledger, and Lena Heady. But drama it is not. This film is a novelty, a rainy day piece of scary moment fantasy fun. Not something to put on your to-do list, but if the opportunity pops up, go for it, if for nothing else but to play 'spot the actor' or count how many different fairy tale sightings there are.C-",The Brothers Grimm
451,register-103,Sleepy Hollow it was Not,2,30 August 2005,"I was very disappointed. I don't like to criticize films. I go to have a good time, but this one was just real bad. Save your money. Stay home and watch The Closer (TNT) or BattleStar Galactica (Sci-Fi), both are much better and free. Thank God for HBO.Matt Damon didn't need that much makeup. He looked like an overgrown Oompa-Loompas from the original Willy Wonka film. That's what I should have seen. You can always count on at least a little genius from Burton.If I knew this had to be ten lines, I'd never have started writing this damn review. Enjoy some popcorn and a coke.

The acting was not believable and I found myself bored with its slow pace and extremely poor character development. The special effects for this movie were laughable. At no time was I pulled into the story for this movie. The plot was inconsistent at best and left me feeling as if I'd been sitting for an hour and a half in front of a trailer. I'm continuing to write this commentary only because I don't have enough lines to simply submit it and move on to more meaningful activities.

The script is based on a decent idea but then does absolutely nothing coherent with it. The visual effects are really really bad CG. The French characters are so overdone in their stupidity (yes Mr. Gilliam, we know you hate the French) that you cannot understand a word they say and nothing they do makes sense or is even a little bit funny.This is Hollywood at its worst - a great preview and nothing else of substance or style.",The Brothers Grimm
454,shorti19,A good story about the Brothers Grimm,8,30 August 2005,"Personally, I liked the movie... I mean sure if you don't know who the Brothers Grimm really were, it wouldn't make a lot of sense. But if you know who they were and what they did, it makes sense. It summed up a lot of the fairy tales and folk lores that they travelled Europe to find out. I mean it wasn't exactly like the Brothers Grimm I know, but how many stories are exactly what they are supposed to be? I thought the visual effects were very well done. I found it convincing, I mean of course it's not going to be 100% realistic since it is about fairy tales such as Rapunzel, Little Red Ridinghood, Goldilocks, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White. Oh ya and Hansel and Gretel. I thought the acting was well done in it. And I also thought it was funny... I found myself laughing out loud at the jokes.One thing I didn't like was the wolf/father guy. That was just creepy... How did he turn into the wolf? I didn't understand that.",The Brothers Grimm

I wondered why I reacted so strongly to ""The Brothers Grimm"", as opposed to dozens of other bad movies I've seen over the years. I realized it was just mean-spirited and artistically deficient on every possible level. The acting was embarrassingly bad (kudos to Monica Belluci for managing to play the exact same character in ""Matrix"", ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" and now this disaster), the accents were so terrible that most of the dialogue was impossible to understand. The editing was so jumpy, I felt sick. The cinematography and sets were just horrible. What was Terry Gilliam thinking when he shot scene after scene of the moving trees, the horses running through flocks of geese, crows and more crows? Last but not least, for those who think animal cruelty is cool or humorous on any level, ever, should be ashamed of themselves. Thank God I didn't bring kids. We all left the theater depressed; thanks, Miramax!",The Brothers Grimm

When I went to this movie I was expecting a good entertaining plot, decent acting, and at the very least OK special effects. I got none of these. This was one of those very rare movies where you absolutely want to forget the 8 bucks you just spent, and run from the theater, knocking over the usher on the way out. The acting, even though meant to be over-the-top, was horrible. The special effects...I only have three words...SCI FI CHANNEL. Frankenfish had better CGI than this movie. The plot had terrible holes and just as you thought you might understand what was really going on, they threw in a deranged gingerbread man to throw you off. Giving this movie a 2 is really being generous.",The Brothers Grimm
457,cbriggs1019,"It is good, but could have been better",7,2 September 2005,"This movie is following a trend in recent Hollywood of taking a good premise and not allowing it to reach its full potential. Unlike some, I still find this movie fully enjoyable. It helps that I have seen every one of Gilliam's flicks and love being transported to interesting situations. Yes, I will admit it has its flaws, but the overall work hit the points it was trying to reach, even if it wasn't with the flair I thought possible. The brothers pull off the roles relatively well and I only wish there was more back story as to the way they found there path to chicanery. Mr. Pryce was under used, but this movie wasn't about him and therefore is not a big point. This biggest problem I had was not using a vision like Monica Bellucci more than they did as she is such a stunning thing that she captivates when she is up there. The sprinkling of fairy tales we all know and love are nice and made me eagerly anticipating the next one to spring up. Worth a second viewing at least on DVD to see what I missed. Ultimately not higher art, but enjoyable as a matinée and a fun experience.",The Brothers Grimm
458,Aaron84,The worst movie EVER!,1,2 September 2005,"This is no exaggeration. I've never felt the need to go online and trash a movie before, but this one was so awful I signed up to IMDb just to post a comment before its too late for you unsuspecting movie-goers because first of all, no one should suffer through this, and suffer is putting it mildly, and second of all, the makers of this movie don't deserve to make any money off of this piece of trash; in fact, they should be punished! I don't know how anyone could be so selfish as to release this to the public. I would have rather watched Gigli, Glitter, and Son of the Mask all in a row with no bathroom breaks than sit through this (had I only known).While the plot in concept is good (that's why we went to see it), the execution is terrible. They ruin the basic story by pointlessly adding in just about every fairytale to the most random of scenes even where it doesn't fit in at all. (I can not for the life of me understand what compelled them to do that!) Along with terrible attempts at humor and over-the-top characters, the decent plot spelled out in the previews is manifested through a particularly stupid and boring storyline. At no time did I feel any suspense or any other emotion for that matter; this was two hours of complete apathy. Bravo to Robbin Williams for getting out of the cast while he could. To everyone else involved in this film: SHAME ON YOU ALL!In summation, a part of me died while sitting through that movie, I can only hope to revive it by posting bad reviews for this movie on every movie website I can come across.",The Brothers Grimm

Heath Ledger's performance was endearing and the best part. SPOILER AHEAD!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! I was really frustrated that they didn't develop or address more the death of the Grimm's younger sister. They really set it up to be a major source of conflict between the brothers but they just left it out there. The character that Matt Damon plays has a reoccurring line of ""Beans!"" to make a point about his brother's lack of common sense which resulted in the death of their sister? Other than that there is no real development of this conflict. Another annoying point for me is that either two of the missing girls look a lot a like or there was a mistake were a girl who had just been taken was back in the village in the next shot! Still worth seeing just save your money and rent the DVD!",The Brothers Grimm

It is different from any other movie i have ever seen, it was funny, managed to surprise me, and draw me to the fairytale-world. The movie is quite a break from the real world, and it kept me interested the whole time.Especially i was impressed with Matt Damons performance, I never thought he could play a role like this one, and keep it so balanced as he does,I simply didn't realize it was him, until the end.I think the story works well by spinning a fairytale around the brothers, and mixing other fairy tales inside the main one. It makes op its own world with its own rules.Simply, if you loved fairy tales as a child, and want to feel that tingle in side you again, this is the perfect movie.",The Brothers Grimm

Quite graphic, but then so are the original stories by the Grimm brothers. The thing that bothered me most about the movie is that Sasha (little girl from village) was kidnapped TWICE. Did the producers of this film not notice this major plot error? She is kidnapped once in a very scary scene, and after failing to rescue her the brothers are taken in front of a French general for questioning. When they return to the village, she is back in the village with no explanation as to how she returned and no reference to the incident. And then she is kidnapped later in a completely different manner!!! It bothered me SOOOOO much.",The Brothers Grimm

Gilliam makes watching movies an adventure in and of itself. Highly Recommended Film. The special effects do not detract from the film at all (though the wolf is a tiny bit of a runaway from Jumanji). The story is entertaining and suspenseful. Gilliam balances the scary with the humorous in a masterful manner. Each character was cast with precision--which makes for a tremendously entertaining group of individuals on screen. Many people are knocking this film because it does not meet their expectations, but see it for yourself. Simply put, this film is a great time. Witty, visually appealing, and a nostalgic story with a twist. GO SEE THIS FILM.",The Brothers Grimm

The fairy tales did not seem to make sense and the color was washed out. I was left thinking the movie was written as it was filmed, even improvised. The actors were really good and I can see them in much better films. There a good team and can make people laugh. The story used the name of the Brothers Grimm but it was so misleading about there real life that a person will never know what they really did. If movie producers use the REAL names of books or REAL characters from books, then I wish they would give more honor to the original writing the way the BBC FILMS do on some of there films. I don't know why it is legal to allow writers and producers to rewrite other peoples work from the past or use there characters names or even the names of real people and mix them up all up.",The Brothers Grimm
464,maurydb,"the idea was grand, the vision was good, the execution was poor.",3,6 September 2005,"This movie is a grave disappointment.I expected a great deal more from Terry Gilliam. Instead of a Grimm Brothers fairy tale, which would have been a relief half way through the film, we instead are taken on a tangled, twisting path that defies logic or cohesive thought.Although the images are interesting, there is no story to go along with it. The dialogue and scenes are choppy and seem to be cut and chopped together so poorly that the scenes leave you questioning whether some segue scene was somehow eliminated. The acting is also poor. Every role in the film is more caricature that character.For this film - the idea was grand, the vision was good, the execution was poor.",The Brothers Grimm

I am literally shocked that they made a movie that was as lousy as this one. The story was terrible. They tried to encorporate all the traditional fairy tales all into one story which would seem to be a clever and fun idea, but it came out as a complete incoherent mess. The story made no sense and was completely unentertaining. The acting and dialogue was very frustrating to watch, particularly the french officer and his accent. The characters had no depth what so ever, and you do not grow to like any of them. The ending was cheesy and predictable. It seems like the whole story was written by a 6 year old. There were a few couples that literally walked out of the theatre 15 minutes into the movie. By the end of the movie, all you could here in the theatre were the comments of unhappy people. Without exaggeration I would have to say this was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.",The Brothers Grimm

Acting was moronic, FX very average, directing same as acting and the story mediocre!I feel bad for those who invested money into this flick (I wouldn't even call it a movie) and not a bit surprised Terry couldn't and still can't find finding for his other projects.Mr. Gilliam obtained sufficient status to have a responsibility not to offer crap like ""Brothers Grimm"" for viewing.

467,La_Deprimee,So-So Flick.,4,11 September 2005,"The movie was witty, a conglomeration of all the fairy tales associated to the Grimm brothers with a twist. It was kind of dragging in the beginning. A ""confused film""... is it a comedy, a thriller or did i miss the humor of the whole thing? The latter part of the film was far better, i like the suspense, the exposition of the now whole picture. Monica Belucci is just gorgeous! I'm biased, I love her. I love it that amidst all the jokes which are most of the time slapstick by nature, it maintained its dim sort of gloomy feel. I'm a sucker for sad endings. I was hoping that Will won't wake up, and the 12 girls will forever be in their ""coffins"" preserved with the elegance of death. Oh well, i guess i'm too much of a pessimist these days.I did like the ending, i mean, how could you not adore the sight of girls running towards a group of villagers who have been waiting for them since forever? How could you not like the sight of a happily-ever-after denouement? I even liked the ""two-timing woman"" who gave both the brothers a g'bye or perhaps an ""im-flirting-with-you-come-and-get-me-boys"" kiss (lucky bastard).

468,danielle_sh,Liked it once I understood the intended feel,7,11 September 2005,"I thought it felt more like a cartoon at first, to such an extent that I was rather bored and annoyed after about a third of the way in. Then I thought about it and I realized the cartoon-like feel was a way to accent the larger than life fairy tales that came down through history from the Brothers Grimm. If you keep that in mind then you will enjoy the movie for what it is from the very beginning. Warning though: this is a guy adventure movie and therefore a bit more gruesome than you might expect (not a kids show!). It is MUCH more faithful to the original European tales which were told to scare young children into behaving rather than the whitewashed versions that came to be told in the US. I.E. you will see the bogeymen of past eras rather than cuddly characters used to put you to sleep as a child.",The Brothers Grimm
469,Mingelo,All over the map,3,13 September 2005,"This movie has its merits, sure. The premise was interesting enough, and I didn't have personal complaints about the acting. The execution of this premise is the problem... it seemed unclear where the movie was going at any given time. The dialogue was unnatural (people talking to themselves in strange ways), the plot was semi-nonsensical and all over the place. The first hour of the movie was rather dull and did not contribute to the story much at all. Certain characters were so cookie-cutter it hurt (i.e. anyone french in the movie at all). The incorporation of old fairy-tale stories was a neat idea, but the way it was carried out seemed incredibly forced. The CG was so poorly done that it was distracting.It had potential, but I don't think it was met in any respect.",The Brothers Grimm
470,megalon13,Very Cool!,10,21 September 2005,"I thought this was a well written and performed movie. The feeling of mystery was very thrilling. The characters were well portrayed. The plot had just enough twists and turns to keep a person very interested. Many of them were unexpected and very satisfying. Not many people showed up at the theater in my town, and I say they missed out big time!! When this particular movie comes out on DVD, I am going to be the first one in Walmart to get it! My friends enjoyed it as well. I highly recommend this film for its lovely mix of mystery, thrill, and an interesting basis. There is an element that I can't quite explain that a person gets when you watch the movie. It is the most perfect movie to show on a dark and stormy summer night to your friends if you're after a good laugh at their screams.",The Brothers Grimm
471,missunny,Good old-fashioned craftsmanship,9,8 October 2005,"If you love a good old-fashioned craftsmanship movie, very nicely made, great pictures/scenery in great detail, this could be something for you. It's a fairytale, but the way they used to be, not the sugar-coated Disney-movies. Great acting, typical Terry Gilliam (Monty Python) humor. Especially funny if you know your Grimm-fairy tales. Although sometimes they maybe tried to hard to get as many fairy-tale figures in at the same time, but they're forgiven. Didn't recognize Matt Damon at first, with his English accent, (again named Will ...) but that makes it easier to forget about Matt Damon and really get into the movie. Can't remember having really laughed out loud in a theater, but today I did.",The Brothers Grimm
472,themadcatlady,A fantastically entertaining dark humoured fantasy...,10,26 December 2005,"The Brothers Grimm is a fantastically entertaining dark humoured fantasy that borrows many of the favourite characters from various Grimm fairy tales such as The Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood and Rapunzel, but putting all of these into a new and fresh, exciting setting. You will see a few well known faces like Jonathan Price and Monica Bellucci, along with the Brothers played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. The look and feel of the movie is sometimes reminiscent of Lord of the Rings (but with humour!), and at other times of Harry Potter, and if in addition you are also a fan of Terry Gilliam, you will really enjoy his latest masterpiece.Totally and utterly fab and highly recommended. :)",The Brothers Grimm
473,paigeherel,I love this movie,9,27 May 2017,"Should I start with the good or the bad... Bad. The only things I didn't like were (and this might have just been my brand new disc) some of the scene cuts. I'm not picky when it comes to scene cuts but some of the transitions were choppy and even within a scene some things were sloppily mushed together making it look like there was a scratch in the disc when as I had said before it was brand new. Things I loved were the actor choice, and their performance of course the whole mix of cast and crew and plot was just the making of a good movie, one that I for sure would love. I mean for heaven's sake my mom saw Brothers Grimm and Heath Ledger on the same case and bought it right away. Definitely a movie worth watching and mystery too! Maybe not one for the kiddos unless they're OK with some mid evil subjects.",The Brothers Grimm
474,powermouce_13,The perfect ending,10,25 October 2005,"The ending to ""The Brother's Grimm"", was one of the most satisfying endings i have ever seen. I was so sad that he was going die, or that he was dead, but him coming back made me so HAPPY!!!. The cast was perfect also, Heath Ledger and Matt Damon make the perfect, HOTTEST team!!! I have to admit. i was not sure that this would be a good movie. For one, I hadn't ever heard of it when i went to see it, and the pictures for it didn't look like a pleasurable movie, but it was, it was filled with friendship, fear, relationships, and many other exciting events. There were also some very shocking events in ""The Brother's Grimm. Overall, I gave this Movie a PERFECT 10!!!!",The Brothers Grimm
475,roxannelast,A great story ruined by inaccurate characterisation,3,6 November 2005,"The storyline of the Grimm Brothers film is absolutely wonderful - a patchwork or the Grimms' best known work (Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretal, Snow White etc) and German folk law & fairy tales, interwoven with 'real life' to create a story of kidnapped children and an enchanted forest.What a shame then, that the wholly inaccurate characterisation of the brothers detracted so completely from Ehren Krueger's wonderful writing. Wilheilm and Jacob (not Will and Jake) Grimm were German scholars, folklorists and above all believers, not English charlatans, performing fake exorcisms for money and fame.Matt Damon, whose performances are usually subtle and well sculpted, was disappointing, his hammed up, overacting is cringe-worthy (Although I suppose this is a matter or personal taste). The only saving grace for this production is Heath Ledger's performance. Tasteful, subtle and human, the only character I was touched by.I was really looking forward to this film, and bitterly disappointed by it. And it appears to me that Gilliam only used the Grimm brothers' name in order to sell his film.",The Brothers Grimm
476,holtzman3,cat cruelty warning,1,27 November 2005,I watched Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm. I am sickened and appalled at the use of animal cruelty as humor. The scene where a fluffy kitten gets chopped up in a machine is totally unacceptable. It does not add anything to the story and is clearly added as a sick attempt for humor. I am familiar with Terry Gilliam's previous work and feel this is a new and disturbing low. Animal cruelty is not funny. I recommend a boycott of this movie and all of Gilliam's work. Animal right's groups have worked too long and hard to stop animal abuse to allow this kind of warped humor to be used. We need to show that we will not stand for this kind of treatment of animals in films. It is simply not acceptable.,The Brothers Grimm
477,chunkymonkey2624,worse movie ever!,1,15 November 2005,"this movie was just awful! wouldn't you think a movie w/Matt Damon would be good? well this was one huge mistake. the editing was bad, supporting cast was bad and the french accents were bad! honestly, i wouldn't be surprised if this movie was banned in France cause it makes the french look like idiots. this movie had potential. the fairytale aspect of it was not bad. i liked how the forest connected so many different tales together. you can see how the Grimm brothers got the story of little red riding hood, sleeping beauty etc. but in the end, the acting, the editing, and the randomness of the story killed it for me.",The Brothers Grimm
478,ryanhunt,I'm surprised I didn't walkout.,1,18 November 2005,"I figured since it was based on the famous brothers grimm fairy tale stories, it must have a good plot/story line to start with, and with a bit of good CGI, it must be good.I was so very, very wrong. They tried to intertwine so many famous fairy tales, and some of the were so loosely connected to the story, it was cringe worthy - like when the child turned into an evil gingerbread man. Little red riding hood - had very little relevance - it wasn't Hansel and Gretel, it was Hans and Greta? The movie felt like they got a point in the movie, building it up - and then realised they were out of budget so had to finish up the film, it had so much potential. And the way the film ended with the whole 'saving princess' thing was really odd - just didn't quite fit. I must admit I saw this film last week and it was so bad that I've forgotten so much about it.The acting was average, the CGI was nothing amazing, and the plot was terrible. There is nothing worse than a fake French accent in films...Don't waste your time, avoid this movie.",The Brothers Grimm
479,whistlerj,"Watch this movie at your peril - and be prepared to be disappointed, very disappointed!",1,22 November 2005,"Absolute unadulterated, dreadful trite!Appalling would be an understatement.Matt Damon: you should have known better.Heath Ledger: another specious, inglorious effort. If this film was a crime, those responsible should be facing fraud charges. It will undoubtedly go down in the annals of filmdom as one of the worst. There is not one redeeming feature, not one standout moment for God's sake. Please, someone, tell me truthfully whether you left feeling you had just seen a good movie. It is, quite simply, a cringe. Grimm by name and grim by nature.",The Brothers Grimm
480,kalico_kitty,Worst Movie Ever!,1,26 November 2005,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story line is crap, and it made little sense. It really made me wonder if they had actually ever read Grimm's Fairy Tales. It seriously seemed as if they hadn't.The little story line it had, is a very over used one. A tough girl helps the hero(s) then ends up needing to be saved. It contained a few snipets of one or two fairy tales, but it never followed through with them. The only fairy tale it really had was the evil queen locked in the tower with eternal life, though no eternal youth. Not even one of the better fairy tales.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone for any reason besides torture and a good way to waste money.",The Brothers Grimm
481,shashank-mash,Insufferable,1,24 March 2007,"This is one of the most God-awful movies I have had the utter misfortune to suffer. I don't know where to begin. It seemed okay in the beginning but with passing time it just got horrible. Whoever thought it was entertaining to have a french-accented madman as a sidekick must have clearly been high. And deliriously so. His hysterical dialog delivery was worser than Heath Ledger's demented portrayal of Jake. Ledger staggers around mumbling incoherently about 'magic beans', and his demeanor is so fidgety that throughout the movie he seems afflicted by the vicious plague that they ostensibly intend to cure. Matt Damon should never flatter himself on his success in the portrayal of a British crook. At most, he looks ridiculous in the wig, and completely helpless as the flirtatious thug. The cinematography is beautiful, the setting for a horror movie has been well designed, but all this is overshadowed by the awful performances by all of the actors. The main story get off the track so many times that one loses interest very quickly. The movie soon becomes an unending torture. Keep away from such movies, they just make you feel outraged.",The Brothers Grimm

First, the actors in leading roles, Heath Ledger and Matt Damon are strange for this kind of movie. Second, the story is too complicated. Third, this movie is beautiful. Yes, the movie is beautiful. Beautiful for the art direction and the screenplay, beautiful for Cavaldi and Angelika, beautiful for Monica Bellucci, beautiful for the actors, Matt Damon and Heath Ledger(in his excellent year). The beginning is too slow and confused, but when Cavaldi arrives, the movie become another, Heath Ledger shows his talent, Matt Damon becomes good and all of the others change. The story takes energy. This is Terry Gilliam, strange cinema, but necessary.",The Brothers Grimm
483,bshirmo,Funniest movie i have ever seen,5,8 August 2006,"Now i know that this movie is not supposed to be considered a comedy, but this was the funniest movie i have ever seen. I don't think i have ever laughed that hard before in my life. This movie was so poorly done and presented, it was funny. Now, the special effects were really good and all, but it just cant save the movie. Damon and Ledger are great actors, but what were they thinking trying to do this movie. So many outlandish and ridiculous things occur throughout the movie, it just makes you scratch your heads like ""what??"".The only reason i enjoyed this movie so much was because i openly mocked and laughed at this movie for the entire duration of the movie. If you are looking for a good laugh, see this movie with an open and critical mind. You will love it. Oh yea, by the way, if you see someone who you thought was dead already, don't worry, everyone else did too.",The Brothers Grimm
484,neehow,Certainly not a film for young children.,4,28 December 2005,"I didn't know it was supposed to be a comedy until after I finished the movie and saw an advertisement. The writers seemed to have started with a good idea then gotten lost along the way. Often the viewer feels a little lost too. More than once we weren't sure what was happening or why. The story has some interesting plot twists and the two heroes are very engaging. Heath Ledger keeps you rooting for his scholarly character all the way though this strange slap dash film. The movie would seem to be for young people, but I wouldn't advise small children seeing it. It depicts some very cruel, gruesome and disturbing things. Horses and even a kitten are shown being hurt and killed. Often my husband and I couldn't understand what the supporting actors were saying because of their supposed ""French"" accents.",The Brothers Grimm
485,shoot-ill,why is this regarded as brilliant?,3,8 January 2007,"this film was impossibly horrible. i love twisted fairy tales but the plot line of this film is inconsistent, it expects the viewer to follow the story while jumping around and leaving out important parts (like when cavaldi took the grimms and angelkia to delatombe underground torcher chamber, you had to stop any figure out where you were, what just happened and why things were explained. there were a lot of moments similar to this) i know its all about fantasy, but it seriously didn't make any sense, ended and started poorly. i mean, were you supposed to laugh in the beginning or be upset? the lack of coherent dialogue between the characters made the movie even harder to follow. did terry gilliam just try to shove a load of mystical crap into our faces? mash every story together into 118 minutes? that gingerbread blob that went from the actual screen version of 'the blob' to a burnt, tar-black cookie? what was the point of that? i find myself disappointed.",The Brothers Grimm
486,kkhasapes,I had to turn off this movie - I could not finish it,1,14 January 2006,I have never disliked a movie as much as this one. Fantasy type movies are my favorite so I thought it would be great. What they did to the animals was cruel!!!!!!!!!!! I still have in my mind what they did to the kitten. I could understand the part about the rabbit because that is part of life (even though I would prefer not to see it). Burning the horses in the beginning should have stopped me from watching it but I thought I would give it a try. I made sure to tell my family and friends that are animal lovers not to watch it. I really think there should be a warning at the beginning. For that matter it should not be rated PG 13. That sort of violence should not be watched by children.,The Brothers Grimm
487,jjmhowell,The Type Of Movie That Makes You Devalue Director's Past Work,2,28 March 2006,"I suppose I've had it in for Terry Gilliam for some time. Like Tim Burton he brings a terrific graphical sensibility... I don't say visual as that might suggest some approval of the net effect of frames in succession. But both of them ought to be working as a component of a production crew under other directors, because they can't provide a satisfying narrative. ""The Brothers Grimm"" is shrill, mentally badgering, but ultimately toothless. It contains many ideas which I decline to call interesting but certainly could have been stepping stones to better ideas; either more coherent or simply more evocative. I don't mind chaos on film at all; this isn't a problem of me not ""getting it."" As I explained to my bewildered wife, ""I get it, but it sucks."" Doubtless there are many other would-be auteurs who are great visual stylists. Perhaps some of them have an understanding of the theory of moving images and sound assembled as entertaining narrative. One of them should have Terry Gilliam's ability, such as it is, to get films made. Sorry Terry, but you are actively discouraging interesting and eclectic movies by making craptastrophes like this.For the record, I am very well versed in myth, legend, and fairy tale. I shudder to think that movies like this and ""Sleepy Hollow"" may be children's first exposure to these legends, and perhaps dissuade them from ever discovering better access points into them for their imagination. This film makes ""Sleepy Hollow"" look decent, and even succeeds at making Spielberg's ""Hook"" seem far less obnoxious and ill-conceived. Quite a feat.",The Brothers Grimm

As you see, I have rated this a 1 (awful). I wish that the system at IMDb could have a scale of -1000 to 10. It would definitely be rated -1000. Here are the reasons why: First of all the actors could pass grade 9 drama. I seriously think they were hobos pick off of the street. The effects appear to have come from a cereal box, in which i mean some clowns who tied ropes to random crap and pulled it around the stage. My third point contains some very ""humerous"" descriptions of scenes. The first ""event"" which i would like to point out would be when, read this carefully, there are no mistakes, A horse shoots spider webs from his nose at a little girl who looks like a boy, wraps him around in his web and then projects him into the air and swallows him hole. The next ""event"" i would like to point out would be when a giant blob coats himself on a raven and then attacks a girl, stealing her face, who runs away into a house. The blob then reaches under the door and pulls her into itself, makes a fine impression of a gingerbread, bites his thumb man and then plunges back into the well.",The Brothers Grimm

Yup, Terry Gilliam has done it again. Only this time, he did it in PUBLIC!Has anybody else out there grown sick and tired of directors who care nothing for the sensibilities of their audience and churn out hours of pointless sadistic drivel without ever coming to the freaking point? For some reason gratuitous cruelty seems to be the watchword in films today and this is no exception. It has, however, the distinction of being a real low point in trash cinema. Children kidnapped and killed. Horses set afire. Small animals skinned and the gruesome slaughter of a kitten (with actors eating the shredded results) is depicted as humor. Do you want your family to see this? Do YOU want to see this?Gilliam, you should be ashamed of yourself. I've always thought most of your work was muddled nonsense but this movie is garbage, pure and simple. Perhaps you should get out your scissors and go back to making pointless paper animations like you did for Python.

As it is it does both them and their collected tales a disservice... If this was all you had heard of them you would surely not read their tales to you children.Consider this movie with another title and different character names - it becomes a much better story that does not leave you wondering 'but what about the Grimm's and their stories?"".As director Gilliam says in his commentary, He was not interested in the script but, hey, it was work.... perhaps he should have left the Grimms to someone who was interested and made this movie as a separate thing??",The Brothers Grimm
