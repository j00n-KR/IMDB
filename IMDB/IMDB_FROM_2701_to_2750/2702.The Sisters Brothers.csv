0,MartinHafer,A French existential western.,3,15 November 2021,"Considering that ""The Sisters Brothers"" stars some amazing actors (John C. Reilly, Joaquin Phoenix and Jake Gyllenhaal), it should have been an amazing film. Instead, I found it quite dull and slow....and yet also filled with incredible violence to boot.The film is from French director Jacques Audiard and was filmed in Europe...and stars a mostly American cast. Now some seeing it might think that the film is more like the real west, as it lacks the pretty cowboys of westerns of the 1920s-50s. However, while these films paint a very inaccurate picture of the west, so does this one. To put it bluntly, the west was not this violent and shootouts like you see in the movie were very, very rare.When the story begins the Commodore procures the services of the insanely violent Sister brothers (Reilly and Phoenix) to track down Herman Warm (Riz Ahmed...an odd choice in casting as he is Pakistani/British and you never would have seen Pakistanis out in the old west). He apparently developed a formula to make panning for gold VERY profitable, as it makes the gold glow in the rivers. Additionally, John Morris (Gyllenhaal) also is trying to find and kill Warm. Oddly, however, when they meet up with Warm, they decide to join up with him to look for gold....and not surprisingly, folks come to try to kill them.To say this is a slow and depressing film is an understatement and it's obvious the film was intended to be that way. This combined with some portions where folks talk about life, death and the meaning of life make it seem more like a film written by Jean-Paul Sartre than a mainstream movie! Some obviously like this, based on the reviews, I just found myself trying hard to pay enjoy the movie and stay awake. Somehow all the vomit and blood still didn't keep my attention!",The Sisters Brothers
1,Leofwine_draca,Couldn't get into it,5,9 February 2020,"THE SISTERS BROTHERS is a character-focused drama that just so happens to have a western backdrop, thus tying it into the grittier end of that particular genre. It's a slow-burning story that's full of dialogue and punctuated by the occasional noisy shoot-out, but mostly this is about looking at a handful of characters and seeing what it is that makes them tick. However, for me, the writing is merely adequate rather than profound, and it doesn't really help that I didn't buy into the plot (which seems to be a spin on the old alchemy yarn). It's one of those films in which the famous stars - Phoenix, Reilly, Ahmed, Gyllenhaal - are all self-consciously ""acting"" rather than being, but I'm afraid I never really got into it all that much.",The Sisters Brothers
2,SnoopyStyle,Coen Brothers Adjacent,7,28 December 2018,"In 1851, brothers Eli (John C. Reilly) and Charlie Sisters (Joaquin Phoenix) are gunmen working for The Commodore. Their next target is Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed) who supposedly stole from The Commodore. Fellow tracker John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds Warm first. Warm explains that he has an easier process to find gold and convinces Morris to join him.Award winning French director Jacques Audiard brings a semi-Coen brothers sensibility to this movie. It's quirky. The deadpan humor comes off a little stiff. Reilly is itching to get a little more surreal and weird with his character. Everything happens to him and he's amazed by every new bathroom technology. I can almost see him going off with Will Ferrell taking this into a more comedic zone. The movie does go on a little too long at two hours. The first shootout with Mayfield's gunmen is a perfectly good climax and a great way to kill off everybody ending the movie. The gold mining leaves me a little perplexed. I don't know the actual method of gold mining being depicted. This is a weird fun little western.",The Sisters Brothers
3,Horst_In_Translation,"A good film, but less fun than I thought",6,14 March 2019,"""Les Frères Sisters"" or ""The Sisters Brothers"" (and it is really tough to say which of the two is the funnier title, maybe the first with the rhyme) is a new two-hour movie that is actually a co-production between no less than five countries and it is mostly in the English language, which should not surprise too much if you look at the cast list. The director is French though as this is the most recent filmmaking effort by BAFTA-winner Jacques Audiard. As for the cast, it is a pretty male-centered movie. But what would you expect for a western set in the mid-19th century. Golden Globe winner Joaquin Phoenix plays one of the two leads and he is one of my favorites. I usually like John C. Reilly as well, another Oscar nominee we have here, and the two key supporting players are Oscar winner Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy winner Riz Ahmed. I would say that maybe my expectations were too high because honestly this is a cast I like quite a bit, but here hardly anybody really won me over, maybe Reilly, but also only in the second half and I found him pretty forgettable in the first half.But let's take a general look at the story: Here we have two brothers who do dirty violent jobs for a Commodore and yep that also means killing people. Very early on, you get an example of what that looks like most of the time. This is just an introduction though. The main story is about them going after Ahmed's character and they are instructed to torture him until he gives them a formula that will be of great help in making it rich during the times of the gold rush. Their ally is Gyllenhaal's character who is supposed to find Ahmed and he does so and starts a friendship with him before revealing his true colors. Well, actually his non-true colors as the two become friends and find themselves quickly on the run from the murderous brothers. When they find them, they manage to ambush the brothers before getting attacked. However, the quartet is forced to work together when all of them are attacked by another group and eventually, a bit to my surprise, they grew closer and kept pursuing a plan to stay on the road together and find a new future. That they decided to work together surprised me a bit though, mostly with Phoenix' character, but I guess he just decided to join in with the other 3, not really with Reilly's character, who seemed a bit like a sensitive soul altogether, if you take a look at how he feels for his horse, the staged scene with the prostitute and his plans to retire and lead a normal life. Also almost so sensitive that I struggled with seeing him as a gifted gunslinger. Back to the story, a while after the 4 bonded, tragedy happens. So much for the story for now. The ending is also interesting: With all the bloodshed going on before that, resulting in severed limbs even, there is finally a moment of harmony at the mother's house.What else can I add? Oh yeah, it is worth mentioning we have Jake Gyllenhaal in another western here that is very different compared to his career-defining performance though. In this one, he did not win me over as in some other works from him in the not-so-distant past. The Commodore is played by famous Dutch actor Rutger Hauer, but sadly for his fand, he has virtually no screen time at all, is briefly in it early on and at the very end again, but there in a way that his fans surely don't want to see him. This was also a bit of a disappointment for me because the build-up of the duo (or just Reilly's character basically) coming for the Commodore felt interesting. A lot of animal trouble in this film. Spiders (man that was gross and painful to watch seeing Reilly's character suffer), chickens, horses, bears, only to menion a few, and all of them are not very lucky with their fate. Also, this is a very violent movie, but this should not come as a surprise with Audiard. Many people are shot (in the head), the blood is clearly visible. As the film keeps going, we also find out a whole lot about the brothers. The hunt is just the setting for this character study, for example what happened to the brothers' father or how the two see the future for themselves. Overall, I guess it was an okay movie with decent performances by everybody involved here. Could have been perhaps ten minutes shorter, even if it must be said that it never dragged. I also would not say that it is one of my favorite films from Audiard, which is a bit of a pity as I usually like western movies and this one has received a strong reception by critics mostly, by awards bodies too. And the moments I found rather unrealistic like that they constantly easily win all their gunfights (I talked about my struggles with Reilly's character already). Even when Phoenix' character was very drunk, they prevailed and the two looked too much like invincible super heroes to me. And what happened to Phoenix' arm or how Reilly tries to pay the bad guys to let them go does not really justify any of that.The title to me had this film sound a lot funnier than it actually ended up being. It is just a coincidence that they are named like that, not really a funny one, even if there is a moment of situational comedy here and there like when Phoenix' character while being drunk talks about Mayfield's raccoons. But this film can by no means be called a comedy. It is a western drama with some family elements because of the connection between the two protagonists. I think, overall, I give this film a thumbs-up because it was a good watch from start to finish and had me curious about what would happen next, which you could never really predict. Some fairly surprising moments. Sadly I must say the sequence in which Ahmed and Gyllenhall get so severely injured is one that stayed a question mark to me in the dark of the night and maybe they/Audiard could have made it easier to understand because now that I read back what happened, it makes totally sense and there is some massive irony to Phoenix' character causing all that and Ahmad's genius invention in the hands of the wrong man basically killing him and his plans. Okay, that should be enough of the story now. My guess is you watch this film for yourself if the genre and actors sound interesting to you. It is definitely worth spending two hours on, even if I think Hardy may be the more fitting recent portrayal by Reilly compared to this one we got here.",The Sisters Brothers
4,nogodnomasters,You can change the name of your town now.,7,6 January 2019,"Oregon/California 1851. Charlie (Joaquin Phoenix) and Eli (John C. Reilly) Sisters are hired killers who work for the Commodore who has frequent jobs for them in order to protect his assets. Eli has his doubts and longs for a better life. Charlie has his drink and likes killing. Their latest task is to meet up with detective John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is tracking Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed) their next target. The Sisters brothers are infamous and folks want to be known as the guy who killed them. Charlie always uses his outdoor voice which makes their identification easy.When they find whom they are looking for, the plot takes the expected twist.The film was decent with moments of humor.Guide: F-word. Sex. No nudity.",The Sisters Brothers
5,kosmasp,Sisters Brothers,8,8 June 2019,"Last names can be confusing - and/or funny that is. In this case and while this dead serious when it comes to the gun fights, it also has a lot of humor in it. And you can tell by the title. The chemistry between the two brothers is quite something and as with every sibling relationship, we just know there is friction and trouble.And it is a really good thing, they both have different goals and characters, the movie is richer for it. No pun intended and the story does move nicely. For some it might be tough to tell where this is going and even the mood might feel weird. But that is the charme of the movie. Not being able to pin point certain things. Having a mystery about it - which the end only proves. Whether you like it or not is a different tale overall ...",The Sisters Brothers
6,classicsoncall,"""Hey, have you noticed how long it's been since anyone tried to kill us?",7,21 November 2020,"There's an interesting dynamic that takes place in the movie between Charlie Sisters (Joaquin Phoenix) and his older brother Eli (John C. Reilly). As they journey to fulfill a contract for an unseen wealthy landowner, it's Charlie who's the nominal guy in charge, with Eli at one point lamenting that he should have been the one to kill their abusive father before they both struck out on their own. After the unfortunate turn at the gold panning creek in which the greedy Charlie dumped all the chemical into the water, he loses an arm when it's removed for a life threatening infection. With both John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed) both dead, the brothers head back to put an end to The Commodore, but now it's Eli who takes charge after Charlie loses much of his spirit.Except for a last minute view of The Commodore lying in a casket of his own, the character had only been mentioned numerous times as a feared presence who's money could provide an endless source of gunmen and assassins to do his bidding. Up until then, I thought The Commodore might have been a red herring in the story, and I got the biggest kick when Eli took a couple of punches at the body in the coffin just to make sure he was really gone. What really astonishes me is why the film makers cast a name recognition actor like Rutger Hauer to pose in the film as a dead guy, and even then, for a mere few seconds. I can't think of a better gig to collect a paycheck, do absolutely nothing, and add another notch to your career credits. Great job if you can get it.Anyway, this is a somewhat offbeat Western taking place in 1850's Oregon with a side trip to Mayfield, California. Proving to the citizens of Mayfield that they couldn't be intimidated by the family that owns the town, they assert that a name change could be in order as they head off for San Francisco. Phoenix and Reilly had an unusual chemistry as brothers, with each having the other's back after bouts of alcohol and clinical depression. I've seen Reilly in a number of films recently, and his presence in a story always reminds me of character actor Michael J. Pollard, or if you go back a couple more decades, R.G. Armstrong.",The Sisters Brothers
7,searchanddestroy-1,"An ""order"" movie for Audiard but with his personal touch.",7,20 September 2018,"Jacques Audiard himself told that this film was an order film. Producer John C eilly came to him to ask him to do it. Audiard was not the creator. But after watching it, I must admit that you find here much of his personal touch. For instance, ths feature reminds me his very first film: REGARDE LES HOMMES TOMBER, made in 1995. It was not a western but a crime drama involving ONLY MEN, as here, men from different sides, who finally found a kind of meaning at their lives. A complex story too, very hard to analyze, very interesting but not for all audiences, except the ""elite"" ones. Very unusual. In this movie, supporting characters are maybe more worth than the two leads. Jake Gyllenhal and the Arab actor are greater - for my own taste - than Reilly and Phoenix. I did not appreciate it but that remains a good western, very unusual, I repeat.",The Sisters Brothers
8,ferguson-6,Audiard's streak continues,8,28 September 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. It was a good news - bad news kind of day for westerns. First, it's announced that Mel Gibson will direct a remake of Sam Peckinpah's 1969 classic THE WILD BUNCH. Talk about an undesired and unnecessary project! Fortunately, the movie gods understood this gut-punch and as a peace offering, delivered this near-masterpiece that doesn't so much re-invent the Western, but rather provides a tonal and stylistic twist to the genre. This is the first English language project from writer/director Jacques Audiard, who has previously delivered such powerful and well-crafted films as A PROPHET (2009), RUST AND BONE (2012), and DHEEPAN (2015). Based on the Patrick DeWitt novel, with a screenplay from Mr. Audiard and his frequent collaborator Thomas Bidegain, this latest is a very unusual film that teeters on satire at times, but is simply too bleak to be a comedy - although it's too darn funny to be an outright drama. A terrific opening sequence in 1851 Oregon features a nighttime shootout that sets the stage both visually and tonally for what we will experience for the next couple of hours. It's beautifully shot and there is some misdirection on what exactly the Sisters brothers are made of. John C. Reilly is absolutely wonderful as Eli Sisters, the soulful forward-thinking one who also has a dash of goofiness to him. His younger brother Charlie Sisters, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is the slightly unhinged one who frequently follows in his hated father's footsteps by drinking heavily. Charlie is alternatingly quietly menacing and drunkenly menacing. The two brothers are hired assassins, and while Eli dreams of a peaceful retirement, Charlie can't imagine not doing what they do.The brothers have been contracted by 'The Commodore', a rarely seen power broker played in brief glimpses by the great Rutger Hauer. They are to meet up with advance scout John Morris (played by Jake Gyllenhaal with a quasi-British accent) and kill Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed), who has supposedly stolen from The Commodore. Of course, there is more to the story. Warm has actually developed a chemical compound that allows for the easy gathering of gold from waterways - remember this is the height of the Gold Rush. This is kind of a road trip film ... only it's on a horse trail from Oregon to San Francisco, and it's kind of a buddy film ... only it's two brothers. Along the way, bonds are forged and broken, and paths are crossed with a kind-hearted saloon gal (Allison Tolman), a greedy town lord (trans actor Rebecca Root), and the brothers' mother played by the always interesting Carol Kane. There is also a cringe-inducing run-in with a spider, an unfortunate end for a favorite horse, and the hilarious first use of a toothbrush. There is also a Dallas joke that drew quite the laughter from my Dallas audience.It's such an unusual film, and it's presented with a non-traditional pace and rhythm. The moments of laughter surround a core with a dramatic story of destiny, the meaning of life, dreams and visions, and the greed of man. All of this is set to yet another terrific score from Alexandre Desplat and the visually striking photography of Benoit Debie. Director Audiard has delivered a bleak comedy or a comical drama, and he's done so with more than a fair share of violence. Whether you consider yourself a fan of westerns or not, this one deserves a look.",The Sisters Brothers
9,morrison-dylan-fan,"Sisters are doin' it for themselves, I Said, "" Hey, hey, sisters are doin' it for themselves""",9,13 September 2021,"Recently having gotten into the saddle to see the terrific Hostiles (2017-also reviewed) I decided to take a glance at Netflix UK for more recent Westerns. Finding his The Beat That My Heart Skipped (2005-also reviewed) to be very good,I was interested to find a Western from Jacques Audiard,which led to me joining the brothers.View on the film:Riding in with an excellent opening sequence of a shoot-out taking place in darkness lit by oil lamps, co-writer (with Thomas Bidegain)/ directing auteur Jacques Audiard & The Card Player (2004-also reviewed) cinematographer Benoit Debie dual weld the mythical escapism (a major theme in Audiard's works) of the Wild West with beautiful wide-shots and superimpositions along the blue sky mountainside.Contrasting the shiny blue of the sky above them, Audiard loads the brothers up with wonderfully bleak lit by natural light rich gloomy atmosphere haunting the Sisters brothers on the long road they take towards the new industrial revolution world that Morris and Warm are rushing in with.Riding into town with Patrick DeWitt's novel, the screenplay by Audiard and his regular corroborator Thomas Bidegain intelligently retain the humorous tone of the dialogue from the book in their adaptation.The writers build the cultural divide between the inventive, civilized future gaze into the Gold Rush of Warm and Morris, (played with great pent-up yearnings by Riz Ahmed and Jake Gyllenhaal) whose invention offer the chance of a decrees in the cut-throat outlaw life.On the other side and having the cut-throat life hang round the necks of Eli and Charlie, (played with a fantastic mix of harshness and quiet humour by John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix) the brothers brutally stick firmly to the traditional ways in searching for Morris and Warm with all guns blazing,as the Sisters are doin' it for themselves.",The Sisters Brothers

11,blanbrn,Drama and comedy type western that's fun and enjoyable.,7,24 October 2018,"From time to time I see a western film and with this latest ""The Sisters Brothers"" which is a pretty good film with plenty of elements and themes.
I decided to check it out. Based on a novel it's set in 1850's Oregon and the old west coast and the travel and journey adventure takes the viewer to San Francisco for a gold search. Along the way the film is blended with plenty of funny scenes of laughs and drama. The chemistry of the cast is in top notch form as the funny John C. Reilly and good Joaquin Phoenix light up the screen as brothers Eli and Charlie who have weight issues of family, doubt, worry and trust as they search for gold.Also you can see the themes of greed and old style action in the form of gun fights and blood being shed. Overall may not be the greatest western still it entertains with a blend and hybrid mix of drama and comedy all while trying to discover an old fashion gold rush find.",The Sisters Brothers
12,MOscarbradley,An instant classic.,9,4 May 2019,"""The Sisters Brothers"" is a revisionist western directed by a Frenchman but it feels like a classic; the idiom may be 'modern' but it's a film that will fit in any list of great westerns thanks to a terrific script, a terrific cast and the direction of that Frenchman, Jacques Audiard and I haven't even mentioned the superb cinematography of Benoit Debie.The brothers of the title are a couple of paid killers and their story runs parallel with that of Jake Gyllenhaal's more urbane killer as they all journey west in pursuit of a gold prospector who allegedly stole from the man who is paying them to hunt said prospector down. It's the kind of western Anthony Mann or even Budd Boetticher might have made but given a nice post-modernist twist by our knowledge of the western as a genre and of how cinema itself has developed since the western first appeared. The plot may be actually quite thin but is still sufficiently different from most westerns and Audiard does get terrific performances from his cast.The title roles are played by Joaquin Phoenix as the laconic, laid back brother and John C. Reilly as his more thoughtful and seemingly slower sibling and both actors do some of the best work of their careers in these roles while Gyllenhaal underplays beautifully the other hunter who befriends his prey, a superb Riz Ahmed. Here we have a quartet of great performances that far outweigh a lot of what is winning Oscars these days.The pace of the picture may be slow, as slow at times as the brothers hunt for their quary, but it captures beauifully a sense of the past that many contemporary westerns have denied us. These towns and their inhabitants look very much like the real thing and the landscapes reek of authenticity even though the whole film was shot in Europe. Should we ask more of a genre that has been around as long as cinema itself? The pleasures you get from watching a movie like ""The Sisters Brothers"" may be manifold but mostly they are the pleasures you get from watching a film you know is head and shoulders above most of what else is out there. See this.",The Sisters Brothers
13,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Mundanely bizarre and bizarrely mundane.,6,7 April 2019,"'The Sisters Brothers (2019)' belongs to that very real, cross-genre subset of stories that aren't really about anything in particular. Indeed, its title pretty much doubles as its synopsis, as it just sort of follows its eponymous siblings as they go about their day-to-day lives. Very little that happens actually seems 'out of the ordinary' for them, which is probably why the whole affair feels so 'run-of-the-mill'. I mean, it's not bad. It's just that it's neither unremarkably remarkable nor remarkably unremarkable; it occupies that almost bland space in-between. Moment to moment, the movie mostly works. It charts the adventures of its bickering brothers in rather broad sweeps, though these are interspersed with a few more intimate scenes. Its events are mundanely bizarre and bizarrely mundane. Nothing is treated as being extraordinary, per se, but plenty seems out of the ordinary to me. It's not realistic but it's not unrealistic. It's also not a comedy but it's not not a comedy, either (that makes sense, trust me). It's a film full of oxymorons. The narrative feels as though it was written linearly. It takes strange turns and stays where it ends up for long stretches. It also starts things and then finishes them within a couple of scenes, which almost makes them feel pointless and certainly makes them lack consequence (though, consequences are present elsewhere). The flick feels very long and, even, unfocused. It's never funny but it's quirky enough that it seems as though it's trying to be. This shifting tone isn't too much of an issue as it seems kind of cohesive, but it doesn't make for a sure-footed viewing experience or, even, yield any real results. Plus, the characters don't really change (internally) and their relationship remains the same so I'm not sure it can count as a 'character study'. It probably sounds like I don't like this movie but it's more like I'm having difficulty understanding it. Not in terms of the text itself but in terms of how and why it came to be. It's certainly an odd duck. With a budget of around thirty million dollars, its been a box-office bomb. It's easy to see why, frankly. How can it find an audience if it doesn't even know what it is? It's an indie movie, really, so it should've expected indie movie profits. The feature itself isn't bad, by any means. It just doesn't feel like it's about anything and it isn't all that engaging. Moment to moment, it works quite well; at times, it's rather entertaining. I think, in the end, it just needed to say something. 6/10",The Sisters Brothers
14,dromasca,a boring western,6,12 December 2018,"I find rather funny the debates about 'what was better - the book or the film inspired by the book?'. It's like comparing apples and oranges in my opinion. Literature and cinema are different arts, they use different means to express emotions or trigger thoughts, and books and movies cannot be judged using the same criteria. We can however compare the feelings and the memories we are left with after reading a book and seeing a film inspired by the same book. From this point of view my memories about the charming book that Patrick DeWitt wrote about the two brothers who used to be paid assassins in the Far West of the 1850s exceed by far my feelings after seeing 'The Sisters Brothers' movie which is bringing to screen the same story is based on the same book. Much of the humor, complexity of the characters, their stories and family background, as well as the light atmosphere of the book went loss in translation, and not enough was added instead. A few years ago, when I read the book and I wrote about it, I was guessing who would be the best directors to undertake the task of bringing the story to the big screens. Tarantino? The Coen brothers? Unfortunately (IMO, of course) it's the French director Jacques Audiard who undertook the task.I am wondering why the French director whose some of the other works I liked a lot decided to make this film. Maybe I shouldn't. Jacques Audiard is a complex film maker who explored different genres. In some of his 'black' action films he used themes and techniques imported from the American gangster movies, now he may have crossed the Atlantic with the good intentions to make a film at Hollywood, in the most American of the cinematographic genres, the Western, by using some of the methods of the European art cinema. It's an interesting proposal, but the result is not that exciting, especially taking into account that Audiard enrolled some serious acting talents like John C. Reilly, Joaquin Phoenix and Jake Gyllenhaal in his exercise.What I liked. John C. Reilly gets a great lead role and he deserves it for a long time, after many secondary character heroes that he brought to screen. His role is complex and developing as the story advances. Not so for the other roles which are more uni-dimensional, although seeing Joaquin Phoenix or Jake Gyllenhaal is always a feast and seeing both of them in the same movie is a double feast. Riz Ahmed completes a formidable quartet of actors who provide the best part of movie.What I liked less. Most of the time, actually all the time with the exception of the scenes that take place outdoors in full daylight, the cinematography is dark and blurred, to the point of being confusing. While we learn gradually quite a lot about the characters, the process is slow to happen, and not fully accomplished. The final of the story makes a lot of sense in the book because by the time we reach it we know everything about the history and motivation of the characters. Not so in the film, the final actually may be a surprise that I doubt that many of the viewers who did not read the book will understand.The western genre has its rules, and one of them is that one needs to be fast in deciding who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. Gunmen paid with their lives being slow. Movie directors pay by making a film that cannot keep its viewers interested. Actually, if I am to resume what I felt at the end, it was that I have seen a boring western. Not really an achievement to be proud about, despite it's many other qualities.",The Sisters Brothers
15,ThomasDrufke,The Sum < it's parts,5,25 October 2018,"I'm a pretty big fan of Rust and Bone, the french film Jacques Audiard made a few years back with Marion Cotillard. But I also know that French films are generally a different type of filmmaking than something you see in 2018 Hollywood. There's more amiguity and it's typically a story that doesn't necessarily have a paint by numbers plot nor 3 act structure. But even knowing that, I was a little letdown by The Sisters Brothers. It feels like it wanted to a few different movies all in one. A buddy cop/assassin film, road trip film, revenge thriller, and even a bit about an adventure to find gold. Not all of those work as much as they should. I tended to gravitate more to the serious side of the story and became less interested as the film leaned into comedy. But I do think Reilly and Phoenix have great chemistry and are believable as the titular characters. But I'm just not so sure the film completely comes together as the sum is not as great as the individual parts.5.8/10",The Sisters Brothers
16,westsideschl,European American Western,4,25 February 2019,"The first noticeable problem was the dialogue. If I turned off my eyes (i.e. stopped watching, and just listened) I would have been totally convinced I was listening to characters that were contemporary highly educated Americans. That was a turn off! Next problem is that the area in which it was suppose to be filmed is really beautiful. Although filmed in Europe, they could have done better. Lastly the story could have been more interesting - seemed so generic. Also some holes in the storyline such as the gold extraction chemical subplot.

17,tomgillespie2002,More at home with the revisionist westerns of the 70s,7,24 April 2019,"French filmmaker Jacques Audiard has made a name for himself by focusing on morally-conflicted lead characters surviving any way they can in an environment they have no real control over. Whether it be the brutal prison setting of A Prophet, the street brawls of Rust and Bone, or the Sri Lanka torn apart by civil war in Dheepan, Audiard seems most at home when tossing his lead character in the deep end and observing as the survival instincts inevitably kick in. There is perhaps no greater time and place to explore humanity at its most savage and uncivilised as the Wild West, so Audiard feels right at home among the shootouts, saloon fights and general lawlessness of his latest film, the curiously-titled The Sisters Brothers.Based on the novel by Patrick deWitt, The Sisters Brothers follows the titular siblings Eli (John C. Reilly) and Charlie (Joaquin Phoenix), two apparent opposites who seem to tolerate each other for their shared bloodline only. While their overall outlook on life couldn't be further apart, one skill the pair undoubtedly share is a knack for killing, and their exploits have granted them an almost mythical status throughout the land. They are hired killers in the employment of a shady businessman known only as the Commodore (Rutger Hauer), and their latest job is to track down and kill chemist Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed), who has supposedly stolen from the old man. Their journey takes them from Jacksonville to San Francisco, but the mission is plagued by misfortune. Encountering everything from bear attacks to venomous spiders to rival hired hands, these mishaps allow plenty of time for the brothers to reflect on their life choices and their future, if they are ever to make it out alive.As the elder of the brothers, Reilly's Eli hopes to eventually settle down and walk away from a life where death seems to await them at every turn. The drunken, unpredictable Charlie believes their lives couldn't get any better, and cannot imagine a world where his brother is not at his side. Little by little their backstories are revealed, and although he shares his younger sibling's flair for murder, it becomes clear that Eli's life would have turned out quite differently if he wasn't forced to pick up the pieces left in the wake of Charlie's destructive nature. The two actors are so good together that the film slows down when the action moves away from them, and more time is spent developing the relationship between Warm and softly-spoken private detective John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal). Morris is actually working with the Sisters, but has a change of heart when Warm reveals his water-based formula that will potentially turn the tide for gold prospecting.While these little detours slightly derail the film's pace, they prove intriguing enough in their own right. Despite the brutality of their surroundings and the natural hostility of the unexplored frontier, Warm and Morris are tidier, more articulate, and completely at odds with the survivalist nature of the anti-heroes of the title. They hint at a changing world, and the way the Old West is imagined by cinematographer Benoit Debie - shot in Spain - would be more at home with the auteur-driven revisionist westerns of the 1970s, but not so different to cause traditionalists to scoff. The key ingredients are all there: bursts of violence, whiskey-drenched brothel visits, and a long, perilous journey across country; but there is a sensitive, character-driven drama at its core. It was billed as a comedy of sorts upon its release, and although there are certainly laugh-out-loud moments, they serve only to reinforce the humanity lurking within its murky characters.",The Sisters Brothers
18,cruise01,John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix have a lot of fun with their characters in this dark comedy western film.,8,2 March 2019,"The Sisters Brothers (4 out of 5 stars).The Sisters Brothers is surprisingly a good western dark comedy film with a great cast, a good plot and script, and a well done direction. The plot follows Eli (John C. Reilly) and Charlie (Joaquin Phoenix) who is the Sisters brothers and is asked by the Commodore to do one last job of taking out Hermann Warm (Riz Ahmed). Warm knows a technique by mixing chemicals to easily extract gold from the rivers. During that time of the gold rush. Warm is being assisted by John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal).John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix were both great playing their characters. There was some fun dark humor. Reilly being the more sensible character. Phoenix has alcohol issues and can have sudden violent outbursts. Seeing the two work with each other on screen is endless entertainment. Jake Gyllenhaal is good too as John Morris. Who was also working for the Commodore but decided to run away from his task. Riz Ahmed was good playing a chemist specialists.It does have a good plot. And well paced with the script. There are a few shoot outs and some little action. But the film is all focused on the characters. Seeing Eli and Charlie travel from town to town searching for Warm. While getting mixed up with the other outlaws. It does have a lot of fun with the direction.Overall, The Sisters Brothers is a good film. It may not be the best. It has its fun moments with the characters, the plot, and the direction.",The Sisters Brothers
19,eddie_baggins,A western with a difference and two great lead turns,7,19 June 2019,"Somewhat of a forgotten film of 2018, The Sisters Brothers is a film filled with pedigree behind the camera and in front of it, but it didn't stop this darkly comedic and slowly paced adaptation of Patrick DeWitt's well-regarded novel from appearing and disappearing from many people's minds in the latter half of last year.It's a curious case of wrong place and wrong timing, as A Prophet director Jacques Audiard film is as assured as you'd expect from a type of a production that has genuine star power at its disposal and a relatively hefty 30 million plus budget, but the slow paced nature and quiet story at the heart of this Western tale is likely the reason why so many people forgot it even existed and why despite some genuinely noteworthy reviews, was lost amongst a raft of other prestige films in the awards season.While changing things up in more ways than one, Sisters is a fairly straightforward adaptation of DeWitt's pitch black and violently tinged novel that focuses on John C. Reilly's kind-hearted Eli Sisters and Joaquin Phoenix's Charlie Sisters, two-hitman/enforcers for hire who are sent on a quest by a man known as the ""commissioner"" to find their colleague John Morris (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and Riz Ahmed's mysterious chemist Hermann Kermit Warm, who has a debt owing to the commissioner.It's a simplistic set-up and one that is even more bare-bones when you begin to realize that the film's main concern is to allow you to spend time with Eli and Charlie as the two long bound together brothers begin to face up to the changing nature of their lives.This isn't a bad thing as Reilly and Phoenix make for great companions, with both performers sharing a believable and sometimes tense chemistry, with Reilly in particular awards worthy as Eli, a man that unlike Charlie, isn't as fond as killing and violence and is beginning to wonder about what a life outside of the business he is in may look like, but one that seems far away as a keeper of sorts of the drunken and depressive Charlie.Despite this not being a bad thing, and with fans of both performers likely in for a treat when watching Audiard's film, is does make one wonder that with more of an inventive and higher-stakes plot with a more zippier pace, Sisters could've been a genuine breakout hit and elevated itself up to a higher place than a merely entertaining, yet sadly instantly forgettable ride.With seemingly all the elements at its disposal, including a moody score from Alexandre Desplat and some picturesque surrounds captured courtesy of D.O.P Benoit Debie, this is a polished production with flashes of brilliance technically and performance wise but one that feels weighed down by simplistic plotting and a sense that there's a lot of time wasted on not of a lot of meaningful content, even if the films end coda is touching in its humanistic approach to its subjects.Final Say -For fans of DeWitt's book and for those followers of the main casts work, The Sisters Brothers will be a joy to behold but with meandering pacing and a persistent but non-rushed bare-bones plot, Audiard's film feels ever so slightly like a missed opportunity to turn this material into something truly special and undeniably memorable, not just a pleasant diversion.3 ½ spiders out of 5",The Sisters Brothers
20,howard.schumann,The Smothers Brothers they are not,8,25 September 2018,"The Smothers Brothers they are not. Brothers Eli (John C. Reilly, ""Kong: Skull Island"") and Charlie (Joaquin Phoenix, ""You Were Never Really Here"") Sisters, known to all as the Sisters Brothers, are deadly serious. Hired assassins who prowl the Old West looking for their prey, they operate at the behest of a mysterious figure known only as ""The Commodore"" (Rutger Hauer, ""The Mill and the Cross"") and go about their tasks with keen precision. Winner of the Silver Lion award for Best Director at the Venice Film Festival, Jacques Audiard's (""Dheepan"") first English-language film The Sisters Brothers is a Western that has more on its mind than Cowboys and Indians. Though it has its share of violence, there is nothing of John Wayne in the film and, may I add, probably very little of the real West.Written by Audiard and Thomas Bidegain (""Rust and Bone""), the film is set in the Oregon Territory in 1851 during Gold Rush days. Based on Patrick DeWitt's novel of the same name, the film features the love/hate relationship between two siblings, the volatile and alcoholic Charlie and his more responsible brother Eli, also a killer but with a soft(er) side. While Phoenix does his usual workman like job, Reilly is the real standout in his first lead role, showing a gritty determination with a side of humor and a touch of melancholy.The film opens with a barrage of gunfire as the two men raid a farm in the middle of the night. Their target is one man but there are six dead bodies at the end, prompting Eli to tell Charlie that we messed that one up pretty good (though he did not use that precise terminology). Always ready to stick it to his brother, Charlie declares that he will be the ""lead man"" on their next assignment. The brothers are far from incompetent, however, and have a reputation for being a two-pronged killing machine whose interests lie no farther than getting the job done. In their next assignment, the brothers are dispatched to track down, torture, and kill Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story""), a chemist and prospector whose invention of a device that is alleged to make gold sparkle and rise to the surface of a lake or river is coveted by the Commodore.Enhanced by a delightful score by Alexandre Desplat (""Isle of Dogs""), the brothers ride their horses over gorgeous Western vistas shot by cinematographer Benoît Debie, (""Spring Breakers""), though it was actually filmed in Spain and Romania. Capturing Warm, however, has been left to John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal, ""Stronger""), an incongruously elegant detective who proceeds to strike up a friendship with the articulate prospector that saves him from torture and death at the hands of the Sisters. Although their friendship may be primarily about a business partnership, Warm entrances Morris with his talk of a utopian community in Texas where everyone is equal, there is no crime or violence and presumably, like in the Norwegian folk song Oleanna, ""the cows all like to milk themselves and the hens lay eggs ten times a day.""Bickering most of the time and leaving a few dead bodies along the way, the Sisters find their way to California and eventually San Francisco where Eli becomes enamored with such modern inventions as flush toilets and toothbrushes, perhaps a signal that their way of life is coming to an end. Eventually meeting up with Morris and Warm, they try their luck at prospecting until greed, as it often does, gets in the way. Eli talks of quitting the life and returning to domesticity, perhaps opening a store with Charlie, but he will have none of it, saying that he has never known any other way of life and wants to keep doing what he's doing.The Sisters Brothers takes place in a Western atmosphere we are unfamiliar with. The two men are not one-dimensional gunslingers and opportunists but real people who exhibit a degree of self-reflection. As the film progresses, a transformation occurs that lifts the film to another level. After a poisonous spider finds its way into Eli's mouth, Charlie is forced to care for him and the brothers bond in a gentler, more caring way. Though The Sisters Brothers attempts to attain a balance between action/adventure and dark comedy, its message of human connection and the longing for a more just society strikes a responsive chord in an age overflowing with cynicism.",The Sisters Brothers
21,Tweetienator,Of Brothers in Arms,7,23 December 2018,"The Sister Brothers is a really good contribution to the good old genre. We get some unique ideas, a good and interesting story with some twists and a top cast with John C. Reilly, Joaquin Phoenix and Jake Gyllenhaal. Also the cinematography and the music score got some candy for the audience.Reminds me a little (because of the unique ideas implemented to the story told) of movies like Appaloosa, The Homesman, 3:10 to Yuma, True Grit.I dare to say, if you like those movies I mentioned, you will like this one too.",The Sisters Brothers

23,imseeg,"NOT your usual western, in a good way. Slowburning, true to life portait of the relationship between 2 gangster brothers. Great acting performances. Warmhearted direction.",8,3 April 2019,"2 gangster brothers on a journey to find gold. Will they find it, or will they die trying?Actor's movie, with an original take on the western genre, by focussing on the relationship between two gangster brothers instead of the usual gunfights and cool poses.Beware, this is a VERY slowburning portrait, nothing much happens in the first hour, yet I never got bored though, because the acting performances by Joaquin Phoenix and John C Reilly are quite mesmirising. They both excell in portraying true to life mean gangster characters, who I grew fond of near the end...For those who know the classic western ""Unforgiven"" by Clint Eastwood, that movie comes close to this one in spirit, because it also gives an alternate sobering portrayal of how life in the wild west was really like back then.Some tongue in cheek jokes can be enjoyed as well, when we see John C Reilly discover a toothbrush for instance. Or when he experiences an actual toilet for the first time in his life. Details like these make this movie stand out with subtle wit and attention for detail. The attention for personal feelings between the 2 brothers is what really makes this movie shine bright though. These characters increasingly become more interesting near the end. Because of the slowburning start a bit of patience in the first hour is needed, BUT that patience will be rewarded with an excellent final climax!Everything in this movie is done with lots of finesse, from the sober, yet original soundtrack, to the candlelight coloured photography, to the editing of this story, which slowly pulled me in and left me behind with lots of goosebumps at the very end. I felt as if I had made a long journey through the wild west myself as well...I definitely wanna see this western again. It really added somthing to the genre. I loved it, although it took me a while to get into the right mood of thist slowburning story...",The Sisters Brothers
24,paul-allaer,Ambitious attempt to revive the western genre has its ups and downs,6,14 October 2018,"""The Sisters Brothers"" (2018 release; 120 min.) brings the story of Charlie and Eli Sisters. As the movie opens, we are reminded that it is ""Oregon 1851"" and the Sisters Brothers are involved in a night time shootout (for reasons we aren't told). After that, they go to their next job: hunting down a guy who may or may not have stolen a chemical formula that makes the prospecting of gold easier. In a parallel story, we get to know John Morris, a detective looking to chase down the Sisters Brothers. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from noted French writer-director Jacques Audiard, whose earlier work includes the outstanding ""The Prophet"" and ""Rust and Bone"", just to name those. In this, his first English language movie, he brings the novel of the same name to the big screen. I haven't read the book so I cannot comment how faithful the film remains to the book. The movie is helped immensely by the two leading actors, John C. Reilly (as Eli Sisters) and Joaquin Phoenix (as Charlie Sisters), and in a sense this movie is a western buddy movie. But please don't call it a comedy (or event dark comedy), as there are very few ""funny"" scenes in the movie, (One notable exception: the excitement when Eli uses a flushing toilet for the first time ever, when the brothers find themselves in hustling and bustling San Francisco.) Jake Gyllenhaal plays a very subdued John Morris. Beware: I found the plot to be quite convoluted and it took me a long time to figure out who was going after whom (and why). Also annoying is that quite a few scenes are (purposefully, I'm sure) poorly lit, if not outright under-lit, making it difficult to see what the heck is going on. Bottom line: this is an ambitious attempt to revive the as good as dead western genre, and as a whole the movie has too many ups and downs to really call this a success. Nevertheless, it's always a joy to watch guys like Reilly and Phoenix do their thing.""The Sisters Brothers"" premiered to good acclaim at the Venice Film Festival last month. I recently caught it at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 10 people). I could be wrong, but I don't see this movie having a long life in theaters. Maybe this will find a wider audience when it expands on other platforms. If you like westerns, or are simply a fan of Reilly, Phoenix or Gyllenhaal, I'd suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Sisters Brothers
25,jamesrupert2014,Slow-moving and disappointing revisionist western,6,4 March 2021,"Brother killers Eli and Charlie Sisters (John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix respectively) are tasked by their boss the Commodore (Rutger Hauer) to track down and kill Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed) after extracting from him (by torture if necessary) the secret behind a chemical that detects gold. Unknown to the assassins, John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal), the detective that the Commodore first hired to track down Warm, has had a change of conscience and is now partnered with the inventor in a gold extraction venture. Typical of revisionist westerns, none of the characters are particularly likable (although the hapless Warm seems to be a bit of an 'innocent abroad' and a utopian dreamer). The four leads are all quite good but the slow-moving story just isn't all that interesting and too much of the 'action' takes place at night. Although often very dark (at times almost a black comedy), the film lacked the subtle supernatural feel of the novel (which I liked) and the plot didn't benefit from the alterations made to Patrick DeWitt's original story. The cinematography and music are excellent, and by the time the film meandered its way to a somewhat anticlimactic conclusion, I had grown to like Reilly's interpretation of Eli, the more sensitive of the murderous pair, but despite these assets, I didn't find the film particularly interesting or entertaining.",The Sisters Brothers

They're attempting to track down John (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Hermann (Riz Ahmed) - for differing objectives.I think the reason why this is an enjoyable ride is down to the aforementioned cast. Reilly, Phoenix, Gyllenhaal and Ahmed are very good, I approve all of their performances here. They definitely raise everything else up.There are some impressive scenes from the midway point, which is where the film really does get going; it's solid beforehand, though all of the good stuff comes late on.I think I expected much more from this, but it's still a film that leaves a positive impression on me.",The Sisters Brothers
28,kirbylee70-599-526179,FAMILY BOND,8,11 February 2019,"I've always been a fan of westerns. Sadly the genre died out after a long period of TV fare that was almost all westerns. But occasionally a good one pops up in theaters like SILVERADO or DANCES WITH WOLVES. When I heard a new western was coming out called THE SISTERS BROTHERS I was curious as to what that would be.Eli and Charlie Sisters (John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix) are two hitmen in the employ of a man only referred to as the Commodore (Rutger Hauer). The movie opens with them taking out someone the Commodore sent them to kill and then reporting to him for a new assignment. That job is to find Hermann Warm (Riz Ahmed) and kill him as well, the Commodore claiming he stole something from him.The pair set out and their differences become apparent as they travel. For one, Eli wonders why so many people would choose to steal from someone as powerful as the Commodore, questioning the tasks they've been assigned. Charlie defends their employer. This shows how Eli is the thinker of the two and Charlie more one for action. As they travel another difference is the fact that much of what they do weighs on Eli while Charlie is slowly evolving into a raging alcoholic, drinking and starting fights at night when they hit towns.The brothers are able to follow the path of Warm with the help of John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal), a writer and investigator for the Commodore. Traveling with a wagon train he befriends Warm while at the same time leaving messages along their trail for the Sisters brothers. He helps Warm purchase a horse and the duo head for Jacksonville. When Warm discovers what Morris is up to he knocks him unconscious and handcuffs him.But Morris breaks free and takes Warm prisoner. It is then that Warm tells him his story, how he's developed a formula that will make finding gold easier and that the Commodore wanted to steal it from him. Finding out the truth Morris frees Warm and the two become partners in this endeavor, continuing on west to the gold rush.The brothers find their prey has left Jacksonville and is on their way to Mayfield and they pursue. When they arrive they're greeted by Mrs. Mayfield herself who puts them up in rooms in her saloon. It isn't long before Charlie is drunk and Eli begins wondering if Mayfield isn't on the up and up. Sneaking Charlie out of their room they're confronted in the stables by a group of men looking to make a reputation for themselves as the killers of the infamous Sisters brothers. It doesn't end well for them.The pair follow more clues taking them closer and closer to Warm and Morris. Along the path Eli continues to try and talk Charlie out of continuing on the way they have and Charlie remains adamant that he enjoys his lifestyle. What happens when they finally reach Warm and Morris takes the movie down a different path with and ending most won't see coming.Watching the film the first thing I loved was that the production took the time to get it right. I've seen far too many westerns in recent years where people seem to be wearing newly purchased store bought clothes rather than the weather beaten items that would have been worn at the time. It's a small detail but it shows the depth the film maker is willing to go to make the movie seem real.This film had a fell that this was the real west, not the manufactured Roy Rogers type we grew up with but not so far into gritty realism it couldn't be enjoyed. Everything from the aforementioned costumes to the sets combined to make this a western in every sense of the word.The acting is stupendous with a standout performance by Reilly. Not an actor with the stereotypical good looks one expects he brings life to the character of Eli. Phoenix also delivers a find performance making his character not one to hate but to feel pity for. Fans of Gyllenhaal will be slightly disappointed as his role while important takes a backseat to the main leads.If your fans of the actors involved, of westerns, of movies that are willing to take a chance of going down a slightly different path than previously seen then this is a movie you'll want to check out. It was one I enjoyed and know I would have no problem watching a second or even third time.",The Sisters Brothers

30,Pairic,An Epic Western,9,7 April 2019,"The Sisters Brothers: A Savage Western but one which has a dark strain of humour running through it. Brothers Eli (John C. Reilly) and Charlie Sisters (Joaquin Phoenix) are hired killers, they work for the Commodore dealing death to those who have crossed their boss. The film opens at night in Oregon, 1851. Gunfire lights up the darkness as the brothers attack a house, they kill all six inhabitants. A barn is on fire and Eli tries to save the horses within, a cold killer with a sentimental streak. This sets the tone for what follows.The Commodore assigns a new task to them: kill a man who has stolen from him. A scout, Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal) has been sent ahead to track their target, Warm (Riz Ahmed). The scout though thinks of himself as a private detective and keeps a journal. Misfortunes beset Eli and and Charlie as they travel across Oregon, their camp is attacked by a bear and Eli swallows a poisonous spider. They then encounter a murderous Madam, Mayfield (Rebecca Root) who runs a small town. Morris inveigles his way into Warm's company and discovers that the commodore hasn't revealed the full truth.This is a Classic Western where all of the characters are rounded and their motivations teased out. The Sisters brothers quarrel like an old married couple, Eli worries about Charlie's drinking, Charlie fears that Eli wants to give up the life of a killer and settle down with a schoolmarm. Charlie is the more savage when it comes to killing but is dependent on Eli to protect him when he is drunk, something he will never admit. Warm is an idealist who longs to join a Utopian Community in Texas, he finds that he has much in common with Morris who is also a deep thinker. Even Mayfield wants to extend her control beyond her town, to become a crime chief more like the Commodore.The changing landscape is central to the film as the characters move through sage, to scrubland and mountain forests as they make their way down through Oregon and California to San Francisco and beyond. Wagon Trains, new settlements, gold miners and crime lord both petty and large figure in this tale of the Far West in a time when life was cheap and the law was the gun in your hand. The voiceover by Morris as he records events and sights in his journal adds to verisimilitude of this reimagined Frontier Age.Director and co-writer Jacques Audiard has delivered a lyrical Epic Western. 9/10.",The Sisters Brothers
31,truemythmedia,Interesting Characters,6,11 September 2019,"Trying to nail down the subject or focus of this movie isn't really an easy prospect. The story is fairly straightforward but the characters themselves are not. Neither is the tone of the film.The characters are the highlight of the film. They are each unique and stereotype bending examples of specific complexity and eccentric quirk.Eli is the older brother of the two and more soft-than Charlie. Charlie is the sort of man that drinks and whores more than his fair share and doesn't even see that his brother is protecting him from getting robbed or in over his head the whole time. Together, the pair of them create a dynamic wherein they are both protecting each other but are also enabling each other in their various vices.On the downside, this dynamic is not that interesting or compelling. I wasn't expecting to say that about this film. I normally like movies about brothers but I just found it hard to care about the characters and their relationship. In fact the film actively takes steps that rob you as an audience member of the time you need to get to know and love the Sisters Brothers.About 50% of this film is focused on another couple, John Morris and Herman. John Morris is scouting ahead of the Brothers and sends word to them that he found the chemist they are looking for. Normally, he would just tail Herman and keep an eye on him but Herman, and incredibly aware human being, notices John Morris and so far from being afraid that someone is after him, he is excited to make his acquaintance and travel with him.Through this relationship we find out that Herman has a formula that will allow him to find gold by just dumping the substance into a river. He is used to having people come after him for the secret but what he really wants to do with the money is set up a ranch/commune in Texas. When John Morris hears this, he decides he wants to join him.This idea was really interesting to me and and the characters seemed more fully realized. Unfortunately for me, these aren't the main characters of the movie. Every time we switch back to the Sisters Brothers i found myself wishing I was watching John Morris and Herman.I think the director was trying to make some commentary on family, money, an religion but it never got rounded out and by the end, I couldn't care less about whether the Brothers won, lost, or some combination of both.On top of all of this, the trailer and even the opening felt like this film was leaning hard on the Dark Comedy end of the spectrum yet as the film progressed it got to be more of a straight shot serious drama than I was expecting. The film had its funny moments, for sure, but a film with an all star cast like this one needs an all star story to bring it home and this one just didn't have what it takes to rise above a middle-ing just decent movie.",The Sisters Brothers

For me 'The Sisters Brothers' is a superior movie to these and the direction in places is superb. Both Phoenix and Gyllenhall, are two of the most talented actors around, though not really sure they suit this type of material, or the generic Western on a whole. 'The Sisters Brothers' is still an interesting entry to the modern western and the star of the show is the lessor known John C. Reilly (playing the other Sister brother).",The Sisters Brothers

(R)Sibling hitmen (Reilly, Phoenix) working for the mysterious Commodore (Hauer) are on the trail of gold prospector Ahmed in the mid-19th century, but get more than they bargained for when beset by calamity, gunslingers, and misunderstanding. Director Audiard's first English-language film is an enigmatic endeavor, not quite a revisionist Western drama, not quite a comedy founded on quirky happenstance and irony (and not at all a giddyup-n-gunsmoke horse opera), with odd details that are either ultimately unimportant or are critical to the plot bends (a dangerous compound that can be used to find gold in a river, Ahmed's dream of a utopian society, etc.). Moseys a bit slowly in the early going, it's not until the main characters are developed through operation, interaction and backstories that interest picks up and the weight of their journey is felt. Reilly and Phoenix turn in fine performances as expected; their understated relationship is what holds the sometimes poky and wayward narrative together. The shoot-outs are memorable for their stark messiness, especially the opening scene set in blackness where gunshot flames are the only beacons to follow.72/100",The Sisters Brothers

Their latest job involves finding a man who has developed a chemical mixture that when poured into a creek bed, will cause a reaction that makes the gold glow.That's all I'm willing to give up about the plot. If I had to choose, I'd say that the main character in this film is the one played by John C. Riley. He's the older of the two brothers and seems to be the one who is ready to make some changes in life. He did a great job with portraying the drama in his character.I thought this could've been a little better than it was. With such a strong cast I was really ready to see something special. This was a much more dramatic film than I was expecting. It had a couple funny moments but I thought there would be more comedy too. I think that maybe the biggest problem was that there wasn't a lot of emphasis placed on any specific dilema. Everything just kinda had the same sense of urgency or importance. It was a drama without focus or maybe depth is the right word.I didn't hate this film. I think that maybe I just went into it with the wrong expectations.

41,maurice_yacowar,Two sensitive brothers resist their brutalizing gunslinger careers,10,16 October 2018,"A Canadian novel, filmed in Spain and Romania, co-scripted and directed by a French director, not surprisingly casts an acerbic eye on an American cultural tradition. Here it's the toxic masculinity mythologized in the American Western mythology. 
 It starts in the title. The brothers begin as their family name, Sisters, but are driven by their abusive father into a patricide, then into the hired guns' violent cycle of deaths in life. Their colleague John Morris is similarly driven from gentleman to outlaw by his abusive father. The Commodore is the visible father figure, despatching his young men to kill until they are killed. 
 Extending the theme of brutalized sensitivity, the town of Mayfield is owned and tyrannized by a gruff-voiced, masculine woman, Mayfield. If we didn't know the actor is named Rebecca we'd take her as a man in drag. 
 The Sisters' mother has also done very well running the family homestead on her own, ready to blast away any attacker and even her own sons if they are coming to hide from the law. 
 The sons' homecoming is an explicit homage to the opening and closing shots of Ford's The Searchers. But unlike John Wayne's Ethan Edwards, these gunslingers can come in from the cold frontier desert; they can recover their civilized roots. 
 Her sons personify delicacy abused, a feminine nature struggling to survive their violent pattern of life. Eli is the more obviously sensitive, as he treasures a woman's gift shawl, chafes at his murderous career, and reaches out to others - the prostitute, the scientist, brother Charlie - with a reflexive tenderness.
 But Charlie may still be the more sensitive. After all, he carries the burden of patricide. He finds an outlet in the bravado of his drinking and killing, but he still whimpers in his sleep, even after pretending to, to trick Eli. He also pays the greater price, limb wise. 
 The dark-skinned scientist Herman Warm is the most feminine male character here. The utopian society he plans to establish - in (of all places) Dallas - is sensitive, generous, caring, free of profiteering and power systems. Its appeal not only converts Morris form his mission but drives him to accept his father's inheritance, to dedicate to that cause. 
 Morris and Eli share another sign of the creeping civilizing of the wild macho west. They are both introduced to the toothbrush, a radical encroachment upon their macho strut and breath.
 Is ""toxic"" too strong a term for the Western's macho spirit, under attack here? Not when you attend to the most dramatic metaphor in the film. Herman Warm's system is to pour a corrosive acid into the water, then stir it, to expose the gold nuggets beneath. But that acid also eats away the flesh, if the men aren't fast enough to wash it away. Charlie loses an arm and a hand to it, Warm the flesh on his legs and finally his life. 
 America's macho swagger may have delivered it some fortune, but only at the cast of flesh, blood, humanity. The lesson sticks. 
 There are no African Americans in this film's wild west, though there's a possibly racist sneer in citing one ""Sanchez."" The delicate Warm is played by a Pakistani rapper, Riz Ahmed, possibly evoking contemporary Islam. Director Jacques Audriard frames his vision of contemporary America very specifically here. His subject isn't the racial divide but the high cost of violent male privilege - not just to the nation but to the trapped individual soul.",The Sisters Brothers

43,Holt344,"This film isn't like an ordinary western, it doesn't try to be - Spectacular cinematography, acting and direction",9,6 February 2021,"The Sisters Brothers is directed and co-written by Jacques Audiard, his first English-language work.
The film stars John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix as the notorious assassin brothers Eli and Charlie Sisters and the story follows the duo as they chase down two men that's played by Jake Gyllenhaal and Riz Ahmed who have banded together to search for gold.
Incredible acting throughout the film, all four of them were terrific. John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix were best though, their chemistry were great.The story starts off simple but evolves into so much more, the script is great, with well written characters and a plot that keeps you interested. There's a lot of towns, cities and locations the characters visit and each is unique and non like the other, great production design. The story isn't the film's strong point though, it's the acting and cinematography as it's visually stunning, each scene satisfies your eyes... With great camera work, lightning, sets and overall authentic.
It's some of the best cinematography I have seen, I believe. Benoît Debie did a phenomenal job, one that will hopefully give him many acclaim and maybe awards in the future. The costume department did a magnificent job at creating clothes that are both authentic and also recognizable as you can see who the character is by their clothes, that's a nice and important detail.Alexandre Desplat's musical score is both powerful and mesmerizing, a soundtrack fitting perfectly with its time period.
The sound mixing and editing is also top notch, everything sounds real.Too bad that this was a box office bomb, but I can understand why. The pacing is quite slow and it is more about character development than action. The few gunfights that exists in the movie is quick and realistic, and brutal.
The Sisters Brothers is a must watch if you're a fan of the western genre, as it's one hell of a good western and a beautiful film.",The Sisters Brothers
44,RforFilm,"The Sisters Brothers finds some gold (acting and tone), but its anarchic story will stress those wanting something more straightforward",5,24 October 2018,"When it comes to westerns in film, they seem to sit within two different camps; one being more fun, such as the John Wayne films, showcasing the beauty of the deserts and canyons. The other shows a darker, grittier west, a lot like in ""The Man with No Name"" trilogy, which shows the west as more brutal and unforgiving. While I don't have a preference over the other (it depends on the story presented), it does honestly portray an environment that had different perspectives. Like a lot of people who never lived through a time period, we can only draw our own pictures on how we want to see the old west.There are even those rare instances in which someone can balance out both. That's not easy to do, given the distinct styles, but it can be done. There are even times in which the old west can be weird. A lot like those Mad Max movies, the frontier was so mysterious with little control, that the deserts and small towns could take on identities and looks that are all their own. We can see how these guys look compared to the rest of the west in The Sisters Brothers.Two hitmen for hire, Eli Sisters (played by John C. Reilly) and Charlie Sisters (played by Joaquin Phoenix) are in the pocket of a man only known as the Commodore, who take another assignment to hunt for a man named Hermann Warm. The brothers make their way in the frontier, but deal with a lot of dangers that were commonplace. Much of it includes a sickness-inducing spider bite for Eli and Charlie's constant drunken buffoonery. Even at a point where the two end up in their first luxury hotel that includes hot water and a flushing toilet, they still manage to fight and threaten to kill each other.Meanwhile, another detective John Morris (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) manages to track and confront Hermann Warm (played by Riz Ahmed). It turns out that Warm is on his way to northern California to find gold, using a new chemical substance that could help track it in the water. Though Morris initially tries to arrest him, he does become intrigued by the possibility, show he goes with Warm to see if this could be done. At the same time, the Sisters brothers are following them in hot pursuit, following their orders.I have to commend director Jacques Audiard for attempting more of a cross between these different kinds of westerns with a little comedy thrown in. The result is a movie that does have it's moments, but is going to come off as too dry for some people (including myself). The Sisters Brothers is something that I can completely call bad. There were moments in which I was getting board. A lot of that has to do with the writing, but doesn't have a lot of personality. In fact, a lot of it is unforgiving in it's cruelty and more random moments. It reminds me of similar writing on Game of Thrones. This is the moment that is either going make you like this or not.I will say that the best thing in the movie, are the performances. Even with the little personalities given, John C. Riley and Joaquin Phoenix, they do have a lot of good banter as brothers would. What separates them from another western team like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is that they are more vulnerable and even willing to make mistakes. This is probably the other feature the will draw audiences. This is one of the things that I did really enjoy.I think what throws me off is the structure and pacing of The Sisters Brothers. There is a goal of reaching these guys who say they can use science to find gold, but it can either become sidetracked and even abandoned all together (I won't say what happens). I think because there is a set goal in mind, it all matters whether the movie's material can offer a payoff. Given how little we know what the leads care about even with their flaws, it's hard to become passionate about the movie if it seems to not care.I'll give this five gold rush nuggets out of ten. Like the real prospectors of the old west, I too had trouble finding a goldmine, but I did find something of worth. I could see a lot of people getting into the more anarchic-style of movie with The Sisters Brothers. I can clearly see that this did come from a place of passion. I just don't think this was for me. Perhaps you may find some gold I didn't see.",The Sisters Brothers
45,carbuff,"Just no, no, no! French auteurs should not make westerns!",2,12 December 2019,"Somehow or other the French director was attempting to make auteur cinema with the ""Sisters Brothers"". Possibly a western of that type could be made. Possibly a Frenchman (or woman) could do it, although I'm having serious doubts after suffering through this total failure to say ""something"" (God only knows what) about existence with this horribly lifeless film. After all, we definitely know that Italians have made a wide variety of successful Westerns (from Clint Eastwood stuff to the incredibly funny ""Trinity"" series); however, this slow, plodding, film is an utterly miserable fail. All of the characters sound completely flat like they are simply reading their lines off their scripts, while periodically ambling through some admittedly spectacular scenery. The other person I suffered through this with also found it totally disjointed and pointless. As best as I could make out, the moral of this film is that life really sucked around 150 years ago for most people, which I already knew--it ain't actually even that great for a large percentage of people in the world today for that matter. I was hoping so badly for a new and different take on the classic western, and instead I got this incredibly lame, pseudo-philosophical rubbish. I could go on and on about what a total waste of time this movie is and to just ignore the positive reviews, but I think I've made my opinion pretty clear. I might be inclined to give this film one more star, but it's just way too big and too total a letdown.",The Sisters Brothers

47,juliankennedy23,I enjoyed the movie and was surprised where it took me.,7,29 April 2019,"The Sisters Brothers (2018): 7 out of 10: Two brothers (John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix) with the surname Sister work for a gentleman called The Commodore (the always good to see Rutger Hauer in a brief role), their job is to protect and expand the Commodore's business empire in the mid-nineteenth century American west through the methods of murder, torture, and intimidation.It's a western. Yay. It's a revisionist western - much less yay. The Sisters Brothers is, on the surface, an excellent film. As God as my witness however if I have to see one more revisionist western that seems not to realize that revisionist westerns have been a thing for the last eighty years; I am going to be forced to make ironic comments about the future while using a newfangled technology that is now part of our modern daily lives. You want to do something interesting make a regular straightforward western. That would be refreshing.The Good. There are large swaths of this film that work. The entire section in a town called Mayfield works so well one wants to cry out more of this, please.Tonally the movie does not go where you expect it to go. It is quite refreshing in that way. The Brothers Sisters is not a comedy despite some sharp one-liners here and there. The brothers' relationships, despite some carping about the characters below, really holds the movie together and elevates it over some of its contemporaries.The Brothers Sisters is also a very handsome production with an excellent cast and incredible set design. I was almost under the impression that they had wandered onto multiple sets of much more expensive movies. They recreate at least three frontier towns in The Sisters Brothers including an excellent and expansive San Fransico. You could have filmed a movie version of Red Dead Redemption 2 at the same time, and only the only thing you would be missing is the alligator swamp.The Bad: Joaquin Phoenix is the hot-headed impulsive brother that continually gets into fights and gets drunk to the point of passing out. John C Reily is the brother who wants to settle down and quit the life. As a whole their performances are excellent but through script contrivances each of them to have their moments. Reily gets it the worst by far.Here is the scene that still sticks in my craw. Now keep in mind this whole set-up is a one-off. Nothing that happens here has anything to do with the plot, doesn't reveal anything about the characters that had not yet been revealed and doesn't provide any entertainment on its own.The Brothers are in a saloon with prostitutes. Drunk wild brother Joaquin Phoenix has two hotties one on each arm and is getting blotto while quiet brother with a girl back home John C. Reilly drinks at the bar away from the ladies of the evening. But a girl catches Reilly's eye. She is uglier than the other prostitutes, a little chubby, and she seems shy hiding in the corner. He takes her upstairs, and they have a very awkward conversation which ends in the prostitute leaving in tears because Reilly is too gentle and kind to earn money from in exchange for sex.It feels like some Mary Sue self-insert fan fiction the middle of my revisionist western. I would love to say I have seen this done better before, but I haven't. Every time I have seen this scenario play out in film or other media it is always awful. The ye olde our hero too sensitive and wonderful to do any prostituting with.This is not how hookers work. This is not how they work now, this is not how they worked in the olde west, and this is not how they worked in biblical times. It simply is ridiculous on its face.The Ugly: If you love horses stay far away from this film. You have been dutifully advised.In conclusion: This is a good film. It's a hell of a lot better than some of its revisionist western contemporaries such as the Zellner Brothers 2018's Damsel. I enjoyed the movie and was surprised where it took me. I do wish the titular characters were less black and white and I also thought the entire enterprise had an air of pretension that did it no favors. Overall a good film.",The Sisters Brothers

""the Sisters Brothers is pure Jacques Audiard, so if you like his movies, jump on this one, it's pure gold. Audiard isn't a western lover, and that's so interesting how he got in the mythic american genre. It's at the exact opposite of the classic westerns, music isn't really western style, large spaces are not really shown (and that's not the subject, and it's not shot in Oregon or in California), and the shooting is shaky, confused and sometimes poorly enlightened (no beautiful shots, we're not in a Hollywood western, except ...).

49,joebloggscity,"Panning for Gold, this film is worth its weight in it....",8,12 January 2020,"Bit of a surprise this one. Despite the 'Western' tag, this isn't a run of the mill Western, and is more about the time & setting. Two self-styled notorious guns for hire (The Sisters Brothers) are tasked with hunting down two men, but there turns out to be more than meets the eye as one of the men to capture has a novel idea of how to obtain gold. As ever there are twists & turns and not all is as it seems.This film lives off the writing. The story is wonderfully told, and keeps you hooked. The title of the film didn't exactly appeal to me, but the wide range of actors present meant I was bound to watch this. You can't argue that this is a fine cast, and they all put their souls into the roles. There are really four leads to the roles, and their characters are allowed to developed. The key role is John C Reilly whose character is on a redemption story arc, a foil to that of his more volatile brother. You empathise and follow his journey, but also see how it fits in with the others.The film is wonderfully paced and directed, with some beautiful vistas and settings. That though turned out to be the key problem for the film, as despite all the great aspects, it never sadly pulled in financially enough to cover its costs. I think it could have been still made with a lower budget, and unfortunate that as this came out before 'Joker' became a big hit, it lost out on the chance to take advantage of Joaquin Phoenix's time in the sun.It's still a wonderful film, full of gritty & interesting characters, and avoids the cliches of the genre (and the Western has too many of them). I'd highly recommend it.",The Sisters Brothers

The story follows these brothers on their journey and whilst doing so they find out about each other and what is important to then.The film is a western but it has more story and heart than many other films I've seen, in fact whilst being slow in places this actually let you know more about the characters and so you actually cared about what happens to them on their journey and afterwards.Because of this, this definitely is a Marmite movie, you'll either love it or hate it, personally I hate Marmite but loved this new in depth western formula.If you enjoy story, characters and a true beginning, middle and an end then give it a try, if your into just simple shoot em ups then don't bother because you'll probably be turning this off.Rating 8 out of 10",The Sisters Brothers
51,kjproulx,A Boring Experience with a Fantastic Cast,6,16 October 2018,"Much like the horror genre for me, western films haven't been able to win me over as well as others. That being said, I was looking forward to this one, due to the energetic trailers and very talented cast all around. Sadly, this film only lived up to one thing, which was the cast. I don't expect much from westerns to be honest, because aside from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, or even the remake of 3:10 to Yuma, I haven't loved too many others. I still found myself disappointed in this one, however, due to the story being told and the crew behind the movie being so incredibly gifted. Here's why I'd recommend this movie if you're a fan of any of these performers, but why it's really not worth seeing as a whole.Based on a true story of two brothers who are on the run after multiple felonies in the 1800s, The Sisters Brothers dives into the dramatic aspect of their characters and pretty much becomes a road trip drama with a Western setting. That itself would interest me if someone were to sell the movie before viewing it, but the drama aspect is far too heavy for this sort of film. A duo of gold prospectors in Jake Gyllenhaal and Riz Ahmed are on the lookout, while also being in pursuit by these brothers, who are played by Joaquin Phoenix and John C. Reilly, respectively. The premise of this film is very interesting and different for this genre, but it truly goes nowhere that we haven't already seen westerns go a million times over.If you go into this film hoping for great performances and nothing else, then you might end up loving this movie, because these four performers in Reilly, Gyllenhaal, Ahmed, and Phoenix are stellar from start to finish. I felt riveted each and every time any of them were sharing the screen together, but that's where the greatness ends for this film. It relies too heavily on this cast to carry the very slow pace. The film begins with an action sequence and ends with a decent one as well, but the rest of the movie is a very slow burn that does nothing all that interesting to keep you engaged. Sure, you will learn about the backstories and life goals of these characters, but it's nothing I'll ever find myself wishing to revisit.With all of that said, this is a well-directed film by Jacques Audiard, who has been previously known for his award-winning foreign films in Rust and Bone, Dheepan, and many more. You can tell that this is a director that cares about his character on-screen and he definitely focussed the majority this filmmaking process to get that aspect just right because it really does show. These characters are fantastic. I just wish the movie itself was injected with a little more energy to hold my interested throughout the full 121 minutes.Overall, The Sisters Brothers is a competent film as a whole, with great direction and superb performances, but the rest of the movie surrounding those aspects just left me underwhelmed. I'm not saying the movie itself needed a gunfight every five minutes, but the calm score, subtle performances, long sequences of sitting around a fire or riding a horse, and even the comedic aspects that were played as light humour to deviate from the tense moments, all felt dull. I enjoyed watching this movie, but it feels far too long, due to the slow pacing. I personally feel that this film is a big example of wasted potential. I can't quite give this movie a glowing recommendation, but there are enough positive aspects to warrant a positive grade.",The Sisters Brothers
52,AhmedSpielberg99,The Sisters Brothers is a must-see hidden gem from 2018!,8,22 February 2019,"Love Western films or not, The Sisters Brothers will probably leave you more than satisfied, for it refuses to be submitted in a specific genre; it's equal parts drama, comedy, action, and even artistic! Every single frame is filled with arresting images and stunning lighting. Let alone the incredibly subtle metaphors Audiard weaves into the scenes throughout the movie. The score, which is by this year's Oscar-nominee Alexandre Desplat, also is hauntingly beautiful.Audiard has made a poetic Western in which the four lead actors work harmoniously. Phoenix, Reilly, Gyllenhaal, and Ahmed are all at the top of their game. Each one of them delivered what could be one of, if not the best performance in his career! They brought their unique, different, and often contradictory characters to life in their very own way. I can't single out only one performance as the best among the four better-than-each-other performances. Riz and Gyllenhaal prove that their terrific chemistry they had in Nightcrawler wasn't a mere coincidence. John C. Reilly has never delivered such a mature and ripe performance before; he is really at his peak! As for Joaquin Phoenix, I would only say that he wasn't only snubbed once by the Academy, but twice, if not three times, as I haven't watched Gus Van Sant's Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot. If there is an Oscar for best ensemble cast, The Sisters Brothers would definitely take my vote in 2018!The movie can feel a bit overlong partially due to some slow pacing at certain points. The other reason it can seem overlong is that because there are times I felt that the movie wasn't sure when it should end. Nonetheless, the journey our characters go through is anything but boring. It's insanely thrilling; as Jacques Audiard manages to convey its temptations, dangers, abrupt feelings, and twists to the screen.(8.5/10)",The Sisters Brothers
53,Blue-Grotto,American Grit & French Wit Combine,10,23 September 2018,"American grit and French wit, sensibility and cinematic prowess combine in this unique and alluring form of the traditional western. It is about time. The results are spectacular.Bounty hunters Eli and Charlie are brutal, efficient and effective. Charlie, often drunk, is impulsive and cynical, while Eli is more thoughtful and emotional. During the Gold Rush of 1851 they are trailing their mark from Oregon to San Francisco. Along the way they encounter thugs, spiders, mercury and frontier medicine at its best (or worst), and grapple with their fears and fantasies. Eli has strong feelings that violence invites more violence and attempts to get his brother to quit while they are ahead. Charlie, however, prefers action and meeting fears and uncertainties head on.There was a genuine and spontaneous expression of love for the film from the audience at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival. From the flashes of black powder in night to the music, cinematography, twists in the plot and quotes from Thoreau, there are so many aspects of the film from which to derive pleasure. The all-star cast includes Joaquin Phoenix (Charlie), John Reilly (Eli), Jake Gyllenhaal and Riz Ahmed. Reilly and Phoenix work extremely well together and the film is worth watching just to see their chemistry. The filmmakers provide realistic and refreshing portrayals of 1850s western hygiene (or lack thereof), clothing fashions, fighting, sex and roleplay, the environment and even bird songs. Modern language is employed, rather than awkward and confusing attempts to employ historical words and phrases that audiences no longer understand the meaning of.From the director of amazing films including Dheepan, Rust and Bone and Cannes Grand Prix winner Un prophete. Audiard said he intended to show what regular life in the West was like in 1851 and he succeeded. The Sisters Brothers was shot in Spain and France, with sets in Romania, but there was no way I could tell if Audiard did not say so. Something I do not often realize, but the editing is crisp and remarkable. The scenes seem so natural in their order.

My fave part was when they were in the brothel and Jon C Reilly wants the girl to hand him the shawl in a certain way. Had me cracking up and was imo the most memorable part. I liked Riz ahmeds character as well . I feel the part where everything goes wrong was too dark to see and I didn't understand what Charlie was doing and what was going on and the ending was a little confusing as well as I think at times it shows charlie with arms and then not.

In fact the only saving grace of this film was the acting. Great acting boring film, it's as simple as that. So the 2 hour film is literally wrapped around getting this gold and the two that find it just die just like that. 2 hours of nothing literally for me. I liked the bond the two brothers had but that isn't enough to keep me interested for 2 hours. You might see the film differently but when I see a wester film about two assassin brothers I expect a more exciting film.",The Sisters Brothers
57,Alexander_Blanchett,Fine western,7,31 December 2018,"Solid Western adaptation with two very dynamic leads. The story was quite interesting and but what really stood out was the great chemistry between John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix. Both excellent actors and both delivering great performances. I think the one I preferred was Phoenix, who proved some little attempts to comedy talent here. I hope he continues. John C. Reilly was also very effective and this is just further prove that this actor deserves more dramatic leading roles. He really nailed his character and gave him the right attitude.
Jake Gyllenhaal was also quite good. Also he was able to go beyond what was written with his character. Always good to see Riz Ahmed getting challenging work. He is a great underrated actor. Also loved to see him teaming up with Gyllenhaal again after ""Nightcrawler"" in a similar relationship. The atmosphere was right there and the look and feel perfect for a western. I had a little trouble with the pace because after a very good beginning the film started to slow down a little. Never lost its quality but really created some lengths after a while.",The Sisters Brothers
58,MrDHWong,A moderately enjoyable film of its genre held together primarily by its two lead actors,6,12 September 2019,"The Sisters Brothers is a western drama film based on the novel of the same name by Patrick deWitt. Starring John C. Reilly, Joaquin Phoenix, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Riz Ahmed, it is a moderately enjoyable film of its genre held together primarily by its two lead actors.In 1851 in Oregon, gunslinger brothers Eli (John C. Reilly) and Charlie Sisters (Joaquin Phoenix) are hired by a powerful businessman to hunt down a man named Hermann Warm (Riz Ahmed). Along the way, the brothers try to come to terms with their own personal problems, with Eli dealing with a poisonous spider bite and Charlie constantly drowning his sorrows in alcohol.Despite some solid fraternal chemistry between Reilly and Phoenix, The Sisters Brothers unfortunately feels bogged down by its overly familiar setting and odd pacing. The film takes way too long to truly become engaging, and while most other times that would come down to it being a slow burner, here it feels more like an example of weak creative choices in direction and editing. In spite of this, director Jacques Audiard does make nice use of the western backdrop during several establishing shots, even though they usually went to waste in favour of dragging the film out to extend its runtime. In addition to this, the supporting characters could have been used better. Jake Gyllenhaal's character did not feel implemented into the story as well as he should be, and several of his scenes felt as though they were there merely for the sake of exposition. However, as previously mentioned, both Reilly and Phoenix make the film watchable throughout the film's glaring imperfections and it was often great fun to see what their characters would do next. Overall, this hit-and-miss western may not impress all fans of the genre, but it may be worth seeing for the great performances of the two lead actors.I rate it 6/10",The Sisters Brothers

While the book was more comedic and violent, with a fast pace, the movie is much slower and focused on building up the four main characters, and especially the brothers. Reilly stole the show for me in showing the empathetic, thoughtful brother who struggles to balance his brotherly duties with his role as an assassin. I loved the background and nuance of the brother's relationship, in showing how their father shaped them and whether they kill out of necessity or by their nature. The ending was very strong, subverting expectations of killing the Commodore and reaching some agreement or separation, and instead going back home. The cinematography of the final scenes at home was gorgeous. The scenes are well put together, with a balance of emotion and humor, but it is quite slow moving and doesn't have any big messages or symbols hidden. I think the more someone was familiar with the Western genre and wanted a subversive character driven western story, the more they'd like it.

64,sweidman-28016,Overlooked Western,8,28 October 2018,"The Sisters Brothers Review:The Sisters Brothers follows two famous assassins, during the 1850s Oregon gold rush, tracking a good prospector. I saw this movie a week ago (it's been a long and busy week). I didn't know anything about the plot, just that it was a western-comedy with assassins, or ever saw a trailer. I just heard about it's critical acclaim and knew about it's stellar cast. I was a little concerned because it was a mix of my two least favorite genres. I really liked this movie, a very good western, though I did expect just a little bit more. That's probably because I never watched a trailer or read about it. Don't get me wrong it's a good movie. It's not even an issue. Alrighty, the story was pretty interesting. I was comedic at times and knew when to be more serious. There's a very interesting part at the end that was so original and you could tell everyone in the theater was really into it. It could be slow at times however. Though I do like slow films more than others, it felt a little slow. The setup for the film made it like an old movie and I loved that. There were a couple random scenes that had no direct affect on the plot but were just there and I loved them. They were comedic and enjoyable. The exposition was a little bit late for me but it made sense for the setup. The characters were pretty good. Obviously the standouts were John C. Riley and Joaquin Phoenix as Eli and Charlie Sister. They just had a perfect relationship. I also liked Jake Gyllenhaal as John Morris. They all fit for the role very well. The only problem with Jake was that he had an accent and at first he seemed to slip out of it a few times and I wasn't sure what it was. The cinematography was pretty, like most westerns just because it's beautiful there. The score was by Alexandre Desplat, winner of Best Original Score for The Shape of Water and The Grand Budapest Hotel (though it should've been Hans Zimmer for Interstellar), so naturally it was really good. Overall this was a good movie that will be overlooked this season since it's an independent company. I would suggest seeing it as it is one of the better westerns recently.My Grade: B+",The Sisters Brothers

John C. Reilly is really good in this, and if they ever make a live action movie of ""Shrek"", he will be perfect for it ... physically. I also liked his reaction to both the toothbrush and the indoor water closet!But... this is a slow moving story, even for a western. And the voice of Riz Ahmed had nothing ""western"" about it! His character's whole presence in the film seemed completely out of place, as though it had popped in from some Merchant Ivory film and uncomfortably picked up a pistol in the ol' west.

Two brothers who are notorious assassins chasing a gold prospector and his ally across 1850's Oregon.Jacques Audiard's film is captivating for the most part due to the four lead performances.
Riz Ahmed plays Hermann the gold prospector with a revolutionary substance that can illuminate the gold in them there hills.

There's also a brief but dialogue free appearance from the late great Rutger Hauer which rounds off an impressive cast.'The Sisters Brothers' won't be for everyone.
This is not an action packed western.
This film burns slowly and is subtle in terms of its storytelling and conclusion.
Humour is delivered occasionally by Reilly and Phoenix but I wouldn't suggest that this film is a comedy.

There's some wonderful cinematography, costume and set design.
This movie bristles with authenticity.

It is a flawless film, and definitely one of the best movies I have seen come out in 2018. It is a film with pristine balance and dynamic, and it's directed with great discipline. This is a fantastic first impression of director Jacques Audiard for me - starting with a masterpiece is a strong way to start! All 4 of the lead actors kill it and have incredible chemistry together. John C. Reilly puts in quite possibly his finest dramatic performance. Joaquin Phoenix fulfills yet another classic character for the books. Jack Gyllenhaal is astonishing in a completely new way, and his bromance with Riz Ahmed feels so right. The film starts out relatively slow as you would expect any movie taking place in the 1800's to do, but once the ball started rolling...I chuckled endlessly, I wondered, I worried, I cried, I was touched.

72,WalkdenEntertainment,"Great Cast, But a Slighty Odd Film...",6,24 March 2019,"Set in the year 1850 in Oregon, a pair of brothers are hired assassins for work (also known as 'guns for hire') and over time have inherited the name ""The Sisters Brothers"" (Sisters being their real surname and they are brothers). The two brothers, Eli Sisters (John C. Reilly) & Charlie Sisters (Joaquin Phoenix), are hired to hunt down a man who is known as a ""gold prospector"". This film shows us their journey as they encounter different people, towns and dangerous situations along the way.For those who are not aware, this film is in fact based on the well known novel by Patrick deWittFrom the opening of the film, the western theme was alive in the surround speakers as we are greeted with a night time gun fight. The sound of each foot step as well as seeing sparks fly out of guns grabbed me instantly. From an audio point of view, the film is creative and rather enjoyable.The Sisters Brothers film has been promoted as a comedy as well as a Drama & Adventure film. After watching the film, I honestly couldn't agree with the term ""comedy"". Perhaps this is depending on the viewer...
As the brothers ride and journey from city to city, many deep topics about their past and future are discussed. Many situations they get in are also dealt with more in a serious tone.Although our film is loaded with great performances and a great audio track, the film's plot... is a little strange and random to me. Like calling this film a comedy, the film's plot and viewer's enjoyment could vary from viewer to viewer. At certain moments I actually found the film a little confusing and slightly dull. I also felt certain scenes didn't serve any major reason or purpose regarding the film's plot and progress. To make matters worse, I even found the film's ending slightly disappointing (and random). At the end of the film I honestly didn't feel I gained much for my investment other than a well performed and a great sounding western film.As a performance, I must also praise the surprising work of actor John C. Reilly, who delivers a more serious character compared to what he is best known for (outrageous comedies). Joaquin Phoenix delivers a great performance but sadly he delivers nothing out of the norm. I was also surprised when actor Jake Gyllenhaal made an appearance on screen. For the sake of any spoilers, I'll just say he was amazing as always.Overall, The Sisters Brothers will get praise from a selected audience but sadly I don't appear to be one of them. While the film sounds great and is acted well (in particular from John C. Reilly), the film's plot at times can feel sluggish and selected scenes don't always bring a real purpose. As for the ending...5.6/10

73,jamesjustice-92,Those with loaded guns shoot once,7,2 December 2018,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie. With time I learnt to see only one thing in the trailer: eagerness. My eagerness to see the movie or simply skip it. And as you can see I didn't skip on this one.
The Sisters Brothers isn't flawless. It has its good and even great moments: wonderful music, brilliant costumes and set pieces, marvellous cinematography (especially the long shots), phenomenal shootout scenes and naturally the main characters played by John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix, they all make this movie a very enjoyable ride but sadly the one you'd take only once.
The main reason for this movie to not hit the mark (in my opinion) is the way it goes. Interesting scenes go side by side with fillers and it just loses it narrative. You can easily cut all of the scenes including Jake Gyllenhaal's character (who's very weakly developed anyway) and you will only win by cutting the runtime down to 100 minutes.
I liked The Sisters Brothers because it's full of different genres which makes it so versatile and fresh. But it also contains one of my most hated things in cinema as well - unnecesary and ill-developed characters, that's why it's a 7/10.",The Sisters Brothers

British detective John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal) was hired by the Commodore to locate Warm so he can be turned over to the Sisters Brothers who will most likely kill him.This is told like 2-stories between Eli and Charlie tracking Warm and John Morris scouring the landscape in gold rush towns to find Warm and he does. In time they all meet up and the Sisters Brothers find out that Warm has turned John Morris to be a part of his vision to get rich. Then Eli and Charlie are also convinced to join the partnership and go against the Commodore's orders.Do they find the Gold? Yes. Warm's formula for getting gold to just about to pop up in the river worked. How that is done is never explained, but something happens and sickness and deaths come on them. Very puzzling, and something should have been explained here. Didn't happen. These were very confusing scenes.If there were better lines this may have been more than watchable. The banter between Eli and Charlie was kind of lame talking about what to do after this job and Charlie wanting to become the new Commodore and Eli wanting to get out and open a store or something. Of the four main stars in here no one stood out, but we kind of felt for Eli as the most personable. I did enjoy Gyllenhaal's British accent. Not bad. This was something different in a movie where nothing was different or outstanding. Well, unless you count Eli seeing and using a toothbrush and powder for the first time; or his telling Charlie about a flushable toilet in the hotel room. But Eli's attempt at role playing with a whore fell totally flat.Some scenes were cut short when we almost lost the continuity. Some scenes were hard to explain why they were there in the first place. You'll see. In many, too many scenes we see the men eating while relating life stories.Notables: Rebecca Root as Mayfield, who the town was named after and she sent men out to kill Eli, Charlie, John Morris and Warm; Carol Kane as Mrs Sisters.Yes, the cinematography was outstanding.

75,harrylosborne,Janky,5,16 March 2021,"Westerns are slowly dying in the same manner horror films have: an oversaturated genre relying on big names and some nice visuals, but producing very little of substance.The Sisters Brothers is a prime example: a great cast with serious story potential, spurned by a lack of directorial drive. What really irked me from the beginning was some weird effects used throughout.Strange vignette filters and some weird continuous shots feel so out of place in this primitive film. There was even an instance of a fourth wall-breaking, which served no purpose either. The music was similarly disorientating, deliberately playing off-key notes; I will confess, I could not see the aim of this technique either, unless patronizing the film.The acting is serviceable (although the accents are so whack I was actually amused when I heard Jake Gyllenhaal speak), but the story doesn't really drive you forward (and poorly deploys comedic elements in a serious tale). I would give the settings credit, but again, how often do you see a bad looking Western? Drive an hour from any city in the American mid-west, you can find these views too.All in all, a weak effort, disappointing from the off, and an instance of when two hours could be spent better elsewhere.",The Sisters Brothers
76,Bertaut,A plodding and overlong tale of violence and redemption that doesn't seem to know quite what it's trying to say,5,16 April 2019,"The Sisters Brothers is a film set in the American Old West, based on a book by a Canadian, made by a mostly French crew, shot primarily in Spain and Romania, featuring a Brit as an American, an American as a Brit, and a British trans comedian as a ruthless American businesswoman. I don't bring this up out of mere frivolousness; rather, a certain element of schizophrenia is built into the film's very DNA. On the surface it's a Revisionist Western with a gritty Spaghetti aesthetic focusing very much on a group of anti-heroes, but it's also a story of two brothers getting on one another's nerves, a tale of avarice and the destructive potential of progressive thinking, a chase movie, a dark comedy, a tragic fable, an examination of the days when the Old West was giving way to an ever-encroaching modernity, a look at how the sins of the father are oft repeated by the children, a study of competing types of masculinity, and even a political thesis, postulating that there was a time in American history when certain people genuinely believed they could build a harmonious society based on direct democracy.The English language debut of director Jacques Audiard, who adapted the script with his regular writing partner Thomas Bidegain from Patrick DeWitt's 2011 novel of the same name, the film is very much of a piece with his more celebrated humanist work such as De battre mon coeur s'est arrêté (2005), Un prophète (2009), and Dheepan (2015). Unfortunately, it did next-to-nothing for me. I wouldn't say it's a bad movie, as it clearly has a lot going for it; not the least of which is an unapologetic foregrounding of character over plot. However, its episodic rhythm, bifurcated narrative structure, and poorly-defined morality left me unengaged, frustrated, and rather bored.Set in 1851 at the height of the California Gold Rush, the film tells the story of Charlie Sisters (Joaquin Phoenix) and his older brother Eli (John C. Reilly), hired guns working for ""The Commodore"" (a criminally underused Rutger Hauer). Far more sensitive and thoughtful than his younger brother, Eli is growing weary of the lifestyle, wanting to retire, settle down, and open a grocery store. The more unpredictable and volatile Charlie, however, wants to keep on killing indefinitely. Their next quarry is Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed), a mild-manner chemist who has created an elixir that when poured into a river, will illuminate any gold deposits on the river bed. Unsure of Warm's exact location, The Commodore has already sent highly-intelligent tracker John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal), a man too gentile for killing, to pick up his trail and detain him until the brothers catch up. However, upon learning that Warm doesn't want to use the gold for himself, but to help establish ""an ideal living space, ruled by the laws of true democracy and sharing"", Morris begins the doubt the mission. Meanwhile, the brothers are rapidly approaching.Very much adopting the visual style of a Spaghetti Western, everything on screen looks dirty and/or dusty, whether it's the worn and lived-in costumes, the spartan buildings, or the perpetually unshaven characters and their rotting teeth (an historically accurate detail absent in most modern westerns). Of particular note are the shootouts, of which there are three significant examples. The first takes place at night, and is shot from a distance and without much in the way of coverage; the second is shot primarily from the point of view of two characters doing their best to hide; and the third isn't seen at all - we remain inside as the shooting can be heard on the street.This should convey just how revisionist The Sisters Brothers is; the genre's tropes are all there, but they are presented from unexpected angles; men ride horses, but when a horse is mortally wounded, the man to whom he belongs cries and apologises; whisky is drunk aplenty, but one character would rather sit alone thinking about home; the anticipated climatic shootout plays out in a manner you'll never see coming.The film opens with an extraordinarily beautiful and striking scene. It's night on the prairie, and having vanquished their opponents, the brothers are about to leave, when they see a horse, its back covered in flames, galloping away, trying to outrun the fire from which it doesn't understand it can never escape. Realising the barn is on fire, Eli dashes in to try to save the trapped horses, whilst Charlie urges him to remain outside. Is the metaphor of the burning horse a little on the nose? Absolutely; try as they might, the brothers can never escape that which brings them pain, no matter how far or fast they run. But just because it's not exactly subtle doesn't mean it's ineffective, and as opening visual metaphors go, it's as striking an example as you're likely to find. The scene also immediately establishes the differences between Eli and Charlie.In relation to the milieu, yes, this is the Old West of John Ford, Anthony Mann, and Sergio Leone, but Audiard defamiliarises it as much as possible. A recurring theme, for example, is that this is a world on the brink of modernity. This is depicted via a running gag about Eli's fascination with a curious modern invention (the toothbrush), and his childlike glee at staying in a hotel with indoor plumbing. Elsewhere, Morris remarks on how quickly the country is changing, writing, ""I have travelled through places that didn't exist three months ago. First tents, then houses, then shops, with women fiercely discussing the price of flour."" Additionally, Warm's progressive egalitarian vision for the future allows the film to examine the belief (however short-lived) that out of the lawlessness, land thievery, and Native American genocide, a certain section of the populace hoped a more mutually beneficial society might arise.However, Audiard is not naïve enough to suggest that the Old West was especially peaceful or safe. But even here, he subverts the genre, using a recurring motif of either Charlie or Eli shooting an already downed opponent pleading for his life, which is certainly not what we've come to expect from the protagonists so familiar in Hollywood westerns.In terms of acting, Phoenix, Gyllenhaal, and Ahmed all have moments to shine (a monologue in which Morris describes his hatred for his father is especially worth looking out for), but this is Reilly's film. His nuanced performance allows us to see just how badly Eli's conscience is affecting him, and how much he is drifting away from the increasingly amoral Charlie. His unexpected affection for his horse is especially poignant, and his tendency to sniff a shawl given to him by his girlfriend is beautifully played.However, for all this, I really disliked the movie. For one, I found it far too episodic, lurching from one incident to next with little in the way of connective tissue between them. I also didn't particularly like the shifts in focus from the brothers on the one hand to Morris and Warm on the other, making it impossible for either to fully settle. A knock-on from this is that it's difficult to figure out where one's empathy is supposed to lie. This difficulty becomes especially problematic in relation to the morally questionable dénouement, in which there is an incident which seems designed for the audience to roundly condemn one of the main characters, only for the film to then give us a 15-minute epilogue seemingly designed to redeem him.This throws into relief what for me was the most egregious problem - none of what we see seems to mean anything, there are virtually no consequences for anything the brothers do (although plenty of consequences for others). This left me scratching my head as to what the film is trying to say. Is it suggesting that even the most morally repugnant of men deserve a shot at redemption? If that is the case, however, its rhetorical position is not especially cogent, as the character mentioned above in no way deserves redemption, allowing his greed and stubbornness to cause untold suffering to others whilst he gets off relatively scot-free. The film is also far too long, and could easily have lost a half hour or more.As a kind of an aside, it's also worth mentioning an aesthetic decision that has me baffled. On occasion, the film is shot within a circular frame (think of how films often simulate POV through a telescope), often combined with racked focus and unsteady photography. I'm assuming the idea is to try to replicate the style of a Kinetograph, but given that that device wouldn't be invented for another four decades, I'm not entirely sure what the point is. An especially strange example is a scene in which Charlie speaks direct-to-camera, the only example of such in the whole film. Is this a break in the fourth wall, and if so, why? If it isn't a break, from whose POV is the scene shot?The four performances at the heart of The Sisters Brothers earn it a great deal of leeway. But even taking that into account, I just couldn't get into it. Far too plodding and thematically unfocused, it's certainly original in how it approaches generic tropes, and that's to be commended, but the imprecise and poorly constructed episodic narrative saps away the good will built up by the aesthetic design and the acting. Is it a western? A comedy? A tragedy? An esoteric political piece? A realist depiction of greed trumping idealism? In the end, it doesn't seem to know itself, trying to be many things, and ending up being none of them.",The Sisters Brothers

I loved that it wasnt a typical shoot em up western and had some heart and soul in it. It was quite a sad film at times. A couple nitpicks though. It is very dialogue heavy. And it didnt need to be. Like, we can establish that Eli has a girl back home that he misses by him taking out the shawl every night, we dont need a scene of Charlie literally explaining that to us. That could have been cut out, which is the other problem is that this film felt long. Could have been edited down for sure. But overall I liked the film.

79,peeedeee-94281,Misled by the Trailer,2,17 October 2018,"Let's just get this out of the way: What you see in the trailer is NOT how the movie plays out. The trailer is fun, it's witty, they even use a contemporary song to make the movie feel hip. But then you sit down and watch the film, and you're like 'whaat?' 
The tone and pacing was all over the place. This wasn't a buddy movie, nor was it a western in the true sense. This was a euro drama set in the 1800s. There were so many extraneous scenes and moments that I swear the director should have just found another editor. None of the alleged comedic moments played out in a humorous way, the comic timing was off or non-existent. The movie meanders all over the place with the plot, and just when you think it made it's point, it just keeps going on and on. And it just doesn't make any sense. I mean, what happened to all that gold that supposedly they found? They just up and left everything just so they could head back home and lie on their beds? Yes, I know there was a pointless part in between all of that (no explanation as to what happened, or even why there weren't any of the Commodore's men standing around when the Sisters Brothers showed up).
And what was with Jake Gyllenhaal's accent? Was he a southerner or not? He couldn't keep that straight. It reminded me of Keanu in Bram Stoker's Dracula and his disappearing english accent.
If you never see this film, you'll not be missing anything. This doesn't add anything to the western genre. Steer clear of this stinker.",The Sisters Brothers

81,scb_coldsteel,A dark and nihilistic western thick on dialogue and atmosphere.,8,30 October 2018,"So I saw The Sisters Brothers at the theater. I really didn't know what to expect from the movie going in. The trailer made it seem to be a strange buddy comedy western, but I'm a fan of all of the actors so I wanted to give it a chance. Thankfully this was a case of an absolutely misleading trailer. I really enjoyed the end product and think this is one of the best westerns made in years.The movie is a gritty and at times nihilistic western heavy on atmosphere and dialogue. The film tells two parallel stories that eventally connect as the bounty hunters the Sisters Brother chase after their prey a scientist who has discovered an efficient way to find gold. Along the way both parties encounter struggles that really emphasize the hardships of that era. This is not the kind of western with good and bad guys. Everyone is morally grey and is just trying to survive the best they can.Anyone looking for an grand and extravagant plot should look elsewhere. The movie is far more about the journey than the destination. The initial conflict acts as a MacGuffin. The real meat of the plot is more of a character study on the brutality of the wild west and the impact it has on the individual. The film plays with traditional Hollywood tropes and the audience's own expectation to craft it's own unique voice of the era.The brutal nature of the film was one of my favorite parts. The film really ripped away the glamour of a silver screen western and left it bleeding on a table. The movie makes it clear that life was hard, fast, and cheap. A random spider bite, visit to the doctors, or drunken hangover on a horse could easily end a person's life. There was no time for finding something to make you happy when everyday was a struggle to survive. This added realism really captured the nihilistic feel of the movie and added a bleak and somber tone to the film's progression.The film was also very well directed and shot. The cinematography of the action scenes were fast and fluid, but never felt choppy. This by no means the kind of western with epic battles, but the action suited the overall tone of the film. The director also really did a good job with the set pieces as you really felt like you were in the wild west. The film was exceptionally well shot. The films at times was absolutely stunning to look at. The film also provides an excellent score to match the intense atmosphere the film cultivates.Acting wise John C Reilly stole the show. It's always nice to see him in films like this to remind everyone what kind of range he has as an actor. Joaquin Phoenix also delivers as the alcoholic and and fast tempered brother. Jake Gyllenhaal was solid as expected, but didn't really stand out in any way in the film. Still I don't have a single complaint about the acting in the film. Everyone did their jobs perfectly.The film certainly was a very slow burn. It was heavy on dense dialogue and required quite a bit of attention. These are not negatives in my book as they were intentional, but this will not make people happy who are looking for a more traditional western. I will say that the film could have been cut down twenty or so minutes to speed up the flow of the plot. This slight pacing issue did make the film drag at times. The plot structure may be a bit of a turn off for some as well. The bleak and nihilistic flow of the film that puts the initial conflict as secondary may come across as anti-climatic for some.In a lot of ways this is one of my favorite westerns I've seen in years. I love the actors, but it's the directors masterstrokes that really makes this movie stand out. It was all around one of the best made movies I have seen all year. It certainly had its flaws and it is not going to make anyone happy if they are expecting a traditional Western, but for those who care more about the journey and atmosphere this movie is for you. Unfortunately this movie is bombing in the box office, but it certainly deserves some praise for its accomplishments. A 8.25 out of 10.",The Sisters Brothers
82,Slarkshark,Don't Sleep on these Brothers,9,16 April 2021,"An incredible cast delivers a memorable western. Three of my favourite actors with Gyllenhaal, Phoenix, and Reilly are of course not surprisingly great in their roles, especially the latter two as the brothers. Riz Ahmed was also good and has done some very good work over the last few years.The attention to detail was noticeable, such as just how it would be to live in a time like that. I felt immersed in the story and the brothers life. Phoenix was hilarious, but also possessed a real darkness. Reilly again shows that he has tremendous range, and you can't help but feel for his character.'Hostiles' is my favourite western in recent years, but 'The Sisters Brothers' is well up there. It's tragic, but has a satisfying peaceful ending. I couldn't help but wonder what ended up happening with his lady friend though; I felt as though that was built up throughout and ultimately not addressed.",The Sisters Brothers
83,js-66130,BEST WESTERN,8,15 October 2018,"John C. Reilly's giddy reaction to a flushing toilet, or his clumsy introduction to teeth brushing, are but a few of the little gems sprinkled throughout this Gold Rush western. Not technically a comedy, ""The Sisters Brothers"" has just enough tiny smile inducers mixed in with a languid pace and stark violence to rank among the best westerns of recent yore. With Joaquin Phoenix, Riz Ahmed (both very good) and Jake Gyllenhall (excellent as a proper dandy with flowery language), we have an odd buddy-buddy vs. buddy-buddy road movie. Jacques Audiard directs directly from the Coen Brothers school of clever period pieces, starting the show with an after dark, distant gun battle, that's as mysterious as it is beautiful. The line between good and bad guys is in flux, but Audiard knows how to elicit sympathy towards the Brothers, even as the ruthless hit men set about their messy business. ""The Sisters Brothers"" is a beautifully shot epic, with some charming performances, an intriguing Gold Rush plot line, and a sensitive dip into the complicated brotherly pool.Strike!",The Sisters Brothers

Reilly and Phoenix post commanding performances, in contrast with Jake Gyllenhaal's minor and rather meaningless part, Audiard's direction is extremely competent, and even the musical soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful and strangely fitting, given its modernity.The script is also quite gripping though, as indicated above, Gyllenhaal's role could have been removed and would not have been missed. Riz Ahmed's part is more substantial, but I could not help thinking that there must been very few Asian Indians in the old West of the 1850s, and his presence is rather distracting, especially a large number of close-ups of him, which seem irrelevant at best.",The Sisters Brothers
86,PotassiumMan,"Gritty, old school western with a biting sense of humor",8,10 November 2018,"It's always good to discover that they still make high-quality westerns every now and then. This one has the all the classic foibles, including dark humor and a morality tale at the heart of things. It has an edgy sense of western mayhem from the very beginning.Joaquin Phoenix and John C. Reilly are two feared outlaw brothers who are hired by a wealthy baron, The Commoner, to assassinate an up-and-coming entrepreneur (Riz Ahmed) who has found an innovative way to mine gold with the use of a raw chemical. With the gold, Ahmed's character hopes to build a utopian society and he develops a close friendship a local detective (Gyllenhaal in a studied performance) who has intercepted the brothers' assignment. This is a great western tale about conflicting loyalties and the blur between sense of duty and greed. The four principals make this an awfully enjoyable film to watch.John C. Reilly gives the most compelling performance as the conscience of the two brothers, one who is eager to move on to a more honest living, while his wild-eyed, loose cannon brother, Phoenix, cannot imagine a life without crime and refuses to abide such a notion. They play off each other quite well. Gyllenhaal and Ahmed once again work well together. And the cinematography here depicting the American West is truly exceptional.This film's modest approach and low-key style will not win everyone over but it's still a gripping, old school tale that will leave a haunting mark, long after the final frame. Highly recommended.",The Sisters Brothers

88,MoistMovies,Comedy? Not at all. But a solid little film none the less.,7,1 January 2019,"It is not a brooding dark western. Would you call Butch cassidy and the sundance kid a comedy? No. It has a similar genre to that style of western. Light hearted in some parts; more sombre in others, but not overly gut wrenching.
Not a grand adventure, but i would say that genre fits well as a small scale type adventure.
The scenery was very beautiful, but to be frank. Pretty much all non low budget westerns are. As its one of the easier genre type films to get incredible scenery without having to use any prop work, or going outside of the country of origin. Tho the cinematography was top notch, and that isnt always a constant in some westerns. America still has a ton of unspoilt landscapes that fit perfect in this type of film, and they used it quite well.
The Acting wasn't anything to write home about, but it wasnt bad either. Everyone did a adequate job.

It would have made more sense to have them played by men in their late 20s or 30s.There's some gunfights where a lot of people are killed, but the brothers are left without a scratch. It would have been more realistic if the gunfights were 2 vs 2 with the results being the same.Some parts of the movie are dull. The attempts at humor generally failed, and were just boring to watch. The dialogue between the brothers is far from interesting.The ending is rather poor, if you think about it - but I won't go into details that would make for a spoiler.I can understand why it bombed - it shows word of mouth is more important than critics reviews.",The Sisters Brothers

92,domtaylor,It has all the right pieces but doesn't know what to do with them.,6,20 April 2019,"'The Sisters Brothers' is one of those films that just sort of exists, without really trying to do or say anything of note. There's no real through-line to the narrative; it just follows seemingly unrelated events that the brothers experience, with the only real link being that they follow on from each other. The lack of a 'proper story' means that it's never really all that engaging or interesting. That being said it's far from boring, with some of the sequences being quite entertaining. Phoenix and Reilly are excellent throughout, too, and the assured direction means that it's a confidently crafted piece, so there's always a base level of investment there. The protagonists initially seem to be well-grounded, realistic characters, and their similarities and differences lead to a convincing brotherly duo. It's unfortunate, then, that despite their strong formation they aren't necessarily 'good characters'. Throughout the film they don't really change, and this lack of arcs makes the whole affair seem kind of pointless in the end. It could have, and probably should have, been a character study; most pictures of this ilk - those not following a traditional 'three-act' narrative, that is - tend to focus on delving deep into developing core characters, so it's a shame that this picture doesn't even manage that. Like I said though, it never manages to be boring - even if you can feel the length at times - and the direction and performances (Gyllenhaal and Ahmed are good, too, despite being severely underused) are always engaging. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it has all the right pieces, but it unfortunately just doesn't know what to do with them. 6/10",The Sisters Brothers
93,Ziglet_mir,Another Great Film of Its Genre,7,21 June 2019,"A stud line-up produces a solid modern western in a time when the genre has certainly lived way passed its prime. Never really dead, The Western, proves time and time again that even with its typical tropes, run-of-the-mill grizzled outlaws, and the learned sheepish ""city"" man that set out to settle for a better life; to risk all they knew to find the dream, that the genre still has something to give us.The Sisters Brothers gives us a character study that focuses on the fraternity of brotherhood, and in this case, a very close look at a twisted one that at its core finds the fundamental values of what it means to be a brother. We have all seen Joaquin Phoenix play this type before; reckless and obstreperous, while we find Jake Gyllenhaal and Riz Ahmed sharing screen time (again). But this is truly John C. Reilly's movie, who at first, is certainly overlooked and shown to us as the ""lesser"" brother. As we come to find out the truth we see the foils of Reilly's and Phoenix's character come full circle; ultimately seeing how their past has affected them. We notice (indirectly) how father figures are important role models, and to some extent we even get a taste of the affect mothers have on their kids as well as we see traits of either parent in both brothers as they film goes on. Reilly gets his iconic moment and really the final statement of how far he will go to protect his brother when the time comes, and it is awesome. Certainly the highlight of the entire film for me.At times slow, the film has moments of wittiness and subtle humor that remains fresh throughout. The Sisters Brothers is definitely worth seeing as it makes its statement as a film of its genre with great performances, especially from Reilly.",The Sisters Brothers

97,RMurray847,"Violent, funny, bittersweet and altogether surprising.",8,8 January 2021,"What attracted me to this film was the prospect of Joaquin Phoenix and John C. Reilly as brothers...particularly as brothers playing essentially guns-for-hire in a Western. I suspected it would have a flavoring of Coen Brothers (it does...in its quirky characters, unexpected dialogue flights-of-fancy and its casual violence). It's also got a bit of Larry McMurtry (yes, it's a Western...but it works really hard to take you down unpredictable paths and sometimes, bad things happen randomly to good people).The Sisters work for a mysterious crime lord ""The Commodore"" in 1850's Oregon. They do the dirtiest of his dirty work. They are sent to track down someone who has ""stolen"" from the Commodore (Riz Ahmed) and are to meet up with another gentleman (Jake Gylenhaal) who is already on Ahmed's trail. We see Gylenhaal meet and become sort-of friends with Ahmed, and the two men lead the Sisters Brothers on a wild chase into Gold Rush country. Adventures are had on the way, and the final third or so of this lengthy movie takes turns that are so unexpected, I won't even hint at them here...except to say that these moments are touching and frustrating and show the film at its most ""McMurtry-esque.""So, the plot is nicely complex without being too much. The events that occur are dramatic and well-done. The film peppered with small, interesting performances. And Ahmed and especially Gylenhaal do very nice work here. Jake is quite effective. But the film belongs, as I had hoped, to its two stars.Phoenix has been giving some interesting performances lately, including this film and the underseen HE WON'T GET FAR ON FOOT. He has aged perfectly into playing these reckless, fatalistic characters...world weary, driven to reckless action by a desire to DO instead of THINK (or reflect). His Sisters is the one eager for the fight, but also the more cunning brother. It takes a LONG time to warm up to this guy.Reilly is the real reason to see this film. I think back about 20-23 years, when he was in great, generous, bursting-with-goofy life supporting performances in films like BOOGIE NIGHTS, MAGNOLIA, CHICAGO and even the woeful THE PERFECT STORM. A great, likeable lug. Yet, in films like MAGNOLIA, even when surrounded by massive star power...he became the one we rooted for. The one we related to. His less than movie star visage, couple with an emotional openness just made him so much fun to watch. Then his career evolved into broad comedies (so many with Will Farrell) that made him so popular (TALLADEGA NIGHTS is the prime example). But even then (see WALK HARD, please), there was a humanity and a sense of being grounded in reality that he couldn't shake off. But seeing THE SISTERS BROTHERS took me back to his early days, when his simple, authentic, open style made him so effective. I was thrilled to enjoy him in such a role again...and it's extra great because he is really a co-star and not a supporting actor here. He and Phoenix play off each other particularly well, and I strongly encourage fans of quirky but flawless performances (with strong stomachs) spend a couple of hours with this unforgettable pair.",The Sisters Brothers

The bleak climax is upended by earlier (failed) attempts at humor, and any poetic resonance from its myriad themes never come to pass.

104,suprabhattacharya,Well..it's Reilly who really deserves Oscar nomination,9,3 January 2019,"French stalwart filmmaker Jacques Audiard's(A Prophet,Dheepan)debut hollywood venture involves a great cast in this western based on the infamous sisters brothers i.e the assassin duo Charlie and Eli Sisters(phoenix and reilly respectively).The film revolves down their chase of the gold prospector Hermannn(Riz Ahmed)who has allegedly stolen from a man who likes himself to be called Commodore.
This is quite offbeat western to watch for...funny at times,calm and completely devoid of dialogues sometimes ,thus emphasizing on a weird silence.The 19th century gold prospectors used to travel long,rough ,trecherous paths,climb steep mountains in search of gold,no restrictions issued by government,no limitations in amount to be prospected..life was tiresome but also simple..so was their life more happier?This is a question which deserves to be answered but I think no one can't give properly.The cinematography of the film is good enough to achieve awards and also the background music by Alexandro Desplat.Audiard is not only a brilliant storyteller but also an expert in analysing a character(for example malik in A Prophet),thoughtful and very cautious in knitting a good story. Riz Ahmed brings on the genuineness in his role who wants to prospect not only for his own purpose but for utilising them for development of civilization.Riz Ahmed previously proved his calibre in 'night of','four lions'and 'nightcrawler' but this time he has adopted a completely different role in which he has completely scored full marks.Gylenhall as John Morris is vigilante on his role as the person also sent by commodore to hold on Hermann till the sisters brothers arrive but also we saw a change in his motive in the midway of the film.Phoenix(charlie) the younger of the sisters..alcoholic,immature was completely believable and shares a good chemistry with John Reilly who plays his elder brother Ellie.The film is unarguably Reilly's film...his performance without doubt one of the best of this year.One of the most underated actors working today John Reilly has overshadowed all other performances in the film with his mature,thoughtful role as Ellie Sisters ,his body of work is remarkable.Reilly's role as Ellie Sisters may be compared to Tahar Rahim's Ahmed in 'A Prophet'.Both the characters shed a drop of thoughtful perception of life..both are forced into a situation which they don't want to.

This film is really good, although it is really its own thing. Its often really funny and sarcastic, often gripping and nightmarish and at times feels thought-provoking. As I see it, it's more of an establishment for the word ""ride"". It has a little bit of everything and even if I am not so fond of that, I kind of appreciate the overall effort.This film is about aging and decaying in a tough and unfair enviroment as the west and manages to show how choices effect our lives and how change, even of the most lost souls, is still possible. Hate can always be beaten by love and acceptance and katharsis can be provided in the very end.From a technical standpoint, it is well-done. It is well-shot and the sound design during the gunfights is pretty good! The soundtrack is also really well done and the script although not really consistent is interesting and fun.The performances are just perfect. Joaquin Phoenix is haunting and mad as always, Jake Gyllenhaal is really good and he nailed the accest, Riz Ahmed is nice ( NOT AS GOOD AS HE IS IN VENNNOOOOOOOMMMMMMMM) and Jesus Lord, I am glad that John C.

By no means a new concept, Jaques Audiard wishes to revise a western cowboy story into an intimate, gradually bleak character piece that questions the genres conventions in the first place. There's some shootouts and some galloping across landscapes and old shantytowns, but there's subtlety at play here. How abusive parents control our psyche, how we either want to continue our life of crime or end it all and start an honest life, and so on. There's even a whiff of social commentary, like building new inventions to get richer, only to destroy nature around us.There's plenty enough at play here, but THE SISTERS BROTHERS isn't focused on allegory. It proves that these twists and extra insight could conjure some effective drama, to which it does. John C Riley and Joaquin Phoenix have great chemistry and pathos with each other, and the movie finds comfort - maybe a little too much confort, granted - in just having these guys talk real conversations instead of lazy exposition.Like I said before, it does meander at a lot of points and some might feel impatient with its weird structure. However, I felt patient enough to give it the benefit of the doubt. It's a exceptionally shot, slowly heartbreaking, quietly subversive curiosity. Can't recommend it enough.",The Sisters Brothers
113,archiecm,"Different kind of Western. Mostly over my head, I'm afraid.",7,15 October 2018,"I liked the details. I liked the bar scenes, the chaos. I liked the gun fights. I liked the humor. I liked the relationship between the brothers, especially John C Reilly's character protecting his younger brother. I thought the movie got lost about a half hour before it ended and I looked at my watch and whispered out loud, ""Where is this movie going? Is it about mining gold now? I thought it was about two hit men."" 
I did have two other problems with the movie. 1. Did that gold-seeking liquid really work? It seemed to but in the morning, after half of them are poisoned by the stuff did the buckets of gold actually contain gold? The survivors (the brothers) don't seem to care if it did or not. The other detail was about rifles. The opening gun fight and one near the end were outside and I would think two professional assassins would own rifles. You can't hit much with a pistol after fifty feet no matter how long the barrel. Nary a rifle to be found in their travels.",The Sisters Brothers

115,FreddyShoop,A unique take on the Western.,7,26 February 2019,"The real treat here is the interplay between Reilly and Phoenix as brothers who feel bound by blood, but often don't really like one another. The familial duty often reveals itself as a type of love between them. Anyway, they're hired killers of notoriety so you don't exactly root for them.Between the story , the acting, and the cinematography, the movie will pull you in. Although, the French director's take on several of the gunfights is oddly unengaging. Several times he chooses to film them in the dark, from a withdrawn, 3rd party perspective. As you might expect, if you watch a gunfight on a dark night, from 100 yards away...all you see is the flashes from the gun barrels. I don't know what he was trying to achieve, but I think he failed. The characters could obviously see the situation much better, so it would have been much more engaging to be in the fight with them.",The Sisters Brothers
116,chilversedward,Good movie,10,25 August 2019,"I really enjoyed this film. Audiards movies have always been great stories and him making a Western has worked out great. If you like John C Reilly than you will likely love him in this. The role allows him to use all his best acting traits and his chemistry with Joaquin is spot on.
The relationship has comedy but also a touching reality and their characters oppose and meld brilliantly making it a memorable acting partnership. Joaquin was superb in this film as was Arizona Ahmed and Jake Gylenhaal too.I've always been a fan of westerns due to the feeling of the time and landscape the genre brings and this film delivers in spades. If your not a fan of westerns then I think you can enjoy this films story despite, Audiard is a very talented director and I highly recommend this film",The Sisters Brothers
117,Toph-22,Modern western,7,30 December 2020,"The Sisters Brothers is an interesting modern western that captures well the mood, locations and people of the time. The plot takes place in many different places and there is no skimping on small details.Gunfights must not be missing in a western. These don't come up short and are also well staged throughout. Otherwise, the movie takes its time to let the images, the world and the actions take effect.The characters are introduced reasonably bit by bit and the respective motives become clear. The characters reflect on themselves and their intentions and go through a development.Overall, you see the contrast between the wild west with all its escapades and its own rules and the progress that humanity is experiencing in parallel. These include seemingly mundane things like toothbrushes. Here you can also see very nicely how such new inventions integrate info life.Initially, the focus is on a kind of bounty chase. This pursuit picks up only sparsely. Here, it would have been nice to feel the pressure that the persecuted undoubtedly felt as well. This would have given the movie a decent boost.Overall, a high quality made western where the pace didn't fit in some places. The movie takes its time to let the environment and the events take effect with its details. But the supposed pursuit (main plot) doesn't come across as a pursuit. The movie keeps getting lost in other storylines here. A lot is shown and talked about and the main plot is picked up every now and then. And you think, oh yes, that's what it's all about. Towards the end, the movie takes another interesting turn. Can definitely be watched.",The Sisters Brothers

This film has some of my favorite actors in Hollywood, Jake Gyllenhaal and John C. Reilly. But because the character development is so poor, I don't care about the Sisters brothers or what there doing, and when it gets to anything remotely exciting it's underwhelming. There is too much filler and unnecessary scenes that don't drive the story forward. This movie doesn't know what it wants to be, and that's too bad, I'd rather watch a movie that has been done countless times over, like the film ""In a Valley of Violence"", a revenge film, that movie knows what it wants to be. I found it vary hard to follow along, and I shouldn't have to read the book, to understand this film, that's just poor storytelling. But I found the landscapes and the world in which this film takes place, absolutely gorgeous the people in the backgrounds to the costumes and clothing on characters. I and said earlier how I thought the acting was great, the interaction between John C. And Joaquin Phoenix is great, they sound and talk like brothers would.

Catching the matinee showing with minimal sleep, I was almost at the edge of dozing off but there was enough entertainment to keep the sandman at bay.The story is simple, and goes on much in the way of expectations, but it plays well and without waste.

Guided by director Jacques Audiard it largely succeeds, clearly influenced by Sergio Leone (it was also filmed in Europe) and John Ford/Huston, perhaps. The plot rolls along nicely, following the sister brothers, assassins employed by 'the commodore' to track down rob and eliminate rivals. They are conflicted when they come across quarry who are not quite so easy to deal with, and get rid of.

That was a wide audience appeal, not a handful of viewers who think the men in the west talked like people in Hollywood. With a bit more humor and a whole lot less bad language, this could have been an entertaining show.
But I wouldn't want my family to see this bunch of foul-mouthed characters. Am I a prude? Maybe, but I've loved Westerns since Randolph Scott and Audie Murphy were kids.

Acting is as terrific as expected from all the cast. Setting looks authentic and the sceneries are breathtaking, even if only glanced through. Gun fights end in blood, prostitutes are not eye candy and pretty much everything looks dirty, depicting reality of the period.Overall it's a weird movie, despite many action scenes you get the feeling it's going slow.

It falls between the two stools, and fails to convince in either. The story is slight and drawn out to excessive length. John C. Reilly seem to be reenacting his Ollie role while Phoenix is just dour and unlikable devoid of any redeeming feature. Unlike the recent Hanks movie this totally fails to make use of the wide vistas of the old West with much of being shot in the dark. At the end of 'News of the World' i felt like standing up to applaud. With this i was just glad that it was finished.",The Sisters Brothers
136,auberus,"Freedom and redemption, the roots of the American Dream",8,8 May 2020,"""The Sister's Brothers"" is the perfect example on how a so called ""Western"" can be more than its Genre. Made by French director, the talented Jacques Audiard who already gave us gems like the 2009 ""un prophète"" or the 2012 ""de rouille et d'os"", ""the Sister's brothers"" tells a story of violence and greed but also of freedom and vast spaces, proposing a definition of what the American Dream could also be. Based on Patrick DeWitt's novel, this movie revolves around two henchmen and brothers, Charlie Sisters (Joaquin Phoenix) and Eli Sisters (John C. Reilly) who are chasing down across one thousand miles of 1850s Oregon desert to San Francisco, California the gold prospector and idealist Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed) and his partner to be, John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal). The film works as an initiatory journey where the two brothers will be confronted to their violent past, their meaningless present and eventually a choice for another feasible and peaceful future. All protagonists wish to fill their life with sense, transitioning from an absurd condition to a meaningful one. Hermann Kermit Warm is pursuing his dream to build a peaceful community, understanding that gold is only a means to an end. John Morris his willing to accompany Warm in his utopian quest, understanding that what matters is the journey and not the last station. As per our brothers they are looking for redemption and peace, one think he can find those in a bottle of whisky the other think he can fool himself in a virtual relationship with a stole. But eventually both understand that what matters is what we do. It's not our blood that conditions who we are but our actions that shape our present and future.
Serve by outstanding actors delivering ""frugal"" but true lines of dialog and a terrific cinematography where gun flashes in the dark are an allegory of the Wild West, ""The Sister's brothers"" is more than a Western, it's a film about freedom and redemption, the roots of the American Dream.",The Sisters Brothers

The thing that got me most was how Reilly's portrayal of Eli Sisters was so honest and thoughtful. The film is almost a 10, but one early scene in particular was a little bit disturbing.

146,orlando-somera,Best Western since The Unforgiven,9,24 October 2018,"I grew up in a rural area and never felt westerns quite captured living close to the land. It was always fun to watch movies like A Few Dollars More, but they were not real to me, just enjoyable fantasy. Every time one did seem realistic, it would fall down in some other area like not having likable characters or featuring overly beautiful women or an unlikely story. This movie is finally one that is both realistic and believable.The performances are impeccable. Joaquin Phoenix gives the most memorable and likable performance of his career and John C. Reilly couldn't have done better or been better cast. These two form a pair of brothers you will not forget.The story is pure western set around 1850 and taken from a novel by Patrick DeWitt. I would credit the excellence displayed here to both DeWitt whose story is key and to the inspired direction of Jacques Audiard whose only other film I've seen was nothing like this, Rust and Bone. He's made a leap forward with this film on the order of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill and deserves to win awards for it. I especially liked that there was not one scene that was not believable. That's quite an accomplishment in itself.This movie is fairly upbeat and sometimes delightful though appropriately dark in other places. I loved it but my wife thought it too slow (meaning very little romance). I thought it perfectly captured the rhythm of those times.

148,dogmaticdogs,Enjoyable but Too Many Plot Holes to be Great,7,21 October 2018,"This story is about two brothers raised by an abusive alcoholic until they eventually kill him as children. The movie starts with the brothers as adults. One questioning the path of his life and paternal, the other rowdy, impulsive and addicted to sex and booze. They survive working together as hitmen.
I didn't know what to expect, as the trailer made it seem like it would be a comedy with a lot of violence. Thankfully, the comedy routines were kept to a minimum.
The acting was very good, and the movie did not disappoint on the violence side. For the most part it was enjoyable. A decent pick for anyone that enjoys westerns. There were some things that irked me, however, in the form of enormous plot holes.1. These stone cold men instantly fell in love with Riz Ahmed, a Middle Eastern socialist who supposedly developed a formula to help find gold in rivers whom they were hired to kidnap and torture to steal his formula. Their relationship never seemed to make sense and there was no believable background on this.2. They decided to risk their life to find gold using Ahmed's process. It appears to work. In fact, they got such gold fever, they worked to the point of disfigurement and the death of their new found friends in extracting the gold, but when Ahmed dies they just move on. They never show the gold being counted or packed, or any of them attempting to recreate Ahmed's formula. The gold was just instantly forgotten with his death. It made zero sense.3. Although they both appeared reformed men, they decide to go kill their former boss who is portrayed as having at least dozens of hitmen working for him and take over his business. When the arrive at his compound there are no guards or security, and they walk right into a room in which his funeral is being held. Security is so lax, they just beat the dead body during the funeral and leave, with no attempt to take over the business. Everyone is portrayed as being very poor except for this one dead guy, who has no security detail or anyone trying to take the reigns of his empire. You would think a man with such power would have to be highly connected with others who would have much interest in a succession plan.4. After the funeral they just decide to move in with their mom with no real plans for the future. This really didn't fit into any patterns of family abuse and desensitization that I am aware of.Although the acting was good, they story of redemption just didn't make any sense. They kept going down different plot lines with no explanation of why they came to a complete halt. The story showed no insights into cycles of abuse, only a lack of understanding thereof. It showed people entirely changing their character and personality rather rapidily and without explanation.

This is a Jacques Audiard film.I've always admired Audiard's movies for their Bergman-esque characters, so full of internal conflict. And man, do Reilly, Phoenix, Gyllenhaal, and Ahmed all act the hell out of their respective roles here. Despite some of the character arcs delivered a bit on the nose, the film goes in some interesting directions. Each man has his own search for gold defined by the threads of his past, and this theme is ultimately woven together quite nicely.It's not without the gray area complexities Audiard respects in us, however. He presents seemingly equal shades of darkness and humanity, while leaving a lot to mine beneath the surface.

161,chiefjournalist,''The Sisters Brothers'' An unexpected Western.,9,21 April 2021,"This movie was on multiple watch lists for a long time (a couple of years.I kept putting it off; maybe it was the title or the fact it had goofy faced Will Farrel sidekick John C. Reilly in one of the lead rolls.But last night I caved and finallly watched ' The Sisters Brothers ' - A slap shtitch comedy it most definitely is not.It's primarily a dramatic buddy movie about a pair of assassins chasing their latest assignment across the Oregon Wilderness and yes -they are related by birth.John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix play the title characters - each inhabiting their rolls with the ease of great character actors. We expected that of Phoenix... Not necessarily of Reilly.The duo is quite practiced at deadly their craft working for the shadowy 'Commodore'. We follow them across the Pacific NorthWest thru a series of assignments and mis adventures as they begin tracking the commodores latest obsession, a hindu chemist.Set against the period of the California Gold Rush ... the chemist has a unique 'mstrike it rich plan'' that makes him for a number of the Commodore's assassination squads.Fellow assassin Jake Gyllenhaal is leaving breadcrumbs for the Brothers leading to the Chemist played by the brilliant Riz Ahmed. (Riz is nominated for a best actor Oscar this year. (And is officially on my must watchlist.)The script examines relationships, personal motivations and morality on multiple levels...When the Brothers have the chemist and their fellow conspirator in-sight the tables are turned and a series of events leaves the brothers both scarred and forever changed.It's quite a change-up from the sappy bad-guy/good guy westerns of my youth, and definitely worth watching.",The Sisters Brothers

When I finally sat down and finished the last half of this movie, I was kind of shocked how much I was enjoying this strange, rich, gritty western with seemingly no purpose.The action, when it comes, is matter of fact, no slow-mo, 'who outdrew who' hollywood stigmas. The acting and the settings are the point of this movie. Some of the scenes in this movie made me squirm worse than any horror of recent memory.If you like Westerns, you'll probably enjoy this movie.

Here it sways between proper camera work and candid shots as though they ran out of budget after paying the big stars. It's hard to maintain interests and there are utterly random moments with studio-lit monologues for instance, but other times a totally different character doing voiceover.

It almost gets going a couple of times, but then we slow down and get reflective. Is this a psychological western? Give me Monte Walsh any day. I guess I just cut my teeth on such good westerns that this one just doesn't favorably compare. John C.

And instead of black and white bad and good guys everyone here is painted in gray tones, like you would find in real life.The movie is dialogue driven and focuses on the characters rather than the action. There are some good action scenes but thats not the main focus of this film. Theses scenes are somewhat gory (in a realistic way) so sensitive viewers should beware.This is the type of movie that one might almost expect to have one of those annoying non-endings just for the sake of being artsy, but it avoids that pitfall and has an ending that is fitting for the tone of the movie.****VERY VERY Minor SPOILER Below****
My only complaint is that there is one scene where a character takes actions with a caustic chemical that are never explained and don't make sense. I really wanted to know what he was trying to do there but sadly it never was mentioned again.

It seemed overly complex for what was simply a chase movie through the Wild West. The protagonists pass through cities like San Fran which looked great, but too much attention was put on the non dynamics between the characters.Also, the way the story was written tried to pass off the two brothers as ""likeable"" despite being murderers, but in doing so they almost come out of character and form a bad vaudeville double act.

And, yes, there's even a funeral.While this is an interesting movie, it's a bit long. There isn't really a big plot and there are several plot holes, like what happened to the gold and other loot?If you look at it as a French-style Western (it is), it makes a bit more sense. At least the scenery and everything else seemed to be free of anachronisms.It really is about relationships as others have noted.Don't expect much from the gunfights. Many are done at night and only seen from a distance, so there are a lot of muzzle blasts and people dying, but they're sort of detached from the viewer.The gunfights you do see seem to be realistic in that they're fast, up close and people get shot in the back a lot.On the whole, I can't recommend it. It gets dreary and depressing in places and I'd rather watch something that holds my interest better.I gave it a 6 because the production values are excellent and John C.

The relationship between the two brothers played by John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix unspools in a recognizable and sensitive way despite the murder and carnage they pursue. One is questioning how long they can keep this up. The other doesn't want to discuss the future. What changes everything is gold but not in the way you might expect. Yes, greed is definitely involved but how its pursuit is illustrated takes the movie in an odd and unexpected direction.This is definitely worth a look especially if you like the unusual.

Joaquin Phoenix and John C. Reilly are perfectly cast against the other. Their relationship is realistically tetchy and contentious, their resentment of their devotion to one another shining bright in each moment they're together, and there were so many scenes in the film at which I burst into laughter at some random expression or off-hand response from one or the other. Gyllenhaal and Ahmed are great here too, and there are quite a few scenes of genuine charm and humanity between them, especially coming from Ahmed's character - so idealistic, so guileless, which is quite out of place in the context of the genre of this film but really breaks it open, makes it something unique and fresh. How often in a western do you hear a man talking about hopes and dreams for the future of humanity, trying to engineer a society in which all people can live a peaceful existence free of poverty and violence?

I think John C. Reilly is one of the most underrated actors working in Hollywood today. I have not seen Stan & Ollie but I am assured he will give yet again another great performance. I should mention I am definitely a bit biased as I'm not particularly fond of Western film. And despite the great cast of Jake Gyllenhaal, Riz Ahmed, & Joaquin Phoenix (the acting was phenomenal, as to be expected and the relationships between the actors were believable & well executed) I had a few issues. A very disjointed screenplay I believe due to poor editing. I'm addition, too many unnecessary (and underdeveloped) sub-plots that I felt took away from the films pacing; which was very stagnant at times. I endured the entire film in hopes for some large character arcs or evolution throughout the runtime (which I felt did not happen/I truly wanted to care about Charlie but I really didn't) or even perhaps a climatic ending (also not present).

I didn't even realize that John Reilly, Joaquin Phoenix, and Jake Gyllenhall were in it. In fact, I did not recognize Jake until the last few minutes of the film. To me, the movie was a bit overbaked. Their pistols looked more like Roman candles when fired at night--with long flames and sparks spewing from the barrels. It took me a few minutes to appreciate what was happening. I really like Reilly. He's a very fine actor and one of the many, many producers of this movie. Candidly, they all shined as actors. The storyline and plot were clothed in violence. Many of the scenes were raw and brutal. The more I watched of the film, the more I was eager to see what was coming next. My greatest criticism of the film is the unrealistic verbiage used by the characters of the west in the 1850s. The use of multisyllabic words of the time by the characters did not comport with the language of the day, that is, the level of sophistication of the English language far surpassed western reality. Afterwards, I did learn that the movie earnings were far short of the budget and that is really too bad because it is a film worth viewing. Very fine acting.",The Sisters Brothers

I get that old timie times are hard but where is the film going and while I Get thing were a bit slow and boring in 1865 replicating the sentiment in the film is not recommended. Honestly one of the dullest films I've seen that dragged on and on. Hard pass,The Sisters Brothers
217,joshuapoldfield,A cowboy saga,6,19 March 2021,Bit of an epic wild west gunslinger prospector saga. Well made and well acted. A bit different from the usual. I didn't enjoy all that much though. Would recommend if someone into that type of film.,The Sisters Brothers
218,mannimario,Audiard / Desplat / Reilly / Phoenix / Gyllenhaal / Ahmed - JUST GREAT!,9,3 February 2019,"Many people write it is boring, but it has its own pace and depth that is tangible throughout the entire movie. It´s been years I WANTED TO BUY A MOVIES SOUNDTRACT - BUT REALY, DESPLAT MADE THAT HAPPEN! Audiard created a beautiful and moving movie, that is different than other Western-classics. With this movie, John C Reilly made it happen. It is his movie and with Phoenix as Sisters Brothers they created an unforgettable duo. Gyllenhaal and Ahmed not to speak, what great performances. Kudos to all of them, give this movie a change and wait for it to unfold... It is worth it...",The Sisters Brothers
219,stuprum,What did I just watch?,3,17 October 2018,"I was excited about this movie. Love the cast. Love westerns. But that could not save this terrible movie. It seemed like a movie put together with a bunch of scenes that didnt exactly follow any coherent story. What story there is, is ridiculous. Jake Gyllenhaal...what are you doing in this movie? Worst performance I have ever seen by him. A bunch of silliness in this movie as well, keeping you from ever taking it seriously. Do yourself a favor. Dont go see it.",The Sisters Brothers
220,sharkfinsoup,Thoughtful Western,9,18 October 2018,"Wow! I went to see this knowing that horses would be ridden shots would be fired, and blood would be spilled, but not much else. I put my trust in Jacques Audiard, my favorite French director, directing his first English-language film. This is rich with moral complexity, like some of his earlier films, like ""A Prophet"" and ""Read My Lips.""This is a western that has a lot of action, as do most. But it's as much character-driven as it is plot driven. I especially liked John C. Reilly as Eli, the older, and much more mature of the two Sisters brothers. The rest of the cast is outstanding...especially Joachim Phoenix as the other brother, Charlie, and Jake Gllendaal, as a frenemy.It's also interesting to see things that were new, or new-ish inventions, that were mostly unknown to people of 1852, when the film is set. Things like toothbrushes and flush toilets.A satisfying film, with food for thought at the end.",The Sisters Brothers
221,jlastra,the thinking persons western,8,24 November 2020,"It's a shame this movie didn't do better at the box office but after watching, you being to think that perhaps a direct release to video may have been the right move.
Why do I say that?
It's not the typical western, it's not even the modern western.
The 'hook' for me was initially the pairing of the actors and the characters they play. It's not a star studded cast but four very solid actors with credible resumes in Phoenix, Reilly, Gylenhaal and Ahmed.
As the story movies forward and the characters begin to develop their roles, your interest is piqued by the prospect of this 'formula' for finding gold actually working.The scenes of San Francisco in the 1850's was brilliant. You get a glimpse of what the city built on the gold rush might have been like at it's peak.As in most things in life, with each great rise in fortune, there is a corresponding low point. Yes, the formula works but the demonstration of one man's greed to find more, results in the peril he puts the others in. Eventually the loss of the right arm and the early demise of two main characters.The story reveals the bond of two brothers. The complexity of how two men are driven by the force of early violence in their young lives. How one brother emerges as the leader and how the lesser who follows becomes the caretaker and eventually the leader of the other.The filming location's in Europe are spectacular. There are beautiful vistas of the plains and mountains of Oregon and California are memorable.It is said that you reap what you sow. The brothers have lived a violent life and seem to have been rewarded with money and gold along the way, their past seems to be catching up to them as they seek to separate themselves from their former life. They just want to go home.In the closing scenes we get the sense they have overcome the obstacles and the odds of their dangerous deeds and are finally close to home. Arriving at the homestead, they meet their mother with a shotgun standing guard on the ranch. She fires a warning shot at the strangers and then we realize it's a shot gun and she's not a very good aim. She is ready to welcome them home, but yet she knows they have lived a violent life. She makes it clear that she wants no part of that life. They assure her there is no risk of harm to her or the homes, she welcomes them in a warm embrace and we get the sense the trail of violence has ended.",The Sisters Brothers
222,cinecephale,Something is missing,6,2 November 2018,"The actors are wonderful, the photography is somptuous, yet something is missing. The film fails to reach the epic and tragic dimensions of truly great contemporary westerns. The story is too sketchy and the background stories of the characters too naive. The movie also fails to transmit the true darkness and irony of the book, which are not limited to gun violence. It all wants too feel raw and edgy but is really just beautiful but void.",The Sisters Brothers

Happily, the film manages to capture the tone and style of the book, effectively representing a period in American history in the west, when life was hard and casual violence was the norm. The story of the brothers' change in fortunes unfolds as a visual feast, complemented by whip-sharp dialogue.

The story is just on the surface, and never pulled me in. The pacing is all over the place. There were some decent moments, but few and far between, and too many lengthy boring periods. I'm a huge fan of westerns and have a large collection of them, but this one isn't staying in it. Really unfortunate. I see other reviews that call this movie ""gritty"" or a ""throwback"", and that's nonsense. This wants to be a revisionist western at times, but doesn't come close. The comedic moments fall flat. It's just a mess really. I almost didn't finish it.",The Sisters Brothers

The acting was a joy to watch, as was the cinematography, lighting, & the score, but the plot failed to drive it all home. I did not read the book, so I can't speak to the changes made, but I feel that there was more to explore. The morality of an all consuming life of crime for hire vs. a get rich quick scheme that uses chemicals to extract gold, but at a cost is fascinating, but ultimately left the audience to draw their own conclusions.",The Sisters Brothers

If that's the case, the director transferred from dark to more light hearted movie very well. Honestly, I'm not sure I have to much to say about this film. It succeeds in almost every aspect. It looks absolutely stunning, and this is in a genre (Western) filled with lots of other beautiful films. Another aspect the film succeeds in areas far beyond what I expected is the music. It sets the tone wonderfully and succeeds in sounding so amazing I might even buy the soundtrack. Other than that, everything else was done at least pretty Well. The characters are interesting and have well done arcs, the sets are flawless, the acting is great, the script and dialogue was good, the pacing and editing were also pretty great. My only complaint is a certain part of the last twenty minutes could have been better, and some of the action scenes could be improved.

I was hooked from the opening scene, which stands out as the most realistically played night gunfight I've ever seen. This directorial team really nailed the details on every front, from the use of flash powder, to the overall grittiness of life in the wilderness, to the caustic effects of what I assume was a radium-like ""formula"" that was used to make gold nuggets glow (although in reality Au is chemically nonreactive, the scenes were well-executed). It's a visual treat throughout, and I loved every minute of it. One star knocked off due to a bit of confusion up front as to who was doing what to whom, but otherwise well worth the time.

In The Sisters Brothers, the inversions don't stop there.In classic French style, there's a real focus on seemingly meaningless, mundane activities such as brushing your teeth or being sick. But it's from these actions, all too often discarded in cinema, that we can learn so much more about our characters.The four main actors each give an excellent performance while the script is laced with comedy, emotion and political commentary.And while often a negative in films, *SPOILERS* the ending resolves nothing. There's no emotional group or resolution to the characters problems.

Reilly and Phoenix are both powerful in their performances and play characters never before seen on screen (that I know of). Cons: 
Reilly and Phoenix's characters, are ultimately despicable, and the fact that they go home to their Mommy at the end is just plain ridiculous. Maybe show a fantasy of that as their meeting their inevitable demise, but don't actually end with that.Ahmed and Gyllenhal are characters I could care less about. I was glad when they met their demise, because it meant I didn't have to watch any more of them for the rest of the film.Also, where is the antagonist? I thought it was Reilly and Phoenix at first, but then they switch their positions and it becomes The Commodore? Yet, when we see finally him on screen, he's a corpse? Great character development there, Writer.Reilly said about the film, you don't see such emotionally open characters in Westerns. Not true at all. There are plenty of richly portrayed, hardened characters that have moments of weakness which reveals the underpinnings of an extremely emotional character. Even Eastwood's William Munny, a hardened murderous man, shows he is capable of an intensely emotional outpouring (albeit in a violent manner).",The Sisters Brothers

WRONG ! This is as pointless of a movie as you can find. It fails as a Western, as a mystery, as a character study, as a philosophical piece.

Right up front: The movie wasnt really my taste and it has its weaknesses. But it's not bad either. I would put it in the lower half.
The first half of the movie seems to be not knowing in which directions the movie wants to go, which makes the first half not really necessary.
The second half on the other hand was a little better, with some characters confronting each other. That's the climax of the movie, that I really liked.
But unfortunately thats just 5% of the movie. The rest is rather forgetable.What isnt forgetable is the cast. With John C. Reilly, Jake Gyllenhaal, Riz Ahmed and Joaquin Phoenix, its not a cast to oversee.
The world is interesting, as its from 1851, where things are quite rare, that today are part of our everyday life.It's a slow-paced movie, that gets quite boring from time to time, but shows some really good character development at the peek of the movie. Overall it couldnt really convince me.Rating: 4/10",The Sisters Brothers

The answer is a meandering journey desperately searching for a theme or purpose. But it comes up short. Is it brotherhood? Friendship? Betrayal? Greed? We never get a satisfying answer, things are constantly setup and never pay off, like some strange postmodern filmmaking style where nothing matters in the end.It's fairly well shot, but it is not a beautiful film. There are exceptions to this, a gold panning scene being one of them. I would've forgiven a lot if every shot would've looked like a painting. But the pace of this film will lull you to sleep, about halfway through we get to our first interesting conflict and character development between the brothers. I don't think we would've missed Jake Gyllenhaal's character had he been entirely cut from the film. It's a slow burn of a film, but instead of a roaring inferno, this one fizzles out.

I happen to live in the area this is supposed to take place in, and believe me the terrain isn't even close. Early in the film they are supposed to be in the town of Myrtle Creek, OR, the background terrain looks like high desert, where Myrtle Creek is in the upper Umpqua Valley which is covered in evergreen trees and scrub Madrone.

John C Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix star as an incredible dynamic brother duo, working as assassins chasing Riz Ahmed along with Jake Gyllenhaal, a pair recent pair from Nightcrawler (2014). With outstanding performances all around, the actors create a terrific sense of realism in the relationships between characters, John C Reilly stands out, as he delivers one of his most outstanding serious and heartfelt performances yet. The film takes it times establishing itself as a true but unique western with charm and intensity, but the film hits it's prime in the third act delivering brutal and vigorous scenes. The score fits perfectly into the vibe and tone and elevates scenes to higher and more emotionally gripping spectacle. The cinematography is also notable, with exception use of gun flashes in the dark, and alluring composition. As an entirety, the film is extremely compelling and is one of the best westerns in the past decade.",The Sisters Brothers

The intriguing cast, blank canvas plot line and sharp cinematography were all so promising to start. I liked the idea of John C. Reilly in this type of role. But while his character is being developed, we don't see much of that for Gyllenhall, Ahmed or Phoenix's characters.There are scenes that seem poignant that end up being irrelevant, and visa versa. It's a long haul to the climax of the film, which ultimately is completely rushed and felt very forced. After that, it just meanders to the finish line for what feels like an eternity, concluding with virtually no payoff for the viewer.",The Sisters Brothers
300,everdeej,LOVED the book...,6,15 October 2018,"The good news? Loved the book and had been wishing for 6 years that someone might make it into a great film. I was excited. How I hate to write the obvious next line, but, you know - the bad news? The director changed too much. Enjoyed his beautiful, gritty ""Rust and Bone"", so I was hopeful. On the surface, the 2 stories would seem to have little in common, but are similar at their core. Dark, damaged, quirky, real and beautiful are themes for both. But back to The Sisters Bros. I'd planned to reread Dewitt's book before seeing the film, because I actually recalled very little of it, but knew I loved it (no reflection on the book, but rather, likely due to the stress of deaths and loss in my life the year I read it). That the story was able to engage me at all during that time speaks well of it. Much less that it left me longing for a well-told movie. I get that adaptation is tricky. So many little things were changed that made no sense to me. Not for the better. And a couple of big ones that would definitely be spoilers. I know - so cliche for the lover of a book to be disappointed in a film adaptation - but I can rattle off so many that did not disappoint (To Kill A Mockingbird, The Color Purple,...). Some scenes I recalled from the book so fondly, that were inexplicably missing. Terribly missed. One was a second short, sweet encounter between Eli and a bookkeeper. Not the added brief weird role-play scene portrayed earlier w/ the sympathetic prostititute at Mayfield's, but it would've been lovely to have enjoyed those few moments of tenderness, hope, and joy for Eli, as he accompanied a kindred lonely soul on the makeshift 2x4 boards crisscrossing muddy streets, while she smiled and even giggled. The last appearance of the mysterious Commodore was altered. Why? And finally, returning to their childhood home made perfect sense to me after having their minds opened to new ideas and surviving all. I thought it was purposely lit to look magical, just as they might first see it. Or were they dreaming, or dead? I loved the cast, and might not have minded some surprising choices if only they'd stuck to the better points of the book, great and small. I came home, reread the book, and preferred it.",The Sisters Brothers
301,fuzzahproductions,Phoenix and Gyllenhaal on the same screen!.... for this?,6,24 September 2018,"I was looking foward to the crossover movie of Joaquin Phoenix and Jake Gyllenhaal where they prove to not just be the same person this whole time, and i would be lying if I said it didn't deliver in that regard. But this movie... was just okay. 
The performances all around were stellar, with Gyllenhaal and Joaquin completely getting lost in their roles. John C. Riley was good... half of the time, the other half was just Steve Brule in a cowboy hat. 
Throughout the movie i just kept thinking to myself, ""so when are we gonna start wrapping up?"" That's not a good sign. Don't get me wrong - where this movie goes and each scene in of itself is pretty good, the film just lacks real momentum. The film doesn't really go anywhere, which would be fine if there was a central theme for the spiraling story. But The ending was kinda poop, so that doesn't help.
I enjoyed watching it and the directions it took, but it never felt complete to me. Everything about this movie (except the exceptional performances) were just fine. Go see if you want an enjoyable and unpredictable western with good performances, but if you're hoping for this movie to prove itself as a treasure of cinema, you'll be sadly mistaken.

306,toddmccomascomedy,John C. Reilly is back baby!,7,29 January 2019,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie but I will say it's not for everyone. I would compare my experience watching it to the way I enjoyed sitting and listening to my grandpa tell old stories about his childhood and the war. It's a very specific way to consume a story because it's from the perspective of someone who lived it and includes all the subtle details that come with that, whether they add to the entertainment value or not. But those details are real and they help me feel what he felt and see what he saw. If a famous story-teller retells my grandpa's stories, he or she is going to add elements to them that help the stories appeal to the masses and make it easier for the masses to feel entertained along the way. For example, when it's night-time in this movie it is pitch black. Ever notice in most westerns it's light enough outside that you can see everything? That makes it easier for us to see what's happening but it's not how I would see things if I was actually there. There was no electricity! I want to see how difficult it is to have a shootout when you can't see anything because that's real.I also found myself enthralled in the dynamic between the Sisters Brother, John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix, which is made even more interesting by their chosen profession as assassins. I enjoy a good cold-blooded assassin but I really enjoy a good cold-blooded assassin that is complicated by emotional baggage and attachment when he's not sending folks into the after-life. Two brothers arguing about who has the better horse or how one drinks too much, right after they put six bodies in the ground, adds depth and I need that in my main characters. That's the difference between sex and making love.This movie is full of great performances. Jake Gyllenhaal and Riz Ahmed knocked it out of the park as well. There were no holes in this movie as far as writing, performance and storyline is concerned.That being said, there isn't as much action as I was hoping. This is strictly a personal thing with me but when I watch a western about two brothers that are paid assassins, I want a fair amount of violence. This has a bit, but I definitely wanted more. I also felt there was more room for humor in this film. But again, I'm very picky about such things. The dialogue was great but it stuck to a dramatic tone for the most part. I definitely remember at least three moments where I was hoping to be surprised by a big laugh that didn't come. This could be because I'm a comedian by trade or because I just expect these moments when you cast John C. Reilly as a main character, but either way this movie still delivered as a drama so it's fine.I don't feel comfortable telling you to pay to see this movie in a theater or to pay $14.99 to download from Amazon like I did. However, the story and the relationships between the characters is unique, the performances are superb and the cinematography is second to none so, I highly recommend you watch it when it reaches Netflix or your cable/satellite provider.",The Sisters Brothers

Mostly the rather decent script explores the relationship between two brothers who as a result of family circumstances are drawn into contract killing as a way of life, pretty much always on the run from someone or other. Of course there are guns and killing, that is what the film is about but I found myself thinking, as I do more and more, that it is all a bit tedious.

For example the word Bingo was used and the word wasn't invented for 80 years after the time line of this movie. For a movie like this to be great the details need to be correct.

As I came to the realization I really started to focus in on the dialogue and get a grasp of where the story was heading, which definitely hit it's stride around the halfway mark. Held together with brilliant atmosphere and acting (Phoenix, Gyllenhaal, Ahmed.) coupled with a very strong second half I would recommend seeing this movie.A lot of adventure and crime with less laughs than you'd expect from a movie with comedy listed in the genre, but a good movie nonetheless. 8/10",The Sisters Brothers

335,jdhackbart,"Overall, a very good film",9,15 December 2019,"As far as modern westerns go, this movie very much fits the mold. The cinematography is beautiful, and I found myself very immersed in the western world of the 1800's. The two main characters, Eli and Charlie Sisters, are very well developed, and as the movie progresses, more and more depth is revealed, allowing you to feel like you are getting to know them yourself. The film is written very well, with few plot holes as far as I could see. Phoenix and Reilly both do a very good job, A+ work from the both of them.There are a few gripes I have with the movie. For one, there did seem to be a lack of establishing shots. I very much missed the wide pan of the open western landscape that I have come to love so much in this type of movie. The landscapes they did use to shoot in were very beautiful, and I enjoyed the colors they brought to the film, but sometimes I did find myself questioning where exactly they were... Secondly the two side characters, Herman Warm and John Moris, played by Riz Amhed and Jake Gyllenhaal respectively, both felt a little underdeveloped. I wouldn't have minded a longer movie with a little more time spent on those characters, even though they did not play as an integral role in the plot as the Sisters brothers. Despite this, Amhed did a very good job in his role. Gyllenhaal was good, but forgettable, although that may have just been the way the character was written as well.",The Sisters Brothers

337,susandewalt,I wonder if Patrick deWitt was as shocked as I was.,1,1 November 2018,"If you read the book and appreciated the depth and complexity of the characters, the clever dialogue between Eli and Charlie (or even Eli's musings), then you should steer clear of this distortion. To say that this movie is based on deWitt's novel is to overstate the facts. Too many changes from the original make for shallow cardboard cut-out characters racing through a sparse and simplistic story line. All that made the book engaging and rich is missing in the film, and will only make you angry to have wasted money on it. I understand the need to edit and crop to fit the screen, but this was such a disappointment. Had I seen the movie first, I'm afraid I would have missed the novel, because there's no way I would have read it after seeing this.",The Sisters Brothers
338,dbti,Best Movie of the Year! Not for Kids.,10,5 November 2018,"This masterpiece of soul will be nominated for best picture, and if it doesn't win, it should. Hardly a comedy, it's as serious as a heart attack, as beautiful as a painting, as real and gritty as life, and as profoundly, mysteriously human as the dreams and longings of the heart. It's what we find when we bother to look under the hood to see what makes people tick.Rich in allegory and metaphor that gently reveal and never intrude, it starts off slow, low and grim, allowing little chance to care at first but dropping crumbs that begin to draw you in before you realize what's happening. All the glamour of gunfighting is gone and what's left is what it is - brutal, loud, smoky and messy.Firmly rooted in a background only glimpsed is a criminal underworld that existed then as it does now, driven by greed, rivalry and vendettas and upon which the fates of four damaged, lost, but ultimately fascinating characters are woven, and against which they each in their own way come to make a stand.Free from stifling stereotypes of good guys and bad guys while dripping with diverse authenticity, this experience takes you there like few others.
Watching it I evolved, from disappointed to interested to captivated to stunned. What a magnificent voyage.",The Sisters Brothers
