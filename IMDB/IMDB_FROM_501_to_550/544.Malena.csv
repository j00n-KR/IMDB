0,MartinHafer,A real mixed bag...a lot of good and a lot of bad,4,3 June 2007,"This is an Italian coming of age film about a young man who was entering his teen years when WWII began. In some ways it reminds me of a combination of AMARCORD and THE SUMMER OF '42--as at least in the beginning, the film focused on ordinary small town folk during the war (like in AMARCORD) and a bunch of very horny boys (like SUMMER OF '42). The problem is that while the film began well, it seems to have lost its focus and charm. While WWII isn't exactly a ""charming"" period, the likability of ANYONE in the film was a problem. The townspeople turned out to be quite vile and the leading character seemed to have some serious sexual hangups (such as voyeurism and fetishism)--plus he spent so much time masturbating. Now they didn't show masturbation explicitly, but the little goomer was clearly playing with himself again and again with great gusto! In hindsight, I would have dropped all the sexual hangups the kid had because it tended to deflect the focus in the film. The film was at its best when it showed human nature, as the townspeople gossiped about and mistreated a decent lady just because she was so beautiful. Then, when she was apparently widowed and broke with no one to help her, she slept with the Nazi occupiers to survive. This and the peoples' reaction to this after the war was really fascinating but unfortunately so much time was spent on this horny kid that the significance of the rest of the film was lost.Oh, and if you want good parenting advice, just look to the boy's father. To cure his chronic masturbation and wearing the lady's stolen underwear on his head while he slept, his father took him to a prostitute. Now THAT'S something I don't remember reading in Dr. Spock!!",Malena
1,SnoopyStyle,beautiful Monica,6,16 May 2016,"It's 1940 Castelcuto, Sicily. Mussolini has just declared war on France and Britain. Renato is a 12 year old boy. He gets a new bike and joins a group of local boy. They are obsessed with Nino's new wife Malèna Scordia (Monica Bellucci). He starts spying on her and having erotic dreams about her. Her husband dies in the war. In the town, the men are obsessed and the women are jealous. Rumors of affairs with married men lead to a court trial.If this is a story about Malèna, it could be something great. However, she's really more of an object and what a beautiful object she is. This is really a coming of age story about Renato. We're seeing Malèna through his eyes. In many ways, he has to be more compelling as a character played by a more charismatic actor. He needs to have friends to play with. He needs to have connections other than an imaginary one with Malèna. There has to more satisfying conversations. He's obsessed with a naked Monica Bellucci. Who isn't? That probably is worth some extra points somehow.",Malena
2,lee_eisenberg,It's both the little and the big things that matter.,9,30 September 2006,"""Malena"" may appear to be many things: a coming of age story, an allegory for Italy's gorgeous and mighty past (and getting beaten to a pulp in WWII)*, or maybe something else. But overall, it seems to be about life in general. This story of how the beautiful title character (Monica Bellucci) leads teenage boys to their first sexual experiences in WWII-era Sicily forces one to consider one's own sexual experiences and whether or not they helped us fully understand our own future. The ambiance of Mussolini's Fascism naturally raises the stakes. But either way, it's definitely a movie that I recommend, and it's not one that you're likely to forget any time soon.*Apparently, director Giuseppe Tornatore said that this was the movie's real aspect, as Malena represents what Italy used to be, and what happens to her at the end is a metaphor for what happened to Italy.",Malena
3,ccthemovieman-1,'Malena' Almost Beyond Description,9,4 November 2006,"A gorgeous, voluptuous woman is the object of attention in this World War II period piece, set in an Italian town. The star is a horny 13-year-old who fantasizes about a relationship with this grown woman, ""Malena,"" a sexy lady who gets all the mens' attention in the town, and all the wrath of the jealous town women.This is a strange film at times but beautifully filmed and almost always interesting. Monica Bellucci is indeed a feast for any male's eyes. She is almost beyond description, looks-wise. What happens to her, unfairly, near the end is not pleasant. Otherwise, it's a pretty humorous film in segments, especially with dialog between the young kid and his dad. Some of the lines there and at other places made me laugh right out loud. Some of the language is not really profane but it's certainly crude. The kid is not that likable nor are his friends. There is a such a mixture of genres in here that is makes the movie fresh almost every time I see it, which has been three times so far.",Malena
4,ma-cortes,Nostalgic and sensitive picture with a ravishing Monica Belucci,7,11 October 2006,"The film is developed on WWII in a small town from Sicily,there live an adolescent(Renato)coming of age,he is obsessed of a married woman(Monica Belucci)whose husband was to the war.The young man tries to help her but he is enamored and is too young .We see him growing up during a few years and by Malena he changes his life forever.The picture contains drama and nostalgia completely wrapped in an enjoyable love story between an innocent young boy and a beautiful woman.The movie gets a sharply social critical about village customs,habits and gossips leading to mistreats and violence. The story is narrated with great sense and sensibility,the intelligent screenplay is by Luciano Vincenzoni(Sergio Leone's usual screenwriter).Gorgeous Monica Bellucci is sensational although she barely talks throughout the movie and the starring boy is sympathetic and agreeable;another actors are good but they are unknown.Glowing cinematography with scenarios colorfully and splendidly photographed by Lajos Koltai who reflects the elegant beauty Monica Belucci.Sensible and moving score musical by the veteran master and prolific Ennio Morricone who was nominated with a deserved Academy Award.The picture is produced by the great American brothers producers:Harvey and Bob Weinsten and well directed by Giuseppe Tornatore who made a similar nostalgic film,the excellent¨Cinema Paradise¨. Ratting :Better than average,well worth watching by a beautiful,exceptional Monica Bellucci.",Malena
5,jotix100,The girl in the villa,8,5 September 2005,"In a way, ""Malena"" kept reminding us of a famous photograph by Ruth Orkin, in which a young American woman is seen walking alone in an Italian street where there must be at least twenty men ogling this beautiful beautiful creature in different degrees of desire, shouting things about what they would love to do with her. In Giuseppe Tornatore's ""Malena"", the young woman at the center of the story, suffers that kind of sexual predatory practice from all the men in the little town in Sicily where she lives. It appears Italian men, then, as well as now, can express anything at all, especially for their big friends' benefit, their opinions of how they feel about a woman. Even the town's ladies have no qualms in shouting nasty things as Malena passes them by.If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you would like to stop reading.The film takes place during the last days of WWII. Malena's husband has gone to war, but he never returns. She is left to fend for herself under the most extreme circumstances. In order to make ends meet, all the men in town offer Malena anything so they can get favors from her in return.Watching all this is Renato, a young man who has reached puberty and is completely taken by Malena's beauty. Renato follows this woman all over the town. Whenever Malena is coming into view, Renato abandons his bicycle and makes a point to pass near this gorgeous creature almost breathing her aura.A lot of people in this forum have expressed their views in making ""Malena"" a coming of age film. But contrary to what they might take, Mr. Tornatore, its director, like most film makers in Europe are influenced by the politics and the history of their country. In here, it appears that Malena stands for the way Italy was manipulated by Mussolini in transforming the country into a fascist paradise. Also Malena, like Italy, is turned into a prostitute in the eyes of many Italians, who watched their beloved country invaded by the Germans, who were supposed to be their allies.""Malena"" is a film that is blessed by the presence of that amazingly beautiful actress Monica Belucci. Ms. Belucci is perfect for the title role and runs away with the film. In one of the most hear wrenching scenes in this movie, we watch in horror as the other women in town have their revenge in punishing Malena for what they perceive are her sins and her collaboration with the enemy.Young Giuseppe Sulfaro is seen as the appealing Renato Amoroso, the young man awakening to his own sexuality. He lives just to spy on the woman that has captured his imagination, and even in his solitary gratification she plays a large role in his vivid imagination.""Malena"" owes a lot to Giuseppe Tornatore for what he has been able to accomplish.",Malena
6,zetes,Very good,9,20 July 2015,"Sicily, 1940. A teenage boy (Giuseppe Sulfaro) is initiated into manhood when his friends introduce him to the glories of Malena (Monica Belluci), the most beautiful woman in town. Sulfaro becomes obsessed, following her wherever she goes on his bike, and he even spies on her in her home. His obsession is not the only one, as much as he wishes and wants to believe it were - the whole town worships her. Every man wants to have her, and every woman is deeply jealous of that fact. And, man, does that make life hard for Malena - her husband is fighting the war in Africa, and the rumors are flying, making life nearly impossible. Sulfaro might see her as a sex object initially, but the more he observes the more he sympathizes. This film begins as an enjoyable comedy, but it grows deeply serious. The climax is one of the harshest, most potent sequences I've seen in a long while. One will recognize the nostalgic tone of the movie if you're familiar with Cinema Paradiso, but I think this is actually a stronger film. Excellent.",Malena
7,HumanoidOfFlesh,Truly amazing!,10,19 April 2001,"Words can't describe how brilliant this movie is!""Malena"" is simply one of the best Italian movies I have ever seen.Monica Bellucci(Malena)is truly gorgeous:her ethereal beauty is incredible.For me  she is is the most beautiful woman on this planet!I'd love to see her in more movies-especially in some stylish Argentoesque giallo/slasher.Giuseppe Sulfaro is outstanding as a young boy Renato,who falls in love with Malena.The supporting cast is also fabulous and the cinematography is excellent.The score by Ennio Morricone(""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage"")is fantastic,and the scene in which the women of Sicilian town brutally beat Malena is pretty powerful.All in all this is rather sad film,which can be also funny at times.An absolute masterpiece-and the first non-horror movie I actually reviewed.",Malena
8,Vincentiu,A subtle delight,10,30 December 2006,"In each Tornatore movie, the most important character/actor is the music. A subtle, inebriating music of same Ennio Morricone.In each Tornatore's film, each scene is a childhood memory's projection. The images, sounds and voices of same age defines a life like a gorgeous form of his beauty. But this nostalgic beauty is, again and again, the supreme form of world's discovery.I saw ""Malena"" in each year before 2000. At firs sight, Belluci's acting was the fascination object. Then, Sulfaro's subtle interpretation of a certainly alluring character. In final the atmosphere, the faces, the light, the small gestures, the looks, the music. I don't know if it is a good movie. His charm is so powerful that a definition is always strange. In fact, it is the result of a great way to relate a tale. Same tale, maybe, but with more subtle shades. So, ""Malena"" is a slice of a nostalgic world who lives in everyone. And this fact is only important.",Malena

10,=G=,A worthwhile film but a nebulous presentation.,7,18 July 2001,"""Malena"" is about many things....the people of a small Sicilian town during WWII; a woman scorned by the town's women and admired by the town's men for her sensual beauty; and a pubescent boy's obsession with the woman as he comes of age. Obviously the product of a talented auteur because of its technical and artistic excellence and its many poignant moments, ""Malena"" fails to focus clearly on its story such that the end result is somewhat less than the sum of its parts. The director of ""Cinema Paradiso"", Giuseppe Tornatore, doesn't deliver a cogent product in ""Malena"" though the film has its moments. Recommended for more mature males.",Malena
11,dromasca,Beautiful Sicilian Story,9,31 August 2002,"Director Tornatore made one of the best movies in the history of cinema 'Cinema Paradiso'. I saw recently his '98 film 'Legend of 1900' and was disappointed. With Melena he is back with a vengeance.The story happens in small village of Sicily during WWII. Beautiful Melena, wide of a soldier gone to war, becomes object of desire for men, raises the envy of the women, and enflames the imagination of the teenagers, the film main character among them. The story of the woman that has to fight to survive the war and human evilness develops in parallel with the story of the boy who grows up, follows and secretly loves the mature woman.
It's a moving story and a well made film. I am not very fond of 'coming to age' movies, but this one is much more. Italy and the war and after-war period still seem to be background for some of the best films made.",Malena

13,kenjha,Beautiful but Vacuous,4,2 August 2009,"This film focuses on a boy's obsession with a voluptuous woman in Sicily in 1940, as Italy enters World War II. In fact, it is not just the boy, but the entire town that is obsessed with the title character. Perhaps it is supposed to be comical, but it looks ludicrous - whenever she walks through the town, every single man lusts after her and every single woman envies her. Even though she's played by the gorgeous Bellucci, it is hard to believe that she would get so much attention. The cinematography is beautiful and the period is nicely evoked, but there's little plot and the title character is so one-dimensional and undeveloped that a doll could have been used to play her.",Malena
14,johnnyboyz,"An often quite beautiful film, about beauty.",7,28 July 2018,"It is not Malèna's fault she is so beautiful, nor is it her fault that she happens to find herself living in a society at a very specific point in history which happened to place a heavy emphasis on the appearance and internal makeup of a person: Italian; white; patriot; Catholic, etc. This is a film about beauty as much as it is beautiful people - certainly by the end of the film, all sorts of different individuals have sandwiched into their minds preconceptions on our eponymous herald, but a large chunk of the film is about what really transpired over a period of around four and a half years. It is also a film about behaviour - behaviour and outlooks at a time and in a place when behaviour and outlooks are scrutinised to within the inch. It is difficult for many of the men who live in the small Sicilian town in 1939 wherein ""Malèna"" is set to balance their lust for the eponymous woman with the honour they are supposed to feel towards their own spouses and the Catholic faith. Where director Giuseppe Tornatore toys with things in this respect lies in his placing of a young boy at the very epicentre of the film. At twelve years of age, Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro) is too young for politics; religion and wives, and because he is so young he will never hook up with Malèna in the first place. Irrespective, he is still on the outside looking in like everybody else anyway. Amidst the ugliness of war; fascism; a volatile homestead situation and seclusion from a group of other boys, Monica Bellucci's Malèna character is both a visual tonic for our Renato as well as a key into an alternate reality where they are together; happy and blissfully ignorant of all the pain and misery which engulfs both of their worlds. But because the film takes place so long ago, there are no modern quick-fixes to relieve the cupid's arrow - having spent an afternoon spying on Malèna at her house, Renato has a pretty good idea of what music she likes to listen to, and must purchase it at the local music store if he wants to be reminded of her. The only problem is, he doesn't know what it is called, obviously, and must embarrass himself by singing it to the clerk in the vain hope he will recognise it. The film is emboldened by that sense of the nostalgic and of the romantic in this regard.Tornatore depicts the fascination Renato comes to possess of Malèna, the bulwark of the film, in such a way that we genuinely feel that the boy has come to feel a fondness for her that is authentic. We are already aware of just how out of favour Renato is with other boys in the town of his age, who bully him and pick on him. Their own fondness for Malèna is more superficial; they are not shy of crudely expressing their lust for her as she walks past them. We do not sense that they have the ability, or even the creativity, to visualise themselves in a motion-picture with her. In a film that is the antithesis to something like an ""American Pie"" sequel, or the ugly younger sibling to any of those films in the form of ""Superbad"", this is to be applauded. If you want to cover this sort of coming-of-age material, and give it a sprinkling of situational comedy, ""Malèna"" is how to do it.",Malena
15,leplatypus,Fantasy of a w_a_n_k_e_r (DVD),4,11 April 2009,"This isn't a love story, just the wild infatuation of a teen for a mature woman. For sure, as the woman is played by Monica Bellucci, a lot of us would have feel the same and his reaction at their first ""meeting"" is common.For that, the movie is rather brilliant, funny, true: It's hard to get out of passion, you see the dear one everywhere and you feel compel to ""spy"".But, finally, the movie fails to become a classic. Malena is just a flat character, without voice. The audience can't really care for her, because of her muteness, her silence. Everybody in the town speaks about her but she is scarcely heard! I remember to have seen this movie in Luxembourg with my Italian friend from the European Parliament. at the release, he sent me this DVD from Italia and I discovered that a lot of scenes had been cut from our version.A few last words about the bonus: they are rather boring: just shooting of the sets, without commentary and where voices are ""confuse"" or ""inodibili""!",Malena
16,Anonymous_Maxine,Hell hath no fury like relentless gossip.,10,21 March 2005,"Malena is a film that gives the impression that there are no innocent parties. The men are guilty of dirty, lustful thoughts (and some of more than just thoughts), the women are guilty of gossip, violence and probably more than a little envy, and Malena is guilty of being a homewrecker. But in looking back at the movie it seems that what caused the problems were two things  gossip and something like insecurity.Roger Ebert wrote probably the most idiotic review I've ever seen him come out with about this movie. He missed the point of this movie even more than he missed the point of Memento, and his review of that movie was like a blind man describing a shooting star. He describes Malena as a schoolteacher ""of at least average intelligence, who must be aware of her effect on the collective local male libido, but seems blissfully oblivious.""Roger, seriously, are you joking? BLISSFULLY?? Did you sleep through this movie?She almost never speaks at all and never displays even the slightest hint of a smile. Given the extent of her depression and stifling sadness, it is astounding to me that anyone in their right mind could attach the word ""blissfully"" to any element of her character.I know what that's like though, because sometimes I completely miss something about a movie and I think that something else is the stupidest thing in the world because of it, at least until someone explains what I missed and then it all makes sense. Watch Malena, for example, walking through the central square in town at any point in the movie. If you think she keeps her eyes on the ground directly in front of her because she is in a state of pure, ignorant bliss, then trust me. You are missing something.I don't know if Malena was actually unaware of the effect that she had on the townspeople, but I find it nearly impossible to believe that she did. That thought actually never even occurred to me until I read Roger Ebert's gem of a review. Her behavior struck me much more like someone who had been dealing with such behavior from the men around for her whole life. I doubt very much that she doesn't understand the concepts of human physical attraction.Moving on. Set against the backdrop of World War II reminded me of Life is Beautiful, especially given the uncertain mix of comedy and tragedy. It wasn't as powerful on both sides here as in Life is Beautiful, but it was truly heartbreaking to see Malena suffering and trying to ignore the increasing tension that was being generated around her.It's hard to say that she was a victim of her own beauty, but it was really what drove all of the conflict in the story. The women at first seemed to be upset with their husbands because of their stares, and things got worse and worse because of the endless gossip which seemed to monopolize the talk of the entire town. If anyone was talking about anything, it had something to do with the latest sexual escapades of Malena.Women would not sell her good food at the town market, so she had to get it from men who expected things in return. There was a scene where an officer was at her home, but I don't think there was any indication that they had sex. It was clear that he was more interested than she was, and later it was her that wound up in court for having an amorous relationship with a married man in uniform. The courtroom performance of Malena's lawyer, by the way, is one of the highlights of the movie.I'm not really sure how to feel about the women involved in the climax of their collective hatred of Malena, because surely Malena did not sleep with the husband of every woman involved, and of those whose husbands committed no crime other than looking at a beautiful woman, what did they then think of their wives, who would do such a thing out of pure jealousy and envy? I'm a man myself; so I can't speak from a woman's point of view, but if your husband cheats on you, take it out on him. Don't go and beat up the subject of his affections, especially if it is nothing more than a beautiful woman that he looked at. Imagine all of the attractive women beaten up without knowing why.Weaving his way throughout all of this chaos is Renato, a 12-year-old boy who has conceptualized Malena as the ideal woman in all ways. He sees himself as her protector, desperate to save her from the tension that he sees growing around her, the unfair antagonism that is being leveled at her, for really no fault of her own. His identification of Malena as the subject of his developing sexuality reminded me of another great film, The Hairdresser's Husband. If you liked this, see that one, too. Oh and if you're Roger Ebert, maybe watch this one again.And stay awake this time.",Malena

18,billcr12,Bellucci full of grace,7,6 April 2012,"Melena is a Latin teachers beautiful daughter and the object of desire for a group of adolescent boys in wartime Italy. As Mussolini speaks to the nation on the radio, the kids follow her on bicycles. The youngest, a twelve year old named Renato, spies on her constantly through holes in the walls and windows and with a telescope when she is outside sunbathing. One day he sees her dancing with a photograph of a soldier, apparently her husband, who is off fighting in the war. Renato fantasizes about her being nude and Monica Bellucci's body is breathtaking. She walks the streets in a tight fitting skirt and the entire neighborhood comes to a halt as the men stare and women make disparaging remarks. After news of her husbands death in combat, Renato envisions himself comforting her. Several more dream sequences follow with the youngster rescuing Malena. Rumors spread of affairs with different men and leads to a trial. The lawyer defending her gives a funny and rousing speech and later demands payment with her favors. His mother disapproves of the relationship due to her bad reputation. Desperate circumstances force Malena to sell herself in order to survive. The Germans invade and things get even worse. The problem is that Malena is played as a comedy for most of the film but becomes a tragedy for the last twenty minutes. Bellucci is a standout, showing both grace and beauty; so it is a mixed bag and a cynical, realistic study of human nature. A single phrase used by Renato toward his amour provides a simply touching moment of grace and dignity.",Malena
19,Chris_Docker,Stylish and sexy,7,29 April 2001,"Stylish and sexy, Monica Bellucci parades beautifully and endlessly around photogenic Italian backdrops, arousing the adoration and sexual development of a young teenage boy. The rest of the town react in different, often extreme ways to her sexuality and the way it affects the township. European style cinema. Jointly produced between America (Miramax) and Italy, the film combines the opulent, realism of European cinema with the polish of US dollars. A delight to behold.",Malena
20,Kdosda_Hegen,The Chronicles of Stalker.,4,28 April 2021,"It's impossible to talk about this film without spoilers.This is one of the most disgusting films I've ever seen. In this film pretty much all men are horny sex addicts, all women are jealous witches. Malena who is a widow, gets attention from every man and woman in town. All men want to have sex with her and all women want to ""kill"" her, because she 'steals' their husbands (even though she is not). She does nothing wrong, but many women humiliate her and many men rape her. Yet, Malena is put to blame for everything. Later on women even beat her and cut her hair off...The whole film is shown from the protagonist eyes, who is himself not saint, he is a creepy stalker, yet still morally the purest character in the film. He knows the truth and condemns everyone even avengers Malena on many ocasions but no matter how hard he tries there are too many evil people and he can only watch how they damage Malena. In the end of the film Malena leaves town but years later she returns as a faithful wife (which she always was) and everyone now respects her... Doesn't make any sense, but whatever, I get the idea.Oh, and don't get me started on boy's father. He at first condemns his son as a pervert and disgrace to the family but later on, he insists and literally brings his boy to a brothel to pays for the services... (I assumed). It felt completely out of character.This film is a disgrace to humanity, it was extremely unsatisfying to watch, it was disgusting and painful. The only thing I like in it is that it condemns everyone in it, but it does not save the film from its filth.",Malena
21,caspian1978,Coming of Aga,8,25 April 2005,"One of the better films to come out of Italy, let alone Sicily, in a very long time. Malena has two strong audiences. For those who are fans of Monica Bellucci, this is the movie. Bellucci is pure eye candy, let alone an amazing actress. For most of the movie, Bellucci is without voice. She is an ornament for much of the story. By the end of the movie, the audience realizes how hard a role this was and how many actors would be unable to do what she did. Giuseppe Sulfaro and Luciano Federico, who plays the Father are terrific. Both bring drama as well as some great comedy to the story. This is the story about the coming of age of a 12 year old boy as much it is a story about Malena. Monica Belluci proves to the world that she is an actress and not just an ornament. For those who are not a fan of Belluci, this is still a great movie with its story, setting and unforgettable plot.",Malena
22,rbverhoef,Seems to be something else,7,8 December 2004,"'Malèna' is a strange movie. It seems happy and with a lot of joy in the way it is presented, but the things that are presented are sad and disturbing. Malèna (Monica Bellucci) is a young woman, the most beautiful one in a small Sicilian town, 1940. Her husband is send to war and the rumors start. People say she has a lover, probably only because they are jealous. A young boy named Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro), the film's narrator, who is deeply in love with the woman does not believe this and creates his own perfect image of her. Then the news of her husband's death arrives. She becomes a poor woman and to save herself she does some more things people disagree with, including sleeping with a German soldier (although not on screen). Renato keeps idealizing the woman.Where both stories will lead, Malèna's and Renato's, is not for me to reveal but I have to say one thing. Monica Bellucci, who only speaks about five times in 'Malèna', has a thing with violent films. 'The Matrix'-movies existed out of just sci-fi violence, but in 'Irréversible' she is in one of the two most violent single scenes I have ever seen and of course she is Mary in 'The Passion of the Christ'. In this film she is in another violent scene, one that feels completely out of place. Although events were sad, presented differently, this scene does not belong in this movie, not on screen at least.The director is Giuseppe Tornatore, something I could guess before learning it from end credits. It looks and feels the same way as his great 'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso'. The difference is that 'Cinema Paradiso' knew it was really about, the story really was filled with joy. Here the film only seems that way, there is no real happy moment. When Renato's father slaps his son it is presented in a funny way and yes, it might make you smile, but that does not make it a happy event.",Malena
23,Spleen,Wonderful,10,22 April 2002,"Spoilers follow.Afterwards I had the vague worry that perhaps I enjoyed it too much.  I don't think any of us expected that Malèna would be made to suffer quite so much.  By small degrees we progress from a general attitude of unfriendliness and disrespect to a brutal public beating - no less bad than if she'd been raped at the point of a knife - and STILL, although this particular scene is heart-rending, the film as a whole is not unpleasant to watch.  Why not?The obvious answer: because it's good.  And it IS good.  Few films are so pleasing to look at, with precise yet wonderfully casual camerawork (take the scene in which Tornatore's camera ambles around, picking out first this conversation in the village square, then that one - this is kind of thing is common, but rarely done so well), and some shots are simply so gorgeous that they would justify themselves in any context.  (But never is the visual beauty presented to us MERELY for its own sake.)  It's funny, perceptive, brisk, disarming, and has a lovely score (by Ennio Morricone).  Of films about tragedies, only the bad ones are ENTIRELY depressing.But there's more to it than that.  For almost every second we watch, we half expect Renato to intervene on Malèna's behalf - and very often, there's an elusive first few seconds in which it seems as though his intervention would do some good.  (Maybe this is never more than an illusion, but like many illusions, it persists.)  The offer of a happy ending, or at least a small triumph, is never far beneath the surface.Nor is the offer entirely false.  It's not clear exactly what happened in that scene in the marketplace at the end - least of all to the protagonists - but I interpreted it as another sign that Malèna had KEPT her dignity all along, and that she now cared so little for the village's judgment in itself that she could publicly ""accept"" it without feeling compromised.  This is still a SMALL triumph, all things considered, but I think Tornatore fairly lets us know that it's the best we could reasonably expect.I haven't gone into Renato's side of the story, which is of course just as important and just as richly rendered.  ""Malèna"" is surely one of the best films of 2000 (at the moment it's third on my list, out of a hundred or so). See it for Luciano Federico, if nothing else: he has a Mussolini impression that must be seen to be believed.",Malena
24,Seraphion,Deep story meets nice plot shift,7,11 January 2015,"The story first seems as a it's only focused on Renato and the depictions of his wild and childish imaginations while he's jerking off. But slowly and surely the side plot of Malena's life starts to take center focus and becomes the main focus nearing the movie's end. What's nice is that both focuses are depicted accordingly. The movie doesn't take lightly in portraying each sides of the story. It went on wild and crazy on Renato's imagination and on how he almost devoted his adolescent life to stalk on Malena.. Yet the movie also gives a good matured view on the focus of Malena's life. The story plays it nicely on telling how fate seemingly throws in inevitable situations again and again at her life. The movie uses nice touches of editing and fancy fast cuts here and there. We see great usage of camera angles and a lot of close ups focusing on Renato's expressions. The acting is a good work in overall. Playing the lead character Renato, Giuseppe Sulfaro acted out well enough maintaining the sad looks in his character's innocence. Monica Bellucci did well in portraying the expressions needed as a widow in such conditions, although the final conflict shot feels quite lacking.",Malena
25,JuguAbraham,"The second half is too close to Lean's ""Ryan's Daughter"" for comfort",6,3 July 2015,"This is a fabulous vehicle to showcase the physical beauty of Monica Bellucci. She is truly an eye candy.But as cinema it falls apart if you are a cinephile like its director Tornatore, The second half of the film is too close to the tale of David Lean's ""Ryan's Daughter"" (made 30 years before this film) for comfort. Screenplay writer Vincenzoni and Tornatore have cobbled up a tale that could be called ""Ryan's Daughter in Italy."" This is Tornatore's weakest work I have seen. As in ""Cinema Paradiso"" and ""Baaria,"" Tornatore shows his passion for cinema by morphing the lead actors in scenes from famous films.Tornatore must have always wanted to showcase Bellucci ever since he made ""Malena"" so much that he got Bellucci to do a topless sex scene in ""Baaria,"" which was totally gratuitous.If you really want to appreciate the creativity of both Tornatore and Morricone, (the composer has provided music for all Tornatore films, I believe), see Tornatore's ""The Legend of 1900.""",Malena
26,Lady_Targaryen,She was too beautiful and he was too young to protect her.,7,11 October 2006,"''Malèna'' is a nice movie starring Monica Bellucci, one of her greatest roles in the movies, that also projected her to the United States. (Since she was limited to European films until then) Set in 1940 during World War II, just as Italy enters the war, we see through the eyes of the boy Renato, the story of Malèna, a beautiful woman who's moved to his Sicilian town to be with her husband Nico. But as soon as they move, Nino leaves to serve in the war, leaving Malena sad but having to deal with it. Being desired by the men and criticized by the women, a lot of gossips about Malena's life are made by the people from town, and basically all of them are bad things. And her only sin is to be beautiful. During the next few years, Renato grows toward manhood and he watches Malèna suffer more and more: her loneliness and sadness, specially when Nico is reported dead, the effects of the gossips on her relationship with her father, the poverty she eventually reaches and even her search for work, that ends in prostitution.The irony of the story, is that only Renato, a young boy who cannot help Malena, knows that she is a good person and that she was forced to do many of the things even to survive.But Spite of the many sad things that Malena needs to handle, and also showing the humiliations she suffers, the final message of the movie is positive, being about forgiveness and ""redemption"", since at the end of the movie, Malena's life returned to normal, not only having her husband Nico back, but also being treated very well by the townspeople.",Malena
27,frankde-jong,Hollywoods bad influence on the films of Giuseppe Tornatore,6,6 October 2020,"""Malena"" is in the first place about a teenage boy falling for a more mature woman. As such it is rather simplistic. Much attention is paid to the erotic fantasies of the boy. This gives rise to a couple of nude scenes leading to the suspicion that the director is applying the ""Betty Blue"" (1986, Jean Jacques Beineix) trick. With that I mean wrapping up nude in a quasi serious story. All in all, from all the films I have seen about a teenage boy falling for an older woman (""Girl with a suitcase"" (1961, Valerio Zurlini), ""Y tu mama tambien"" (2001, Alfonso Cuaron) and last but not least the film by which Tornatore obviously was inspired ""Amarcord"" (1973, Federico Fellini)) ""Malena"" is the weakest.Malena (played by Monica Bellucci) is not only having an effect on teenage boys but also on the local adult men. She is the ""femme fatale"" who proves to be ""fatale"" mostly to herself. This part of the story is more interesting. It is sort of a mix between ""American beauty"" (1999, Sam Mendes) and ""Fury"" (1936, Fritz Lang). ""American beauty"" by the way the adult and adulterous men can't imagine that the object of their desires is less sex driven then they are. ""Fury"" by the way the women are blinded by jealousy and don't blame their husbands for their adulterous thoughts but the woman that induced these thoughts.Just as in ""La vita e bella"" (1997, Roberto Benigni) the German soldiers are the villains in ""Malena"", which is remarkable when one bears in mind that Germany and Italy were allies in at least the first few years of the Second World War.Giuseppe Tornatore is best known for ""Nuovo Cinema Paradiso"" (1988). In this film a little Sicilian boy is falling in love not with an older woman, but with cinema itself. Just as ""Malena"" this film is told as a flashback, the main character already being of old age. ""Nuovo Cinema Paradiso is bittersweet and full of nostalgia. ""Malena"" desperately seeks the same mood, but does not create it. My hypothesis is that the influence of Hollywood (the producer of ""Malena"" is the infamous Harvey Weinstein) has something to do with it.",Malena
28,hall895,The burden of beauty,7,2 March 2013,"Monica Bellucci plays Malena, the most beautiful woman in her small Sicilian town. It's 1940, her husband has gone off to fight in the war and she's all alone. It's her husband's hometown, she's new there. Nobody knows her. Nobody knows what to make of her. The town's women are bitterly jealous of her beauty. The town's men are infatuated with her. And the town's boys are quite simply in awe of her. We see a group of boys wait by the side of the road so they can leer at her as she walks by. And then they get on their bikes, pedal ahead of her, then stop and wait for her to walk by again so they can leer at her some more. One of these young boys is Renato. For him Malena will become an all-consuming obsession. And we will find that this film is not Malena's story at all. It's Renato's.Young Giuseppe Sulfaro plays Renato and what a wonderful performance he turns in. As Renato comes of age Sulfaro grows with him. The young boy in short pants becomes a man. Meanwhile things begin to go very badly for Malena. Her husband is killed in the war. The women of the town, not the most sympathetic lot, continue to shun her, refusing to even sell her food. They also spread vile gossip about her. Only one person in the town believes in Malena. That is Renato. He sees that she is not at all what everyone makes her out to be. He's there to support her. Or at least he imagines he is. In his fantasies, some wistful and some amusing, Renato is Malena's savior and protector. But in the real world there is nothing this young teenage boy can do for her. Things get worse and worse, leading to a shocking and disturbing conclusion. But that conclusion is not truly the end, this very smart story has some more twists in store. And maybe Renato can help Malena yet.It is a wonderfully crafted story, very poignant and compelling. Renato is a very endearing character and a great narrator for this tale. For him Malena represents the impossible dream, the unattainable goddess. But part of what makes the film work is in its allowing us, and Renato, to see she really is no goddess at all. She is a woman like any other, with hopes and dreams. Hopes and dreams which for her sadly end in despair. She has this incredible beauty. But for her beauty proves to be a burden, a curse. Other people are so consumed by her beauty that it ends up destroying her. No one can see her for the person she really is. All they see is that body and a woman who looks like that...well, she just has to be a whore doesn't she? Very rarely in this film does Malena get to speak for herself, Bellucci hardly has any dialogue at all. The movie is not about her, it's about how people see her. Mostly about the boy who sees what no one else will, the truth. Beautifully shot, well worth its Oscar nomination for cinematography, and with a wonderful Oscar-nominated score as well this film has all the pieces to be very successful. It's a great story which is very well performed. Bellucci certainly looks the part and young Sulfaro is terrific. All in all a very enjoyable film.",Malena
29,marcin_kukuczka,"Individual against mob; yet, besides all, let us never stop singing ""Ma L'Amore No""",7,3 May 2007,"MALENA, as the title would most probably suggest, is a movie about a woman, her life, her feelings, her beauty, a Sicilian woman who was named Malena (Monica Belucci). However, when you decide to see Giuseppe Tornatore's movie, you will quickly realize that it is not as simple as that. Malena appears to have nothing to say though her character seems to be emphasized throughout. There are lots of men who undress her with their eyes, there are lots women who would gladly burn her as a ""worker of iniquity."" There is, however, one boy, Renato Amoroso (Giuseppe Sulfaro) who deeply loves her. Yet, he is too young to be recognized, his love is too straightforward to be accepted... In fact, do individuals have anything to say in the world of social hypocrisy and jealousy? MALENA appears to be an autobiographical movie by the Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore who patterns his directing upon classic Italian cinema artists, including Federico Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni. Except for the sentimental background like the dreamlike locations of Sicily, music, colors, the whole movie is filled with emotions, empathy with the main character, disagreement with social fixed rules, anger towards those who consider themselves ""moral"" but none of their deeds prove that morality. Everyone in the town seems to know life to the letter, yet, it occurs that only Renato and Malena get to know real life through suffering. Malena's character, from the mob's point of view, represents intrusion, a person who subverts the established order. How is it possible that she walks, wears, behaves, looks this way? Everyone, particularly other women who already have husbands, find this behavior outrageous and disgusting. Men, to the contrary, find Malena attractive but what they adore in her is primarily her body. It is only Renato who recaptures a real feeling, his first one, his most memorable one.Why did I like this movie? When I saw MALENA for the first time, I found Renato a real character, a true boy in a puberty age who wants to be an adult at last. He starts to be after women and his first sympathy is not any girl at his age but a mature woman. There are many haunting moments of his fantasies, e.g. he is in cinema and regards himself as a movie hero who kisses a lovely woman (and this woman is Malena). In another moment, we see him writing a love letter on the lesson and imagining his serious teacher as the woman of his dreams. These moments are there for a very important reason - they help us experience an insight into his character's struggles and desires. Tornatore really manages to do it. What else did I like about the film? I loved the music by Ennio Morricone. It appears to own a special capacity to uplift a viewer into higher horizons. Since on the one hand, the whole film is a very simple, down to earth, sometimes even a vulgar story; on the other hand, however, there are moments of pure romanticism. And the music is what combines the two: higher emotions with down to earth desires. As the story takes place during WWII, we are deeply in this period. Renato once watches Malena dancing to the rhythm of ""Ma L'Amore No"" and from then on, he loves this song.There are also many gentle sensual moments, for instance Renato sitting on a rocky beach and dreaming about Malena or Renato trying to come closer to her in the sleepy streets of Castelcutto. It's always a dreamlike moment for him, it constantly has that combination of desire and childlike shyness. Once, such a moment is interrupted by bombing of the city, which represents a horror of war not allowing for love. But is it only war which does it? The film proves that jealous people filled with hatred can do more harm...I also found some performances brilliant. But it is, to the contrary, not Monica Belucci who appears to be top notch in this aspect. Of course she is great in the role, fits very well but the entire story concentrates much more on her looks than her acting. We rather see her walking than speaking. It was young Giuseppe Sulfaro who made my day when I watched MALENA. He does a tremendous job as Renato, his performance is absolutely fresh and breathtaking! However, there are also things which I find wrong in this movie. I don't complain so much about some vulgarity because when we want realism, it's normal among youngster boys to talk about women with lots of swear words. Consider, for instance, the moment they check the lengths of their penises and mock their mates who are small. What I found silly was the stereotype of religious people. The film seems to put the equality mark between all those bad, fanatically furious people for whom traditional religion is the only way of life and Christians in general. I agree that the Church consists of many individuals, some of them may be odd but this is not because of Christianity but because of their wrong interpretation of faith. There are many great catholic families in the world for whom psychology, empathy, love are everyday bread. These are not those few ""lunatics"" who regard carnal desires as devil's work. So please, don't take it seriously! That is not Catholicism!In sum, MALENA is a film worth seeking out. It's made according to the rules of high class cinema, it has an unforgettable atmosphere and great coming-of-age story. It combines a simple story with art and both go in pairs at once.Yes, Renato, let us all sing the song of love in our hearts as long as there is hope in a true feeling among two people, as long as the cruel philosophy of the mob is unable to defeat those who really care.

30,rps-2,It's just soooo Italian...,9,13 July 2002,"Wonderful, funny, human, sad, sexy, superb movie!!! Seldom have I enjoyed a film as much. Why is it the Italians can make a movie with bare breasts, masturbation, erections, orgasms, fetishism and sprinkle it with four letter words yet it is not the least bit offensive! But then Italians (and Europeans in general) take a far more realistic and healthy view of sex than we do. Lewdness is almost an alien concept and Italian films reflect that. This is almost a family film. And any guy who remembers what it was like to be 13, whether in wartime Sicily or contemporary North America, will identify with young Renato. Add the wonderful photography, the brilliant visual gimmicks and some very listenable music and you have an awesome film. I gave it a 9 and I'm wondering now why I didn't make it a 10!",Malena
31,natashabowiepinky,She must be some kind of Siren...,6,7 January 2014,"I bet the director would say this film was about 'requited love' or 'a young boy's ascent into manhood.' I would describe it as 'A kind of collective madness afflicting a small Italian town during the latter stages of WWII'. I mean, this woman can't even walk down the street without people from both sexes staring at her and following her every move as if she was some kind of Goddess. Yes, she's pretty. But having that kind of effect on ALL the residents? So that they'd just stop what they were doing and act completely goofy? Wasn't there any gay men around then? What's even worse, she seems completely oblivious to it. Despite having hundreds of pairs of eyes on her, she never once looks left or right, acknowledging them at all. Besides, beauty is only skin deep. On the rare occasions she does speak, she doesn't seem the sharpest tool in the drawer. Taking all factors into consideration, perhaps the wolves who lust after her could (whisper it) do better?These events are witnessed through the eyes of a 12 year old, who despite all the attention lavished on her, declares himself as her greatest fan. And when he discovers she's lost her husband in the war, he declares to have her when he 'comes of age' in four years... and that means, punishing her detractors and following her everywhere, even to the extent of spying on her at night through a peephole at her house. Don't these kid's parents realise he's missing every evening? He keeps up this charade while she sleeps around, before finally becoming a prostitute in the service of the Germans. Meanwhile, he has his own adventures, including an accusation of being possessed by the devil which some nuns 'cure' him of. I'm not sure about that, but there's definitely SOMETHING wrong with him. And the rest of the province, come to think of it.Well acted and very funny in places, it's still hard to get round the initial idea... that Malena is so beautiful there is nothing else to think or talk about when she's around. This is such a far-fetched ideal it did affect my enjoyment of the film, to the extent I wanted to confront the characters and tell them to get a life. And how can someone be so blind as to not notice that you're being stalked and harassed by pretty much everyone? Either that, or she's the best ignorer ever. Regardless, there is pleasure to be derived from the film, as long as you're willing to accept the ridiculous behaviour of all concerned. Those crazy Italians... 6/10",Malena
32,LeRoyMarko,2 movie in 1,9,5 November 2002,"First, let's get this out the way: Monica Bellucci is gorgeous in this movie. And she plays the role of Malèna Scordia very nicely. She's some kind of temptress without even trying to be one. And she's not alone to give a good performance. Guiseppe Sulfaro is also very good in the role of Renato.This is a coming-of-age story. Renato's life is changed forever when he first lays his eyes on Malèna. As so many adolescents know, love can be cruel.Great setting in fascist Italy, with the rumbling of war in the background. Superb camera work makes it even more enjoyable.Of course, this movie starts out as a romantic story. But soon, it becomes a tragedy, with its fair share of brutality.One last word to say that I liked the storytelling and narrative style of this movie.Out of 100, I give ""Malèna"" 85.

33,Ben_Cheshire,"Tornatore: ""It'll be like Amarcord, but by me.""",2,24 July 2004,"Italian cinema is starting to remind me of that line in The Good Girl (2001) by the character who's so obsessed with Catcher in the Rye that he re-named himself Holden Caulfield. He says one day he's going to write the great American novel: ""It'll be like Catcher in the Rye, but by me.""Italian cinema has been obsessed with Fellini's Amarcord since it first came out. What I don't understand is why they don't just go and watch Amarcord again, instead of re-making it based on their own particular childhood memories of beautiful women, filtering out more and more of its brilliance each time. And the rest of the world have advanced past the stone age, but the italians insist on keeping their women as to be seen and not heard - objects to strut about with their heads down, be whistled at, and masturbated over (this is not slander, it is more than once scene in all these kinds of movies) - instead of spoken to as a human being with thoughts, feelings and desires of their own. I could only feel sympathy for poor Malena/Monica Bellucci, having to walk down all these busy streets/film sets with a bunch of horny, google-eyed little boys watching her like so many hungry wolves.And, even worse, she has to live with the fact that she's kissed a ten year old kid many many times for money, without ever suggesting to Tornatore that the screenplay has been done before, and its very silly and shallow.

34,skepticskeptical,Jumps genres,7,1 May 2020,"The first half of Malena is a comedy. I was actually beginning to wonder whether the entire film would be about Sicilian males´ raging hormones. Everything changes about half way through, so if you are looking for a lighthearted comedy or rom-com, then you might be disappointed. On the other hand, if you start to become bored with the bawdy humor, hold on: it will change.Overall, quite good.

35,rajdoctor,Malena,5,17 August 2007,"This movie was recommended by CNN-IBN. I had seen the images of the movie and had liked it. The movie seemed like a coming to age story of a boy falling in love with an older woman. A theme I love.The story is set up during World War 2 in a village in Sicilian, Italy. The 14 year old boy Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro) falls madly in love with Malena (Monica Bellucci) from the first moment he sees her. Malena is the center of attraction of the village man, woman and boys alike. She is very beautiful and her husband is at war. Everyone in the small town gossips and loose talks about Malena. When the news of Malena's husband's death comes to the village, Malena has not choice but to be a prostitute to feed herself. In an air-strike her father too is killed. She is insulted, abused, ashamed, paraded naked in the town square by angry woman who want to protect their husband from Malena. Humiliated Malena leaves the village. All this is observed by the boy Renato who dreams of Malena day and night. In the end, Malena returns back to the village when her husband (who is found alive) brings her back.To say the least, the story is Italian  too over the top, too dramatic, and too crude! The script is jumpy. The characters shallow. The emotions superficial. This is a perfect movie where it shows that good cinematography, camera angels, images and locations, sets and historic backdrop, representation of different phases of emotions  just alone does not make a good movie. Showing different phases, incidents and events does not really make audiences relate to the characters. Some parts it does  but overall it leaves you unmoved.Monica Bellucci looks gorgeous, but somebody tell me  what on earth she was suffering from, that she was not able to communicate like a normal person? Her characterization was mysterious and sometimes, I felt it was a bit stupid too. The boy Giuseppe could not have done more than what he has done  in performing the role of a growing young boy.The romance of a young boy and older woman is a very sensitive subject and should be handled with care and feel. Such commercial story-telling in a dramatic way did not really help communicate the wonderful meaning and message of first love and romance.The Director Giuseppe Tornatore has tried to create a romanctic tale under the backdrop of World War 2 setting, with magnificent camera work and photography. The locale where is movie is shot is also very beautiful. But rest said, it is not a classic. I hope good images and locales can make good movie  it does not! (Stars 5.5 out of 10)",Malena

One reviewer complained that the lad didn't stand up for his ladylove and be heroic--simply put, this town in not in suburban California, but a relatively small, traditional Sicilian town in which he was born, and one doesn't usually confront the village! It simply isn't done. Exquisitely photographed, evocatively recreating the early days of World War II, Malena would be an interesting film to pair with Respiro, both of them dealing with barely-teen protagonists obsessed with older women--know that neither pulls punches and it isn't all sweetness and light as it might be in Hollywood--but both kids grow from their experiences, and both learn about human strength and frailty, no easy lessons.

37,braddugg,We grow up on dreams and then dream to grow.,8,20 September 2014,"We grow up on dreams and then dream to grow.Before reviewing this film I would share my personal account related to this. In college, adolescent movies, porn used to be discussed and when I was in one such discussion a friend told that he was fascinated by this movie. I downloaded it and privately watched it alone expecting this to be a very evocative and a sexual movie. Now it was all to my surprise, it turned out differently. A week later, I showed this movie to my friend Raghuveer. Initially, he was interested in nude scenes (coz I got to know of this only through him) but once the film began, we both completed it. And after a week when I called him to know what he was doing, he just said, he was dreaming and thinking only of Malena. That was the impact. I got back to this 2 years later while in job but the reaction was the same by my other friend. Now today when I watched it, I was again satisfied coz this is one of the most compelling stories that stood out in time.Hmm, to review this movie is a tough job for me coz it's difficult to judge what you love the most. I love Monica Bellucci thoroughly in the movie and while younger, fantasized about her the same way Renato did in the movie. It's a story of how cruel beauty is to self and how beautiful it is to the eyes of the beholder. Malena's only curse is she is beautiful in a village filled of demons. It is one of the most simple stories told and still it kept me going because the way camera works and each scene be it an adolescent or a court room fight, or even a dream sequence just made me feel something if at times happy then at times sad and in fact very angry. So each scene did move me, they touched me for sure and that's where the writing of the screenplay is a winner. Mind you, it is based on a short story and this can be anywhere and at anytime. Though based on world war 2 in Italy, the theme is universal, it's of abuse and how beauty is used.A kid has a dream but is still helpless and most adults are powerful but devoid of compassion. While in movies, nudity comes as an X factor or for publicity it is very precisely used here to take the story forward and rather substantiate the theme. The music by Ennio Morricone grips you and empathizes with the characters emotions be it a chase on a cycle or a song La Amore, they are very aptly placed and used. The way camera moves tells you what the whole village is talking and what each character is about. The art direction takes you back to the time of world war 2. So everything is done well but acting by Giuseppe Sulfaro (son of the director Giuseppe Tornatore) is terrific. I think, since the director could not romance Monica, he let his son do just like a scene where the father takes the son to brothel when he realizes his son has grown up. And Monica is quite a revelation with silence she spoke a lot.Spare the nudity please, if that was not there this could just be another story.Thank you Tornatore for such a compelling film and thank you for showing Monica Bellucci as the ultimate beauty whom every man should crave for.It's 4/5 for this one.

Very nice settings. Well rounded characters. A nice point of view. Attaching scenario. Good score.The actors. Monica Bellucci plays her role to perfection, but it doesn't stretch her abilities much since her role is almost silent and relies heavily on her beauty, except for one very dramatic scene. It's a small if central role for her. Giuseppe Sulfaro plays his role just right. The rest of the cast seems to be playing it a bit over caricatural, but it looks to be part of the vision of the director, unless I'm just not getting some flavor of the Italian culture, which could honestly be the case.The bad.

I use the word 'platonic' because I felt Renato's passions towards Maléna's outstanding sexual beauty were mostly of profound appreciation, not just his own voluntary arousal of his sexuality, though the film has many scenes of his musterbation. And all these happens when Italy went to the World War.Expressions of the War came in every aspect of the film, even in Renato's feelings towards Malena or the hatred towards those men who wanted her. Guiseppe Sulfaro did an outstanding job in this extremely demanding role. My hats off to him. The goddess-like Monica Bellucci rarely looks up or speaks in this film. Besides providing the audience the guilty pleasures, she did a wonderful job in creating the aura of sadness and melancholy around her character. I considered hers is a fine piece of acting.",Malena
43,Shiva-11,Far from paradise...,7,23 December 2000,"Malena - Puberty is that time in a boy's life when everything feels like it's breaking down: your joints throb with growing pains, your voice takes on the qualities of a rusty hinge, hair starts growing in strange places, and you begin to feel very self conscious.  Most importantly, you start noticing the opposite sex in a way you never had before.  Things pretty much go down hill from there.For the small Sicillian village of Castelcuto the Second World War has not been as intrusive as the arrival of Malena Scordia, the young wife of a local.  She has two strikes against her: she is from another village and her stunning beauty draws unwanted attention whenever she walks down the street - the men relentlessly ogle her and hiss, whilst the women spew invective, insults and insinuation.  Enter Renato, a headstrong twelve-year-old with a deep crush on our heroine.  He is determined to be her savior and rescue her reputation.  Malena's situation becomes increasingly perilous with the death of her husband at the front, further inspiring Renato's resolve.Who was not moved by Tornatore's earlier film ""Cinema Paradiso""?  With its mix of eccentric characters, stunning cinematography, humor, and beautiful story line, it is everything movies aspire to. Naturally, I anticipated a similarly styled film, and from what little I had gleaned from previews, I expected the film to be a coming of age tale along the lines of ""The Summer of '42"".   Assumptions as always are a fool's game.When the viewer gets to participate in Renato's fantasies (played masterfully by Giuseppi Sulfaro, easily the film's standout) they are taken on a fanciful ride - he is a gladiator, gangster, cowboy and all-round do-gooder who always comes to Malena's rescue.  They are moments of hope, levity, and temporary joy.  The lawyer's speech in the courtroom, and Renato's home life also provide some comic relief.  However, the film inevitably switches back to the ugly reality of Malena's lot. 
Once her husband is declared dead, every man in town tries to take advantage of her, the local women's vitriol increases, and Malena, with few options for survival, becomes that which she's been accused of and the film becomes very ugly.  I found it increasingly difficult to watch the film, especially since I know that many women in similar situations have and do suffer Malena's fate purely because of other people's jealousies and insecurities.
""Malena"" could have been a poignant film that reveled in a boy's struggle to fit into the world as a man or a film with a message about intolerance. Instead, the director chose to showcase negativity, and use desperate times as an excuse for despicable behavior. If you enjoyed ""Cinema Paradiso"", rent it again.  Unless of course you have a desire to feel bitter, in which case, ""Malena"" is the film for you.",Malena
44,Artimidor,Italian beauty with a message,9,25 June 2012,"In ""Malèna"" Giuseppe Tornatore mixes a lot of his own memories of war time Sicily à la Fellini's ""Amarcord"" and combines them with adolescent curiosity à la Truffaut's short ""Les Mistons"", all centering on the radiant and enchanting beauty of the title character played by Monica Bellucci. ""Malèna"" however is much more than just a celebration of Bellucci's sinuous body, which on the other hand admittedly is most effectively used when photographed by a capable director. But ""Malèna"" has other things to offer as well. For one it is an exquisite coming of age portrait, masterfully narrated and shot, marvelously scored by Ennio Morricone, in many ways a companion piece to Tornatore's better known and critically acclaimed ""Cinema Paradiso"". It's also nostalgic, endearing, funny, touching, daring at times, erotic is a given, yet beautiful and innocent, but then also tragic, sad and even unexpectedly shocking - the film is a symphony of all those emotions brought together through two very strong characters, the boy and the desired woman. Not to be neglected is the often overlooked allegorical aspect very prevalent in ""Malèna"": The action takes place with WW II as backdrop, where motherland Italy prostitutes herself for Hitler and becomes a mere satellite of Nazi Germany, with the once virginal beauty being brutally ravished. How fast things can change...Finally, a warning: The film's international release version was cut by no less than 17 minutes, reducing many of the scenes laden with enticing sensuality - which represent the core of the movie - to an absolute minimum. While the film miraculously still works that way, the experience of course is far less intense. If you can, see the original.",Malena

And as they've held me close... and asked if I will remember them I've said, ""Yes, I will remember you."" But the only one I've never forgotten is the one who never asked... Malena."" A young man's infatuation for a beautiful older woman blooms amidst the outbreak of World War II in this bittersweet comedy-drama from Italy. Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro) is a 13-year-old boy growing up in a small Sicilian community. Mussolini has risen to power and has declared war upon England and France, but Renato has other things on his mind -- mostly girls. While hanging out with his friends by the seashore, Renato spies Malèna (Monica Bellucci), the daughter of one of his schoolteachers, whose husband Nino (Gaetano Aronica) is fighting with Mussolini's army. Renato is immediately obsessed with Malèna and follows her like a lost puppy, spying on her whenever circumstances permit and imagining her as his co-star in elaborate erotic fantasies inspired by his favorite movies. Renato, however, is hardly the only man in town to be struck by Malèna's charms, and her beauty leads to resentment from the women of the community. Malèna's circumstances take a turn for the worst after her husband is reported to have died in combat, and she is forced to resort to prostitution to survive; she is brutally attacked by a pack of angry matrons and driven from town. Renato tries to keep track of her, and has some less than encouraging news to report when Nino turns out to be alive and finds his spouse is missing.I vividly remember seeing this film for the first time about six years ago when I was just a little young 'un and the version was dubbed and most of the scenes was edited. It was the time where I watched movies and skipped the talking parts and went straight to nude scenes and such. Don't blame me, blame the raging hormones I had at that time.So anyway, I was foraging for DVD's not too long ago and I found a copy of this film, immediately I was taken back to Memory Lane and I knew I had to buy this one.Well, after watching it for the second time (no I didn't skip to the nude scenes), I was amazed. What an amazing film. I laugh at my childhood self for not appreciating such a great film (well, can't blame him, it was the raging hormones *winkwink*). This film is touching and beautiful, the story is without a doubt one of the best that was interpreted on screen. My hats off to Giuseppe Tornatore, the director who also made 1988's Cinema Nuovo Paradiso for making such an ethereal movie experience.Monica Bellucci, the most beautiful woman who walked on Earth, gave a stellar performance although she only spoke a couple of times. Being in a film as a lead and barely even speaking is a tough act to achieve, you have to rely on your body language and facial expressions to convey such a tremendous character and yet she did it like a pro. The kid, Giuseppe Sulfaro on the other hand also gave a wonderful performance and yes, I envy the lucky bastard for seeing Monica's hot bod in the nude.Another amazing factor is the music of Ennio Morricone, the Danny Elfman-Hans Zimmer-John Williams combined of Italy. Malena is the perfect coming-of-age story, I suggest you go see it.",Malena
46,ilovedolby,Director Tornatore has crafted a film that is deeply personal.,10,1 August 2005,"It was two years ago when I first saw ""Malena"" and no matter how many times I see it, I am deeply captivated by it. I am probably so connected to the film because I can relate to it one form or another. The story of a boy coming of age and his fascination with a woman who he cannot have is a common idea for a film, however, it is done here so exquisitely through director Giuseppe Tornatore's realistic writing style, cinematography and the moving score of composer Ennio Morricone. The end result is a film of longing and bittersweet memories of people and times that we all must let go of in order to grow up. It is a story about innocence lost and the love gained through obsession.""Malena"" follows the story of a young man named Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro) and his obsession with a local woman, Malena (Monica Bellucci) widowed during World War II in Sicily. He follows her around town, fantasizes about her constantly, even spies on her through a peep hole in the wall of her house. But he is not a pervert. Renato is getting his first taste of infatuationone that would turn to love. Regardless of his obsession, Malena is ostracized by the community for her beauty. Men want her and tell their wives that she is disgusting and all of the town's women despise herso much so in fact that she is denied work. As such, she is forced into prostitution in order to afford food. Renato understands her circumstance and does not hate her, but learns to loathe the town for what they have made Malena into. All the while, Renato is growing into a young man and learning the ups and downs of adolescence. His obsession for Malena grows over time until the point Malena is driven out of the community by an angry mob of women who beat her for being a whore. But everything will change when Malena's thought-to-be dead husband shows up in search of the love he left behind for the war.""Malena"" is not simply a whimsical story of the exploits of a young man. It is much deeper than that. It is about a young man growing and understanding the world through his obsession. He learns to understand the power of love and the hypocrisy and setbacks that societies intend upon those it does not want to succeed. Malena is the would-be victim of circumstance and the ultimate victim of society's cruelty. In the beginning, Malena is a pure woman. But to be looked at as a whore and forced to become one in order to survive, Malena becomes the scapegoat for the insecurities of those around her. The character Renato knows this. He vows to protect her, but there are only so many things that a young man no older than thirteen can do.Director Tornatore has crafted a film that is deeply personal. Taking place during the hardest of times and when the world was changing so rapidly in the face of revolution, the real revolution is that of the one occurring inside Renato's character. The war not only brews in the environment around him, but also inside himself with his passion for this woman. As such, Tornatore has given us reason to reflect upon ourselves and the times long since gone when we faced our first heartaches. The film's last lines are the most poignant as the narrator, an adult Renato reflects on his feelings for Malena after seeing her for the last time, ""I peddled as fast as I could as if I were escaping from longing, from innocence, from her. Time has passed and I have loved many women. And as they have held me close and asked if I will remember them, I've said, 'yes, I will remember you.' But the only I've never forgotten is the one who never askedMalena."" **** Out of ****",Malena
47,imbluzclooby,Timelessly charming!,8,26 September 2020,"Malena is one of those films that can be criticized, but it's impossible for any human not to feel. Witnessing ethereal female beauty through the eyes of an earnest boy does not have to be entirely sexual. It can be something more profound, more generous and even more rewarding. Malena offers such benefits
Monica Bellucci is used for her beauty as usual, but here she displays a melancholic grace that seems to wipe away all the earthly and crummy matters that come in her path. She's a lonely woman who we really don't get to know, except through the eyes and observations of Renato, her nubile admirer.This ""Coming of Age"" film has some comedy mixed in, but it's not vulgar. We need the laughs. Some of the acting from the supporting cast is farcical, but that's forgivable being that this story serves as an allegory of the human spirit. It's also a good period film, set in Sicily during WW2 during the German occupation and uprising.This movie has also had some criticism. Without dumping on those critics, I'm sure they had personal reasons for the story not fitting their credulity. My suggestion to those individuals is that they experience this movie with an open heart and try not to let their critical thinking skills get in the way. It's a beautiful story that is both heartbreaking and immeasurably deep.",Malena

49,diand_,Duality,6,20 July 2005,"Giuseppe Tornatore has a fine eye for romantic and nostalgic themes. He takes time to set up the story and this is a movie that grows on you with every minute passed.There are two stories at work here. In the forefront we have the rejection of the villagers of Malèna and the consequences hereof. No romanticizing of Sicilians like The Godfather here. Tornatore, being Sicilian himself, makes them look backward and morally repugnant. His negative view here on mankind resembles that of Kubrick. In the background is the Second World War, sometimes reaching the village by way of refugees, soldiers and bombs. (The start of the bombing is one of the best shots in the movie).The director has the difficulty of not only making Malèna attractive for the villagers but also for the viewers and in order for this to work the choice of telling the story through the eyes and fantasies of teenager Renato is a good one. The distance maintained between Renato and Malèna makes this work; they only meet shortly in the end.The main structure here is the duality between the destruction war brings and the destruction of the individual by a group. And wars usually start with victimization of individuals. The beauty of the landscape (therefore the many landscape shots) set against the ugliness of war; the beauty of Malèna set against the ugliness of the villagers. The ant scene in the beginning a precursor of things to come.I'm wondering why some actors have a preference for a certain kind of role. Monica Bellucci (with almost no lines here) plays once again a victimized character like she did in Irréversible.The name of Anthony Minghella popped up on the credits. And there is great resemblance here with his directorial style in for example The English Patient and Cold Mountain: Realistic stories with a romantic wrapper but a very dramatic core.The portrayal of Sicilians in the movie and especially Renato's family is so over-the-top and exaggerated in its typical Italian mannerisms that it becomes almost screwball comedy. If that's the intention it makes no sense in the overall mood set out in the movie.",Malena
50,m_madhu,"sensitive, funny, shocking, ruthless all at once ....",8,12 March 2002,"malena is another example of brilliant storytelling and narrative style from italy. the movie is a rollercoaster of emotions and handles some very sensitive topics with amazingly believable sense of reality. the first half is outrageously funny and enjoyable despite being risque, the warmth and matter-of-fact-ness with which it is handled makes it thoroughly enjoyable.
the director provides a wonderful setting and the claustrophobic reaction of the small-town to the stunning beauty and independent, strong-willed spirit of malena is almost palpable. monica bellucci is astounding in a role in which she is hardly required to speak, she lets her expressive eyes and her body language convey the necessary emotions and feelings. a truly outstanding performance.the obsession of the young boy, renato, with malena is amusing, funny, touching and sincere. and is very convincingly portrayed. contrasting with the humour of the first half is the more sensitive and darker second half, when things go bad. this again is handled very beautifully and poetically. the movie is a feast for the senses and a treasure, however there are a few potholes and it does get a little repetitive at times. apart from these, the movie is a little gem in a similar movie making style to that of life is beautiful. love it or hate it. but watch it.a sensual 8!!",Malena
51,athena24,A good movie.,7,31 July 2016,"This is a good movie, although an idealistic one. The cinematography and acting are top notch. The character of Renato Amoroso is interesting, very likable and played well. His father's character is also a good one. Not too caring one, but he does understand his son's needs and more than holding his word, ultimately leaving a positive impression. Monica Bellucci as Malena is just perfect. Malena is a woman whose beauty is her sin. Women are jealous of her, and try to throw dirt at her. Men try to use her. She's the target of constant gossip, but she tries to hold herself graciously. Who other than Monicca Bellucci can play it so well?The drawback, In my opinion, is that the movie tries to be too idealistic in its nature. It seems that apart of the main character and his family (whose members have nothing to do with Malena), all characters are nasty people, trying to take advantage of Malena. I find this exaggerated and mostly untrue. There are always good people, that will make a good deed without expecting something in return. Especially, when those deeds are not of sacrificing nature.I find some resemblance of Malena's story to Izmeralda's from The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Both portray a woman (although Malena is slightly more mature) whose beauty is a subject of jealousy. However, in the case of Victor Hugo's novel, the characters involved are from a broader spectrum of good and bad, making them closer to the people I know.To sum it up. Malena is a good movie. It's a tale of right and wrong. I think it will be more interesting to people in their teens or twenties, believing in ideals and a clear separation of good versus bad. And it would appeal less to those who see the world as a mix of everything.",Malena
52,wjfickling,Boredom with a few moments of greatness,7,31 January 2001,"This is a better film than Cinema Paradiso, although I seem to be almost alone in regarding Cinema Paradiso as a piece of c**p.  The first half of the film is devoted to one of my least favourite themes, a male adolescent ""coming of age.""  If you enjoy scenes in which a bunch of adolescent louts sit around comparing penis sizes, or in which the lead--and least cretinous (meaning he is undoubtedly a standin for the director)--lout is repeatedly shown masturbating or with an erection bulging in his pants, then this is the film for you.The first half of the film is excruciatingly boring with all of its coming of age cliches, and deeply offensive as well.  The protagonist, Renato, is seen spying on Malena through a (very convenient) crack in the wall of her house, and he is thus able to see her in various states of undress and/or entertaining male visitors.  We are obviously meant to think this is funny and endearing.  The director clearly has no sense of what an invasion of Malena's privacy this constitutes.  Not to mention the fact that credibility is stretched to the limit when we are asked to believe that this seemingly intelligent schoolteacher never notices this young lout repeatedly spying on her, climbing up trees outside her house, etc.Yet, the film has some redeeming moments that make it worth seeing. Bellucci is not given much dialogue, so her acting is primarily nonverbal. In an exquisite performance, she succeeds in conveying Malena's character through gesture, gait, and posture.  And the scene in which the women of the town take their wrath out on her is almost as great as anything on film; in this scene, Bellucci establishes herself as a truly great actress. But...I didn't find the film's upbeat ending the least bit credible.  A mixed bag indeed!",Malena

54,isaacsundaralingam,The exact right amount of cinematic exaggeration,8,4 November 2021,"Malena is a heartbreaking movie... especially considering how easy it was to not be so. Starring Monica Bellucci in a role that almost perfectly embodies her own objectification in this industry, Malena offers us a very intimate account of what a woman could go through in a society where she is seen only for the curves in her body and not an inch deeper than that.Malena is beautifully written. It marries a coming-of-age story with something much powerful. There is ever only one character in the movie worthy of our sympathy, and that is the titular Malena. Because everybody else, protagonist Renatto included, only serve us to show the levels of rot in society's insecure thinking as a whole. And the movie is very powerfully protrayed and even more powerfully delivered.Apart from the acting, it is the imagery that sets Malena apart. Symbolized through various works of art; from cinema, to religious iconography, Malena puts its emphasis on the suffering of the character. And it accumulates in the movie looking absolutely gorgeous.Malena is far from real life. It is exaggerated to pack a punch. And I honestly think it succeeds in doing so. The exaggeration never got to a point where it felt numbing, as is so with most movies that try to push the line. The exaggeration feels real, and more importantly, feels human. And pulling this off in the way it did, is probably this movie's biggest success.",Malena
55,fredberglyle,Malèna - Ravishing beauty yet 'resistable',7,16 August 2013,"Malèna Scordia shown as an object of desire for men and an object to envy for women. Set in 1940, the movie deals with the story of 27 year old beautiful widow in an Italian village. From the eyes of Renato, a 12 year old, Malèna arouses sensual feelings (quite normal as the other kids in the neighborhood) and I admire the way the director shows it in a series of scenes. The way the boy's father beats and scolds deserves laugh and applause. IMO, I feel that the director pushed way too hard abusing the character (Malèna) almost every other scene and it makes the viewers feel that the village women ain't got other work than abusing the poor widow. The level of sentiment quotient in this work makes it one short of being 'Irresistible', yet Monica Bellucci looks Irresistible in the scene where she is dressed as the Holy Mother",Malena

So some of the details of her life will not be known to us. Still, we observe what the boy sees, and therefore feels what he feels. But, as we were when we were kids, we just observed and dreamed, wanting to approach or interact, but never having the nerve to.Toward the ending, it was a shock, because it was always assumed that people only stared or talked behind her back, never acting out what they wanted to do, but that is what makes it more shocking.All in all, a fine film that has makes you feel of how it was to be a kid again.",Malena

Watching Malèna gives you an answer to these questions, it tells you what it is to waste your time in chasing something you'll never get. Nothing really intellectual, but when it has been created to look so innocent it becomes more interesting. The frame of the movie could have occurred some other place too but this time it happens in Sicily during the Second World War. Using the wartime makes the film more dramatic and casting a little boy in the main role makes it look just some innocent curiosity. Making the the fortune to maltreat the woman makes you to understand her actions and feel pity for her. Malèna is about the situation when sexuality and emotions don't match even if you wished for it - the worst example of a Romance!

Malena (Belluci) is a statuesque beauty desired by the local menfolk in Worl War II Italy. Renato is a twelve year-old boy who worships her from afar...
A film that may well improve with subsequent viewings is beautifully shot with a sumptuous score to match.
Caught between glossy wish-fulfilment and hard-hitting realism, Tornatore, working well within his game here, doesn't always pull off the tricky transitions from whimsy to tragedy. But Ennio Morricone's score and Lajos Koltai's photography paper over some of the cracks, creating a beautiful, if not completely satisfying, work.",Malena

60,RARubin,A Masterpiece!,9,25 July 2005,"I saw Tornatore's, Paridisio and was impressed as were all the other critics. The incredible recreation of the Italian World War Two era was astounding. The sites of old Europe make the trick a little easier for European directors - they only have to move the cars and TV dishes from the roofs, and in some places, Sicily, they may not have to do that. Try making a picture about the 1940's in New York City. It's studio simulation time which just isn't the same thing.Monica Bellucci may have been just another model, but Tornatore saw something in her, and what a fascinating performance she gave him. The beating and haircut scene is unforgettable, a magnificent work of art by the beautiful woman. Where were the Academy Awards for this portrayal of the lonely Sicilian woman betrayed by her people? The fools! This is why Hollywood is in the dumps. At least Harvey Weinstein was smart enough to front some dough for this flick.How do Italian directors get so much splash out of every scene, The people jabbering away with their arms in the air expressing every emotion, love, disgust, anger, spite, and jealousy all in a speedy moment.

And in the first half I just watched it like a very casual movie, because of it's pretty simple storyline that too at the era of World War II times! But suddenly in the second half (especially in last 20min) something happened to my mind, which changed my entire prospective of this movie that too very fast within some seconds! Suddenly I became thoughtful about this gripping storyline!Ohh man! What a Cinematography, and what a great combo of background musics attached with those scenes.. Despite of language barriers I just completely able to enjoy it by my own just adding some English subtitles to it.Overall great movie to watch.

62,Philaura,"Gorgeous, Sensual, Moving - Thoroughly Entertaining",10,20 August 2001,"I'm baffled that so much criticism is attached to this film by folks that would have shown this ""moment"" another way - their way. As though their view of life is more accurate than this directors and he somehow made a mistake. Hey - life is full of possibilities - pick one and somewhere, sometime through someone's eyes I'm certain it happened just that way.
I had my own issues with the film.  I grew up as an attractive Italian female.  I made many enemies of family and friends, not so much because of my natural physical gifts, but because of how I flaunted them with total disregard of other's feelings, demanding everyone's attention to them by wearing accentuating clothes, etc everywhere I went. I didn't care or was more correctly oblivious to the fact that I made other's uncomfortable by forcing them to deal with strong emotions that are difficult to control i.e. lust and jealousy every time they confronted me. It took me a while to learn that there is a time and place for everything.  If you choose to play with dynamite, you are not totally blameless when the sh*t hits the fan.
So, my issue with the film was that the town was presented as wrong and Melena portrayed as the innocent victim.  Or was that even the case?  Maybe that's just my take because that's where I come from. I guess what I'm saying is - I'm giving this film a 10. Not because I agreed with everything that I ""thought"" was implied, or that I felt the characters were exactly the way that I would like to see them portrayed if the story was mine, but rather because this very talented director with his extra-ordinary abilities created a moment on film the way he saw it in a extra-ordinary way.

Normally, I would end up liking a movie or I would end up finding it a cheap pass time or find it completely stupid. This movie, I could not categorize too easily. Neither did I find this movie too likable and yet I did not hate it. The fundamental feature of the movie is that it has two parallel perspectives that instead of complimenting each other actually destroy each other as I shall try and explain.The movie is about Malena, a beautiful wife to a soldier, admired and fancied by all the bachelors in her town. There is a group of kids including the lead character Renato who fancy her and imagine themselves in romantic alliance with her. Simply put, her beauty invokes their deepest sexual desires. The movie follows the transformation of the lead character into an adult whose first and extremely strong crush is a lady much elder to him. He always spies on her and imagines being with her. This part of the movie is meant to make you smile and laugh.The movie's other part is the tragic tale of Malena. Her troubles begin when she loses her husband. Gradually she is forced into the immoral way of life i.e. being a prostitute in order to survive. Parallel to this, we have the young boy who is trying to come to terms with the seemingly immoral direction that his admirable first crush is taking. In the process of showing the funny side of Renato understanding his adulthood, the movie fails to convince us of the deep pain of Malena and also how she ends up provoking the town's ladies to react violently.The ladies of the town beat her up badly on the streets to teach her a lesson. Tough this scene is meant to be and it has been well shot. But what about all the motivation? Where did it come from? We are not allowed a much deeper understanding of the ladies' thoughts on Malena. The ending of the movie is handled extremely well and it is this part of the movie that made me question as to why the remaining movie did not involve me so much? This movie could have found its place as among the most dramatic movies ever should there have been a different mixture of comical part of the movie and the tragic. The proportion adopted in this movie destroys, in my opinion, the very important element of a drama - the involvement of the viewer.",Malena

65,gbrumburgh,Beautifully realized allegory as a ravishing Sicilian woman's fall from society is set against the turbulent backdrop of Mussolini's Italy.,9,23 March 2001,"Once again director Giuseppe Tornatore delights his core film audience with a beguiling coming-of-age piece as seen through the eyes of a young Sicilian boy.  With the enchanting and sentimental 1989 feature ""Cinema Paradiso,"" Tornatore offered  an affectionate look at a young boy's burgeoning preoccupation with movies.  A decade later he returns with ""Malena,"" wherein the object of obsession is a beautiful, older woman.  This time out, however, the story unfolds in darker, grittier, more harrowing fashion. 
Set in a quaint Sicilian seacoast town amid the rise of fascism in Italy (1941), a streetwise 12-year-old experiences his first boyhood ""crush""  in the form of Malena, as she strolls into the piazza one day.  Malena's exceptional beauty and provocative dress instantly draws attention, and though she remains aloof to the incessant scowls and lecherous leers as she tends to her daily business, it doesn't stop the small town gossipers from spreading malicious lies of adulterous affairs with assorted menfolk  hearsay perpetuated not only by the jealous wrath of dowdy, shrewish wives, but by their  husbands who fantasize and even boast of non-existent conquests.  In truth, Malena has been faithful to her husband, who has gone off to war.   As the boy's infatuation deepens, he begins following the mysterious woman, even spying on her, desperate to disprove the ugly talk that threatens his saintly, puerile image of her.  After her husband has been declared killed in action, Malena's safety becomes at risk.   The eventual rape, desecration and banishment of the symbolic beauty coincides with the downfall of her own war-ravaged town. ""Malena"" is first and foremost a story of lost love and innocence.  Our young protagonist becomes a helpless onlooker as he witnesses his beautiful flower in a nest of weeds choked of life and loveliness.  To break up the natural bleakness of this tale, the director interjects some lightness.  One consistently humorous ploy is the playing out of the boy's various movie fantasies starring Malena and himself   as Tarzan and Jane, as a gladiator slaying his opponent for the fair queen, etc.  Another is his devoutly religious parents' overly hysterical  reactions to the boy's ever-budding sexuality, done in typically old-style Neopolitan fashion.  These clever scenes add purpose to the rebellious boy's unusually deep obsession with Malena.   Monica Bellucci is the most ravishing, enigmatic creature to capture a lens in decades.  The incarnation of smouldering, spell-binding beauty, she fascinated this viewer from start to finish, doing so with a minimum of dialogue or gestures.  I have to go as far back as Jennifer O'Neill in ""Summer of 42"" to remember being so taken aback.  The bulk of the film, however, rests squarely on the shoulders of young Giuseppe Sulfaro as Renato.  No problem.  The boy's a real natural,  maturing affectingly as he learns to face life's many, often cruel lessons.Easily my favorite foreign film of 2000.",Malena
66,clivy,"Another movie for men, by men, about a woman (supposedly)",9,18 April 2004,"I enjoyed watching Malena. It is a moving story about a boy on the verge of manhood. It's also about a woman trying to survive in a world surrounded by lustful males and and their jealous, gossiping wives and mothers. The first story is told lyrically and masterfully. The second story -- well, we see the woman's story only through the eyes of the boy. A boy who loves the woman from afar and gains revenge on the woman's critics by spitting in their drinks and peeing in their handbags. I suppose that the boy couldn't do more for his beloved because of his youth: the film shows several times how he is ignored by the adults, and like Malena, oppressed by them as well. His writing the letter defending her does lead to her reunion with her husband and her acceptance by the townspeople at the end of the movie.The film is very much a cross between Summer of 42 and Portnoy's Complaint. The scenes showing the boy's budding sexuality emerging and his family's horrified reactions are hilarious and the strongest moments in the movie. But I wanted to see more of the woman's story. Though she is the title character and is almost every scene Malena is given few moments to speak in the film. I don't find the film offensive, but I have to say Malena would be a very different movie told from her point of view. For one thing, she is completely unaware of the boy who tells her story. I thought while watching the movie -- although I liked it and found it very funny and poignant -- it's a man's movie. Fair enough, but when are movies about growing up and learning about love and beauty going to be made about women, showing a woman's view?",Malena
67,gufi-04429,Is beauty a gift or a curse?,7,27 April 2019,"Oh, Malèna! Such a pretty face, such a sad story!Amazing cinematography, brilliant storyline. And let's not forget, who is perfect for this role? Of course, Monica Bellucci. Not only stunningly beautiful but very talented too. I have heard so many people underestimate her because they think of her just as a pretty face and nothing more. So in a way, she's Maléna. And that's what makes her perfect for this role. She had the luck to be born gorgeous but with this gift there comes jealous and hypocritical people just like the ones we saw in the movie. And exactly because of her talent, the thing that I really will remember for a long time is going to be the scene where Malèna gets beaten up. This was one of the most disturbing moments I have ever witnessed. My heart just broke. I felt disgusted by all this people and I felt hopeless because there was nothing I can do. I just wanted to go and give her a hug. She didn't deserve any of what has happened to her. And I guess, I wasn't ready to realize how ugly some humans really are.",Malena
68,LBytes,View of life from a 12 year old in WW2 Sicily,8,31 January 2002,"Everyone takes this movie so seriously. There is indeed serious content. Malena defines 'Beauty is a Curse'. She drives all the men wild with lust, while the the other women (almost all are unattractive) fill themselves with undisguised hate. These forces put Malena on a nasty little path in which she has almost no choice. The town women ultimately have their day, and were very cruel. As a man I can see why she would drive you nuts, though. But it is the boy that makes it all work. I LMAO sometimes at his little antics and responses to the nastiness that he spied going on around his fantasy love Malena. Also his fantasies with her are great, probably like some of the silly stuff I imagined when I was a kid. Its worth watching even with subtitles. After a while you can almost follow the story without them.",Malena
69,campblood13,Monica Bellucci is super sexy in a very good film,7,21 August 2003,The person who should get the most credit in this film is the one who gave Bellucci those dresses to wear.  (yum)  The story of young obsession is one that is close to my heart.  I remember being a young teenager in love with a certain girl or woman.  She is all you think about.Giuseppe Sulfaro does an awesome job as Malena's admirer from a distance. Malena goes through many struggles and depressing moments in her tortured life.  Some people don't like the ending of the movie wear Malena is beaten by a gang for her choices.  That scene is a true to life event because it actually happened to women at the end of WW2 who made the same choices.  How Malena is able to restore her pride and womanhood is a wonderful moment. 7/10,Malena
70,dfwforeignbuff,Another (though smaller) masterpiece from Tornatore,8,8 January 2010,"Directed by Guiseppe Tornatore one of my favorite film makers who made the Oscar Winning best film Cinema Paradiso. In this film Italy is just about to enter WWI after being dominated by Mussolini for several years. Suppose you were a 12 year old boy who was not yet as mature as your friends but at least you got yourself a new bike & then you find yourself really attracted to an older woman in town. (Malena played by extremely beautiful & well built Monica Bellucci) This 13-year-old boy (Renato) & his obsession with a small-town outcast woman in World War II Sicily make for a beautiful tale. Renato catches his first glimpse of shapely Malena , the daughter of his deaf Latin teacher (Notarianni). Instantly hooked hormones raging, Renato starts following her everywhere, indulging in keyhole spying & frantic masturbation. Though he never catches her attention she is drawn into elements of the war to survive & is outcast & beaten by local women at the end of the war. In the surprise ending her husband arrives alive after all at the end of the war. Malena combines a coming-of-age story with the sad journey of a woman punished for her beauty. With strong erotic elements & nostalgic cinematography it gives us a great (though simple) story & great views of a vanished pre-war Italy. These are the traits of film maker Tornatore used to make international hits of Cinema Paradiso & Il Postino. Production wise this film is a class act showing rich period detail of Fran. Frigeri's production design & Maurizio Millenotti's costumes. Cinematographer Lajos Koltai's gives us a truly beautiful warmly lit screen making the most of the Sicilian locations & the long stretches of the sun drenched port a(which was reconstructed in Morocco) Music Wise there is Ennio Morricone's insistent score which works well to enhance up the poignancy & emotional resonance of the film especially in the final scene.

73,EThompsonUMD,"sentimental, but far from hogwash",8,21 July 2001,"Like his memorable Cinema Paradiso, Giuseppe Tornatore's Malèna is a coming of age story set against a rich, nostalgic backdrop of mid-twentieth century Italian history and small city culture. The setting in this instance is Southern Italy during World War II. On the day that Mussolini declares war on Great Britain and France, the film's young protagonist, Renato, is given a bicycle that represents the first stage of his passage to manhood. Although still too young to wear the long pants symbolic of sexual maturation, he joins a group of somewhat older youths whose principal occupation - seemingly like that of every male in town  is gawking at Malèna, the voluptuous daughter of their dotty, deaf Latin teacher.Played by the miraculously beautiful Italian model Monica Bellucci, Malèna, a newly wed whose husband has been shipped off to war and later reported dead, is a focal point of male desire, female envy, and general gossip. Innocently charged in a sex scandal, she succumbs to the initial, near-rape advances of her operatically bombastic lawyer and begins an affair with him. The lawyer, one of the Tornatore's familiar comic-grotesques, proves to be a mama's boy who abandons Malèna at the mother's insistence. Increasingly alone, desperate, and hungry, Malèna heeds the siren call of a seedy pimp and begins a rapid descent into communal disgrace. Ultimately, she sets up shop with another notorious local prostitute servicing the occupying German officers. When liberation day comes, Malèna is dragged into the streets by a group of outraged women, and  in a scene worthy of Kosinski's Painted Bird  is horribly beaten, stripped, shorn, and hooted from the town.Throughout, Malèna's exploits are viewed through the (sometimes literally) voyeuristic eyes of Renato, whose feelings for Malèna, Tornatore suggests, stem not only from pubescent sexual urges, but from a deeper, 'purer' romantic longing, the force of which drives Renato to become Malèna's only champion in the town, reeking minor vengeance on her enemies and detractors and lighting candles for her protection in the church. In developing Renato's complex attraction to Malèna, Tornatore constructs fantasy sequences that often blend ambiguously with reality in the manner of Fellini's 8 ½ and sometimes invoke the imaginative power of the cinema. These fantasy sequences culminate in a technically adventurous, kaleidoscopic montage that bring to a crescendo the whirring, sex-saturated images of Renato's subconscious.After Malèna's brutal banishment, two things happen: Renato is taken to a whorehouse by his father for sexual initiation and Malena's husband shows up minus an arm but very much alive. When no one will tell him what has become of his wife except to suggest mockingly that he look in every brothel in Sicily, Renato mails the husband an anonymous message exonerating Malèna and informing him of her whereabouts in Messina. A year passes. Renato is next seen walking the square with his first girl friend. Suddenly, all eyes turn to witness the re-emergence of Malèna on the arm of her husband. Confronted with the courageousness of her return and reassured by her safely married state and the few wrinkles now tempering her still beautiful face, the townswomen accept Malèna back into the community. Her redemption is capped by a brief encounter with Renato, who helps pick up some fruit she has dropped from a shopping bag. As Malèna walks away, Renato rides off on his bicycle, the voice-over of his adult self relaying that many women have since asked him to remember them but that only Malèna, the one who never asked, remains unforgettable.If all this sounds sentimental to the point of mawkishness, I suppose it is. Nevertheless the film is a visual treat, and the lush soundtrack by Morricone doesn't hurt in the slightest either. Malèna doesn't reach the heights of brilliance that the first half of Cinema Paradiso does, nor is Renato as appealing or as well developed a character as Salvatore. On the other hand, Malèna doesn't overstay its welcome. Its tightly constructed screenplay is sparse in dialog, yet filled with warm humor. Overall, the film merits a solid ""8.""",Malena
74,d_carlotaj,Malena: A Texas Tornado in Italy,10,9 February 2020,"""Malena,"" (2000). Starring Monica Bellucci, Giuseppi Sulfaro. Directed by Giuseppi Tornatore. Written by Giuseppi Tornatore and Luciano Vincenzoni. This was a little hidden gem for me. Won several awards and was nominated for two oscars. Whatever won instead must have been phenomenal. This film was dedicated to the director's father. So it's a good bet that this bildungsromen was a personal memory. It is about a young teenager who falls madly in love with an absolute goddess whose husband has been called to the front in Africa during World War II. Like the Greek myth Cupid and Psyche, Malena suffers from the slings and arrows of jealousy, lust, revenge, and female mobbing. But she has a little champion, Reynato. Malena is the obsession of the fantasies of all of the men and boys in the little Sicilian town of Castelcuto. But the little hero of this story is Renato. You could say that a closing line of his reveals the leitmotif: ""After your husband, the only man in your life is me."" You could say that this little man knows what a real man is, does, and doesn't do. He watches her, watches over her, seeks revenge on her behalf, watches her from afar, adores her. She knows. What ensues is a blend of hilarious comedy, pathos, tragedy. The characters are so fully developed with that keen Italian eye for detail and humanism. My favorite character, of course, is Renato's father. You're going to love this film. The cinematography is superbly Italian. The direction, acting, screenplay, just every element is superb. I may have a new favorite director. This movie is all about charm and has become my favorite woman-mobbing film! It's on Amazon Prime. I give it 5 of 5 stars. Enjoy.",Malena
75,silviopellerani,A beautiful Monica Bellucci for an useless film,5,27 November 2000,"Giuseppe Tornatore in one the most known today's directors outside Italy, not only because he won the Oscar with ""Nuovo Cinema Paradiso"" but also because his films are quite clever, and very well exportable: i.e. The Pianist.Castelcuto Marittima is a small dry town in Sicily during the second world war, politically framed by the fascists. One of those Italian towns where nothing could be done in silence and where everybody is informed of everything. Malena belongs to an upper class lady and is waiting her husband lieutenant sent to Africa. She is as beautiful as reserved and a teenager, Renato, is falling deeply in a platonic love with her. He follows Malena everywhere without disclosing himself. The whole town is gossiping about her private life but Renato knows that she is faithful. Renato is in the age perfectly represented by the transition between the short and the long trousers. The ""malice"" age. The beautiful shots when Malena walks crossing town's main square and everybody gives their eyes are just excellent. The film continues with dreams where Renato has a role of a hero and she is a heroin -sometimes slightly like a fairy-tale. In another scene she is seen as the Virgin crying in a religious easter procession.Then she is informed of her husband death and starts her sense and need of sexual liberalism which worsen her position in town. Even her father does not trust her anymore. Then arrive the Germans with the economic recession and she is obliged to sell her body. Town women do not spare her and in a terrible and violent scene outrage, humiliate and lynch herself in public. Renato assists passively, but deeply involved, to her town leaving and when her ""non"" death husband returns back he informs anonymously about Malena's faithfulness.In spite of the excellent shots and professional editing -the scene like the harangue of Malena's lawyer is great- these do not justify the achievement of this commercial film which is rather empty and do not add anything to the italian neorealism. The film seems just to be built up around Bellucci's beautifulness.Rating: 5/10",Malena
76,diztorted,A bittersweet blend of Tornatore,9,19 May 2001,"Before I saw this film, I knew I was going to like it. From the moment I saw the poster outside the theater I felt something intriguing about it. And of course I was right. Tornatore once again like in ""Starmaker"" transports us into a new bittersweet atmosphere surrounded by a beauty that is not contained in just a frame but that spreads and becomes the place where you are standing on. The yellowish tone of the film gives the sensation that we are looking into the narrator's memories with certain melancholy and sadness for what happened those days; but at the same time, it gives the film the tone of innocence, longing and the tone of pure love and joy.It is a film in which we can appreciate the process of how a boy becomes a man in a society filled with hypocrisy, and in which people don't accept exceptional persons for being different. A society just like ours, in which people just take appearances in count regardless of how they are on the inside. But it is also a story about how a single person (the boy) can appreciate Malena for what she is more than for what she looks like. We can see how things like pure love at first sight can be possible. We see how the woman he loves, even though he never talks to her, helps him get through his life and brings him happiness. And on the other hand we have the lovely Malena, a lonely but brave woman, suffering the absence of her husband. A woman, who due to the rejection she suffered from the people around her, had to give up and become what people wanted her to be. And the kid who became her guardian angel to protect her from a world filled with envy, prejudice and hatred. At the end this film is a bittersweet mixture of love and despair, of hope and desperation, of dreams and reality. Something we don't see easily and beautifully portrayed everyday.This is not an easy movie, it might shock you, or it might bore you. You might either love or hate it, but at the end I can assure you one thing, is a movie you are going to talk about for quite some time.",Malena
77,dbogosian-1,profound mix of comedy and tragedy,9,7 August 2008,"This film is unusual in that it combines some truly light-hearted, comedic material with some of the darkest, most unpleasant themes. The resulting mix is in many ways reminiscent of its compatriot ""Life is Beautiful,"" but ""Malena"" comes across as distinctly darker, less optimistic about life overall.The light side of the story concerns an adolescent boy who develops a fixation on Malena, by far the most gorgeous woman in this small Sicilian town. The anecdotes of him spying on her, fantasizing about her, etc., are hilarious and entirely enjoyable. Very enjoyable are brief cuts from B&W movies in which the boy imagines himself in a scene opposite her, e.g., as Tarzan to her Jane, or a western, etc.But while Malena is admired by all the men, she is despised by all the jealous women who see the effect she has on everyone. This forms the dark backdrop of the story, the buzz of gossip and slander that circulates throughout the town and seems to surround her everywhere she goes. Interestingly, virtually none of the townspeople ever directly speak to her; in fact it is nearly halfway through the movie that we even hear her say a word. She is almost in a bubble while the hatred swirls around her. And the men, while their lust is openly displayed, make off-color jokes about her.***** SPOILER FOLLOWS ****** It is this dark side that eventually leads to the film's climactic episode, in which Malena is brutally beaten by the town's women and forced to leave town. Meanwhile, the town's men stand by and do nothing to protect her, even though they have all worshiped her beauty for years. This was a very difficult scene to watch, perhaps one of the most difficult, because it showed the horror of the evil that slander can generate, and the inability of individuals to do what is decent and break through the spell of group-think.All along, we keep hoping to see the boy come through with some act of chivalry or kindness, but he is too shy and unable to step forward. Until the end, however, when he does finally take a small step towards redeeming himself, and by finally coming forward he helps to reunite Malena with her husband (who was presumed dead in the war). The movie thus ends on a slight upbeat.***** END SPOILERS ***** This is a fantastic film on nearly every score. Strong acting, particularly from Monica Bellucci as Malena who seems enveloped in tragedy throughout the film. The score is marvelous; the one theme song stuck in my head for days. (Unfortunately the soundtrack is OOP and ridiculously expensive.) The filming and cinematography put you very much in the middle of Sicily during WW II; the atmospheric quality of the film is palpable and terrifically enjoyable. All the central characters are very real and multi-faceted; some are just there for comic relief and are perfect as such.Perhaps the overall message of the movie, besides the vilifying power of slander, is that being exceptionally beautiful, which most women would consider a longed-for blessing, can become a horrible curse, one that leads the person to the very brink of destruction. The film makes a powerful impression and it will leave you thinking about its story for a long time. Strongly recommended, 9/10.",Malena

79,dsa_ca,unpretentious innocent romance of the early life,8,31 July 2008,"'Malena' is a movie known to many around the world, notoriously everyone talks about it. No one knows anything about it except for Monica belluci's voluptuous assets on display in the movie. Just like the tiny Sicilian town of Italy during final chapters of the second world war, no one knows nothing about her except, that she is the object of man's innermost desires and has a considerable sexual appetite in the conservative town. But the truth is far from it, and only a boy in his late pre teen age has come to know of it. This sensually photographed movie is anything other then an erotic rag sack.Malena is a beautiful woman whose beauty in that small town may have become her curse, center of lustful attention of almost every men in town and envy for every women of the town. Gossips at every turn of the town revolve around Malena. Teenage kids line up outside her seaside house to catch her glimpse. Her father who is a respected (but deaf) professor at Renato's (the young lead) school. His impairments makes him butt of many joke with kids in his class unabashedly ask him for sexual favors from his daughter with him without knowing his students request orders them to "" hurry up""!. With the impending allied attack looming over the town along with the fascists Italy, the towns insecurities starts to creep out of the closet along with Malena. The war takes toll on her private life, as first the news filter in that her husband died in the war, which starts another round of gossips of her sleeping around with various men in town which makes her father abandon her. As her father passes away in one of the air raids by the allied forces over the town, her life becomes object of all kinds of gossips. As women starts accusing her of being a house breaker, the town starts depriving her from daily fresh food and materials. This leads her to prostitution to get her daily ration. The eventual victory of the allied forces brings her life in the town to a tipping point which forces her to live the town. Witnessing these events in Malena's life from rather close quarters in a very daring act of voyeurism is young Renato, whose love for her transform from sexual to emotional. Yes, there are scenes in the movie that can be described as too graphic, erotic and wild and probably faced the chopping table in many countries. But that's the beauty of the film as it depicts renato's young feeling for Malena in unpretentious manner, as the boy goes about exploring his new found sexual awareness in his wet & wild dreams about Malena being a damsel in distress and him being the her knight with a shining Armour. But as he goes onto peeping into Malena's life he starts understanding Malena's plight and begins pickup fights in school and even goes spitting around into people's drink who goes around offending Malena's image. He starts lighting candles at the local church in front of one particular statue, for her protection. This depiction of one sided love becomes so innocent that renato sheds tears for every downturn in Malena's life. As it turns out under very complex and unusual circumstances the boy does come about to Malena's life, without ever getting noticed by her. His love towards her is undying as he makes sure she lives happily ever after as he races towards becoming a man from a boy.Monica belluci balances her act to perfection while showing great maturity while also making audience feel vulnerable about her. The young actor playing Renato must be some mature kid to pull out that performance with such élan. This movie is definitely worth viewing without the things you have so far heard about it.

Young Giuseppe Sulfaro as Renato played the young boy excellently.

86,kastri_gr,An outstanding film that surprises the viewer,8,10 May 2012,When i first saw Malena i was 16 years old.I remember the plot and the interesting story about the world world 2 in South Italy.Malena is about a young adult who fell in love for his first time with a beautiful woman (named Monica Belluci)and despite the opinions that people had for her because although she was a widower by her husband who died in war with the Germans she collaborates with them in order to have an easy.There the boy will try to protect her by the wild moods of local community.The most socking scene is to the end when the war was over and women pilloried Malena as a traitor who collaborated with the Nazis.Of course the most unpredictable clue was the return of Malena's husband (who had not died but he was crippled) and although he had known the truth about his wife he will accept her back.The final scene is when Malena faced the women who hit her but they accepted her now because she returned as she was supposed to her husband and her unknown lover who just tell her good luck and the film ends with the phrase Malena will be unforgettable.Great story and directed by Jussepe Tornatore the creator of Paradise Cinema.Monica Belluci was the right choice for the role because she has this amazing beauty and in my opinion she was excellent.Of course the young kid was excellent and very lucky because he kissed in a scene by the film.A memorable scene was when Malena dances with the photograph of her dead husband Ma lamore no which means i will not love another except you.If you are interested in the European Films then Malena is a movie that you will never forget.,Malena

88,Lambysalamby,A masterpiece.,10,10 May 2015,"Wow, just finished this, totally blown away. This is a shining example of European film. You just do not get movies like this from Hollywood. It must easily be one of the best films I have ever seen. (and I have seen a lot!)This is a deeply sad movie which you could actually compare to the Elephant Man, albeit for beauty, not ugliness, I won't say any more about the story than that.The direction, cinematography and the score here are all flawless but the most amazing thing about this film was Monica Belluci, her subtle performance is beautiful and I could not imagine another actress in the role..The thing that is so poignant about the performance she gave is that she has very little dialogue at all, but the deep sorrow you could see on her face and in her eyes was astonishing.Overall: You'd be hard pressed to find a better film today so watch this one. It's an unforgettable masterpiece and I'm speechless.",Malena
89,AudemarsPiguet,Of sexuality and other demons....,9,10 March 2005,"Malena is a stunning film,shocking to ""pious"" purists&moralists;highly recommendable for the fan of true-blue Italian art film. The story begins at the dawn of the second world war,in a small Italian town somewhere in the utmost isolated,provincial Sicily,the mood of this dusty,archaic,strictly catholic settlement being like in Fellini's Vitelloni or the Don Camillo series-that typical Italian small town,event less,narrow yet not lacking a certain beauty. In this environment,a bunch of horny schoolboys just having reached puberty(they are depicted realistically,as somewhat vulgar,noisy,talkative,yet harmless whereabouts,as sort of Vitelloni in their early teens)spend their time,as expected,mostly thinking,speaking,boasting and fantasizing about girls,talking dirty,getting off...everything is shown credibly,unprejudiced,yet never explicitly sexual. Among them is the twelve year old Renato-not good-looking,not special,just craving for sex(note than in Mediterranen countries teenagers are early bloomers,probably due to the climate,though nowadays entering puberty at this age is nothing unusual,irrespective of country/region)who gradually discovers himself(literally)as sexual being.Of course,it won't take long that his obsessions are directed towards a more substantial object of desire,the a several years elder(yet not much elder,looking only far more mature&ripe)Malena,who just married a young and attractive officer.Her name is symbolical:Malena is abbreviation/nickname derived from Magdalena,like the Bible's most famous carnal sinner of female gender,who turns out to be extremely virtuous in the end. For a while,being attracted to Malena is for Renato a way to ease himself of growing sexual needs,even if she doesn't know for one single moment how much she's being longed for-in a scene familiar to most male viewers we see Renato masturbating while picturing her nude and fantasizing about ""doing""her,proving that the ultimate sexual organ&incentive is the brain and that even in a time when pornography was not so widespread and developed people found ways to stir themselves while having sexual intercourse and/or jerking off. Well,Monica Belluci,a stunning,fiery Italian beauty(a contemporary version of Cardinale,Loren or Lollobrigida),is just made for the part as Malena,she is physically voluptuous and besides that incredibly charismatic and fascinating,so it's not too hard seeing her as the perfect pin-up girl,in my opinion she could arouse even a homosexual or an impotent man(Renato is,of course,neither of these two categories,so...),besides physical beauty Belluci's delivering one of her finest performances(her real talent is proved in this rather unusual part,not in her forgettable,largely conventional,unintelligent,unimaginatively banal parts in Matrix or Mission Cleopatra). Renato's petty-bourgeois,fundamentalist Catholic parents(especially his tyrannical father,who considers beating up his children as ultimate pedagogic method)find out about his solitary practice,yet not about Malena,so after punishing him and lying that masturbation causes blindness(what a dated trick!),they eventually decide that he is not getting ""it"" and he needs a woman.Subequently he's taken by his father -it's surprising to see that even in yesterday's traditional,conservative Italy people were much more libertine than we might presume-to a brothel,where he chooses a prostitute strikingly resembling Malena and even enjoys it. In the meantime,Malena's husband is killed in battle,she then loses her father too,so,left without any means of subsistence,knowing that several male members of the town's better half have always longed for her,she becomes a prostitute herself. While seeing how she is humiliated by her clients and due to her lifestyle,Renato discovers that he is more than sexually interested in her,starting to feel a strong affection and devotion towards her and,finally,real love(though I'm not sure if it was love or only a confusion in an oversensitive,naive,horny teenager,who is easy to impress and to seduce,before being able to comprehend what's happening to him).He even suffers silently because he would like to gentlemanly free her from her misery,yet is too young,too small,too unimportant to act. The climax of this film is the scene were Malena is barbarically ""punished"" by the hypocritical moralists in her town,being,just like the biblical Magdalena,almost beaten to death-the brutal reaction of narrow-minded crowds acting more as an outcome of their frustration,envy and jealousy may be compared to similar scenes seen in Alexis Zorba or Ryan's Daughter,where we can see ""sinful""(in fact,Malena is,just like the young widow or Rosy Ryan,not a whore but a woman who is just living her sexuality more openly than the dated,false,strict morality of her narrow-minded community is permitting-but who's this community to judge anyway-the cause being much more the bottled-up in-satisfaction of the men who couldn't have her and the women who couldn't enjoy their sexuality as she did,rather than a strict,yet rightfully justified punishment). Finally Malena survives,but her pride is tainted for good,her husband,believed dead,returns as a cripple,but in spite of this they both try to resume their marriage-after all,they still love each other. Psycholgically brilliant is the reaction of the community after she quits her trade and returns to her husband-being a married woman,the same people who nearly killed her,treat her with(faked,merely theatrical)respect as she's now a married woman-it just proves how much the status a of a woman depended then not of her personality,but on strictly social,superficial,bourgeois criteria. Renato also underwent a painful change;in the touching closing scene he finally get's to speak to her,without letting her know what he felt for her-tragically he realizes that Malena is the only woman he will ever love,even later on (as an adult)he discovers that he can love no other one like her-ironically,the love for the persons we truly care about is often unfulfilled. This film is among the best creations about puberty&coming of age a,comparable to Burning Secret,The Cement Garden,Dillo con Parole Mie,Du Poil sous Des roses,Zappa,Torless or Jeux d'Enfants.It made me nostalgically look back at my experiences(as incidentally,I also entered puberty at the age of twelve,yet,sadly,without someone like Malena). I don't think that it portrays females,especially Malena,in a chauvinistic way:that females will always be in male's fantasies,even in dirty one's,is a biological fact;even more this film is an intelligent warning of not letting false morality,prejudice,chauvinism-even if Ricardo's folks had no bad intentions,they were far too strict- destroy the beauty of love,sexuality,sexual and sentimental freedom,imagination and romance. An art film and a lesson of life recommendable for teens and adults alike!",Malena
90,bigkingtut2000,"I really enjoyed this coming of age movie, set in WWII Italy.",7,29 July 2007,"It is quite similar to the fantastic Summer of '42, that starred Jennifer ONeill. This Italian coast version starred the stunning Monica Bellucci, as the object of the local teens and adult males fantasies. If god placed a more beautiful woman on this earth, mine eyes have yet to see her! Poor Malena, first her husband, a lieutenant in the Italian Army is lost and presumed dead. She is the object of much scandal from the local townspeople and when the poor girl needed their help the most they turned their collective backs on her. Every male sexual predator in the town did favors for her...for her favors. Some she gave, some were taken without her consent. The young boy that witnesses all this, Renato, sees how all fortunes has dealt the woman is bad luck and heartbreak, ending in humiliation for being a Nazi lover. The girl had to do something to eat. Renato character was excellent and showed the proper lust and compassion for the woman of his fantasies and dreams. When the MIA husband returns to find his family home a refugee shelter and no Malena, the boy as delicately as he could word it, told the news to the husband that his wife had HAD to do what she did to survive. That the towns people were all jealous and liars about her. I gave the film a 7-10, I would have liked to have given it a higher mark but it was never quite readily explained WHY the village women had hated Malena before tragedy had struck her. They acted like she wasn't one of them, yet, her father was a teacher in the town's school? Otherwise, a charming, sensual story well told, acted and equally photographed. If you want a meatier, Summer of 42 melodrama this is your movie.",Malena
91,afdiazr,"Could be better, but it's not as bad as critics say",7,26 December 2005,"I don't know. Maybe I love the film because I'm so in love with Bellucci since I first saw her in Dobermann. Anyway, I think there's a couple of parts where the film succeeds:-The public humiliation scene is really moving. It's even scary and hard to watch. One of the most disturbing scenes ever.-Sicily looks beautiful, and the scenes at the boy's home are great. Anyway, the comedy tone of the film makes the dark tone of the ending really powerful and effective. I think that was made on purpose, and it delivers. Still it's not a lovable movie, it's somehow perverse, but I think humanity is perverse and all Malena does as a character is to drive those perversions from the people around her. If you're in love with Bellucci, I can tell you this is the film where she looks at the top of her game. If you like beautiful European films about adolescence, maybe this is not the film for you.",Malena

93,rimsey-2,Fellini it ain't,4,9 November 2001,Giuseppe Tornatore has attempted to created a poignant coming-of-age story and I think he's been trying a little bit too hard. The characters are 2-dimensional and the situations are cliches. Perhaps the director is attempting to show how things appear through the eyes of the child Stefano who is infatuated with the beautiful Malena but the result is one of those movies where I just sat there bored and felt like jumping up and telling the director what he should be doing to make this movie better. I've seen some glowing reviews of this movie but as far as I'm concerned its a Disney story for adults. The idea of a father (especially one as strict as Stefano's as portrayed in this movie) taking his teenage son to be initiated by a prostitute in 1940's Sicily is mind-boggling. The end result is a movie that tries to manipulate the emotions of its audience and lacks intelligence.,Malena
94,dunbare,Beautiful!!!!!!!,8,11 February 2007,"Malena is the story of one boys and ultimately towns obsession with an incredibly beautiful woman named Malena. Renato is the adolescent who has become just as entranced with the enigmatic Malena as the people around him have.Renato, unlike many of the other admirers is adoring and sweet. He is a young boy who sees how Malena is both envied and adored. THe film takes place in WWII era Italy where Malena is living while her husband is off at war. She is so beautiful that the men literally stop what their doing to watch her walk by. The women in town are very jealous of her and call her names like whore.Malena, of course, is no whore and only Renato who watches her every move knows the truth. When news arrives that her husband has been killed Malena, already scorned and treated terribly unfair resorts to bedding a Nazi officer....after all a girl has got to eat.This sets the town in an uproar as the women are disgusted by her and eventually brutalize her when the war has ended. 1. Renato is like any boy who has seen a woman/girl for the first time who makes him weak in the knees. The daydreams he has about Malena are both funny and probably real for most teenage boys. 2. The movie was in subtitles when I watched it, as foreign films are not too popular in the states. I usually do not like reading subtitles, but I would encourage anyone to give it a try this movie is really worth it.3. Malena is played by the beyond beautiful Monica Bellucci. It was nice to see a woman who is more naturally attractive as opposed to the Paris Hilton/Nicole Richie/Britney Spears garbage that is running around staining Hollywood with their annoying ""projects"" and stupid pathetic party lives. I wish Hollywood would invest more into actresses like Bellucci. She may not be a great actress, but I thought she was wonderful in this movie. I would much rather watch a film with a Bellucci in subtitles than Paris Hilton screaming like a mad cow.4. The scene where the women in town ""strip Malena of her beauty"" is powerful. She is beaten, hair cut, and clothing ripped right in front of all the town to see. 5. Jealousy. What a powerful emotion. Many people are jealous and poor Malena is the center of all this unnecessary grief. While it is hardly admirable that she took up with Nazis', it could be understood. Here is a woman who is teased, mocked and scorned for NO REASON! Her father dies, her husband is presumed dead and she is all alone. This is still a time when women could not easily ""make it on their own"" let alone a war was ravaging the world. She made a sacrifice, that she herself was unsure of, but really what choice did she have?I really liked this movie and now have it on DVD.

A lonely, beautiful woman is an easy target of the dark side of human nature, isn't she?When all was said and done, I could not see the essence of good reviews of this movie. My DVD didn't have any director's commentary as some other said their's did, and I was left thinking that with any other actress, one less well-endowed physically, nothing at all would have come of this thing. The other actor of note, Guiseppe Sufaro (Renato), certainly was excellent in his first outing, and made me pine for that first untouchable older-lady-love of mine when I was a teenager.Yes, Monica Belucci was beautiful, but her two paragraphs of dialogue did not let the viewer get to see anything inside of her.

I surely envied him and I think that even Haley Joel Osment did.I must say that the vengeance of the town women with beating Malena and cutting of her hair remind me of ""Ryan's Daughter"".

Around the time of World War II he was 12 and a half years old, struggling to become a man and get recognitions from his peers. He fell in love with Malena, a very fascinating woman, at first sight. But alas, she was married. And all he could do was to follow her wherever she went; and fantasizing about her.News came that Malena's husband died in the war, and thus leaving her a widow. Now she had to face the world alone, and the world is not easy for a pretty widow. The men in town lusted after her, and the women was jealous of her beauty. At last she had to leave her town wounded and alone. But Renato gathered his courage and helped her; though anonymously.This movie ended with a surprise, and a nice surprise at that. Not necessarily a happy ending, but not a sad ending either. More like a real ending, although this is not a real story. Director Giuseppe Tornatore combined the view of destroyed Sicily with wonderful shore panorama, and the result is gorgeous.

Giuseppe Tornatore masterfully directs  his take on Italy and its part in WW2 history, and disguises it as a comming of age film. The visuals are very nice, and the music is so well done that I didn't notice it the first time through (It becomes so much a part of the mood).

107,blkmgcbhl,Not a forgettable film by any means,8,2 June 2013,"One of the strong reasons for watching ""Malena"" is to be able to sense the true depth of the narrator's final dialogue (translated below to English), ""Time has passed and I have loved many women. And as they've held he close... and asked if I'll remember them, I believed in my heart that I would. But the only one I've never forgotten is the one who never asked, Malena."" An equally important excuse for watching this tale of obsession that crosses all bounds is to witness the beauty of the Goddess-like Monica Bellucci. (I'm finding it a little hard to appreciate other women after this, I hope this is just a tiny phase.) The film starts out quite funny, the humour coming from 12 year old Renato's (Giuseppe Sulfaro) lewd imagination about Malena (Monica Bellucci) and the consequences of this that he faces at home.After the first few minutes, the film tends to get repetitive, a lot of wishful thinking on part of the protagonist is on display. It is only after the first half hour that the film appears to have some trajectory. The film's vision sobers quite gradually to the stage of being heart-breaking.Hypocrisy and jealousy in the Italian society - men and women alike as well as the ill-effects of the war on the mental health of people are some of the themes explored in the film. One example of this would be the synchronicity of Italy's liberalization from it's Fascist dictatorship and Renato's newly-found liberty from fantasizing about Malena.At a mere age of 16, Sulfaro delivers a strong and ferocious performance of portraying extreme sexual excitement, almost to the extent of an ailment. The Sicilian piazzas are picturesque. The musical score is top-notch, absolutely splendid and worthy of all appraisal possible.

Malena represents all that Italy was and is to him, both beautiful, easily misled, and misunderstood, and the climatic scene in which she is beaten down is in essence what happened to the country post Mussolini and WWII.

It starts with a funny contrast thanks to the imagination of Renato, a kid with the role of witness, witness to the story of Malena. Lajos Koltia photography is riveting, almost too beautiful, every frame is a postcard of the Mediterranean. The story is by Tornatore who showed in Cinema Paradiso he has talent for the children's point of view. The film may even start like an Italian art-film version of American Pie, but quickly falls into a darker tone. The screenplay is very good, but Tornatore takes a high risk, when he makes Renato a passive witness of Malena's disgrace, he goes beyond the point of simpathy with the viewer becoming a figure of pathetic cowardness diminishing the emotional strenght of the ending.",Malena

A division seen from the eyes of the teenager as his trouser length grows and the adherence to Il Duce waxes and wanes.As I say, if you thought Cinema Paradiso was good, you ain't seen nothing until you've seen Malena.

It has never been done better (He crushes almost all Swedish child actors as well, just to be fair to the US).The movie also portrays very well how old time, backward (rural) societies treat people who are different (Malena), with gossiping, lies and betrayal.This movie is superb and should just be inches behind Shawshank redemption and Green Mile and the other best movies...9/10 and it's close to 10/10",Malena
118,dubyah1,Unpleasant Italian Dogville,3,24 February 2005,"An Italian 'Dogville' From previous reviews, I was expecting a thoughtful war drama; instead it starts with some charming unrequited cinema-fueled fantasies narrated by an adolescent boy, and segues into the calumny, rape by the lawyer who defended her and prostitution of a mourning war widow, brought down by rumour, poverty and a pack of the ugliest draft-rejects, their wives and spawn you could find in Sicily.After the war, she and her MIA-but-not-quite-dead amputee husband are reunited covertly by the boy who has been too afraid to overtly help her. The townsfolk who shaved her head and drove her out of her home show their shame at their treatment of her by giving her and her husband food that they refused to sell her when she was starving and alone. A lot of the reviewers seem to have been voting for the gorgeous title character, and not the nauseating depiction of a country's devolution. Disturbing and thought-provoking, but in the pitying sense. I bet the writer is quite the nebbish in real life.3 stars for the movie-fantasy sequences, and yes, the gorgeous tabula rasa star.",Malena

120,Akira-29,There's Something About Malena...,8,9 March 2001,"This film is a wonderful realization of the collision between adolescent fantasy and reality. The main protagonist is Renato who is genuinely in love with Malena, a beautiful alluring widow in Sicilian village. Malena Scordia (played by Italian model Monica Bellucci) is the subject of gossip and rumor, and it is clear that she is alienated by it with her detached demeanor, her eyes downturned to avoid the scrutinizing glances of her fellow villagers. Malena incites feelings of lust and desire in young Renato. This lust turns into love as he experiences her alienation and her brief pained relationships with others in the village. Her beauty becomes her curse as jealous housewives and gossips slowly erode her good name... Her dignity erodes with it and the finale is almost unbearable to watch. Renato sees all with his innocent eyes... and we empathize with him - his fascination with this silent, elegant woman who has captured his heart, his disdain for fellow townsfolk who smear her unjustly, and his coming of age. We are impacted by Renato's loss of innocence when he realizes that the object of his affection has lost hers as well.There are moments in this film that are simultaneously funny, heart- breaking and touching. There are themes which touch upon the dark nature of beauty - its ability to alienate, its ability to arouse jealousy and hate in others... and the destructive consequences. How perfect that there is only one scene in which lovely Malena and young Renato interact together. Just one. He views her at a distance with awed fascination. The story and cinematography are both sharp and artistic - just what one would expect from the same writer/director of ""Cinema Paradiso"".",Malena
121,dylan-grieve,"Unsettling, invoking, romantic, moving",7,7 April 2012,"Malena chronicles the journey of one boy in 1940's Italy as he struggles with the journey to adulthood, experiencing feelings of longing, lust, jealousy, passion, fear, and love towards Malena, the object of his desire. This movie covers the spectrum of human emotion which lends a great richness to the film. Monica Belluci is gorgeous, drawing the carnal attention of the men and the jealousy of the women. The depictions of how the men view her as a sex object is amusing at first, but progresses to shameful and disgusting towards the end, as the culmination of the women's frustration and jealousy towards her is vented in a shocking and disturbing way. I believe the insecurities and sense of unrest in this film could be largely attributed to the fact that Italy was under Mussolini's rule at the time, and this was a period when sexual feelings were more likely to be repressed. Malena represented everything in every man's fantasy, and magnified every aspect of beauty that seemed to be missing in the women. The story is mostly tragic, but if you can stick with it, you will be rewarded. Plus, it's not hard to watch Monica Bellucci walk around in short skirts for a few hours.",Malena

The few scenes where Monica Bellucci actually got to act, namely towards the end, were very well done (maybe some day her other movies like The Apartment will be released in the US). The stereotypical child beatings and constant family screaming were a little overdone and didn't really provide the comic relief they were meant to....I don't know what's up with MIRAMAX but I've certainly had it with them promoting each new ""foreign"" flick they come along with as the next Il Postino.

125,juliarobertsla2-2,It was just missing something....,4,24 December 2004,"First of all,let me say that the movie was made beautifully. It was the acting and the storyline that brought it down. I was sitting there, watching this movie wondering if it was going anywhere for the first 50 minutes. It was like OK we got it, the kid's obsessed with Malena, and so are all the other guys in town. None of the wives talked to her, no one would sell her any food so she began prostituting for food which made the ""wives"" hate her more! It's just one ugly circle... Maybe the moral was don't start rumors? There were some scenes which I think they could have cut out. Also, the movie was oversexed just like in the movie Shakespeare in Love, that is of course my opinion. I felt there was absolutely no character development in any of the actors besides the 12 year old boy. The rest of the cast was dead(and I don't mean that they were killed). If you're going to see this movie don't expect something amazing...I did (2 Academy Award nominees, how bad could it be?) well in this case...BAD! 4/10 stars (that's low for me!)",Malena

This movie is an emotional roller coaster with the harsh reality of this world captured beautifully on a camera.,",Malena
127,francescoscinico,"Moving, Touching, And Truthful",8,4 January 2002,"This movie is so intense that I'm not exactly sure I'll be able to see it again. The pain I felt while watching it was almost unbearable.The acting was great; Monica Bellucci is perfectly cast for obvious reasons, but also shows good acting skills during the most tragic scenes of the film. Music and photography are excellent. The reason I could barely make through this movie is that it does a very good job at showing the worst characteristics of Italian people (unlike ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin,"" which shows the best aspects of my fellow countrymen). Should anyone think that things are different now in Southern Italy, let me warn them that the situation is only slightly better. *** Spoiler *** The other reason that mad me suffer is that I, like the main character Renato, was hoping that Malèna would behave honorably even in her most tragic moments, even though I understood her pain and sympathized with her till the end. The last twenty minutes of the movie are awesome. The contrast between the nobility of Malèna's husband's moral character and the rest of Castelcutò's citizens' is striking, and the scene with Malèna and the once-envious women is absolutely moving. The few seconds of silence between their greeting and Malèna's answer are breathtaking. The very last scene showing the tragic dignity of Malèna - seen from behind - walking back home from the market left me on the verge of tears for an entire afternoon. Human nature is truly amazing. *** End spoiler ***",Malena
128,Hacki,Not exactly a masterpiece,6,11 August 2001,"It is very sad to see, that the movies of an obviously capable director get worse every year. After the disappointing version of ""Novecento"" in 1999, Tornatore now fails to put together the two main strings of ""Malèna"". You can still see his mastership even in this movie. He presents an enchanting vision of a Sicily long gone, that he already evoked in his previous pictures. And he stands in the Italian tradition of showing melancholic childhood memories, that was perfected in Fellini's ""Amarcord"".Still Nino's story does not go along well with the tragic fate of Maddalena. On the one hand we are presented with the nostalgic view on the story of a child becoming a man, on the other hand we see how Maddalena is destroyed by envy and admiration. As those two stories belomg to a different genre - to a different way of telling ""tales"" they ridicule each other, making the movie with it's anecdotes partly unbearable.",Malena
129,roger.armstrong,Adolescent turbulations out of Paradiso,7,16 April 2001,"On first reflection this was a great disappointment for a devotee of ""Cinema Paradiso"". The age of innocence is no more, both with regard to the villagers and the male lead. The crudeness of some imagery, language and emotions are ways of showing the impact that adolescence, war and envy have upon people and this is mirrored in the filming.This is not the most comfortable film to watch and there are more subtle and successful ways to show this.Do go and see it but do not expect another ""Cinema Paradiso""",Malena
130,thewolfheart,A lovely woman in the eyes of a boy,9,8 October 2003,"It's been a while since I have last seen an Italian movie and not any Italian movie but a delightful piece of art from director Giuseppe Tornatore. This is a wonderful movie to watch, this is what Cinema is all about ! I am of the ones who find Monica Bellucci a goddess among many talented sexy actresses, and her charm is worked up to the optimal in this movie, she is beautiful Malina, a very attractive woman in town, It is her beauty that brings her misery, the men couldn't let her be, the women hated her and yet she shines still. The movie is told through the eyes of a young boy played by Giuseppe Sulfaro who is going through adolescence, who falls in love with Malena and is the only one in town that saw beyond her beauty. This movie reminded me of a woman I used to dream about when I was a kid.Nothing beats simplicity . . .",Malena

Tornatore is one of the best directors of this time. Don't miss his pictures! Hans Dullaart Delft Netherlands.",Malena
132,chandos49,"""The voice of the people is the voice of God!"" Really?",9,24 July 2006,"The quote above comes from the English subtitles of this movie. I imagine it is a correct rendering of the Italian at that point.If anything, the voice of the people represents all the reasons they (and I) need a Savior, for the voices are of lust, envy, malice, condemnation without provocation, and deceit when apology and recompense were the only appropriate responses.The name Malena is a diminutive of Maddalena, which is more familiar to us as Magdalene. Tradition says Mary Magdalene had been a whore before encountering Jesus Christ. She has been portrayed as a paragon of beauty in fine art down through the centuries. Such a background would be familiar to most audiences in Italy (and Sicily!) who've watched this movie.So, part of the subtext of this narrative is that one's name is destiny, the sort of conclusion easily reached by the unperceptive and unloving. In the case of Mary Magdalene, if the tradition is true, she would bear her name proudly as one whose bitterness of experience was redeemed by the only One Who loves with absolutely pure motive. In the case of Malena, the unanimous force of public sentiment forced her into a corner and then blamed her for the result she resisted.Set and shot in Sicily, the time line runs from Mussolini's declaration of war through the year after the Allies retake Sicily. The camera angles used convey the larger forces at work surrounding, and working within, the inhabitants of ""Castelcuto"" (actually Siracusa, on the east coast of the island).Monica Bellucci's task, so early in her career, was enormous in this role and handled adeptly. Giuseppe Sufaro, as the youngster who lusted after her and came to love her, is similarly impressive.The weak point in the narrative is the role of Malena's father. He is portrayed as profoundly deaf and a master of Latin. Students continually ask him lewd questions, to which he readily assents, with the apparent assumption they are only asking permission to use the water closet. Would a man so sharp in the nuances of Latin have no inkling of body language, nor be unable to lip-read?My dear departed grandmother was no scholar, but she lip-read my words from across the room. Also, when I was caught stealing cookies she'd baked (the first time I stole as a child) she at first refused to believe I'd done it. It was so out of character for me. Similarly, should not the Professor have resisted an anonymous accusation about his daughter? Everything in the film indicated Malena to be a faithful and devoted daughter and wife. To have her father fly off the handle as was done in this story reveals the only blind spot in an otherwise thoroughgoing vision.And visionary may be the best descriptor of this film. Malena is a moving example of the maxim, ""Of those to whom much is given, much is required."" Exceptional beauty, wealth or talent exact a price upon anyone so blessed. The horror is not so much what Malena suffers at the hands of her neighbors (although enough to make a grown man cry) as the base motives animating those neighbors.Maybe that's why I identify so well with this movie. See for yourself if you don't do the same.",Malena
133,frankish-1,"The ""Malena"" Syndrome",10,9 July 2006,"I have the opportunity to watch this film very often because it's a regular on the numerous cable televisions in my country. And although i've seen it so many times, i never grow tired of it. It's really a very charming film with an excellent script and direction by Guiseppe Tornatore. The acting is really great too. Monica Bellucci is not only the most beautiful woman in the world, but also a great actress. She's so beautiful in this film that you never ask yourself why the little Renato is so in love with her. And Guiseppe Sulfaro, who plays him, is really great too. I even recommended this film to a friend of mine, who is a kind of guy whose favorite film is ""The Fast and the Furious"", but he liked it so much that we even had a long discussion about it and he's not into that kind of things too. We came up with the phrase ""the Malena syndrome"".What does that mean? It's about one really annoying women's quality, it exist in man too, but i think not in such proportion. I'm talking about woman's envy, often in regards to a more beautiful woman. We can feel the hatred and envy towards Malena thorough the film. Her only fault is her beauty and that's what destroys her and leads her to the shocking and brutal climax of the film. I've seen several cases of the ""Malena"" syndrome and it's really so pathetic but i don't mean to insult anybody. Man also take advantage and talk behind Malena's back and only Renato, and the viewers through his eyes, can see that she's so pure and innocent of all the crimes they assume she's guilty of. We can do nothing but feel sorry for her.All in all it's a great movie. I've always been into that kind of coming-of-age films and this is one of my favorite ones. I recommend it to anybody and it's a must-see for the Bellucci fans. She's gorgeous in it.",Malena
134,duelek,A Sincere Reflection on Sexual Objectification,8,30 October 2010,"Tornatore's movies shed light on the past and current life and culture of his homeland, Siciliy. His earlier movies Nuovo Cinema Paradiso (1988) and Stanno Tutti Bene (1990) portray the South Italian society in a genuine way, while together with L'uomo Delle Stelle (1995) and Malèna he combines his passion for his country together with the one for cinema and history. Malèna's narrative revolves around the depiction of female beauty through the eyes and fantasies of men. Female body as an object of men's collective pressure and labelling is not peculiar to Sicily or Italy, but rather a universal phenomenon. The fact that Malèna's story is set in a small town increases this objectification, considering that every village may have its own famous beauty, reminding me Gradisca of Amarcord. But the striking story is more about Renato than Malèna. This character should not be alien, strange or even surprising to most of the male audience, because what he experiences is in accordance with a very normal pattern of growing up and puberty. The funny dichotomy of Renato is his reaction to other men of Castelcuto, who share the same sexual desires and fantasies about Malèna. What makes Renato really different from them? Why is he supposed to be innocent while others are evil, because they publicly utter their fantasies about Malèna. In Renato's dreams we don't see any pornography but it is obvious that they are indeed pornographic (or should we say ""phonographic""), but additionally he has a very protective attitude towards her. Maybe he isn't really that old enough to belong to the gang of other boys, who enjoy voyeurism without attaching themselves emotionally, as opposed to Renato who mixes sexual fantasy with love. The movie has very beautiful scenery and old Italian architecture, but the general language is more absurd than realistic. Especially social crises like fascist rule, war and immigration are portrayed in very picturesque scenes, rather than tragic and chaotic. Tornatore always impresses me with the quality of colour in his movies; just to remember the retro atmosphere of his masterpiece La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'oceano (1998). The use of original music with contemporary songs makes also the movie very pleasant to watch. The political references scattered through small dialogues here and there also add the movie an ironic dimension. Especially the father's metaphoric promise about Mussolini's head being broken into two is again just like Fellini's dissident father figure in Amarcord, together with the brief depiction of the education system by the school scenes. I think Malèna has more than the mere sexual element in itself to be discovered, but the reaction to it has hitherto been only in terms of sexuality thanks to the beautiful Bellucci.",Malena
135,lkil,Cinematographic Symphony,9,19 June 2004,"Malena is a beautiful and deeply touching film. It is a masterful combination of sites, sounds and colors. The two leading actors (Monica Bellucci and Giuseppe Sulfaro) are simply excellent at what they are supposed to convey in this movie. Apart from her truly majestic elegance, Monica Bellucci invests her character (Malena) with an aura of tragedy, of some profound and unrelenting emotional trauma and pain which remains unspoken throughout the film and reaches its climax at the very end. Malena's stunningly beautiful eyes remain constantly downcast, and her face -- tense and pierced through by psychic pain (she rarely raises her face, let alone speaks words). Renato (the teenage boy) wins his audience by his incredibly pure and valiant love for Malena (this affection he carries in his heart for several years). She becomes his muse, his courage, his sense of honor, his whole rationale for confronting difficult and disruptive life of the war-torn Italy. I agree completely with another commentator who said that the ending of the movie is perhaps one of the most genuinely melancholic moments in modern cinematography. Simply brilliant. Superb music!

A great story of human nature, jealousy, compassion and courage.

Until I saw this movie, I thought the ""rock throwing"" scene in ""Zorba, The Greek"" was violent and hard to watch, but now it seems very mild. I don't understand why the director treated this scene as if ""Malena"" was a documentary. I can imagine it was his masochistic pleasure.

I love Il Postino and Cinema Paradiso and a myriad of other lovely, sensitive and sympathetically themed, Italian movies. This was just a ""wanna-but-never-in-this-lifetime-be"" and inexplicably and mindlessly mean spirited film. I got the feeling they wanted to make ""American Pie - Italian Style"" but knowing how vapid that was they inserted some monstrously mean and selfish men, women and boys behaving VERY badly.In each example of the eponymous lead character's life she is grossly and erroneously gossiped about and slandered, resulting ultimately in the loss of her father's love and support which leads to her utter destitution. She is vilified, derided, debased, spied on, lied about and all for the basest of reasons - in hopeless pursuit of self aggrandizement which never even comes close to eclipsing the brave young woman's breathtaking beauty let alone her final scene of such extraordinary bravery - which has no equal in filmography.She is savaged and publicly attacked in broad daylight - in the town square - in front of all the villagers as well as all the American troops which had recently landed. Her attackers are a large group of maniacally enraged women who, being unable to beat the vinegar out of their cheating husbands, find a perfectly sweet young woman whose only choice to avoid starvation was prostitution. And WHY was she starving? Because these same women refused to sell her food from their stands - unless it was rotten. Even the young boy who had sworn unending fealty to Malena (via his saint) merely watched, standing together with all the the town's men who lied to everyone saying she had loved them. Not one man nor boy rescued that poor young woman.Malena's wounded husband(previously thought dead)returns home after the war with one less arm. When he falls on the courtyard's stairs - this same young boy can't reach him fast enough to help him up again.Men are pigs but only an evil genius misogynist would actually put into words the utterly despicable and cowardly attack of the young woman, Malena, showing the women to be the monsters.

A pubescent boy's (Giuseppe Sulfaro) own process towards maturity, driven also by relentless, powerful forces, parallels the town's process into adulthood and self-assurance. As everybody completes the cycle of anger, rejection and eventual acceptance, the woman is ready to return to the town, in turn ready to receive her, while the boy is prepared to give up his fantasy life and move into adulthood. Sexuality is no more than a symbol here, serving as a catalyst for people's emotions and propelling the three main characters (town, woman and boy)through the social maturation process.

Also the Score of this movie which is equally emphasizing the comical behaviors of the town folks and the silent sorrows of malena at the same time.The movie is a must see movie and I recommend it to any one not having the label ""SCI-FI, Action and Special effects ONLY""I am sure its not only Renato has wild fantacies about Malena :)",Malena
145,stenlis,A bit flat...,5,19 July 2002,"A small italian town in the early 40's. Renato - a sensitive teenager who is eager to be accepted amongst the adults - falls in love with Malena - the local beauty. Malena seems to be the center of all townsfolk's attention. She is an every man's dream, but also the object of hate of all the women who envy her for her beauty.  Renato keeps following her and he begins to realize how much pain she takes because of her appearance.That seems like a nice basis for a story about the human relationship, life in an italian town during the war and about the problematic maturing of a teenager. But there is the main problem of the film - it simply doesnt get any farther. The characters are too flat - they do not develop throughout the film (except the fact, that Renato starts to bear the Malena's suffering in the beginning of the movie). The 'evil' crowd just gets meaner, the 'suffering' Malena just takes more portions of pain and the 'sensitive' Renato just gets more moved by Malena's fate.It surely is an interesting point to start with but the authors will beat it into your head for two hours instead. As the film advanced, I was just wondering what more cruelties did the writers prepare for the poor girl and how far will they let her fall untill she finally reaches the bottom - whatever it will mean to her. The monotony of the characters is also the reason why I couldn't hang on empathising with them although they were described sou beautifully in the beginning. The cast is a problematic topic for this film. Monica Belucci did a fine job presenting Malena - she managed to give a lot of depth to a character which is rather flat in the script. Through the way she moved and talked you could really sense her essence. She is pulling the movie very much from the misery. Unfortunately the other actors were not so successful with this almost impossible task. You could describe Giussepe Sulfaro's expression throughout the film as 'caring face number 7' and the males surrounding Malena are crippled into slobbering hornies just like the women into jealous and cruel vixen.This movie will quickly describe the scene and then it will try to squeeze out the last drop of compassion from you. If you like this kind of entertainment then it is a good choice for you. You might also like to see some nice acting performance by Monica Belucci. Otherwise don't bother yourself with this movie.",Malena

Instead they suffer the conformity, denial, rejection, or substitution of this astonishing discovery. They make leaders, wars, schools, religions, cultures and of course children. They entrench insidious traditions and dangerous rituals. All of which floats by Amoruso Renato, our puberty struck hero, like an aria from a great opera, out the window, above the ornate stone buildings, across romantic plazas, over the endless azure Mediterranean and into the ever golden Sicilian sky. No one is spared his scrutiny, not the cowardly men with their machismo, nor the vicious women with their ""virtue"". Why? This boy is watching and he is awake. It seems the only memory of puberty still living in his Sicilian town, circa 1940, as World War II erupts, is the perfume of a lovely woman: ""Malena"". Malena, a mystery woman walks through town, not only awakening the desire of our young Romeo, but also that of his entire group of friends, who agree to include him in a very special ""men's club"" dedicated to their lust and her adoration, even though he is only twelve years old and still wearing short pants. But Renato's awakening is filled with consternation and loss. Malena is the object of all the unmet desires, fantasies, lusts and jealousies of his entire town. What can he do? She's the epicenter of gossip. She incites the memory of the original discovery and embodies the danger of all its possibilities. Her existence calls into question the dead ends chosen by most of the populace. No one but Renato seems concerned that no man will hire her as she's a danger to his wife, nor any woman sell her food in the market, because she's a persona non grata. All insist her virtue is compromised. She's forced to go to court to protect herself, then becomes the mark of her lawyer, who wants his payment in more than a pound of flesh. Malena is not the first woman to consider marrying a buffoon, hoping it will protect her, but even that is denied. The lawyer is under the control of his mother who refuses the object of her son's rape, the protection of his name in marriage. All doors close upon her. The war progresses. Finally she falls to the degradation projected upon her. She sells her flesh for food. Then falls further This is not a coming of age story, nor a memory film, filled with longing and regret which smacks of the great fish story, about the one which got away. Nor is it a morality play about Sicily, full of life and beauty but suffering from a blood curse long before the fascist period descends. Malena flies above and beyond these genres to scenes which reveal the human soul. Who is brave enough to look their own desire in the face? Where is the dignity allowed a person desecrated by scapegoating? Who is courageous enough to remember their own lack of courage? There is a triple surprise ending, not to be revealed, which proves it is a true tragedy/ comedy. No matter. See it. Re-see it. It is great film!",Malena

A honest movie about a beautiful lady, an attempt to show the Fascist face of Italy in the times of World war, told by a boy of 12 years. Where the movie scores is the way the story is told and the way they have shown the hardships a lady has to undergo, just because she is beautiful and does not have a Husband is excellent.On the acting front, Monica really does not have a lot to do, because she is mostly seen as a fantasy element by everyone in the movie, which she is not. The boy is excellent, his dad is hilarious and his friends are awesome. In certain parts the movie makes you laugh, but at times it also make you think. The final word: A movie that has all elements of a classic, and is a must watch for all who believe in watching movie as if a story is being told.I rate it very high... give it 10/10.",Malena

It takes a huge effort to become a true Human being but most people don't want to make that effort? people are happy to live like animals bcuz it is easy. Most people with no God consciousness or soul treat helpless, weak or alone people the same way as Malena was treated in this movie. A person with no soul has a brain with no wisdom! then his brain works the same way as it works like for animals- no principles nothing just a selfish machine. Yes Malena has an attractive beautiful body but this is only the outer part of her, the actual Malena is hiding inside that body which is far more beautiful.. but it remained unseen till last!

But when the movie was over, I was asking myself why in the world I had watched it. It seemed incoherent and painful. This reaction lasted about 24 hours.I had to vote twice on this film, my first soon after watching rating was a 6 because my emotional reaction to the woman's fate overwhelmed everything else. As I found myself talking about the movie to family and friends,I discovered a great deal to talk and think about and describe. And in the process stepped back from individual fates, and finally attended to the description of small town society with peculiarly Italian quirks the movie actually aims at.So now I give it a 7. And it seems to me that if I were to watch it again, I might give it an 8 or a 9. But probably not, because of the unevenness. It was as if the movie makers couldn't decide if they wanted to make a comedy of norms or a weighty social criticism.Maybe it could be characterized as not immediately accessible. For me, at least.

153,kruttik-a,A true display of cinematic brilliance winning against critic's samovar,8,21 April 2006,"I am absolutely livid to read Mr Wood Foster-Smith's comment on this movie. Only a man with as myopic vision as his can deny the extreme brilliance of the movie and its story telling. Maybe the critics show quit watching films and go back to novel reading for he who is a movie buff, very well realizes the difference between story telling and story reading. The remarks were apt had it been a novel.Let me try explaining the legend Tornatore and his endeavor to conceive all aspects of human existence in a single masterpiece. 'A fresh-faced boy making wide-eyed sexual discoveries' might me trite but something that marks the beginning of youth. And where would one witness the childish infatuation evolving into an inexplicable exemplary of human love which propelled a kid-usually associated with I-want-it-now attitude into a super human who understood love more than expressing it. 'The cruelly indifferent parents' might be mundane but the same mother crying over the same child for his sickness and the same father showing the same child the path to adulthood is a display of sublime imperfection humans have been dented with.The love of parents can never be called indifferent.'The misunderstood heroine' might be quotidian but the constant struggle with self to endure worldly crass or to give up once and for all to just continue breathing, and still eventually realizing that this crass is in-definitive and a habit of so called educated-happy-alive families.'A husband falling for a faithful woman' might be a cliché but a husband coming from war to meet his wife and discovering that she has turned into a whore and his house is confiscated and the town is howling at his face with a mocking silence of their own- and still after realizing the truth goes back and ordains his wife her lost dignity.'A howling town with sick people' might also be a pitfall but my friends, a town that has seen war and have seen their kins and loved ones going and never coming back isn't too prudent to understand that its their men who are weak to run to prostitutes and not women who have grown beautiful out of bounds. And yet the same town showers respect and sympathy when Malena returns.On the whole Malena is not only a great movie but has sublime story tell with no manipulation what so ever.A must see.",Malena

I say 'image' because he doesn't know her at all to begin with, but as he watches, her increasingly sad truth is seen through his eyes.It's also about Sicily during the war, but deeper than that, to me, it seems to be about the mob mind, jealousy and hatred and about how people tend to become what is expected of them, or don't. Monica Bellucci is undeniably among the sexiest women alive and her near wordless performance is mesmerising. My only criticism is the somewhat stereotypical way that the 'men' are portrayed. Perhaps there's some truth that we are all driven from an area below the waist, but I'd like to think it's not true of all of us.8/10.",Malena

158,forrest44,when the purest meets across the filthiest,10,15 April 2006,"I have to confess that when I first saw this movie, I was attracted by its content of sex, and that's what I think this movie is. Not until later after I have lent it to one of my classmates did I realise I had made an unforgivable mistake. She was really good at movies and she saw everything, and of course, she told me about them. Then I carefully watched it again, and after that, I can't help watching it again and again--it has become one of my favourite which I have so much feeling for. The scene of children's burning an ant at the very beginning of the movie shows that every beautiful individual are weak and easy to get destroyed, which is Malena's tragic destiny. The pure love to Malena from little Renato is the most beautiful thing in this wide world, I have to say. And the OST for this emotion is just like another Mozart from paradise. This precious piece of love could remind everyone of his/her deepest love which has never been spoken out, even to one's death, it's ""babylish"" in every aspect, but it's TRUE. About the adults, I really don't want to say anything about them to bring up my feeling of disgust. The point I do want to make is that at last Malena's fitting into the world just because she has lost her charm is in a sense the tragic of human beings.

160,lamaanhamid,The Burden of Beauty,8,24 August 2010,"Although mellowed by a narrative through the eyes of an adolescent, Malena is a movie that attempts to critique the savagery inherent in the 'civilized' society of men. Through the story, the viewer is shown the cruelty that people are capable of as a collective unit, with each individual playing a small part. It attempts to lay bare the gross hypocrisy and fragile morals that hide just beneath the surface.Malena is also a discourse on beauty, and its brutal power. The feverish lust it produces in a man, and the severe and horrible envy in a woman. The viewer's feelings of appreciation for Malena's beauty are slowly overtaken by a feeling of utter despair for Malena's beauty, which is the cause of all her woes.Technically the film is true to its period - a small Italian village that passes through the crisis of the 2nd World War. The story unfolds through the eyes of a young boy, who carries us along on a journey of lust, love and maturity. We watch helplessly as his innocent perspectives about life are jarred by the realities of society, while he watches helplessly the misfortunes of the beautiful Malena.",Malena

It's a coming-of-age film, set in the World War 2 years in a small town of Sicily. The main lead is a young boy named Renato, and through his perfectly understandable obsession of a married woman named Malena (there couldn't be a more perfect cast than Monica Bellucci in this role),we get to see him maturing over a few years time. Most of the team focuses on Malena of course, but it's all through Renato's eyes (he's stalking her all the time), and his affection for her. It's no wonder that all males in the town (even teenagers) mostly view her as a hot piece of meat, but this boy's pure love is what eventually makes the difference in his (and her) life.The ending credits will leave you with the ""life goes on"" aftermath and possibly the strongest feeling of melancholy you ever achieved from a movie.Great cinematography, excellent performances from Monica Bellucci(though she barely speaks throughout the film) and the boy playing Renato, amazing score by the grand Maestro Ennio Morricone (nominated for an Oscar), this film has become my absolute favourite and Monica Bellucci my most recent (and strongest) obsession!

After many years Malena's beauty in his memory is larger than life.  This is how many of us remember things, poetically and sentimentally. I adored the film.  It is not about how beautiful Malena is or whether or not young Renato will have his love requited back to him.  It is a simple moment in time of when he was young and had his life ahead of him and his aspirations for Malena was what stood out in his mind after many years and lovers.Like Everybody's Fine, Tornatorre has a wonderful way of pacing his scenes and that includes the task of coordinating the incidental music along with those scenes.  Ennio Morricone music was so beautiful and for me reflects not the beauty of Malena, but a distant memory of a time in Renato's life he will never live again. A lost childhood.

Her husband is in the forces in Africa, fighting the British. Because of her looks and her solitary state, she is an object of lust for all the town's men and of hatred for its women. She keeps an eye on her infirm old father who lives alone. Renato a 12 year old boy becomes obsessed with Malena, spying on her in her house and stalking her when she leaves it. To fuel his erotic fantasies, he steals some of her clothes. When his parents find it in his bedroom, they go wild and try to break his fixation. Malena gets the news that her husband is killed, adding grief to her isolation. Rumours grow around her, which she unwisely helps by allowing an unmarried air force officer to visit her after dark. When she is denounced and put on trial, the officer sends testimony that he was nothing more than an occasional friend. The betrayal hurts, but Malena says nothing to condemn him. After her acquittal, her advocate calls round and rapes her. After seeing this Renato decides to be Malena's protector, asking God and his saints to watch over her and performing little acts of vengeance against her detractors. He does not realise that his views of her are little better than those of the townspeople, and has no idea how Malena herself feels.The war reaches Sicily and the town is bombed by the Allies, killing her father. Now penniless and universally scorned, with nobody willing to give her work, she sinks into prostitution. The townsfolk are happy to see her as a whore rather than a dangerous widow. When Nazi forces occupy the town and Renato encounters his idol with two German soldiers, he faints. His mother decides it is demonic possession, taking him to a priest for exorcism, but his more practical father takes the lad to the town brothel. There he fantasises that the prostitute initiating him is Malena.The Germans leave, and to ecstatic cheer American troops enter the town. The women storm the hotel and drag out Malena, ripping off her clothes, beating her and cutting off her hair. To escape further persecution, she leaves the hostile town. A few days later, her husband Nino, who has survived as a prisoner of war but lost an arm, comes back looking for her. His house has been taken over by displaced people and nobody wants to tell him how to find his wife. Renato leaves him an anonymous note saying that she still loves him but has suffered misfortunes and gone to the city of Messina.A year later, Nino and Malena are strolling through the town. Women notice she now looks more matronly and plain even she's still beautiful, they realize that she is no longer a threat.

Yet Malena's looks create spite and jealousy amongst the townsfolk - and hard times for this lonely young woman. The story is really about Renato - how he matures while watching Malena. Indeed we don't really know that much about Malena or her motivation - in the end there are a lot of unanswered questions about what she may or may not have done. To paraphrase Renato - a lot happened back then.This film is the cinematic equivalent of comfort food, warm and delicious. It's hard not to feel about Monica Bellucci the way the boy does after watching this film. I know I do! She is a real old-style cinema goddess. It looks wonderful - as does she. Plenty of melodrama - although you get to see the way the boy's infatuation turns into a desire to protect Malena and help her, instead of remaining a simple crush. The plot is slight and isn't as good as Cinema Paradiso but is still captivating and touching. The film is warm and full of life.

169,Lorna1986,Slightly overrated but excellent all the same...,10,6 December 2004,"When this movie was released the buzz was huge... Mostly because it starred the walking-talking male fantasy, Monica Bellucci. It did the rounds around various Film Festivals and even the most skeptical critics were won over. They were won over by many things... The scenery is stunning, making you feel like you're really in Sicily. The acting is subtle but superb. And it's this that is most shocking. Monica Bellucci was, when this film was released, a model-turning-actress. No-one expected her to actually be good, and we were right, she wasn't good... she is amazing in this film!! Bellucci has very little dialogue, she has to use body language and facial expressions... most people would agree this is much more difficult. Since this film, she has gone on to be Italy's most successful acting export for years. With roles in Matrix 2 & 3, Tears Of The Sun, and the truly ground-breaking Irreversible, she has proved herself time and time again! What her character goes through is heartbreaking and, through Bellucci's acting and the wonderful performance given by protagonist narrator Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro), we experience everything she does.At times the movie is hilarious, particularly when detailing the lengths the men of the village will go to just to catch glimpse of Malena.

170,tipsycitrus,A Pervasive Sadness Only Ever Inferred...,8,24 March 2011,"*Mild Spoiler* The pain Malena encounters throughout the film in the vicious chain of events that unfold in it's narrative is only ever expressed in her face...If you're looking - and most are - but, unlike them, I mean really looking.We see every bitter, scathing and violent situation she weathers unravel through the eyes of her silent, self-appointed teenage protector - he says as little as she does in those times, and as the devastation spirals further out of control I almost came to hate him for it.Yet when it really matters, their moment comes - and he says the one thing that she probably most wanted to hear.I did read some visual metaphors into some of the narratives strongest events - when Malena finally takes to the streets of Sicily, emblazoned with her 'wanton' flash of red hair, outwardly rejecting the modesty that has saved her from nothing simply so she can survive, the men of the town rush to light her cigarette: 'There's no smoke without fire.' And now, it seems, Malena has be forced to squeeze herself into the 'wise' age old saying. A self-fulfilling prophecy. Not even the tears in her eyes can otherwise douse the heat on her now....When the time finally comes for Malena to be 'punished' in a sickening, heartbreaking climax (interestingly, the first of what I'd say is about 3 towards the end of the film), I at first thought it a culture, period specific issue that couldn't occur today. Thinking it over again, not the case - it being the day of 'liberation' was just the perfect excuse for Dentist's wife to grab an opportunity for the women of the town's envy, rage and general powerlessness to be vented furiously without any barricade.The way Malena turns to scream at the silent, unmoving wall of men - instead of the women - after the event is nothing if not poignant.Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful story. Objectification held up to light in the best way (coming from a male reviewer).Personally the film would have been stronger - near perfect - for me without the reoccurring Malena and young child male protagonist (shudder) kissing and bucking imaginary scenes - but they get lost in the later thread of this small-town epic tale.Go watch.",Malena

The ways men see a woman are many and the way men accept her is one, I guess. But how ladies see her? She is Malena, an ill-fated Sicilian during world war 2. Her beauty was the point of jealousy among other neighbour-wives and the point of obsession to all the ages of men as well. Poor Malena's father was deaf a bit and a teacher in local school where the growing students used to pass comments about his daughter, he could not identify, due to his deafness.The adult people in the town of Castelcuto, were hungry to her in civilized form. The other ladies hated her through whispering. She was alone with her stunning beauty though married. Her husband was sent to front.News came about her husband's death and the aggressive townmen started to enjoy the opportunity of her being single. With all her dignity, she was protesting against but she ruined, after her father's death due to a bombardment, her lonely future came up with starvation. The one-eyed world she knew that was waiting for her such a long time, to cherish her physical beauty with extreme brutality, she surrendered.She used to roam between German camps, providing pleasure to keep her own existence, ended with the defeat of Germans. The housewives of Castelcuto brought her into open street, teared her privacy into pieces, tortured, humiliated. One very night, she left the town.But, the world has two eyes. It was Renato, a boy, who felt her silent agony, shared her pain and delivered himself to her favour. Malena did not know at all that she had a young lover, friend, devotee. It was Renato on the other side of the curtain who could not help her directly but expressed his despair in violent manners. Renato is another masterpiece made by the director who picturized the transition from boyhood to manhood with excellent accuracy. Certainly there is a Renato in all of us whom we left behind but never forgot. Malena left and Nino, her husband entered the town. He lost his right-arm in war, but he survived. he received a hard welcome from the dwellers, his house was occupied by the refugees, his wife escaped to an unknown destination, Renato threw a letter on his bed there he had written all the truth since the beginning and Malena's innocence. Nino left Castelcuto.After a year, they came back. The habitants got surprised, started whispering but restrained. They greeted her, she replied. The love she did not find since years, cascaded onto her. At last, Malena found an island in the ocean of her life.The movie is based on Malena and Renato. Malena was simple, homely. All she did to live. Renato was growing up, he was naturally attracted. there were other males who used to cross her in cheap affair. Renato dreamed himself as a protector to her.

The story has no ending and you realize this while watching the movie - you watch this not to see any resolution - rather you wonder what comes next PLUS you adore the picture. The dialog is so great - I cannot remember one thing that I would've rephrased. The realism in this movie is at the most appropriate level. Eroticism of everyday's life is given with a tremendous balance and delicacy. The characters are admirable - I laughed and cried and was taken by the cast - I forgot about actually sitting in the theatre. The main character is extremely realistic and natural. Great young actor will most likely succeed in the future after such a complex role. One thing I will do the first day this movie is in the theaters - I will go see it again. I want to go alone and try to drift into it again, leaving the present at where it so crazily fast brought itself.",Malena

Watching that beating scene was agony - because I, sitting in front of the TV, couldn't jump in there and shout at people and bully them into *doing* something about it instead of just letting it happen. Having to watch humans turn into beasts actually made me bang my fist on the table and shout at the screen, but luckily the rest of the film, with bittersweet moments and stunningly beautiful visuals of all kinds more than makes up for that.

Then the film shows the loneliness of that woman in the small town.

Is it so far a stretch to imagine Italians in a similar attitude during WW2, wondering if people begrudge them a history rich in the arts?This is all idle supposition of course but it does give one pause and perhaps lends an extremely human perspective to the brief war scenes when one ties them to the terrible scenes of Malena's humiliation.This movie is more thoughtful than people tend to give it credit for. It is also a simply beautiful accomplishment in terms of managing to portray a beautiful actress in a largely silent role as a complex and sympathetic character.A must-see in that it can be enjoyed from so many diverse perspectives.",Malena

It is in fact just an image of a beautiful woman because, even though she follows her everywhere and he knows the reality behind many of the town gossips that surround her, he doesn't really know her at all, at least not in the deeper sense that mature love might require. Both main characters are always closed by but never actually interact, it is all a sublime love fantasy in Renato's mind that somehow seems real as we see that everyone but him sees her just as a beautiful sexual trophy. An amazing story of a first love that, as any love history, struggles with tragedy, jealousy and desire, all while keeping the idilic perfect woman untouched. Monica Belluci is perfect for her role as Malena, the full expression of beauty beyond the reach of most people. The music is a pleasure and the cinematography a true delight.

War makes all of cast, exclude Malena, becoming insane. Malena is a victim of man's desire. Every man from all race who fights each other just to be a war champion. And the trophy was Malena.

The actors played their roles very well, especially the extremely gorgeous Monica bellucci who played the titular character. All the men in her town are infatuated by her and all the women of the town are jealous of her beauty. Malena's husband is a soldier who has gone to fight a war and we have another teenager male protagonist who is infatuated by Malena and eventually falls in love with Malena. He follows her wherever she goes. Later it is shown that her husband dies in the war and every man(even the married old men) in the town wants to marry her.
Watch the movie to know what happens.
I am generally an action movie freak and I tried out this drama and it was so beautifully portrayed, I loved it. There is also a scene where Malena gets beaten up by many women of the town, this scene made me drip tears from my eyes. Actually like watching violent action and have watched scenes 1000 times more violent than that scene but this one broke me down.

188,cherokeejew,Helltown Promenade,1,28 April 2006,"Those such as myself expecting a production similar to director Tornatore's likable ""Cinema Paradiso"" are in for a disappointment. ""Malena"" is a malevolent depiction of an Italian town in World War II, the movie's flavor foreshadowed by an early scene in which cretinous adolescents torture and kill an ant. In similar fashion, the adults proceed to destroy, over time, a woman apparently too beautiful to be allowed to live. If you adore lynch mobs, you will love this movie. The women of the town, all of them, are driven by jealousy, and the men, all of them, by swinish lust. (No contrarians here, for that might introduce a real plot.) Not one of them has any real humanity, much less intelligence. Even Malena seems strangely non-verbal and robotic. As I watched, I was hoping that the Allied bombers flying over the town would bomb it into oblivion. So much for caring about any of the characters. The adolescent ""coming-of-age"" nonsense is nothing more than masturbatory glue to bind the scenes together in an essentially plot less story that goes nowhere interesting.

Gives the same feel as the stockings scene from ""The Graduate"" so long ago. I also thought the boy was great. You really get the jittery feel of youth by watching him. You feel the innocence, while at the same time you feel (for lack of a better term) naughty while looking at the gorgeous woman. I felt almost like I was the boy's best friend, like I was standing next to him throughout the entire movie.

Though it's the first movie I've seen where the main character was supposed to be likable, but instead was a little jerk. Throughout the movie, he shows he is nothing but a genuine coward. I don't think anyone who's seen the movie believes he is a hero. He urinates in a lady's purse, spits in someone's drink and steals underwear. This is not normal behavior even for a kid that is in love and ""coming into his own"".Throughout the movie I was waiting for the protagonist, Renato, to finally mature and do something courageous. He could have helped locate Malena's father after the bombing, but he just sat and watched while the others tried to rescue him. He could have stepped forward and try to stop the town's ladies from attacking Malena. He could have told her husband exactly what happened instead of sneakily dropping a vague note. He disappointed me all the way to the end. Even when he helped Malena after she dropped a sack of oranges, he did it for selfish reason; only to satisfy his own prurient interest.The actors were convincing in their roles.

197,kz2114,Beautifully written and directed movie. Very thought-provoking.,10,29 October 2006,"What a beautiful film ""Malèna"" is! Its picturesque, yellow images of Sicily during World War II, combined with its tender, true-to-life writing, paint a very lively portrait of a small town in war-torn Italy, of the Catholic, conservative, and sexually inhibited townspeople, and of their intolerance towards a beautiful, single woman, Malèna (the exquisitely alluring Monica Bellucci). It is both hilarious at times, in its dramatic portrayal of Italian family life and a young boy's sexual awakening, and sadly moving at others, in its intimate depiction of Malèna's suffering and courage: a great movie for a thoughtful evening.If you have not yet seen the movie, you may wish to stop reading here.I think what makes this movie so powerful is Giuseppe Tornatore's artful adaptation of Luciano Vincenzioni's story, in which he captures on multiple levels the essential conflict of the film: between conservatism and sexuality, and the physical brutality of restraint towards dissenters. On one level, a young boy is discovering the urges of sexuality, and his family is outraged by his ""dirtiness."" They are very physical in their display of disapproval, although their melodramatic yelling and abuse is portrayed in a comical light. On another level, an unfortunate woman, who loses her husband (so she believes) and father, and is single in a culture where respectable women must be attached to men, suffers exploitation due to her poverty and vulnerability by the hands of lusty, hypocritical townsmen. The envious women of the town are also very physical in their expression of disapproval, and even more cruel than the men. In a small town where everyone knows everyone else's business, ""the word of the people is the word of God,"" and those who don't fit in with the culture are brutally punished. The third expression of this theme is shown through the Fascist politics at the time, where young boys do institutionalized calisthenics under the guidance of totalitarian propaganda, where the omni-present military dictates what is right and dissent is physically forbidden, and where the hypocrisy of the soldiers is seen through their avid use of prostitution, and exemplified by the actions of Lieutenant Cadel (Marcello Catalano), who visits Malèna with romantic intentions, then abandons her and denies their relationship when she is brought to court in shame. Such hypocrisy and harsh enforcement of uniformity can be seen in multiple instances throughout the film.The defiance of this enforced conformity is what director Giuseppe Tornatore defines as courage. Malèna, who is a pariah in her Sicilian community, is repeatedly called ""courageous"" by protagonist Renato Amoroso (Giuseppe Sulfaro), and her courage ultimately becomes respected by members of her community. By observing Malèna's life, Renato also gains some of her courage. A key coming-of-age moment for Renato is when he knocks over the bust of Mussolini, ""breaking his skull,"" and in return, as promised, gets new pants from his father, an acknowledgment of growth. More crucially, Renato slowly overcomes his habit of passively spying on Malèna's life without coming to her aid. In the beginning of the film, he quietly witnesses all the wrongs done to her without defending her, but towards the end, he decides to take action and help her, and thus defies the popular opinion of his community, by writing to her husband of her whereabouts. At the end of the movie, he even physically helps her pick up the fruit she has dropped and musters the courage to speak to her, wishing her ""good luck."" His change from being a passive witness of exploitation to someone who actively and anonymously defends the victimized Malèna shows a crucial growth in his character. Similarly, his love for her changes from one of horny adolescent obsession to a more mature respect and tender embrace of her whole person (not merely her ""very fine ass."") Monica Ballucci is only portrayed naked in an erotic manner in the earlier scenes of the movie; later her nakedness is the effect of violence not amour.My only criticism for this film lies in the limited portrayal of Malèna's character. She is shown as purely a victim of her environment. Tornatore does not develop her to the same extent as he develops Renato, and the viewer does not know much more about Malèna than what the spying Renato can show through hole-peeping and bike-stalking. We don't reach any real understanding of Malèna's private thoughts and decisions. She is the virtuous and the victimized; every wrong she commits, she commits because she is forced to, because of poverty or sexual harassment. She is not truly a dissenter against the popular opinions of her community in that she seems to have no choice but to act in the way that she does. She is the classic ""whore with a heart of gold,"" what I believe to be a somewhat simplistic prototype of a beautiful and sexually deviant woman.Overall, this movie is utterly captivating, and intensely thought-provoking. It has elicited quite a long prattle from me (I humbly submit my thoughts), and I hope it will do even more so for you.",Malena

Through out the movie, her movie lines are limited, if none, until the end of the movie, why? The director is conveying a message to the audience. Indirectly, the director is challenging current perceptions on women and their roles in society. Is small town life is any different than city life? I think it's the same. Wives blame the mistress when they should focus on their loose husbands, who are the actual whores (perusing adulterous relationships with a widow). This is a great movie for understanding culture and acceptance of ""reverse"" pedophilia (older women and under age boys).The movie was entertaining and funny but overall, I thought it an lacked a meaningful message that got lost in the drama.

206,woodfoster,A Disappointment,4,16 September 2001,"Having seen and loved Tornatore's Cinema Paradiso, I had high hopes Malena, but instead I was disappointed by this sentimental, manipulative piece of cinematic caricature.A coming of age film is difficult to pull off without sinking into cliche. Unfortunately this film goes face down in every pitfall.  The fresh-faced boy making wide-eyed sexual discoveries.  The cruelly indifferent parents. The misunderstood heroine.  The denouement of selfless sacrifice.  The only way these ingredients can be put into a film that doesn't make you want to throw up at its saccharine sincerity is if it has other ingredients which temper it, twist it, change it into something that makes you think, ""Ah, this is new.  I've never thought about it this way before.""Tornatore puts the stock ingredients in, and exaggerates them almost beyond recognition, but he adds nothing else.  It's true, the performances are fine and the cinematography and music are beautiful (I too love Morricone); but with a story that never rises above the level of the cliche, none of that really matters.  What comes across is a goopy string of scenes that alternately tug at your heartstrings and the corners of your mouth (and I don't mean that in a complimentary way).The ironic thing is that I think Malena could have been a very good movie if it hadn't gotten the vaseline-lensed treatment.  It would have been far more wrenching if the story had been told as it actually might have happened, harsh and unadorned.  Women have been driven into prostitution and then humiliated for it throughout the centuries, and coupling this with a boy's struggle to understand his budding sexuality would have been an affecting twist.  But told in this mawkish, eager-to-please style, it degenerates to the level of the cheap.",Malena

208,coralk77,Beauty and The Beasts,10,12 April 2007,"Malena is the most beautiful and touching film I have ever seen. I have watched it countless times, yet it continues to enchant me every time, and I never grow tired of it's story.People never cease to amaze me with their cruelty and pettiness--most which stems from that ""green eyed lady"", JEALOUSY. We, as human beings, always seem to resent those who have attributes we have not--whether it's money, power, beauty, etc. Jealousy is why Malena suffers so much through out this film. That is the simple truth. I won't deny that the men in the movie don't help the situation much, (as they get carried away with their story telling and boasting--as they all WISH they could sleep with her). The fact is, the MEN are jealous, too. Not jealous of Malena, but of each other, jealous of her husband--as all of them are competing with each other to be Malena's potential ""man"".However, the women in this movie, (and in real life in many ways), are the main ""crux"" of the problem. It seems to me that in every facet of life, whether it is in the workplace or the family, etc., women are always dead set on destroying each other out of jealousy. There seems to be only one or two women in this movie who show any kindness towards Malena, (excepting of course for at then end, when they are all afraid of going to hell for what they did to her)...It's ironic how as soon as her husband returns, and Malena is no longer a ""sex object"", how the women warm up to her and begin to treat her with dignity and respect. While she was alone, she needed their friendship the most, but she was all alone suffering in so many ways. This happens so often in real life, and it actually hit home for me, as I have known women in the past who have been abused because of being attractive.I am a woman, and I am not gay at all, but when I see a beautiful woman, I don't automatically HATE her just because she's beautiful! That behavior and emotion is so primitive and stupid--and it's a shame that we women don't have better control over our jealous minds. We could accomplish so much in this world if we were able to get our heads out of our you know what's and stop being so petty and jealous all the time of women who happen to be prettier than us!!! I admire Malena, or any other beautiful woman as a lovely creation by God, to be admired and liked--not to be hated and victimized. Women need each other, we need each others friendship. But ironically, our competitiveness with each other over men keeps us separated and lonely. This is the case with Malena. She does absolutely NOTHING wrong, yet she is humiliated and abused by the entire society--and yes, all because of her beauty. She is guilty of being beautiful, (GORGEOUS, actually). None of the women in this movie come even CLOSE to her. Even our American Angelina Jolie looks like a ""plain Jane"" compared to her...(No offense, but it is true, as pretty as Angelina is--she's TOTALLY overrated)!! Monica Bellucci may truly be the most beautiful woman in the world since Venus.Another point this movie demonstrates is how age has nothing to do with the capacity to experience true love. Renato is only 12 or 13, yet he loves and cares about Malena more than any of the older men in the village. People have prejudices about women dating younger men, but when love is concerned, age should not matter. I am glad she found her husband in the end, but given a few more years to grow up, I think Renato would have been the ideal match for Malena--despite their age difference! (As long as he was legal, of course)!!!In any case, this is truly the best movie I have ever seen, and it has a wide range of emotions that will cater to most people's diverse tastes. The soundtrack is wonderful and emotional. The only people who may NOT like this movie, would be jealous and insecure women, (of any age group), who don't like being reminded of how mediocre they are compared to Monica Bellucci. All women want to be beautiful, but if they were this pretty, they would see how hard it can be. And for all you jealous, petty women out there who have nothing better to do than to gossip and make trouble, I say you should watch this movie, because it may give you an idea of how hard it can be when the grass seems ""greener"" on the other side, and show you how being a beautiful women can be a very difficult and lonely thing sometimes...WONDERFUL movie all in all. Makes a very good point which applies to every society.",Malena

Monica Bellucci plays the most sexy role among those one can ever imagine, and remained in minds of millions of people as a very beautiful lady & sex-symbol of the epoch we live in. The plot is about a beauty lady and a boy, who fell in love with her, but she's significantly older and already looks like a lady plus married:-((. And every man in the town is in love with her, too! But the time shows, how dangerous is the people's society, how people are cruel, and that odd sex, envy and impunity altogether can lead to tragedy... Monica plays a poor village sweet-heart, who became alone, and therefore is doomed on many sufferings, and that makes her role to be the sexiest martyr she plays 100% true. In the country, where I live, this film became most full of feeling one on people's minds. At least 2 TV advertisements were based on this film!... But a crime too... Women like a main heroine can be in any village, in every society. She is a typical sex desire of any man. Giuseppe Tornatore shot really a masterpiece: the boy, Malena, lawyer, city-dwellers are very true, everyl pecularity is taken into account, he pointed out everything. I do not know any other so true film of this genre - only in association with Italians anything like that could be done. I you wanna some erotic film, that can astonish - choose this one if still didn't watch!",Malena
210,lorenforrest,excellent movie,10,20 May 2002,"an excellent movie about a boy's coming of ageand his loyal love of a beautiful woman despite any circumstances.It's billed as a vehicle for Monica Bellucci who is indeed quite beautiful but she as good an acting job as her presence which is soft and outstanding at the same time.This movie questions loyalty and exposes petty jealousy and who it can destroy anyone.Each blessing can sometimes be a curse and no one knows that better than our heroine in this film.However, her plight is interposed with a boy in love.and ultimately a truly loyal man.See this film and understand that both the fantasies of a young boy and the trials of a beautiful woman are but canvas for a larger and more poignant story than first meets the eye.",Malena
211,etherised,not a review- just an observation,10,1 July 2002,"like cinema paradiso, i believe the strength of this film is in the underlying tragedy which is sweetened by the remarkable comedy of innocence. i don't like comparing films to other films, so i won't do it here -- but if you liked cinema paradiso's qualities i would venture to say that you will like malena.",Malena
212,sunnymo,good one,8,2 March 2008,"One of the best movie that I have seen,for its good story selection, characterization and of course presentation. The story of a young,married and beautiful lady staying alone at the time of world war2. The story is shown from the view of an 13 year old boy who like all other people in the town loves Malena. The story deals with how men are attracted towards the beautiful woman staying alone in the town and how other woman are jealous about Malena. The movie tries to unfold how people take advantage of Malena's circumstances to get her, and how she transforms herself to face the situations and ends up facing the violent action of jealous woman. Performances by Monica Bellucci is excellent and the director should be given full credit for bringing out the movie well and showing the beautiful woman Monica Bellucci more beautifully.",Malena
213,kuldeeppunjab,one of movie that shows a person love(lust) at very young age...,8,28 July 2010,"Well when you want to see beauty of an actress and innocence of a guy,this is the movie for you guys. Also some effects from the war adds the spice. Also tells that how difficult the life a an alone women is. Even the lawyer wants her body to protect her from others. The best scene of movie that i think is when a father takes hi teenage son to a brothel to make him feel adult.The movie also depicts the frustration of women for the prostitutes. In a scene the whole town beats the beautiful Malena.One the last i want to say that Malena becomes the most beautiful lady in your life. so go for this movie. Really nice and awesome piece of acting by glamorous Monica n very innocent Giuseppe Sulfaro.Movie end on a great hope. You should go for it.",Malena
214,aminhosseininasab,a truly moving movie,10,6 March 2011,"i have seen many and many and many movies, but rarely have I found myself so touched. I'm writing this review only after minutes of watching the film, and I must admit, I feel high from its beauty.i could find myself laughing out loud, find tears in my eyes, hold my head in shock, and clinch my eyes from the hurt, and even turned on at times, as the story takes you to unbelievable scenes, and rushing feelings.the movie is simple, it does not need visual effects, it doesn't need typical moves, its shown as everyday life, the streets it takes you to, the crowd, the vision of an innocent boy, which i could personally feel his thoughts, and just by looking at his eyes, the role could not have been played better, and the dazzling performance by Monica Bellucci, which I can think of no one more perfect.the movie doesn't have spare parts, it doesn't lack any either, every scene is perfect, taking you exactly to where it wants, and so by far, this is the most moving and intense movie i have ever watched.a must see indeed!",Malena
215,piero-damiani,Good movie but highly misogynistic,8,13 August 2009,"This movie is about a Sicilian woman during period leading to the second world war who does not conform to society conservative expectations and lives life as she pleases. Although the movie is interesting to watch with both funny and sad moments, I must say that it's highly Misogynistic, patriarchal and homophobic which i guess it's something to be expected for a movie set in that era. The movie clearly portrays the deeply ignorant attitudes of people in Sicily (which is still prevalent to a large extent these days) and how everyone mingles in people's affairs and rumors are spread in order to ruin reputations and make non-conformist people like Malena outcasts.",Malena

217,ejm2000,How much I am in love with that girl......,10,5 June 2003,"Belive me, I have never seen anything as georgeous as this...this beautiful creation of Tornatore's never stops to amazem me - day by day I watch this movie and everytime get astounded by its beauty, softness....The film is a mix of wild but unexperienced desire, sex, love, dreams and tragedy... beautiful woman and young boy - his love never fulfilled - from the very beginning doomed ..... she is like goddess and he is just a young boy who cannot express his hot feelings just because his youth....when you watch this movie you know that he would do everything for this woman - he tracks her and hunts every single moment of her ""activity""....he follows her when she goes out and follows her when she stays in...he cries when she gives herself to other man....he writes her many letters but never dares to post them.... he would do anything for her....but finally we see the woman is attacked by the jealous crowd of Castelcuto - she is hit and gets her hair cut in the public - she lays on the pavement almost naked and the boy - can do nothig for his goddess - he may only watch and cry....can do nothing for the woman of his life - just because he is a boy.... Tornatore lets us love Malena and lets us lough sometimes - it is a masterpiece that made an enormous impact on me......I love this movie",Malena
218,PaleGringo,Renewing my faith in the power of film,8,25 June 2003,"A thoroughly captivating movie, with a decent sound track that is fresh but not annoying.  The plot is extremely solid and memorable, with enough dramatic irony to keep it interesting.I'd give this an 8 out of 10 and recommend it to my friends.  There's some things in the movie that perhaps might not set well with every audience - I saw the version with the English subtitles - but typical for a movie made this side of 2000.  Sometimes vulgar language, prostitution, partial nudity - nothing too out of the norm and done so as tastefully as possible so that it fits into the movie.I must admit that prior to seeing this film I was privy (if that's the right word) to Gaspar Noe's ""Irreversible,"" also starring Monica Bellucci.  I was somewhat skeptical of European film after seeing it, but this was a welcome shelter from the brutality of French filming.  The story takes place in and through the years of WWII, from Il Ducé's rise to power, to the bombing of Sicily, to the Allied liberation, to the aftermath.  Specifically, it deals with how the War affects Bellucci's character, Malèna, as a series of increasingly tragic events.  During this whole time, Renato Amoroso watches helplessly as the object of his affection endures the personal tribulations and the jeering of the townsfolk.I think that much of the appeal in the movie is that it's designed so that you can relate to the emotions expressed by its characters.  The story is a superb blend of not only Malèna's eventful life, forever changed by the war, but also of Renato's struggles growing up and the transition from a boy to a man.  Intertwining these two basic plots is the constant ""chattering"" of the townsfolk, and how over the years their personal views of Malèna change. If you're not fluent in Italian, however, it makes for hectic reading of the subtitles, which sometimes appear three or four lines at a time.I'm not saying that this movie is perfect by any means - there's some things that I felt were excessive.  (Doesn't it seem that most of Bellucci's roles involve a scene of personal anguish... perhaps also in ""Matrix: Revolutions""?)  However, this movie presents an overall satisfying tale of growing up, adapting to changes in life, the nature of gossip, and so many more elements of life that we would otherwise forget about.",Malena
219,perxshar,Best Part,9,20 December 2012,"The best thing of the movie I liked is that 2 main characters of movie , the kid and Malena, just had one dialog among them, and it is enough to say it all. The movie do make us all remember of one love which we used to do in our teenage life to elder woman and sometime fantasize about it too. Despite having so many nude and hot scenes in movie, you wont take that with u after the movie, u just remember a beautiful love story of a kid. Although the kid's brothel part is somewhat I don't find entertaining. Malena , the lead character has very few dialogs too but her beauty says it all. It is not a movie for only romantic movie lovers , it is a story of almost every kid, so do watch it it is a master piece. Full marks to Director for his efforts. Ma l'more no ....... :D",Malena
220,abbaskarimi58,What is the symbolic role of Renato in the movie?,8,24 November 2011,"I like a scene of movie, while passing train on the rails which is possessing several fillings, including the separation of Renato from Malena, and both combination of violence and emotion. I have a question in my mind, what is the symbolic role of Renato based on the spiritual concepts? Of course, I should add that advocation of attorney from Malena for accessing her was unequaled. Morricone soundtrack will bear in my mind forever. These soundtracks are completely based on Italian music. Malena return to the city with her husband is perfectly matched with soundtrack named Il Ritorno. It is interesting, majority of Italian women are beautiful, but Tornatore has been pictured ugliness and beauty among Italian women to show off Malena.",Malena
221,KidmanBellucci,"Speechless, ingenious",10,17 April 2004,"Malena is one of the very few films that have left me stunned, staring at the credits...speechless. Usually I'd comment, ""Pretty good"" or ""Not as I expected"". But with Malena, I literally sat there in front of the black screen and found myself trying to organize my thoughts and comprehend what I had just watched. I have been very fond of Bellucci for the past few years. With little dialogue for her character in this film,I was blown away by her ability to say so much by doing very little. As she was walking through that little town, day by day, yet not speaking a word, I was dumbfounded by her beauty and purity. The way Malena carries herself and the emotion in her face, her walk, her voice, all have moved me. I laughed many times as I watched how Renato would cope with the ambiguities of adolescence and his fondness for the ravishing Malena. After watching, I couldn't decide whether it was a tragic tale, or more of an uplifting one. Malena is an incredibly touching story, one that I believe I have just fallen in love with.",Malena
222,ninosama,monica bellucci is gorgeous in that movie,8,15 June 2004,"beautiful, extremely charming monica bellucci is really gorgeous in malena.i think that all her womanly features are displayed here perfectly.besides being a real beauty monica is also very talented.i think that monica suits the role of malena perfectly.i first saw monica in this movie and i was charmed by her.the movie itself also impressed me.the feelings of the young boy for malena are expressed very impressively. also i paid attention of the behavior of the small province's inhabitants, how they treated malena because of their jealousy and malena's behaviour at the end - i sympathised that. as a whole i liked the movie very much and i would watch it for the 4th time with pleasure.",Malena
223,guavagyal,Excellent storyline. Brilliant portrayal of coming-of-age. Graphic scenes.,9,19 June 2004,Loved the movie! It was even better than I thought. Monica is stunning and so naturally sexy. But the best part was the storyline and the truly talented little boy. I was so hurt and enraged to see what they did to Malena. There are graphic scenes of violence and sex. The ending is bitter sweet. Happy but sad because of all what Malena and her husband had to go through. I would definitely recommend this movie. The director captured the loss of innocence and coming-of-age in the story. I was moved by the passion of the little boy; the courage and beauty of Malena; and the gripping story of a village torn apart by their own lust and envy.,Malena
224,pietagirl,A beautiful whirlwind through an amazing movie...loved it!,10,24 June 2004,"I rented this movie out of pure curiosity and found a true treasure.A elegantly crafted film, makes you feel as though you have been swept away.One of the most moving and heart wrenching films I have ever seen.Monica Bellucci is absolutely riveting! A must see on my list .It really has a great message and as a film of high quality a great adventure. It takes you through a time in history when little had no hope .The film is shown through the eyes of a young boy of his early teens.Sometimes the film is utterly funny while others are moving .It is one of those films you will never forget. Rent it soon.",Malena
225,m-elston,"A terrific, complex and in many moments (although tragic) - a poetic movie.",10,23 March 2006,"This masterpiece of a film-making evolves on several layers. The first part of the movie is about the awakening of sexuality of a teenage boy. Events are seen trough his eyes as most of the time he is the only witness of the dramatic overturns. His path to maturity begins with sexual obsession and grows toward deep love and understanding. This progression, from fantasy to a deeper level of feelings forces him to overcome his role as silent observer and actively (although anonymously) helps the object of his desires reunites with her husband.Another layer (a social one) evolves around the theme of an individual (Malena) versus the crowd. Malena is a passive character in the film, however, because of her exceptional beauty, she becomes a source for envy by the women and object of obscene remarks and indecent proposal by the men in a small Sicilian town during WWII. The trouble is not only her alluring beauty, but rather her dissimilarity. She is not interacting with people and seems not much aware of them. Her pensive eyes express nostalgia, which is understandable, as her beloved husband is sent to the front line. However, the people of the town perceive all that as aloofness. Motivated by primitive uncivilized instincts and irrational sense of egalitarianism, this strictly catholic society becomes more preoccupied with Malena, walking at the central square in town, than with the tragic events of these days - Italy is in war and is not winning. Malena's husband is reported dead, but instead of help, she is refused a job and access to food. Although the motives are different, men and women are equally guilty of degrading her with no evidence in a first place.The hatred of the irrational mob is culminating in an action that is almost a repetition of the biblical event of stoning Mary Magdalene. Isn't assumed that as Christians they would be more benevolent human beings? The scene of her horrible beating is extreme but it depicts how far irrationality can go. In view of that, one does not wonder about their response to the Mussolini regime and the arrival of the American troops.Malena's only friend is Renato. By following her, he becomes the only witness to her innocence. His obsession with that stunningly beautiful and mysterious woman helps him grasp best and worst of human nature and understand events - even when she is driven to prostitution as the only possible way to survive.Not very optimistic end, though. At the last seen she is tiredly walking away from the viewer, hardly distinguished by the rest of the crowds. This was the key of their acceptance of her.The third is a symbolic layer, and the most important one, as represents director Giuseppe Tornatore's intend. To him Malena is the tragic symbol of Italy by the end of the WWII.Great cinematography! Great acting!",Malena
226,lunablacklight,Women oppression,6,26 February 2016,"First of all, if there is any mistakes in my grammar I apologize. English is not my first language. The film is a piece of art in many topics. Bellucci's character was perfect for her. Most of all because her character winks her real life career and stereotypes. It would be perfect if at the end, Malena will return as she has always been. Not as a prudent married woman. The film is great but after all the exaggeration with her sex appeal and the city people obsession that was most at all misogynist. The least that the plot should did was to make a strong statement about women reality and oppression conditions. And for more reasons because of the historic and political moment where the story takes place. This diminish the film significance for me.",Malena
227,raymiles-1,Fellini rip-off,2,30 July 2006,"This is essentially a third-rate rip-off of late Fellini, even down to the seaside setting, with Sicily substituting for Rimini, and the lacksadaisical post-synching, but without Fellini's genuine nostalgia and visual poetry. I found the representation of Malena herself totally two-dimensional and whilst the sexism of Fellini was of its time, now in the 21st century it's reprehensible. Much better to rent 'Amarcord' or 'E il Nave Va' than this, a film that seems to cynically aim at the U-S market in its sentimentality and historical inaccuracy. My father (a Londoner) took part in the liberation of Sicily and would be mighty offended to see it portrayed, as here, as a purely American phenomenon.",Malena
228,mingmingbaibaigepi,Some ideas :D,10,8 February 2015,"Just watched Malèna again, last time maybe 10 years ago, at that time, I was just addicted to beauty of Monica Bellucci. In Chinese, it is translated to "" the beautiful legend of Sicilia "", at last, it is not beautiful but fierce humanities. Beauty is doomed to loneliness and indescribable, the root of evil, sin, lust and purity paradoxically? That is destroyed by the violence and silence from the masses. Gossip and jealousy drive people to be mad. Women self-suggest a beautiful woman must have defect on moral as a silly compensation because they envy the beauty from Malèna they could not possess, but the men, their possessiveness and the repression of reality also drive them to self-suggest , they thought Malèna a lust whore to relief or release their greedy because they could not touch her actually. Boy's sexual fantasy seems quite authentic as we are always doing, we are imagining we did everything with powerful heroism at all times, the sad reality is that we are dispassionate onlookers for the tragedy. Who can tell me why the young boys love maturing woman but they would love Lolita when they get old?",Malena

Her husband cared for other people more than his own wife. He knew that his wife would become a whore someday if he leave her alone with those meaningless people without a non-deaf person and enough money.))) but it seems that Malena doesn't even know that that boy exists; The boy doesn't have the courage to tell her how bad he loves to f**k her soft white ass up, so the boy starts masturbating.

230,relmasian,Understanding the film's point of view,8,18 March 2015,"Malena is an excellent film if one realizes the camera is seeing the world through the eyes of 12 year old Renato. It is a bit cockeyed, however, if one assumes that the camera is showing the real world. For example, when Renato's father is asked to discipline his son, he is shown using futile, feminine-like slaps while threatening a beating. But this is Renato's view of his father and should not be taking as an actual depiction of the father.Understanding that what you see is Renato's take on the world and not the actual world is difficult. There is no narrative by Renato. Usually, the camera is not positioned where Renato is but observes his behavior from a distance. Often, there are scenes in which Renato is not even present. However, by the time Renato is shown rescuing Malena while parachuting in with a blazing gun, it should be obvious that camera is showing what is in Renato's mind, not an objective view of the world.Once it is understood, that we are seeing what Renato understands, the somewhat cuckoo behavior of Malena, the townspeople, officials, and others makes sense. Otherwise, as other reviewers have noted, the film is not a representative slice of life. However, it is a very good representation of what a horny adolescent might think",Malena
231,bhavikrollno,Malena an art,9,24 December 2015,"Malena, first it seems an adult movie like any other containing sex and vulgarism but if you keep all that feeling aside and watch this movie with some respect than its an art.Its a story of first feeling of love, an unexpressed love and about the respect for others love. Its a story of woman through eyes of a boy. It shows different perspective of people about single person.It contain many scene that may be prohibited for some age, and to some people its just vulgarism but its an expression of personal thoughts and feelings. If you can find some good thing from bad, if you can except goodness even from bad than its a must watch film (sorry, art).",Malena
232,hichoco,Beautiful but sad,9,26 September 2016,"Through a 12-year-old boy's view, we saw Malèna, a woman suffered from her beauty. At the same time, we can also see how rumors, jealousy and appearance have a huge influence on an innocent and helpless woman...Thus she has no choice but to choose the worst way to make living... Besides, the saddest scene to me is the punishment to Malèna after winning the war. We were helpless like Giuseppe, who was powerless to save her and fight against the community. However, in the end this movie seems to let Malèna have a hopeful life after the back of her husband. I love this movie because I can truly experience the vivid history of the era and see how small things make huge influence through the story line.",Malena
