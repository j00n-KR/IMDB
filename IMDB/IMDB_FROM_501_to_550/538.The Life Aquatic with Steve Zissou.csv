0,MartinHafer,I was left amazingly ambivalent,5,12 April 2006,"Have you ever seen a film that you expected to love but instead found yourself stumped at how bland the movie was? Well, this is certainly true for me when it comes to this movie. Considering it featured Bill Murray, I was expecting magic and a lot of laughs--the same ones I'd seen in THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE, GROUNDHOG DAY or WHAT ABOUT BOB?. Well, I think a lot of the problem may have been that while parts of the film were good, the total package just didn't gel. So despite this film marking the return of Bud Cort and an excellent performance by Willem Defoe, it just was a big disappointment.Murray is ""Steve Zissou""--a Jacques Cousteau-like underwater explorer who is down on his luck. Most of the time, Murray played the part somewhat reminiscent of a zombie--with very little energy. I was thrilled when he ""went berserk"" a couple times in the movie when dealing with the pesky pirates, but these scenes only represented about 2% of the film. An interesting experiment, yes, as the film certainly is original. But, overall not terribly compelling or funny. The film could have definitely benefited from a re-write to punch up a script that just seemed to drag once too often.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
1,SnoopyStyle,more amusing than humorous,6,12 June 2016,Famed oceanographer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) is out for revenge after his comrade Esteban gets eaten by a mystery shark during their last documentary. Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) joins him claiming to be his son. Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett) is the pregnant reporter joining on her own dime. Eleanor Zissou (Anjelica Huston) is the wife and Klaus Daimler (Willem Dafoe) is his right hand man. Bill Ubell is the stooge from the bond company. They break into an underwater station owned by Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) to steal his gear. There is a romantic triangle and a pirate hideaway.It's Wes Anderson's movie after 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. He's doubling down on the deadpan humor on his way to creating his own unique style. It is amusing more than humorous. Bill Murray is a bit too harsh to be likable. This is one more step for Wes on his road to achieving something amazing. This one does get more fun the second time around. The first time is a bit of WTF.,The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
2,claudio_carvalho,"Weird, Non-Sense, Silly, Not Funny and Boring",4,29 October 2006,"While making a documentary, the famous oceanographer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) loses his dear friend, eaten by a jaguar shark. He raises funds for an expedition in his ship Belafonte to hunt the shark and make a new film. The journalist Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett) and a pilot that claims to be his unknown son, Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), join his crew in their journey, planned by his wife Eleanor Zissou (Anjelica Huston). While making the movie, they are attacked by pirates and left without any money to finish their work.""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is a weird, non-sense, silly, not funny and boring overrated movie. The story and screenplay is pretentious and dull, wasting a magnificent cast. The Brazilian singer Seu Jorge sings David Bowie's songs translated to Portuguese in another non-sense of this film. If you do not believe on these words, rent or buy the DVD and see this flick. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""A Vida Marinha com Steve Zissou"" (""The Marine Life with Steve Zissou"")",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
3,kosmasp,Just like Life,7,15 July 2007,"That's what the movie sometimes feel like. And that's what Wes Anderson is aiming at (at least imo). And with his cast (Owen Wilson being his favorite actor to cast, not only because they know each other, because he also has Bill Murray in every other movie of his), he achieves just that. Life Aquatic didn't strike me as Rushmore or Royal Tenenbaums did, but it's still a great movie, with it's own slow pacing! That he likes to focus on details and tries to translate believable connections/relationships between his characters on screen is known, but also obvious in his movies, as is in this one. It's also funny, in a quirky kind of way. If that sounds good to you, go ahead watch it!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
4,classicsoncall,"""I'm right on the edge. I don't know what comes next.""",6,21 January 2012,"A friend who lent me this movie said it was a bit weird, so I considered it fair warning. It started out favorably enough, and was eliciting it's share of laughs within the first ten minutes. At the time it was revealed that Esteban was eaten by a shark, (and chewed, not swallowed mind you), the story held out hope for a really offbeat and comical adventure led by Bill Murray, one of the greats. But then something happened. It got unfunny and just incredibly boring. Even with a fine cast, this movie couldn't hold my interest, so staying with it till the end proved to be an unenviable task. As a Bowie fan, I did get a kick out of the Portuguese translation gimmick, and the assortment of wildlife was imaginatively presented. Where else would you ever get to see a crayon pony fish and a snow white mongoose? But sadly, ""The Life Aquatic"" just didn't do it for me, and as a movie watching experience, it appeared to be all wet.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
5,gavin6942,Among Anderson's Best-Loved Work,8,14 July 2014,"With a plan to exact revenge on a mythical shark that killed his partner, oceanographer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) rallies a crew that includes his estranged wife, a journalist, and a man who may or may not be his son.Not surprisingly, the actors were already in mind while the film was written, particularly Owen Wilson and Bill Murray, who are pretty much synonymous with Wes Anderson at this point (2014). Other actors are just a joy to watch, including Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum.The characters and script found inspiration in unexpected places, such as Fellini's ""8 1/2"" and Marcel Proust's ""Swann's Way"". Notably the line from Proust, ""if her eyes had not been quite so black — which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting her — I should not have been, as I was, especially enamored of their imagined blue."" Heck, even ""Buckaroo Banzai"" gets an homage.The Criterion collection edition is excellent, of course, and contains a very informative commentary (which, for some reason, unfortunately contains a very noisy background). There are also numerous names bleeped out, which seems intentional not for legal reasons but for humor... who knows? One seems that ""Jacques Cousteau"" is repeatedly removed...",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
6,lee_eisenberg,"Continuing on from ""Lost in Translation""...",10,19 October 2005,"With ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"", Wes Anderson completed his troika of masterpieces, preceded by ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". Once again casting Bill Murray, Anderson casts him this time as burnout oceanographer Steve Zissou, who seeks revenge on a shark that killed his partner. You read that right; after all, this is from the director of the aforementioned flicks. Zissou sets up a team made up of various characters, including Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), who may or may not be his son.Bill Murray sort of elaborates on his ""Lost in Translation"" character, as a burnout on the verge of a major change, and does a great job with it. That - combined with top-notch direction from Anderson, plus great support from Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Jeff Goldblum, Willem Dafoe, Bud Cort and Michael Gambon - make this the sort of movie that has basically no bad qualities. It's a real treat in every sense.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
7,jboothmillard,The Life Aquatic of Steve Zissou,2,5 January 2008,"From the director of The Royal Tenenbaums, Wes Anderson, I was expecting a few more giggles, a bit more plot and some good faces doing great performances, but it turned out to be none of those. Basically the story sees a crew lead by Steve Zissou (a dull performance by Bill Murray) in his big yellow submarine, searching for the mythical jaguar shark that ate his friend, so it is both a exploration and vengeful mission for Zissou. The crew includes his wife Eleanor (Anjelica Huston) and his apparently unknown son Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson). Others include Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett), Klaus Daimler (Willem Dafoe), Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum), Oseary Drakoulias (Sir Michael Gambon), Bill Ubell (Bud Cort), Pelé dos Santos (Seu Jorge), Vladimir Wolodarsky (Noah Taylor) and Esteban Du Plantier (Seymour Cassel). There may be plenty of A-list stars in it, but Murray is dozy, and the only interesting part is when they actually see the shark near the end, all moments of chat and ""action"" before that is completely boring. Pretty poor!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
8,ccthemovieman-1,A Strange Film Hard To Rate On One Viewng,6,16 December 2006,"I find this a hard movie to rate. Maybe a second viewing would make it easier. It's a odd film: one of these low-key black humor films which is a mixture of drama and comedy. What set this apart were a few other shocking scenes of violence, something not normally in this type of movie. For a comedy, albeit a tongue-in-cheek one, that violence doesn't seem to fit, but it makes the film all the more intriguing.At times I was totally bored with this movie and at other times fascinated. I know one thing: this is a bizarre story! That automatically means it's a good vehicle for Bill Murray, who excels at wacky characters, event he low-key ones as he sometimes plays (i.e. Lost In Translation, The Royal Tenebaums, etc.). Speaker of the latter, this movie was written and directed by Wes Anderson, the same man who did ""Tenenbaums."" If you saw that, you have an idea of what you might get here, although I thought Royal Tenenbaums was far funnier.At 118 minutes, this a bit long for what it offers. I'd like to have seen it 15 minutes shorter with a tighter script. But it does offer some good photography in addition to the strange story. This movie, as they say, is not for all tastes.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
9,moonspinner55,"Insightful and humorous, but undermined by bursts of violence and an unlikable protagonist...",5,14 January 2017,"Bill Murray, bearded in a red knit beanie, plays a low-keyed, yet fiercely determined oceanographer--a sort of second-runner to Jacques Cousteau--who has assembled a motley crew of adventurers to document his vengeful destruction of a Jaguar shark; complicating the scenario is the appearance of a southern airline pilot who believes himself to be the oceanographer's long-lost biological son. Another dry, quirky comedy-drama of odd human attributes from writer-director Wes Anderson; impeccably crafted and produced, but not always so interesting or likable. A great deal of the film's effectiveness rests on Murray's scratchy, irascible presence, yet his Steve Zissou often acts like a jerk, which undermines the proceedings with a sour tone that I'm not sure is entirely unintentional. Anderson's strengths as a filmmaker are apparent: he has an artist's eye, a talent for visceral detail which sometimes takes the viewer's breath away. However, his desire to punch up the character-driven material with mechanical action backfires (one may initially presume the hijackers episode is a fantasy of Zissou's), as does the mercurial but underwritten relationships between the men and women in the movie. The eclectic soundtrack--an Anderson staple--is lovingly filled with David Bowie songs (originals and those interpreted in Portuguese by Seu Jorge), while the look of the picture is both theatrical and vivid. Overall, ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is about as unwieldy as its title--which surely hurt the film at the box-office--and not one of Anderson's watermark films, yet it features moments of beauty and emotion which make it worth-seeing for the filmmaker's admirers. ** from ****",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
10,Quinoa1984,Wes Anderson's latest trip of a comedy,9,7 January 2005,"Life Aquatic ranks up in the top five of the most original films of the year. It's a comedy, but when you laugh it might be at something you'd laugh at, or maybe not (some of the reactions and timing is so subtle, and the actors pull it off, to add humor), and it's also a drama that takes itself just serious enough to work well as entertainment. Although for one there may be flaws- not all the jokes or humor works very well on first viewing (although it could be on multiple viewings), and it's almost too much to take in all at once- there are also many pluses. For one thing writers Noah Bambauch and Wes Anderson (himself director) get out a story that is at the core fun to get into, even as it is with Anderson's trademark quirkiness with the characters. And, of course, there is a lead performance by Bill Murray that could rank with his best or worst depending on how you take his performance.Like with Lost in Translation, one could say that Murray is the key to the film's success- he's funny when he can, but he also is playing his Steve Zissou as a dramatic character as well. There's always that interesting line Anderson draws with his characters, and Murray proves that he's the kind of pulling off ironic, reactionary humor. And at the same time he's also dead-pan in his delivery- very few can pull off the 'mid-life crisis male' in a film like he can. That Anderson casts the film with a brilliant kind of notice for the right talent and for the unusual- Willem Dafoe as Zissou's right-hand man, Angelica Huston as Steve's ex-wife, Owen Wilson (who may be better than I thought, but I wasn't sure it was one of his very best) as a hit-or-miss possible for Steve's son he's never met, Jeff Goldblum as the competition, and Cate Blanchett, providing enough along with her turn in the Aviator as one of the prime female acting talents in Hollywood.Filling out the story, which I would not want to spoil aside from what was in the one-line summary, are elements that Anderson has yet to really touch upon. While there was some violence in his debut Bottle Rocket, here he takes it another step where there are a couple of enthralling action sequences (one of which incorporating The Stooges' Search and Destroy), where it's filmed is intriguing as well, how it's paced. Not to mention French acoustical covers of David Bowie, and wonderful Animation set pieces by Henry (Nightmare Before Christmas) Sellick... it's very good, if not great, film-making overall, and if you cant catch it in the theater, it's of good worth to watch with friends on DVD.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
11,michaelRokeefe,A strange oceanographer hunts down a killer fish.,7,7 September 2005,"Different and refreshing. Wes Anderson writes and directs and Bill Murray is at his best. Murray plays Steve Zissou, an internationally known oceanographer and eccentric... to say the least. Zissou gathers a crew to track down the mysterious ""jaguar shark"" that ate his long time partner while filming a documentary. On this expedition, to be filmed as a sequel, are Zissou's estranged wife(Anjelica Huston), an inquisitive journalist(Cate Blanchett)and a young man(Owen Wilson), who could or could not be Zissou's long lost son. Co-starring are Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. The movie is shot as a visual journal and the use of coloring of the aquatic creatures is outstanding. The music used is eclectic itself featuring the talents of Ennio Morricone, David Bowie, Scott Walker, Robert Mothersbaugh, Rod Argent and Iggy Pop. The well written script using an overly serious approach is where the humor shines.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

So with Sticks on board, We're off to Find the Killer Fish, through the wonderful Visionary World of Director Wes Anderson.His Sharp Eye, like always, is a Hyper Focused, Multi-Colored, Surreal, Symmetrical look at the World that is Vibrating on a slightly Different Frequency than that of regular Folks. As the Film Drifts through Uncharted Seas on a broken down Boat, everything seems somewhat Uncomfortable and Edgy, slightly Out of Step, but is always In Tune with its own Symphony of Oddball Characters and even Odder Sea Creatures.It is a Stunning Display of Artful Imaginings with a Shallow Story line but with a Depth of Emotion that can't help but draw You into its own place of Meticulously Placed Actors and Props that are Posed to posses with an Artificial Attraction that says, ""This is real but not really"".That is Wes Anderson, take it or leave it. The Pacing is at times Ponderous, but it never lingers enough to bring on Boredom, and it is forever Fascinating Visually. If there is one great Flaw, it is the Overuse of the acoustic Portuguese Language Bowie Songs.

13,ferguson-6,Breathing Underwater,6,27 December 2004,"Greetings again from the darkness. After three brilliant films (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums), Wes Anderson has achieved the lofty status held by the Coen Brothers and few others. That is to say, I will make it a priority to see his movie opening weekend. Sad to say, but ""Life Aquatic"" matches the Coen Brothers ""Lady Killers"" as a major disappointment and unbelievably I would label this one as mostly BORING. While Bill Murray's lead character is strong enough to carry the lead, the supporting roles are ... GASP ... poorly written. Owen Wilson acts as if someone is feeding him his lines as the camera is rolling and Cate Blanchett's character is just plain lost and and undefined. Willem Dafoe's and Jeff Goldblum's characters are the only other ones who bring anything to the film. The Portuguese acoustic Bowie stuff is brilliant, and it is always a pleasure to see cult legend Bud Cort (Brewster McCloud, Harold and Maude) get a few lines. The film leaves us with the impression that Anderson was as pressed for time and money as Team Zissou. It just feels rushed with little attention paid to the script details. There are a handful of instant classic lines, but way less than what we have come to expect from Anderson. Of course, I will still be among the first to see his next release!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
14,anaconda-40658,Overrated and Never Funny.,3,3 February 2016,"Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004): Dir: Wes Anderson / Cast: Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Jeff Goldblum: About as boring as The Real Fishing Show only more visually intriguing. Comedy about companionship without a shred of humour. Bill Murray plays ocean filmmaker Steve Zissou whose partner was eaten by a shark and he embarks on a sea odyssey to destroy the creature. He is joined by Owen Wilson claiming to be his son from a relationship from years ago. Great idea lurks in the gutter. The pirate sequence and rescue is absolutely embarrassing and the ending lacks payoff. Director Wes Anderson was acclaim for The Royal Tenenbaums but here he misses the mark by several miles. One strike against it is that it plainly isn't funny despite trailers and advertizements playing off like it is. What also works against it is performances that are disappointing. Murray is given great background as Zissou then he attempts a relationship with his son all the while the screenplay neglects his focus mission. Wilson is dreadful in a predictable and corny role. Cate Blanchett plays a pregnant reporter whom becomes involved with Wilson. Anjelica Huston appears as Zissou's ex-wife who also has a gay ex-husband. While visually appealing, the screenplay is muddled, disjointed and extremely unfocused waterlogged mess. Score: 3 ½ / 10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
15,movieman_kev,yet another brilliant film by Wes Anderson,10,26 May 2005,"Steve Zissou (Bill Murray)a Jacques Cousteau-like aquatic documentarian whom has lost his prestige somewhat, goes on an expedition of revenge to kill a shark who had killed his friend and Team Zissou partner, Esteban.

I adore Wes Anderson pictures and he has yet to make one that is less than stellar in my eyes. All the actors are simply splendid and well done.

It not only holds up but gets better on subsequent viewings.Eye Candy: Robyn Cohen is frequently topless DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach (great, but the bleeping out of Jacques Cousteau's name was distracting); an episode of ""Starz on the set""; 9 Deleted scenes (with more eye candy); and theatrical Trailer Disk 2 )Behind the scene photos; 'the Look Aquatic (a 5 and a half minute interview with the production designer); Creating a scene; a 19 minute interview with Devo member Mark Mothersbaugh; 'Mondo Monda (a spoof Spanish talk show interview); Intern video journal; a piece on the costumes; 'This is an Adventure' (a 51 minute documentary; Interviews with Seymour Cassel, Cate Blanchett, and Owen Wilson; a visual effects piece; design pictures; and 10 songs of David Bowie as song by Seu Jorge (great stuff) Easter Eggs: Disk 1) Highlight a hidden arrow in the bottom-right room of the Belafonte for outtakes of Bill Murrey jumping and jogging in place Disc 2) highlight an arrow by the Criticon Logo for an introduction to the disc in Spanish; highlight an arrow near the seaweed for a clip of Albert Maysles golfing My movie Grade/DVD grade: A-/ A+",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
16,The_Void,Another stylish treat from Wes Anderson!,8,30 August 2005,"I'm a big fan of Rushmore, but The Royal Tennenbaums was terrible and I was afraid that Wes Anderson's latest film, The Life Aquatic, would go down the road of the latter. I'm pleased to say that it didn't, however, and just like he did with Rushmore; Anderson has taken his quirky visual style and wound it around a plot that it can work with and the result is a truly sublime film! Bill Murray has had something of a career revival since the overrated Lost in Translation, but let's not forget that Wes Anderson had been casting him in his movies long before Francis' hack daughter ever got her hands on him. In this film, he plays Steve Zissou; an underwater explorer and documentary filmmaker. He, along with his team that includes several quirky characters set out on a mission to find and kill the Jaguar Shark that ate his best friend Esteban. The film then follows the crew as they face various obstacles on their way to finding the shark; some of them as a result of the mission, and others as a results of their interactions with one another.What makes this film brilliant is not the plot or the action; it's Anderson's attention to detail. It's the little moments such as the part that see a lizard land on Murray's hand, only to be flicked away, that make this film what it is. Almost every scene has something like that in it that makes it memorable. For the special effects, Anderson has recruited Nightmare Before Christmas director Henry Selick, so as you can imagine; they're not exactly realistic. They are very good, however, and seeing the actors in a completely absurd underwater environment is striking and works brilliantly. The part where they finally encounter the shark is of particular note. Anderson's humour helps the film too, and it is almost constantly hilarious. The jokes aren't obvious, and stem more from Anderson's use of music and the star's faces than anything, and this is much better than having it being gag-based. The cast is terrific, and the ensemble which includes the likes of Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Anjelica Huston, Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum work brilliantly together. On the whole, while this wont be for everyone; the elements come together really well and if you like this sort of thing, you're in for a treat.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
17,zetes,"Some day I will ""get"" Wes Anderson, but that day has not come yet",7,16 May 2005,"Wes Anderson would make a hell of a production or costume designer, or cinematographer even. I'm assuming he is the major force behind the aesthetic qualities of his films, and not the actual production or costume designers, or the cinematographer. His direction pretty much sucks, unfortunately. I did like The Life Aquatic quite a bit better than The Royal Tenenbaums, but only because I wasn't overly bothered by everything, and it did not feel torturous. And I was giggling occasionally, which didn't happen whatsoever during Tenenbaums. Like Anderson's previous film, The Life Aquatic deals with plastic characters in plastic situations. I think it might work as abstract art if the dialogue were inaudible, because it looks absolutely gorgeous. But, as it is, the actors mumble in this odd monotone (Owen Wilson with the worst Southern accent in film history), and I can only assume Wes Anderson wanted it that way. I cannot, however, deduce why in the hell he does want it this way.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
18,Mr-Fusion,2004 was pretty lame. But this was something special.,8,16 August 2013,"""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is an extremely pleasant surprise. A movie that endears on impact, yet I never gave it a shot when it was first released. I feel bad about that. The movie's secret weapon is its great sense of quirk, which is impressively unforced and makes for just a really good time. But what really floors me is that this is probably something that was never meant to be as good as it is. The film features a down-on-his-luck Jacques Cousteau-esque character (also a fairly bold-faced Buckaroo Banzai nod) with a thirst for undersea revenge, a soundtrack of David Bowie songs -in Portuguese- and a disarming sense of sharp-tongued whimsy. Also, it was scored by that guy from Devo. The guys that wrote this are geniuses!But it also sports one hell of an ensemble cast (Murray, Dafoe, Wilson, Blanchett, Goldblum, Gambon, Huston), is extremely quotable, and it actually turns into a pretty good adventure piece. I love the interiors on the Belafonte, the locations are gorgeous, and the whole thing ends with good-hearted poignancy. But most of all, it's genuinely funny.When I think of Bill Murray in his autumnal years, this is the movie that immediately springs to mind. 8.5/10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
19,StevePulaski,An adventure? A task? A waste of time?,6,15 June 2012,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is a film of impeccable beauty. The set designs alone should've earned the film a Best Art Direction nominee. But the film those beautiful sets inhabit is inferior and clunky, yet nothing atypical from the creative mind of Wes Anderson. After impressing me so much with The Royal Tenenbaums, it would've given me great pleasure to report that The Life Aquatic was much of the same; compelling cast, great character actors, and exuberant characters with heart and backstory.It upsets me to report that the film is very underwhelming when compared to The Royal Tenenbaums, yet has sustainable perks of its own. We'll get to those. We are greeted with our title character, Steve Zissou, played by Bill Murray, who has been in attendance for the last two Anderson pictures. He is a famed oceanographer documentarian, who has somewhat lost his popularity over the years, but after his friend Esteban is eaten by, what Steve dubs, a ""Jaguar Shark,"" he plans to make a second part to his documentary, showing the crew venturing out to the deepest waters to find him.Zissou's team is full of quirks. One of the main members is a cleaned up guy named Ned (Owen Wilson) who may or may not be Steve's son, but goes along anyway seeking company after his mother's tragic death. Steve's ex-wife (Angelica Houston), secondhand man, Klaus (Willem Dafoe), and a snobby reporter (Blanchett) also tag along for the ride in his boat to roam treacherous waters, searching for the shark.The film is elevated by its versatile sense of colorful imagination. Colorful indeed. Anderson's trademark use of colors is invigorating here. Everything is so meticulously detailed and beautifully colored, that the look of the film is one thing keeping the viewer interested at all times. Bill Murray's performance as well, handling the dry humor and subtle wit concept effortlessly well.But why are we on this journey, per say? Anderson has created a movie with enough life and color to shape two films, yet has neglected the most important part of virtually every film; the sympathetic part. It's no doubt that the man himself has the aesthetics of a film down to a tune. He can truly make a film great in terms of cinematography, directing, and details. It's when he is faced with creating characters that sustain films he struggles. They aren't characters we feel for, and we are only carried through this journey because of vague interest, and not total involvement. The film is overlong, occasionally very dull, and it doesn't seem it knows that. It has deadpan humor, which is nuanced to the point of straining the mind and soul, and everything moves at a staggering, sluggish pace, which apparently, is how it's supposed to be.Wes Anderson, when valuing characters over minor qualities in film, is a talented man. Wes Anderson, when focusing on minor aspects of a film over everything else, is sort of a tedious director. The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou will most likely please his fans, but at the end, the lack of an emotional impact (which the film sort of hungers for throughout its runtime) is lost because of how much time was wasted on developing cutesy scenery. I admire Anderson for sticking to his guns, but after a while, we question whether or not he is simply trying to make good movies or competing for the title of ""most eclectic.""

20,MovieAddict2016,Falsely marketed as a silly comedy when it is in fact a witty drama,8,13 May 2005,"In recent times, Bill Murray's movies have been misleadingly advertised. Fearing box office failure, the marketing team behind ""Lost in Translation"" crafted ads presenting it as a goofy romantic comedy. It was in fact a much deeper and poignant art house experience, and even after the Oscars ceremony there were still people renting the film expecting a comedy. It was a ""critical success and a public disaster,"" as one reviewer aptly described it. After all, no one pays to go see a serious Bill Murray movie, right? Similarly, Wes Anderson's ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" seems to have misled many filmgoers into perceiving it is a silly slapstick comedy.It is not.Like Anderson's earlier work (and in fact more so than anything else he has made), ""The Life Aquatic"" is a rather serious film with a bit of dry humor here and there to lighten the mood. Those expecting ""Ghostbusters III"" or another ""Stripes"" will be very disappointed.For my money this is Anderson's most mature directorial effort to date. It deals with a lot of angst and could arguably be called a mid-life-crisis movie (although certainly less so than ""The Royal Tenenbaums""). It deals with a man's trials and tribulations - involving death, love, hatred, regret, fatherhood, envy, and so on and so forth. There is not a more ideal actor out there to play this role than Bill Murray. In an interview, he once said that he has a lot of trouble and anger in his personal life; it translates well to the screen.In ""The Life Aquatic"" Murray plays the titular Steve Zissou (pronounced ""Ziz-so""), world famous oceanographer and failing documentary film maker (whose last hit, we are told, was nine years ago). While on a routine diving mission, Steve's lifelong friend is eaten alive by an unidentified ""Jaguar Shark."" Steve captures the events on camera and inserts them in his next film, but the critical reaction is dire. Steve is accused of having lost his touch, and is given one last chance to present his investors a hit, or he will never work again.However the last things on Steve's mind are financial issues  instead he swears revenge on the Jaguar Shark (in the name of science, of course) and embarks on an adventure to slaughter the fish that killed his best friend.Steve's estranged wife (Anjelica Huston) joins him on his trip, as well as a mysterious man who may or may not be Steve's son (Owen Wilson with a Kentucky accent), and a very German Willem Dafoe (who is responsible for most of the film's laughs). Also along for Zissou's final outing is a blunt reporter (Cate Blanchett) seeking the dirt on Zissou, who finds herself falling in love with his ostensible son.This movie is very ambiguous and open-ended. It leaves a lot open for discussion at the end -- something I believe Wes Anderson is particularly good at. Some of his past films such as ""Rushmore"" have been impressive, but it seems if Anderson has any flaws it is his unabashed sentimentality and (as some critics have accused him of) superficiality.Ironically ""The Life Aquatic"" is simultaneously Anderson's most superficial and honest film. On its surface, it is Anderson's first true Hollywood movie and even features special effects. But in terms of narrative it is by far his most realistic and touching movie (or at least I thought so). Watching ""Rushmore"" I laughed a lot and felt attached to the characters, but the ending seemed tacked-on and didn't ring true. ""The Life Aquatic""was entertaining and also managed to feel free of narrative manipulation  and that is probably why people either love or hate it, judging from critical response.Overall, while not a flawless film, it is a very mature work, and a nice addition to Anderson's oeuvre. I believe its mixed reaction from the critics and public is due to the fact that it was heavily misunderstood on release (as some of the great classic films were in their time) and is, as I mentioned above, much more of an honest drama than some the audience probably expected it to be walking into the theater based on the promotional campaign and trailer.You can now experience the film unencumbered with erroneous preconceptions, and thanks to an excellent Two-Disc Criterion Collection DVD, there are ample special features available that may add to your appreciation of this excellent film.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
21,KineticSeoul,Excellent expedition,8,20 September 2015,"If you like Wes Anderson's style of film making, chances are you will thoroughly enjoy this. Watching this film was like watching a Wes Anderson version of Moby Dick with a bunch of other things thrown in there. So the plot is about a oceanographer Steve Zissou and his crew going on a expedition to hunt down the shark that killed his friend. And throw in the relationship between Steve and a estranged wife, a female journalist, and a man who may or may not be his son. And you got a crazy and yet fun expedition journey with retro style and odd characters that reminded me of characters from ""Napoleon Dynamite"". What I really enjoyed is the old school fun film making style of this movie. It seemed like couple of kids that enjoy movies decided to direct a great movie of there own. And I mean that in a good way. Now this could be a WTF movie for the mainstream audiences and if I saw this movie as a kid, I probably wouldn't have been able to understand the weirdness of it. However watching this film as an adult, I can appreciate it for what it is. And thoroughly enjoyed the odd humor in this and the retro soundtrack as always in Wes Anderson films.8/10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
22,Buddy-51,tepid offbeat comedy,6,14 April 2006,"""Quirky"" doesn't even begin to describe ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" a bizarre, completely off-the-wall comedy featuring a lead character who is a cross between Jacques Cousteau and Captain Ahab. Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) is a world famous oceanographer and showman who has made a number of successful nature documentaries aboard his ship, The Belafonte. However, in his last film-making venture, tragedy occurred when his most venerable crew member was devoured by what Zissou describes as a ""jaguar shark."" For the ""sequel"" to that film, Zissou sets off on a search for the killer of his friend, taking along with him a hostile woman reporter (Cate Blanchett) who is doing a magazine piece on his endeavor, a young man who claims to be his illegitimate son (Owen Wilson), and his usual assortment of crewmembers (including Willem DaFoe), cameramen and unpaid student interns.Although there are a number of very witty moments in this film and some of the acting is absolutely on the money, ""The Life Aquatic"" runs out of steam fairly early on, unable to find the buying-in point that would actually make us care about either the story or the characters. Writer/director Wes Anderson and co-scenarist Noah Baumbach maintain the tone of understated eccentricity fairly well, but the material just isn't rich or varied enough to sustain a near-two hour running time.Murray once again proves himself the master of the deadpan delivery and the dry retort, while Blanchett, Dafoe, Angelica Houston and Jeff Goldblum offer superb support. Only Wilson, whose Kentucky accent keeps mysteriously appearing and disappearing throughout the course of the movie, fails to rise to the level of the pros.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
23,ElMaruecan82,Lost in Submersion...,7,18 September 2017,"My first experience with Wes Anderson was ""The Royal Tennebaums"", I didn't finish it but I don't think I was watching it with the right person, let's just put it that way: my buddy and me were staring at the screen exactly like Wes Anderson's usual characters, which isn't a good thing. And I guess I wasn't in much a demand for sophisticated humor at that particular phase of my life. I still have to watch the film though. My second experience was ""Grand Budapest Hotel"", I didn't like it the first time. I loved it the second. All it took was to understand Wes Anderson's personal approach to film-making and the way he took style rather as an end than a mean, somewhat reaching more genuine truths than conventional dramas or just making fabulously entertaining movies. I took it that it took a special gourmet taste to savor his films and the next two discoveries didn't break the streak of enjoyment.So I loved ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" and I loved ""Moonrise Kingdom"". And I kept waiting for the one movie where Bill Murray would finally have a leading role. The film was ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"", whose poster looked like a very promising take on classic documentary ""The World of Silence"" with Commandant Cousteau (Zissou wears the same trademark red cap). I expected a lot of beautiful shots, a lot of laughs no matter the facial expression on Bill Murray's face, I expected a lot of good things. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" had alerted me that Anderson, like Harold Ramis and Sofia Coppola was the kind of privileged director who'd ""understood"" Bill Murray, but not at the expenses of our understanding.Indeed, for some reason, and despite a terrific set-up, I had a déjà vu with this film. It felt like my first experience with ""Tennenbaum"" (and now, you know why I had to write with this lengthy introduction). Unless I was mislead about the film, I thought there would be something passionate about Zissou, or at least, in his Melvillian relationship with the jaguar-shark who ate (even chewed) his first mate Esteban. I know, Bill Murray, tongue-in-cheek, snarky, deadpan humor and so on No problem with that, but it seemed like there was no moment whatsoever where Zissou could actually be seen enjoying anything.There were some outbursts of violence and emotions and I was waiting for genuine reactions like his fatherly anger when his supposed son gets punched in the face by a group of hijackers, but overall, the film played like a series of set-ups for hilarious situations with downer conclusions. It's a comedy drama but I wonder why Anderson ever invested in the comedic element since he never really bring much fun to the screen except for a few chuckles in the middle of some existential contemplation.The film had them all, Bill Murray could have played the role of a lifetime just one year after his great performance in ""Lost in Translation"" but in Coppola's film, we could identify the roots of Bob's melancholy and his brief moments of happiness provided the little zest without which the film would have felt pretty bland. That ""Zissou"" story had like ten characters as ""lost in translation"" as Zissou himself, a malcontent wife played by Anjelica Huston, a frustrated and envious first mate played by Willem Dafoe, a number one fan of Zissou who believe he might be Zissou's son, and played by Owen Wilson.There's also Cate Blanchett who's probably trying to break her 'Elizabeth"" image and have a hip comedic role with a trendy director for a change. It would work better with Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"". And Jeff Goldblum is a pedant, gay and condescending oceanographer named Hennessy, he's supposed to be Zissou's nemesis, he's more like an alter-ego in a film that becomes like an oddball contest, which is fine in a ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" kind of plot, but not quite this time.The film doesn't even trust the initial premise with the jaguar shark, it involves a series of hijacking, assaults, accidents, but we never really get a clear idea of where this is going anyway.Don't get me wrong, ""Life Aquatic"" looks great, the script is full of one liners and the actors are all talented, but they don't seem to be really playing their roles as if the story mattered anyway, maybe Owen Wilson is the most emotionally engaging and so is Willem Defoe but the others were too estranged to us to let any specific feeling unfold. And for some reason, with the story of the eaten friend, and the possible father-and-son relationship, there's never a moment where Wes Anderson tries to get conventional a little for the sake of emotions. In fact, Anderson ever seems to despise emotions, a symptom that thankfully didn't affect ""Moonrise Kingdom"".There's some interesting self-referential approach when Zissou considers the possibility of a relationship subplot in the film because he's got great chemistry with his son, but it's like Anderson was trying to keep this as fake as possible as a defensive move, as if he didn't want to surrender to some corny conventional-ism typical of Hollywood, by doing so, he might have deprived the film from what could have been the emotional core behind the laughs. Just because Murray isn't a man of emotions, doesn't make him emotionless. Anyway, it all comes down to this: I think the story deserves a 6 for the wasted potential, but I can't get past how beautiful some shots look, so I'll give it a 7. Not that the rating matters anyway.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
24,paul2001sw-1,A film quixotic,3,24 December 2007,"Wes Anderson's movies are highly acclaimed, but the more of them I see, the less I find to like. Call me old fashioned, but it seems to be that there are two ways of doing comedy. On one hand, there's subtle, character-based humour where the point is made through minor exaggeration of real life - we laugh because we recognise the situation. On the other hand, there's slapstick, a more direct form of humour and less dependent on an accurate portrayal of the real world. But what Anderson does, it seems to me, is to make films whose ""jokes"" are sly rather than full-on, but in a world that is wholly imaginary and populated by wafer-thin characters about whose fate it's impossible to care. So there's no belly laughs, no drama, just the empty echo of Anderson chuckling to himself.In 'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou', the story, such as it is, is centred on a man who makes nautical wildlife documentaries: ludicrously bad ones. But the truth is, that if one views Anderson's own film without the necessary mask of irony, it is just as bad as those of his character. Where's the plot, the characterisation, the tension in the action scenes (in fact, a lot of the action seems to occur in the middle of cuts between the preceding and following scenes), the jokes? The only real joke appears to be an invitation to laugh at the director's cleverness in daring to make a film that abandons any attempt to meet normal definitions of what makes a good movie. The material, and the concept of its treatment, could be funny in a recurring sketch in a weekly show; but it doesn't stretch to two continuous hours. I'm prepared to grant that this is a daring film; but that doesn't mean it isn't rubbish.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
25,MLDinTN,first 45 minutes was boring....,6,29 November 2005,"but once they got to sea, it got a little better. I was disappointed with this movie. I am glad I didn't go see it at the theater now. I was expecting something very funny and silly, but this film was not that. It was supposed to be amusing, but I found nothing amusing about it until the pirates showed up.The basic story is Steve Zissou and his crew were filming a documentary and his buddy gets eaten by a mystery shark. Steve vows to set out on an expedition to find the shark. Before leaving, we meet his ""illegimate"" son, Ned, who he has never met before. We meet his wife Eleanor, who really isn't that into what Steve does. There's Klaus, who worships Steve, the rest of Steve's crew, the interns, and then Jane the reporter who also goes along. This first part was boring.Finally, they head out to sea and it starts to get a little better. They break into rival's Hennessey's station and steal a bunch of stuff. Later, they have to hide the stuff when they run into Hennessey again. Pirates board the ship and kidnap this guy. So, Steve and his crew track him down to save him. These parts are amusing because it is just so silly when they creep around the island with guns in their silly gray wet suits. Plus, Steve goes Rambo when he saves his ship from the pirates. When the interns quit after nearly being killed by the pirates, he tells them he won't give them an F, just an incomplete. How nice.FINAL VERDICT: It turned out OK once I got past the first 45 minutes. It wasn't great, so don't go in expecting to laugh through out. So, if you like Bill Murray and have 2 hours to spare, I recommend it. Just don't have high expectations.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Fortunately, this innovative, different effort at comedy came off as fresh, honest, and disarming as many of the actors were able to try on different characters with good effect. Owen Wilson had probably the most out of style role while Willem Dafoe had a delicious screwball character opportunity. There was a lot going on in this movie including a film with a film, a carefree attitude, along with a harsh, deadening one that seemed to be somewhat jarring for this movie. On the whole, this movie seemed more of an experience, including the somewhat obnoxious antics of Bill Murray whose slightly toned down style preserved then sanity of this movie for me.

Watching Zissou and his not so bright son (Owen Wilson) becomes redundant. Watching the nice cast being totally wasted is almost criminal.

32,BaronBl00d,Maybe a Depth Charge Would make It Interesting!,3,16 May 2005,"I really looked forward to this film. The previews looked entertaining and amusing. I so wanted to like this film, but, alas, that was definitely not to be. About ten minutes into the film, I thought that this film was kind of slow - but hey, it is bound to pick up. It never did for me. Now, as artsy films go - and make no mistake that is what this film is trying to be - this film is beautiful. I liked some of the innovative camera angles, the interesting colors, even the weird, unrealistic sea life. Some of the characters were mildly interesting like William Dafoe, Michael Gambon, and Jeff Goldblum. The movie's biggest problem is that the film plods on with virtually nothing happening, no real humour, or even a remotely interesting script. Bill Murray plays Steve Zissou, a Jacque Cousteau type who makes films about his adventures. We meet his crew and his wife, and soon a man that is suppose to be his son - Owen Wilson. We never do find out anything concrete about their actual relationship at film's end, but what we basically have is a story of a father who never wanted to be a father be a father. Sounds good huh? It might have been if there was any depth to the characters in the film. Let's face it, Bill Murray is Bill Murray. I think the guy is great playing wacky characterizations like in Kingpin. In this he is stilted and just plain boring. Ever since his Oscar nod for that sleeper of epic proportions(Lost in Translation) Murray has been taking himself too seriously in front of the camera. It's really too bad as he is such a funny man. Wilson was not funny either. Kate Blanchett was just annoying and wasted. Huston the same. The film is a comedy and I think I laughed maybe three or four times - not hearty laughs but chuckles. The film should have been so much more than that with the cast it assembled.

33,jzappa,"A Seafaring Adventure with All the Trimmings, in Anderson's Signature Earthy Sweet Dry Style",8,21 February 2009,"The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou is a wildly creative, enthralling, hilarious, emotional adventure film, but all under the trademark understatement, dry humor, irony, unadornedly subjective cinematography, production design and retro folk-rock music selection of Wes Anderson. It details the adventures of once-famed oceanographer and documentarian Steve Zissou, in a tremendously affirming performance by Bill Murray, who has come a long way since the image he knew in the 1970s and '80s. Zissou's latest film in a body of progressively inconsequential work covers the death of his best friend Esteban by a jaguar shark. For his next documentary, he is determined to find the creature and destroy it. But Anderson's view of life seems to be that we are always fixating on a single intention to conquer, stubbornly forgetting all reasoning and herding your comrades to that advantage, but that if this intention never materializes, we have two choices: We can take what life instead dishes out or we can reject it all for the sake of a futile quest.Anderson wrote the screenplay with Noah Baumbach, who wrote and directed two great recent films, The Squid and the Whale and Margot at the Wedding. He is another contemporary filmmaker who pares his films down to real life size, putting his stories and characters in a contently diminished light. The colorful, dejected title character is surrounded by an ensemble cast as distinctive as he is, unprecedented seafaring debacles, even a gunfight. But the way in which this film implants its roots as a true epic is not by its quantitative scale of action and spectacle, as I've probably already implied. Rather, there are so many real-world references to all the worlds with which Zissou is affiliated. He is surrounded by images influenced by films, noted moments from the lives of filmmakers, namely and definitely Jacques Cousteau and Francis Ford Coppola, and a humble vision of the sea seen through the egotistic eyes of a documentarian. And these detailed undercurrents contrast with the fully realized characterizations of those accompanying him, who are often worlds apart, thus the overlapping panoramas of life seen merely by the presence of the characters create a sort of grassroots-style epic scope for the film.The histrionics of these characters is made easy by the tactile creativity of the boat's architecture, which looks like an old, run-down freighter on the outside but veils countless compartments of blissful comfort, as we see through intermittent cross-sections that allow the camera to dolly back and forth from room to room, in a sense through the walls. But Anderson stays within the realm of his aesthetic voice, employing his usual visual style, via the use of the bright, solid chief color scheme as well as his deliberate, methodical cinematography, using 90 degree camera angles, parallel and perpendicular arrangement of forms, and frequent use of symmetry.The familiar face of a star is part of the characterization of his or her role, and casting can be the most important act in a filmmaker's construction of a character. This movie boasts a huge cast of wonderful actors and actresses who impel all the connotations they bear and induce them into the being of their roles.The film was an unjust box office failure. One can't be sure of what caused that. Perhaps because the film has no secure category with which to address and acquire any particular audience. This is something that is bred by Hollywood and its production practices, audience expectations and the film itself in its contribution to its genre as a whole. But the meaning of a film is brought into the cinema with its audience and, conversely, the cultural power of the meanings are generated by the movie. This film gives the audience something different to do with their notions.Perhaps it was the critical reception. They tried to understand it rationally, through which they decided that the film didn't work, but to no coherent effect in most notices. Many simply seemed to treat it as something no one would be inclined to see. Some said that it was so odd that it had no resonance. ""A mess."" ""Perplexing."" ""Weird."" ""Transparently fake."" ""Not entirely entertaining."" ""The comedy is so subtle, it's easy to miss completely."" So many professional moviegoers seemed to want to rationalize their apparently very unusual experience rather than understand that the film is purely an emotional experience. Rebecca Murray of About.com actually says, ""Do you ever feel like everyone but you is in on the joke?"" Say what you will about the likeliness of its story, of all things, but it's not the same configuration or look as many others of a given kind. It",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Anyone who wants to tag along is more than welcome.""Wes Anderson is one of those few directors whose style and quirky sense of humor is so unique that you could tell what films he's directed only by catching a few seconds of any scene from his movies. The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou is perhaps his most divisive film, and I can understand why considering it is heavily stylized (the set pieces in this film are gorgeous), but it isn't really as funny as most of his other films. I stand in the middle with The Life Aquatic, I don't think it's his best film, but I still enjoyed it a little more than The Darjeeling Limited. My first Wes Anderson movie continues to be my favorite, The Royal Tenenbaums, which introduced me to the rest of his work. What this film has going for it is that Bill Murray plays the lead character and has much more screen time than in the other Anderson films. He is such a terrific actor that anything he does would catch my attention. In this film Murray nails his portrayal of a tired and warn out ocean adventure documentary film maker undergoing a life crisis. Murray carries the film since the rest of the cast isn't as well developed as other characters in Anderson movies. The Life Aquatic may not be as funny as other Anderson films, but it does have the familiar quirky tone and other trademarks of his that we have come to love. It's a lovely tribute to the great Jacques Cousteau and fans will appreciate this film very much.Written by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach (from The Squid and The Whale fame) this original screenplay focuses on a middle aged ocean adventure documentary film maker named Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) who is preparing for what could be his final expedition along with his crew to hunt down a mysterious jaguar shark who recently ate his partner. Steve introduces the different members of his crew during a screening of his latest film. Among the many crew members there's his wife, Eleanor (Anjelica Huston) who usually finances his expeditions, his assistant Klaus (Willem Dafoe), and Pele (Seu Jorge) who basically contributes to the soundtrack of this film by singing Portuguese covers of David Bowie songs. Before he sets out on his final expedition, a man named Ned (Owen Wilson) shows up claiming he might be his son so Steve decides to bring him on board the Belafonte (his ship) in order to bond with him. A beautiful journalist named Jane (Cate Blanchett) also accompanies them on their mission to find the deadly shark, but some armed pirates interfere with their plans.One of the things I enjoy the most about Wes Anderson's films is that you never know what direction the plot is going to go. He creates some quirky, colorful, and unique characters and Murray's Steve Zissou is another memorable one. The rest of the cast doesn't add much to the film with the exception of Willem Dafoe who has several funny scenes and Jeff Goldblum whom I would have liked to see more of. The Life Aquatic is one of Anderson's most stylized films, I loved the set pieces and the tracking shots of the different interior compartments in the Belafonte. It also has some familiar themes we see in most of Anderson's films. The crew in this film plays like the broken families he usually explores, and once again one of the men is seeking the approval of a parent figure. I had a fun experience with this film that does get off track at times, but it comes back at you every time.

Mix that with unusual dramatic plot points, deadpan emotional relationships, action and fantasy. At the center of the story is a filmmaker making a documentary of his potential discovery of a large, rare, polka dot fish. During this expedition are a swirl of scenes that involve all sorts of unusual relationship scenarios, semi-slapstick gunfire, underwater scenes, a hijacking and a rescue all wrapped in a shell of dry humor. This being Wes Anderson, there is an abundance of light-hearted color tones, purposefully framed shots, an awesome ship set piece (think life sized doll house) that is cut in half so you can watch characters walk between different rooms. The bulk of the soundtrack are David Bowie covers. The film is super random which is a pro and a con; perhaps the pacing is awkward in some parts. Some parts are very whimsical and amusing and some parts are a little boring and unengaging. But the final package is highly original and worth the adventure.

That's OK, since that sort of movie is really hard to pull off. So, there were a hodgepodge of other dramatic and comedic elements. It was, at least, reasonably original, and deserves some credit for that. Can't really say that much about the acting. Nobody really stood out. It was all competent and professional, at least for this sort of film. There were a number of amusing running jokes, such as the fake marine life, the way the crew went about casually armed, Anne-Marie (Robyn Cohen) frequently hanging about topless for no obvious reason, and the Brazilian crew member often playing guitar, and singing David Bowie songs in Portuguese.

37,arthur_tafero,Worst Murray Film Ever - The Life Aquatic,3,10 July 2019,"When I viewed this film, I wanted it to be good; I expected it to be good. I really like Bill Murray; and most of the other cast members. I thought the use of Wes Anderson, an expert in the horror genre, as the writer and director of this film was a bit of an odd choice. As it turned out, it was a disastrous choice. Mr. Anderson created some very nice satirical characters that were funny......for about five minutes each. After that, the banal story of hunting down a rare shark becomes terribly mundane. The visuals can not overcome the mind-numbing, terrible dialogue at lame attempts at satire.
The problem is we are aware that all the actors are trying to be satirical; in a real satire, the story unravels naturally, and the satire is revealed through the characters and the plot. That does not work well here. This was supposed to be a comedy. And it was funny for about ten minutes; but not for two hours. This film wasted more talent than any other I have seen in memory, since the relatively unfunny Mad Mad World fiasco. That wasn't very funny, either. Both films had one thing in common; they had forced humor. Forced humor seldom, if ever, works.

The tone and shabby look of time having passed them by is very similar to how Clint Eastwood did a similarly affectionate but oddball tribute to wild west shows in ""Bronco Billy."" The satirical barbs, particularly of types of characters, fly fast and furious, ranging from laugh out loud funny to sweetly amusing. The cast is marvelous at keeping the tone of the movie consistent.Bill Murray has practically patented this tone, but Angelica Huston, as ""the brains behind Zissou,"" is a marvelous anchor (and I love her dramatic jewelry.) Owen Wilson reins in his smugness.While I presume that Cate Blanchett's real-life pregnancy was written into the script, I'm not sure if her odd accent was a left-over of Katherine Hepburn in ""The Aviator"" or in preparation, as she sounds like Kate repeating that line about the calla lilies.Noah Taylor's tekkie assistant is a cute take-off of his role in the ""Lara Croft"" movies.Willem Dafoe carries off a running joke as a sensitive German.The primary color cinematography is charming and the animation is delightful.Stay through the credits to get to see the lovely recessional and hear the last acoustic Portuguese cover of David Bowie songs, as the closing number is not on the soundtrack.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
39,Cristi_Ciopron,A welldeserved opportunity for Murray: he gives an incredibly funny and nuanced performance,10,6 October 2008,"ZISSOU offers Murray so great a chance that it's hard to overestimate it. The script is so well written as to never loose a certain discretion, a balance of truth. Some well meaning critics make ZISSOU look more _criptic, abstruse and enigmatic than it really is . It's an extremely intelligent movie, a masterpiece ,and therefore very clean and quite easy to get. It's too long since I enjoyed a movie this much; on TV it was labeled as an adventure movie. To me, it was a genial comedy. It is pure pleasure, pure delight. There are not many things better in the cinema. Wonderfully coherent, complex and exquisitely written; as craft, it's much beyond the common measure. A work of art. It is an exponent of an wonderfully alive cinemathat of it's author. Written by Anderson and Baumbach, the script is a jewel of artistry, tact and intelligence. Murray confirms his unusual talent, and him, or his career deserved this chance. An allstar cast grants a sensational level of acting. Yes, it's long since I have enjoyed so much a movie.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
40,alansabljakovic-39044,20 000 leagues under the Zissou,7,13 December 2018,"Incredile cast,I really love Bill Murray but in this one I have to admit I liked Dafoe more. Cate Blanchett is amazing as always and Owen Wilson is pretty good in all Anderson's films. This movie just represents Wes Anderson and if you don't like it than Anderson is not for your taste.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
41,slokes,Breathing Underwater,7,20 June 2012,"As with other Wes Anderson movies I've seen, ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" takes on a lot of strangeness and subtext over the course of its meandering running time, enough to drown three or four lesser films. Here it adds to a charming experience that builds with multiple views.Bill Murray is Zissou, famed ocean explorer/documentary maker who finds himself in a nine-year slump made worse when his best friend is eaten by a mysterious creature Zissou dubs a ""jaguar shark."" While hunting the shark with his intrepid crew, Zissou is upended by matters such as lost financing, a brutally honest reporter (Cate Blanchett) who refuses his advances, pirates, mutiny, and a young man named Ned (Owen Wilson) who may be his son.""Zissou"" comes with engagingly dynamic, fantastic undersea visuals and even an action-adventure subplot. Yet people who know Anderson's other movies will know what to expect here. The dialogue is often elliptical, as are the jokes. Scenes begin and end in an offbeat way that can seem haphazard. Emotions are expressed openly but exposition and motivation can be cloudy.So it can take a little longer to warm up to his movies. I liked ""Zissou"" just enough the first time to watch it again and try to figure it out. Now I actually laugh watching line reads that left me as cold as they read on the page: ""It was coming right at us...I just said the first two words that came into my head."" ""I would have named you Kingsley if I'd had a say in it."" ""That's your first question? I thought this was going to be a puff piece."" ""It's not a bad impulse, though. Some kind of nickname. Not that one, it's too specific.""These are all Zissou lines, by the way, and the fact they snuck up on me shows Murray's deadpan comic stylings are in fine form here. I'm not a fan of Murray's last 15 years of mostly arty film parts; ""Lost In Translation"" and ""Broken Flowers"" did little for me. Here he finds something that connects to the ""Saturday Night Live"" wild man I grew up with and loved, while channeling a moving message about redemption that chimes with Anderson's quirky humor. Zissou may be a broken-down man, but he's no drag to watch and Murray makes him his own.The cast around Murray isn't quite up to his level, but it's not their fault. Anderson and co-writer Noah Baumbach have more characters than they know what to do with, and at least two or three seem superfluous. Showing up best for me were a couple of surprises.Willem Dafoe is wonderfully whiney as Zissou's aide-de-camp, jealous of Ned's relationship to Steve and a pleasure to watch in a fun way I never would have suspected of Dafoe. ""Thanks a lot for not picking me,"" he yells at Steve in the middle of a tense action scene. ""I'm sick of being on B team.""Bud Cort makes the most of a nothing part as a character forced on Zissou by his insurers, much to his resentment. Steve calls him a ""bond-company stooge."" ""I'm also a human being,"" the stooge replies, which shames Zissou into an apology.It's funny to read comments here saying Zissou is vain and unlikeable; he's actually quite a softy by Murray standards. He melts instantly and completely when Ned appears, and constantly alternates between having a breakdown and checking to make sure his cameraman is filming him in his extremity.""Life Aquatic"" is a bit lumpy here and there and takes some strange turns in the second half that still feel like minor mistakes in tone to me after four viewings. But the main takeaway is a terrific showcase for the title character. Murray here doesn't deliver the water-cooler wisecracks of 20 years before, but he's still fine company who finds new ways to reward your watching him over and over again.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
42,Enchorde,Peculiar... surely an adventure...,6,5 September 2005,"** HERE BE SPOILERS ** Recap: Steve Zissou heads a team of aquatic explorers, however the last few years or so has been a disappointment. The last expedition even ended in the tragic death of trusted friend Esteban, eaten by a mysterious jaguar shark. While Steve plans another expedition to avenge his friend, preferably with dynamite, there are some trouble. No one wants to finance the expedition, and suddenly a lost son appears. And yes, his wife seems to be leaving... for his archenemy.Comment: Comedy, Drama, Adventure. Comedy, for sure, although a very peculiar one. Not at all what I expected, it relies on characters and absurdities presented in a surprisingly calm and slow pace. Funny, yes, but this is not the hilarious trip I hoped for. Drama? Perhaps... but not by much. Adventure? You bet. A trip in a worn out boat you'll see species you never even dreamt of. There is also a bunch of known actors and actresses around. Murray is very good as Zisou but the star must be Dafoe as the German engineer Daimler. So even if the story lacks something this is worth watching because of the great characters and performances from the actors...6/10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
43,Jonny_Numb,more laid back than Anderson's previous works,6,24 July 2005,"""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" has Wes Anderson's trademark touches smeared all over it--from the eclectic characters unable to express themselves totally, to the musical segues designed to stand in for dialog, to the red beanies and turquoise suits the characters wear. It is also a lot more laid back, which might explain why I enjoyed it more than his previous works--unlike ""Rushmore"" or ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" ""The Life Aquatic"" isn't so enamored of its own preciousness that it becomes a hindrance on the film (too often Anderson seems hell-bent on returning modern cinema back to the innocence and naiveté of the 1930s), and instead plays more raucously, succeeding in spite of its muddled intentions and ridiculous situations (pirates, anyone?). The plot centers around Steve Zissou (an inspired Bill Murray), a washed-up oceanographer and his band of documentary filmmakers, who set out on the trail of the infamous Jaguar Shark that killed Zissou's partner; also along for the ride is a pregnant reporter (Cate Blanchett) and a man who could be Zissou's son (Owen Wilson). By the end, the to-be-expected emotional encounters have been checked off the list, but the humor is strong and the visuals dynamic. What exists between the beginning and end of ""The Life Aquatic"" is ultimately rather irrelevant, but the ride is pretty fun.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

45,Samiam3,"A weird sea adventure, with some effective dry humour (good enough)",7,2 October 2010,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou takes a while to get going, but when it does it entertains in a very bizarre fashion. This motion picture from Wes Anderson in a paradox. If this makes any sense, It is dry, and flat-toned yet equally quirky. Take for instance Bill Murray and his outfit. Murray wears an utterly tacky bright blue wetsuit with a plain white 'Z' on it and upon his head is a even more tacky bright red tuke which remind me of a Dr. Seuss character (I cannot remember which one) By contrast to the uniform, the person inside it is flat faced, dead pan persona. The two traits together (quirky and dry) make this image of this man while humorous, which is also true of the film as a whole.There are numerous signs that Andersson wants his viewer to acknowledge that this is a movie. Something about it recalls the sort of cartoony (but delightful) staginess of cinematic pioneer George Melies (A trip to the Moon). In this movie, every pair of scenes is chaptered using a very retro type font. When the Life Aquatic goes underwater, you feel more like you are in an aquarium than a coral reef. To bring a marine ecosystem to life, Andersson has recruited Henry Selick (the Nightmare before Christmas) to do the job. We have candy crabs, electric Jellyfish, and a jaguar shark the size of a whale, among others. most of the film is scored with bouncy jingles, somewhat reminiscent of Spongbob, and when it is integrated over top a gunfight in which gunfire sounds intentionally like popcorn, the result further enhances the comedic value of this picture.Movie goers will probably get a kick out of the totally weirdness of The Life Aquatic. It could use a few trims and maybe a few more jokes, but I'm glad I saw it. Haven't seen many films like it.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
46,onepotato2,Bucakroo Banzai meets the Tennebaums,6,30 December 2004,"When I saw a (late) half hour of this previously, I found it fairly amusing, and wrote some favorable things about it. The movie in its entirety however plays differently, and not in the good way. While this is unlike Anderson's Tennebaums (Thank God - a shameless ripoff of both Franny & Zooey and the Magnificent Ambersons) these characters are wearying. The story of the movie is halting and dull; and the scenes suffer from a gray sameness, in terms of tone. By the 45 minute mark, I could barely sit through another scene of disinterested/laconic characters (Murray, Huston, Wilson, etc.) Murray has certainly found his director. Hopefully Anderson has put a stop to the string of schlocky, unworthy products Murray was associated with (The Man who Knew too Little, Garfield, Osmosis Jones, Larger than Life.) That crap was getting embarrassing.Anderson however is chronically distracted by a string of unconnected conceits (deliberately cheesy animation of fish, a cut away tour of the ship, a crew member constantly interrupting things with Bowie songs sung in Portuguese, tributes to his own movies, etc.) There are also too many roles, with most of the name actors wasted (daFoe, Wilson, Huston, Blanchette, Cort, etc) It's completely scatter-shot. Momentum suffers badly, and it's 119 minutes long(!). Wes is still stealing other peoples stuff. Team Zizou is a riff on Team Banzai (The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai) which also featured Jeff Goldblum wearing the identical pair of silver Harry Truman-style glasses. The final credits sequence is pretty much a shot by shot ripoff (or in Wes's words, a ""tribute"") of Banzai's fun end-credits.Inconceivably dull and pointless.(For the record: I loved Rushmore very much and I disliked intensely every precious, overwrought sitcom moment of the Tennenbaums.)",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

48,rosscinema,Anderson's film has it's moments but lacks something as a whole,5,8 January 2005,"It feels weird to say anything negative about a film that is so ambitious and at times is genuinely funny but everything seems to be for nothing. You have to ask yourself what it is exactly viewers were supposed to take away from this film and the feeling here is that the director may have tried too hard and bit off more than he could chew. Story is about Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) who's a sad sack oceanographer that makes documentaries on his adventures and after his best friend Esteban (Seymour Cassel) is eaten by a mysterious jaguar shark Steve vows to get revenge and film the whole thing. Steve's ship is called the Belafonte and on board with him are his ex-wife Eleanor (Angelica Huston), Klaus (Willem Dafoe) who suffers from low self esteem, pregnant journalist Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett), accountant Bill (Bud Cort), and Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) who may or may not be Steve's illegitimate son.*****SPOILER ALERT***** There are other assorted shipmates on board as well as unpaid interns that help out from the college and while on they're voyage they steal equipment from Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) who is another ex-husband of Eleanor. There is also a strange love triangle between Steve, Jane, and Ned but things get even worse when they are attacked by Filipino pirates and Bill the accountant is kidnapped. They track down Bill to one of the nearby islands and get him back after a shootout but they need more money so Steve must ask Eleanor to get more from her parents which she does but later they discover the whereabouts of the jaguar shark and everyone gets into the submarine to find it.This is the third film that director Wes Anderson has worked on with Bill Murray and they were meant to work together considering they're both masters at dry wit. While I'm not really recommending this film I still don't want to dissuade anyone from experiencing it either because there are some creative things going on and the first is the set design of the ship Belafonte. Anderson had the set built with the side missing so that the camera can follow characters from room to room without the use of editing. Secondly, Murray is very good in the role even if the script is leading him nowhere and you can't help but feel a sense of empathy for his character as everything seems to go wrong for him. One of the last shots in the film shows Murray sitting on the steps and talking to a little boy and Murray has a look in his eyes that tells us that he's really troubled by certain things. The film doesn't do a good job of allowing the viewer to figure out what exactly that is but once again Murray demonstrates that he's not just a comedian but a terrific actor. But the film seems to be a series of scenes that showcase Anderson's incredible droll comedy which at times is very funny but fail to amount to some sort of logical conclusion. Anderson has made a good looking and interesting comedy but his script (co-written with Noah Baumbach) just doesn't achieve a sort of clarity that his previous efforts had and despite Murray being well cast in the title role this film stumbles over itself when it's time to add everything up.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
49,p-stepien,Island of the quirky,2,22 December 2012,"Quintessential Wes Anderson follows the life of fallen aquatic icon Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), who is an apparent homage to Jacques-Yves Cousteau and his famous marine society. While filming another oceanographic documentary, eagerly awaiting by the public, despite the increasingly critical reaction of once ever-faithful viewers, an almost mythical Jaguar shark consumes Esteban, Zissou's best friend and confidant. Set on the destruction of the shark he venture on his research vessel Belafonte to document this feat. Before embarking Steve Zissou comes across Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), who presents himself as his unknown son. After joining ""Team Zissou"", which amongst others include second-in-command Klaus Daimler (Willem Dafoe), his wife Eleanor (Anjelica Huston), Sikh cameraman Vikram Ray (Waris Ahluwalia) and a host of unpaid college interns. Accompanying them is journalist Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett), come to chronicle the ill-fated voyage. Their direst foe is Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum), the current golden boy of the oceanographic community, currently going from success to success.An almost peremptory respect for Wes Anderson is almost expected from movie aficionados, but despite best intent almost every watching of quirkiness heavy and goofy populated universes of the director invariably are irritable due to the unconvincing absurdist humour, self-referential love affair with his own on-screen weirdness. Practically the only occasion where the much loved Bill Murray is entirely unwatchable. Eccentricity of characters often feels like the sole idea for plotting in an Anderson movie, making audiences interested in something other than quack-pots with odd posturing, reactions and logic detach themselves from any viewing pleasure. Giving Wes Anderson every chance in the world to catch on only one or two pictures made by him have turned out to be watchable, while the remainder seemed like senseless homework for cinephiles. ""The Aquatic Life of Steve Zissou"" sadly falls into the latter pool of Anderson movies.At times surrealist, at times cartoonish, including a plastic underwater world populated by colourful and odd creatures. Overly forced, partially plot less (albeit this is something of a norm for Wes Anderson) the feature has an artificial feel which permeates throughout, while personally vexatious characters make the viewing pleasure even more questionable. The deadpan delivery of jokes isn't as cool as Wes Anderson believes them to be, instead with each new movie feels increasingly fixed in mannerism.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
50,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou""- A whimsical, sometimes pretentious, but always charming and fantastical slice of life.",8,29 June 2017,"Loosely inspired by the life of famed scientist, conservationist and oceanic explorer Jacques Cousteau, director Wes Anderson's whimsical comedic drama ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" has gone on to gain an ever-growing cult-audience in the thirteen years that have passed since its initial release. And for good reason- this is an endlessly ambitious and exceedingly well made work of art despite its inconsistencies and an occasional bit of pretentiousness that crops in now and again. It's thoroughly charming with a great dry wit and some wonderful characters to explore, set to a fascinating and very fantastical backdrop. I've always had something of a love- hate relationship with Anderson. I highly admire the man and adore his work on certain levels, even when more often than not I find his films to be a bit too tediously in love with themselves and overwrought. The man is without doubt a genius, and I think my feelings are a good reflection of that... even when I don't like his films personally due to my own issues with them, I still can love and appreciate their intentions.""The Life Aquatic"" is most certainly one of Anderson's more peculiar works- which is not small feat. It follows the titular Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), an oceanographer and documentary filmmaker whose life has hit a bit of a rough patch- not helped by the fact that during the filming of his most recently movie, his friend and colleague Esteban was killed by a mysterious beast described as a ""Jaguar Shark."" He vows that his next documentary will focus on his hunt for the shark, especially after members of the public question whether or not Esteban was really killed or if the entire situation was faked. (""But what would be the scientific purpose of killing it?""; ""...revenge?"") And so, the film follows his newest voyage, and focuses on the interpersonal relationships between Zissou and the members of his crew, including his estranged wife (Angelica Huston), a reporter who has come to document his latest journey (Cate Blanchett) and a young pilot named Ned who may or may not be his long-lost son, played wonderfully by Owen Wilson.The film is a powerhouse of keen visual storytelling and subtle, dry humor and grounded drama that lends it a great deal of quirky atmosphere while also maintaining a surprisingly heartfelt and realistically emotional core. The film is overtly stylized in virtually every capacity... from a wonderful series of visual sequences where we see the entirety of the ship opened up from the side like a dollhouse, to the inclusion of old-school claymation to bring to life the magical ocean creatures that Steve encounters, to very deliberate caricature performances from several supporting players... Anderson is creating a brand new world with this film (much as he does with all of his movies) that seems to exist in a similar but just slightly more cartoonish reality compared to our own. And yet, you can relate to it because he finds a proper balance in his handling of the world-building. As much as it is detached from our own perception of the ""real world""... you still can still buy into the film because he never goes too far and keeps its heart in the right place with drama seeped in realism.And that's where the film really shines. With its magnificent and expansive cast of characters, who are all given career-defining performances by their respective performers in my opinion, and sharp writing that really seems to understand the human condition, you can't help but be fully absorbed in each moment. This is at its heart a delightful and oft-dramatic slice of life picture and a great study of the interpersonal relationships between troubled and sometimes even jaded and damaged people. Each and every player has their part to play and all are expertly expanded on through the way they interact with others and how their feelings towards one another change over the course of the film. And everyone does an absolutely fabulous job with their performance. This is one of the finest ensemble casts I have ever seen assembled. I didn't even get to mention key supporting players such as Willem Dafoe or Jeff Goldblum, who have smaller but very important parts to play in the story.I do have to comment, though... I wouldn't call it a perfect film. It's perfectly watchable and perfectly engaging and entertaining. And I would consider it a personal favorite. But it's not a perfect film. Because like many of Anderson's other works, I can't help but have some significant issues with the various facets of the movie that do detract a small but notable bit of quality from the overall finished product. As often delightful as the proceedings can be, it too often feels like its too fascinated with its own world-building, to the point it borders on tedium in a few key moments. There's a bit too much... of everything at times. (I know that sounds strange, but it's just how I feel.) It can also occasionally go from the edge of artsy and unique to pretentious and overdone as well, leading to one or two moments where you'll your eyes rolling while you say to yourself ""Really?"" And that can detract from the otherwise excellent world-building and exploration of character.But that cannot stop an otherwise very fascinating and deceptively complex film. It's hilarious. It's poignant. It's wildly refreshing and incredibly ambitious. And it's just a darned fun movie all around. I give ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" a very good 8 out of 10 and give my whole-hearted recommendation.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

53,Cosmoeticadotcom,Mediocre,5,19 September 2008,"Screenwriter and film director Wes Anderson has made a career out of quirky films that have a rabid following, but offer little depth. He rarely pushes himself, and why his latest film, 2004's The Life Aquatic, With Steve Zissou was considered worthy of treatment by The Criterion Collection, which usually reserves its accolades for films of stature- both American and foreign, is a puzzle. Granted, they deemed Anderson's prior mediocre effort, The Royal Tenenbaums, and the 1998 mega-flop sci fi action flick Armageddon worthy of their treatment, but that still is not reason enough to justify this just under two hours long entry into their pantheon- the three hundredth title they've chosen. The film was co-written by another indy filmmaker, Noah Baumbach (The Squid & The Whale), but it's really just an excuse to gibe the film's star, Bill Murray, a reason to act like Bill Murray always does. It's a tossup between Murray, in his dryly sardonic roles, and Morgan Freeman, in his wise old Negro roles, as to which Hollywood actor more regularly phones in his performances. Bill Murray does not act, he simply exists as Bill Murray, whatever the character's name, and in film after film it gets a bit tiring seeing him do the same old tired schtick.The premise for the film is that Murray is Captain Steve Zissou, a Jacques Cousteau like TV and film documentary worker and oceanographer who contrives his shows with a preciousness that would make Cousteau or Mutual Of Omaha's Wild Kingdom host Marlin Perkins gag. He's fifty-two, has found out he has a thirty year old son named Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson- another one note actor) and just lost his co-host and best friend Esteban (Seymour Cassel) to the attack of a 'jaguar shark'. The rest of the cast is filled with similarly one dimensional characters who think that merely acting one dimensionally is funny. The Life Aquatic, With Steve Zissou is certainly not a bad film, merely a forgettable one, although it does have a few good moments, such as a late montage scene to the tune of The Zombies' The Way I Feel Inside. That that great, but neglected, 1960s pop band gets a nod in a film made now is almost enough for me to recommend this tepid offering, but not quite. While you may not be pulling your hair out over the condescending tone of the film, say like in Schindler's List, Crash, or Brokeback Mountain, at least those films garner intense reactions, however negative. The Life Aquatic, With Steve Zissou is a shrug and a yawn, and in a decade will be mostly forgotten. Whether its creator will be also is the real question, for 'hot, young directors' are like starlets to the studios that chew them up and spit them out. Anderson has talent, but he's yet to match his similarly named competitor, Paul Thomas Anderson, whose films like Boogie Nights and Magnolia, despite their flaws, are superior to anything Wes Anderson has wrought.Mainstreaming him might actually be a boon to Anderson, as long as he is willing to ferret out well written screenplays written by others. His distorting of reality into comedy can work, but in all of his films he's yet to have a single real or likable character emerge. This film seems to me to be the filmic equivalent of a good working first draft, but I was always wondering what it could have been had it been written by Terry Southern and directed by Stanley Kubrick, the duo who wrought the great Dr. Strangelove, which shares a similarly misanthropic and comic view of life. Regardless, The Life Aquatic, With Steve Zissou is potential without realization, sadly like most of its audience members. Perhaps that's the reason those eight people laughing do so without knowing why, and simply don't care.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
54,BrandtSponseller,"Maybe I just didn't get the film, but it didn't seem like there was much to get.",4,13 June 2005,"Reading through some of the discussions about liking or not liking The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, I have to cast my votes as follows: I have only seen one other film by director Wes Anderson--The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)--I loved it; I am a fan of dry humor, and have a dry sense of humor myself; While I like plenty of Hollywood films, I like plenty of other kinds of films too (just take a look at my reviews and ratings); I like character driven films, or films that are ""character studies"" just as much as plot driven films; Not everything has to be action with me; I love Owen Wilson; I love David Bowie; I like Bill Murray, Kate Blanchett, and Anjelica Huston; I'm not a big fan of Willem Dafoe or Jeff Goldblum, but neither of them are in the film very much; I'm also a big fan of surrealism.However, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou just wasn't funny to me. I didn't care for the writing--I couldn't become invested in these characters, I didn't think most of the dialogue was funny or clever or significantly unusual (the same goes for the plot). The performances mostly didn't work for me. It wasn't very surreal or even quirky to me, it was mostly just pretty bland--slow even. I did like some of the production design, including the cgi/stop-motion/composited stuff, and there were a couple sequences I enjoyed, but that was about it.Bill Murray is an oceanographer and documentary filmmaker named Steve Zissou. The script implies that he was very successful at one point, but those years are mostly past him. When the film opens, we watch a theatre crowd watching the premier of Zissou's last film, ""The Life Aquatic: Part 1"". It gets a polite response. In the film, a ""jaguar shark"" supposedly eats one of Zissou's crew.During a question and answer session, Zissou says that Part 2 of The Life Aquatic will entail the Zissou crew hunting down and destroying the shark that ate the crewmember. This doesn't go over so well. It is felt that Zissou should not kill what might be an endangered species.So Zissou has trouble finding financial backers. Meanwhile, Ned Plimpton (Wilson) has shown up, saying that he's Zissou's son. Ned ends up using inheritance money to help fund the next expedition, but it's obvious everything is going to pot. Zissou's ship is in bad shape. His marriage is on the rocks. A ""bond stooge"" representing the other financial backers has to tag along. Zissou has been forbidden to kill the jaguar shark. The crew turns out to be not so expert after all, and a magazine writer with a chip on her shoulder about Zissou is accompanying the expedition for an article.In many ways, The Life Aquatic seems like something of a tribute to Jacques Cousteau. Many aspects of Zissou, his crew, his career, and so on are similar to Cousteau, although he's certainly a less successful and less capable version of that famed oceanographer and documentarian. But The Life Aquatic doesn't exactly feel like a spoof.Not that it would have to be a spoof, a satire, or even funny to be successful. However, comedy or not, the story and performances just didn't click for me. I'm not sure I know why they didn't click, but here are some things I suspect: The majority of the plot is announced within the first ten minutes--we're basically told the gist of the film, as well as the ending, right off the bat. Additionally, various other plot points are telegraphed in a manner that people always say they hate when it comes to Hollywood films. For example, the statement that ""those are unprotected waters"" is a red flag that something is going to happen in those waters, as is the fact that there's a mechanical problem during the first flight of the helicopter, the statement that Zissou's wife Eleanor (Huston) is the ""brains of the operation"", and so on. All of these elements unfold in a fairly predictable manner. Not that I mind predictability, necessarily, but this is a film championed for its ""un-Hollywood"" plot. I didn't see that.Next, the performances tended to seem affected to me. A lot of the cast sounded like they were reading lines instead of saying them. Everyone felt like they were acting, not like they were the characters. Again, those things do not always bother me, but this is a film often credited with great acting, deep characterization and so on. Besides the ""un-Hollywood"" plot, characterization and performance are supposed to be the big draws here. That's because there's not much else to the film, except for a few nice computer-composited, colorful underwater shots, and a few nice computer-composited, colorful shots of imaginary marine life.There were a number of other elements that just stumped me. Why is the soundtrack full of Bowie songs, and why does that one crew member keep playing Bowie songs on an acoustic guitar while singing them in Portuguese? It's not that I dislike Bowie. As I mentioned, I'm a big fan. I just don't get why the songs are in the film. Surely, they're not supposed to be funny, are they? Is it just that Anderson wanted some bitchin' tunes for the film and he likes Bowie a lot, too? Kinda like it's scored with a mix tape that he'd play for you if you were driving with him in his car? Even though there were a couple good sequences--a hijacking, a rescue, a crash and its aftermath--and I loved the obvious studio cutaway ship interior, those weren't enough to recommend the film.

You'd expect with it's great talented cast that it would be really funny. It had it's occasional funny moments. But overall, I found it slow, occasionally boring, and well, that's it.Wes Anderson is a talented director and these are some very talented actors. Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Anjelica Huston(of course cause it's a Wes Anderson film), Michael Gambon, Jeff Goldblum and there may be others. I rented it years ago thinking this will be good. Good cast, sounds kind of funny. Well, it's not what I expected. I guess I was the only one disappointed. Maybe if I watch it again soon I might change my opinion. Otherwise, well, my opinion stays. Anderson does what he usually does. He makes a weird film. In the climax of the film, there are some really weird looking animated fish.The film is about an underwater explorer named Steve Zissou(played by Bill Murray). He decides to seek revenge against a shark that killed his partner many years ago. So Steve rounds up a group of people, including his ex-wife(played by Anjelica Huston) to help him.I didn't dislike the film that much. It just wasn't what I expected. I expected a hilarious movie. The film is long. But I will admit that I laughed. And it is kind of interesting. So I can't give it my entire thumbs down. Just can't give it my entire thumbs up.

56,lambiepie-2,"An Experiment in ""Charmingly Bizare""",8,3 December 2005,"I had NO idea what to expect with this film. Bill Murray's choice of roles of late have been a great outlook into what happens when a silly young comedian turns into a thinking man's adult comedian. And this film is no exception.Make no mistake, ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" is an unusual film. But that is just what I adore. Also, I was a child growing up watching (not because I always WANTED to) ""Jacques Cousteau"" - and many of us lay people have no clue about nature documentaries - which is probably why this film is indeed charming to me. This is not a slap-happy comedy, or not even black comedy - it's a dry comedy. There are funny parts everyone can get, others seem like an ""inside industry joke"" that unless you like the aforementioned items I listed, you might not ""get it"".So with my pre-disposition to Marine Biology, Oceanography, documentary Film Making, niche journalism and campy ""poor man's Dynasty"" type soap opera, I really enjoyed this film. All of those elements are there. What I enjoyed the MOST was the Portguese renditions of David Bowie Songs that moved the story along and told the story at the same time.The International cast was interesting, William DaFoe was down right against type hilarious. Bizarre, strange, fun and charming all fit for this film. If you can remember the ""Jaques Cousteau"" days and notice this may be quite the little hat's off/send up of those days and you might just like the ""Life Aquatic"" too.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
57,film-critic,"In twelve years, the baby will be eleven and a half.",9,12 January 2005,"What a stunning body of work Wes Anderson has created. I will be honest, when I first saw the previews to this film I was worried that Anderson may have gone the way of so many other directors who have developed their name in Hollywood. Art is replaced by money, which is replaced by angry fans. I saw the CGI fish and began to feel a sweat break with nervousness. Will he be able to continue the humor from Bottle Rocket, the darkness of Rushmore, as well as the ensemble connectedness from The Royal Tennanbaums? Well, folks, I am here to announce that he has taken the Hollywood money and has not veered too far off his signature course. I always imagine Anderson's work as a very dry martini. His humor, the most intelligent work I have seen in a long time, is like the liquid itself, creating this bold texture while packing a powerful emotional punch. The olives are the cast, giving just some extra to nibble on while you enjoy the entire drink. Place these elements together, the drink and olives, and you have The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.To begin with, this film would not have worked without anyone else in the lead than Bill Murray. His ability to contain himself while also giving us the emotional stress of being a first-time dad as well as loosing his best friend is Oscar worthy. He is the perfect guide for our trip, giving us that knowledgeable laugh as well as those sympathetic eyes that seem to shout, ""Everything will work out"". He is bold and smooth as both the Captain of the vessel as well as learning the tricks of being a father. His ability to deliver his lines was both crucial and beautifully timed giving us just enough to make us fall in love with him by the end of the film. Coupled with his amazing performances is the work of everyone else involved. Willem Dafoe proves that he can handle any role, big or small, and make it very memorable. My favorite character during this voyage was Cate Blanchett's role that nearly stole the show from Murray. Her multi-depth character gave us just the distraction that we needed to see the power of the father/son relationship. Her quirks take us deep into the human soul and give us a mother's perspective to this mission. It is a beautiful counter to Murray's passive/aggressive father figure. Goldblum is quickly becoming a favorite actor of mine, while Huston proves that she still has the ability inside of her. Both of these guys need to see more work. The rest of the eclectic cast ranges from the hilarious ""interns"" to the melancholy songs of David Bowie (see if you can spot them!). Even Noah Taylor (of Vanilla Sky fame) turned out a stunning performance. The cast shines through beautifully, playing off each other, giving us some of the best performances of the year.I will admit, Anderson's comic narrative will leave this dry taste in your mouth, but for me it was a great experience. His humor is dry, his films are dry, but that is what makes him different than others in his field. He gives us those long pauses and obscure references that will either force you to think or create frustration because you do not understand his meaning. I have grown up on his films since seeing Bottle Rocket, and I love the way this man creates. One of my favorite lines and scenes in this film that I have raved to everyone as the epitome of an Anderson film was when Zissou first takes Ned to the island and Eleanor tells Steve that one of his cats died. After some banter, Ned asks what type of cat it was. Zissou replies ""Who cares. A tabby I think"" which isn't funny at first, but then you realize that all he has on the island are Siamese cats, which only make me laugh harder in my seat. That is Wes Anderson humor, and it works perfectly for me. His ability to create these challenging characters and put them in situations that I never saw coming (the ""pirates"" scene being one of them) was outstanding. It felt as if he was throwing his crew into different troubles daily who in turn produced some of the best work ever. Only Wes Anderson could create beauty out of chaos.My fear of the CGI was muted immediately when I saw that Anderson used the technique to create some of the most imaginative creatures ever to lurk in the sea impressed me. He didn't use it as a central focus of the film (until the end), and used it sporadically so that it really didn't feel as if it was being used. The creatures that he created are so bold and colorful that skillfully he uses them to counter the life of Zissou, which seems be getting darker by the day. This contrast allowed me to see deeper into Murray's character and root for his misadventures throughout the entire film.Overall, I was very impressed. I know that not many enjoyed this picture as much as his previous works, but for me it was a fresh chapter with a stellar cast. Anderson is slowly changing the face of cinema, and soon others will follow trying to recreate his award winning voice, but will not succeed. This man is in the same boat as Gondry, Coppola, Jonez, and Kaufman. These are the imaginative thinkers of Hollywood that continually break the mold and open the doors to new possibilities.Grade: ***** out of *****",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

It's really the same with The Life Aquatic. It's just not very funny. Or maybe I'm just not getting the funny bits.I was actually pretty excited going into the movie, but very quickly I felt bored. And the fact that the movie lasts for two hours only increased my tedium. The entire last 45 minutes were very hard to sit through. To me, this is just material that almost completely fails to deliver. Sure, there are funny bits here and there. And I really liked Cate Blanchett in this movie. It did build up a unique atmosphere which sort of grew on you. But it was nowhere near enough. The whole thing was too low-key. Some half-assed parody stretched out for two hours with far too little meat on its bones to sustain that kind of length.

I don't care if it didn't do well at the Box Office. But it is a cool movie. Takes place in exotic locations, the ocean, and almost all the sea animals are done in pastel stop motion.

61,TOMASBBloodhound,Had potential but delivered few laughs.,5,6 July 2005,"Bill Murray in a recent interview admitted that this shoot was a painful experience. It shows. This Wes Anderson film tries to capture the same feeling of The Royal Tenenbaums, but fails to deliver laughs or develop what could have been an interesting story. Murray had a tiny roll in Tenenbaums, but here he is forced to carry a film by playing a major part that is completely wrong for him. The Steve Zissou character is an angry jerk most of the time. Murray has played self-centered characters before, but he has always been allowed to add his own sarcastic charm and usually made the character likable in the process. Here he just isn't funny, and the film ends up feeling like an unfocused pot-induced fantasy.There are plenty of famous faces in this cast. Owen Wilson plays the straight man (Ned) who may or may not be Steve's long lost son. Cate Blanchette plays a pregnant journalist whom both Steve and Ned have feelings for. Willem Dafoe plays one of Steve's associates. He's given a German accent, but little of note to do. Michael Gambon, Bud Cort, Jeff Goldbloom, and Anjelica Houston also appear and disappear when needed. None of these people did anything to enhance their careers by showing up in this film.The film is art-house all the way. Nothing wrong with that, but this time it didn't work. I would have liked to have seen what an Ivan Reitman or a Harold Ramis could have done with this story and a re-write for Murray's character. Wes Anderson seems very intent on focusing on his dysfunctional characters and their quirks rather than on pacing or story development. The majority of the animal life we see is computer-generated, but pleasant to look at. Mark Mothersbaugh's musical score takes us back to the days of DEVO, and is at times more distracting than anything else. The action scenes are intentionally hokey.Overall, this film is probably not worth your time. If you are looking for a combination of Bill Murray and laughter, try Stripes, Quick Change, Caddyshack, Groundhog Day.... you name it. The Life Aquatic is better left to those who would prefer to discuss the dis-functionality of the characters and the use of color over a $7.00 cup of coffee after a film school class.I'll give it 5 of 10 stars since Murray was such a trooper and stuck with it until the end.The Hound.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
62,cultfilmfan,The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,7,7 February 2005,"The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, is about an oceanographer who makes documentary movies named Steve Zissou. The film opens and Steve, and his crew have just premiered another one of their documentaries. While making the film Steve's crew member and best friend was killed by a shark and for their next documentary Steve, plans to find the shark and kill it. At the premiere Steve, meets a man named Ned Plimpton, who thinks that Steve, may be his father. Ned joins Steve's team of oceanographers and documentary filmmakers which includes a bunch of very different crew members who all live on Steve's ship The Belafonte. Soon a pregnant journalist named Jane Winslett Richardson, comes aboard to write an article about Steve, and many other things happen in the movie such as the hunt for the shark, being attacked over unprotected waters and finding out what being a father means. All this happens around a very odd crew and ship including a script girl who walks around topless most of the time and a man who plays guitar and sings David Bowie songs in Portugese. The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everybody involved (especially Bill Murray, who plays Steve Zissou), good original music, good cinematography, good production design and good art direction. The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, is directed and co-written by Wes Anderson, who has given us such films as Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, with Rushmore being my personal favourite. While not being as good as Rushmore, I still enjoyed the film. The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, is slow moving and it's humour is very dry and the film will definitely not appeal to everybody. I have read countless reviews and things about the movie mentioning people leaving the theater and the person I saw the film with was not impressed. I liked the film however. It was unique, original, has some interesting characters, entertaining, has some very nice animated sequences, is a good character study and the film has a lot of scenes that were very well done. Some of these scenes really made the movie a lot more to me than it was and these scenes will stick with me. I also like that although the movie is released by a big budget company and has big budget actors that it does not have a mainstream Hollywood script full of familiar clichés. It is unpredictable and wild and I liked it for that. And, Bill Murray delivers another award worthy performance as Steve Zissou, who even when he is not talking Bill Murray, conveys the thoughts of this character just by looking into the camera a certain way. A very unique and entertaining film while not for everybody.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
63,gregsrants,"OK, but not recommended",5,28 December 2004,"Every once and a while I come across a film that I give a favorable review, but by no means encourage others to see. I harken back to Gaspar Noé's, Irreversible in 2002 as an example. The movie was a backwards-shot thriller where the boyfriend of a murdered companion seeks the identity and revenge on the killer in France. A hard sit through to be sure, the movie was an interesting character study that was overshadowed by a violent gut turning opening scene and the depiction of a rape that was shot in uncut brutal realism. During the screening, about half the theatre patrons left before the film was over (most during the rape scene) and never got to enjoy the film as a whole despite its uncomfortable moments.I remember leaving the theatre thinking that the movie was a little above average (I gave the film the benefit of a three star rating) but I in no way was parading the film at the water cooler the next day. I knew the two scenes as vaguely described above would not be for 95% of the tastes out there and I sure as hell didn't want to send people into a theatre for two hours of bum shifting and Timex watching.Although Irreversible and the new Wes Anderson film, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou have about as much in common as I do with Brad Pitt, they are similar in the way that I enjoyed both, but basically have to keep my recommendation to myself. Let me explain.Probably the most important thing that I can tell you about The Life Aquatic is that it is both written and directed by Wes Anderson whose last two films were Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums. Both those films, more specifically the latter, were sprinkled with Hollywood talent  Gene Hackman, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Danny Glover, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Stiller  but failed to connect with audiences and provide box office platinum (Tenenbaums maxed out at about $50 million). These films were both interesting character studies that were a little too quirky and with too much humor under the radar to be accepted by mass audiences. In summary, they are the kind of films that end up showing on the IFC channel a few years after being ignored on video shelves.The Life Aquatic does follow in the casting tradition of The Royal Tenenbaums. The movie houses such talent as Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson and Jeff Goldblum and puts them in a film that was like taking The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai, Tenenbaums, Napoleon Dynamite and Roger Corman and putting them into a blender with a father and son coming together story.The story itself is very interesting. On paper. Bill Murray is Steve Zissou, a Jacques Cousteau type filmmaker whose friend and partner was eaten by a shark on their last expedition. Seeking revenge, Zissou assembles his aquatic team and begins to seek funding for his Charles Bronsonish type feelings.Enter one Ned Plimton (Owen Wilson) who reveals that he may or may not be Zissou's son. Possibly out of guilt, maybe out of parental responsibility but more likely due to Ned's useful inheritance, Steve takes Ned along on the journey that will include the robbing of rival scientists lab, pirates, a rescue operation that includes a shoot-out not requiring reloading and eventually the tracking of the shark initiated the expedition in the first place.But with all the distractions and sub-plots on top of sub-plots the essential story is the relationship between a father and a son who have not met in the 30 years of their dual existence. And it is here that Anderson is at his best. Murray and Wilson do have chemistry together as two people who want to believe they share a bond. When Steve initially shuns Ned's attempts to call him something along the line of 'dad', you can really feel the hurt in Ned's character and in contrast, you understand and share his elation when a compromise is met scenes later. It's these touching moments that give the film its heart.But heart alone does not make a complete film and despite efforts by the cast, the film never raises above mediocrity. It felt as if Anderson had a plethora of ideas that he was unable to fit into Tenenbaums and he threw them like pasta at the wall in Aquatic.Wes Anderson's characters have and will always been on the far side of quirky and that will always put him on the geek side of likability. My screening had a mixed bag of ages and any time a pocket would laugh at a scene, they quickly stymied their adulation as if they were embarrassed to be laughing at a joke no one else got.That is just the kind of reaction that an Anderson film will inject and that is why my so-so rating is not a recommendation.www.gregsrants.com",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

66,rainking_es,Bill Murray becomes Captain Cousteau...,5,24 October 2005,"Wes Anderson, such an imaginative guy with an endless capacity of creating weird characters, a good caricature-maker; but he's rather a second rate cinema director.In his previous movie ""The royal Tenenbaums"" he told the story of a family that formed by some failure gifted people. Now in ""The Life Aquatic"" we have this Cousteau-wannabe called Steve Zissou (Bill Murray, the god of sarcasm, just great!). Anderson creates his own Nautilus and lets everything go too far...""The Life Aquatic"" is a movie built by long sequences (like little sketches), and some of them are really brilliant, but that's not enough to fill a 120 minutes film. What's wrong with it? Well, the story, of course. And the script. Those are Wes Anderson's weak points: his narrations eventually don't catch the attention of the audience, and it's pretty difficult to achieve a nice result by the way of some gags (unless you're Grouche Marx or Woody Allen). Maybe if he counted on some good story-makers, good scripters he would become a great director. He would go from unimportant to important. He doesn't have a lack o brilliant and crazy ideas, and he usually chooses the best actors (Murray, Huston, Dafoe, Blanchett, Paltrow, Hackman...).So this film will make you laugh at some points, but it gets a little bit boring as a whole.

67,itamarscomix,"Bravo, Zissou!",9,31 December 2005,"With his third major motion picture, Wes Anderson proves that he still doesn't give a damn what anybody thinks about him. The Life Aquatic is as eccentric, fresh and original as Anderson's previous films  Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums  and for my money, it's also the most solid of the three. This time, Bill Murray, who played a supporting role in both those films, is given the lead. Murray, who  partly thanks to Anderson  transformed in recent years from semi-washed up comedian to independent cinema's sweetheart (through appearances in films including, other than Rushmore, Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation and Jim Jarmusch's Broken Flowers) creates one of the most wonderful characters of his career with celebrity undersea explorer Steve Zissou, clearly a tribute to the late Jacques Yves Cousteau, a classic anti-hero who is both despicable and absolutely lovable, which perfectly compliments Murray's renowned talents.Murray is not the only talent on board  The Life Aquatic boasts one of the most impressive ensemble casts seen in some time, one which includes Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett, among others, all of whom give knockout performances. The fantastic actors, though  all perfectly cast  are just one piece of the puzzle in Anderson's vision, and The Life Aquatic, underneath a somewhat chaotic and disorganized surface, is a solid and steady film that bears the signs of a complete and well-thought out piece, assembled in its entirety in Anderson's mind  from the highly stylized visuals, the often dated, even campy, but very aesthetic, special effects, including animated sea-life by grand master of claymation Henry Selick (James and the Giant Peach, The Nightmare Before Christmas), to the unpolished dialog, to the soundtrack, a large part of which being Portuguese versions of David Bowie songs, translated and performed by Seu George (City of God), who also plays in the film.The Life Aquatic is certainly not for everyone, and if you're looking for the Bill Murray of Caddyshack and Ghostbusters you'll be disappointed by the low joke ratio. If you enjoyed Anderson's previous works, by all means you should watch this one too. If you're open minded and are interested in cinema that is a little different, if you like directors like Terry Gilliam and the Coen Brothers, you should definitely give it a shot  maybe you won't get into the spirit of the thing, you might find it dumb and boring, but you should give it a shot  you may just find one of the freshest and most original films of the last few years.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
68,TheNorthernMonkee,"strange, surreal and brilliant",9,21 March 2005,"SPOILERS Wes Anderson is one of a current crop of young directors that stars literally queue up to work with. After obscure but equally superb films ""Rushmore"" and ""the Royal Tenenbaums"", Anderson's latest film ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is another wacky and wonderful creation. Tributing the works of legendary diver Jacques Cousteau, the film contains some brilliant acting performances and some surreal camera work, which is so good, that it's a wonder it isn't adopted more often.Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) is a film maker and head of Team Zissou. Travelling around the world's seas aboard his ship the Belafonte, Zissou and his intrepid team record the weirder parts of nature. After an incident with a Jaguar Shark however, Zissou sets off on one final mission with a desire for something less than scientific... revenge.After his phenomenal performance in ""Lost In Translation"", Bill Murray was too busy shooting this film to collect his BAFTA Award. Some might have questioned whether it was worth it, but with yet another truly amazing performance, Murray's dedication has paid off. He is simply outstanding in this film. Slowly loosing faith in his own skills and feeling distinctively less than popular, Murray's Zissou is an ageing man with little going for him. Partly down to the scripting, it was Anderson who actually wrote the role specifically with Murray in mind, and the two work brilliantly together to bring Zissou to life.As well as Murray's fine performance, ""The Life Aquatic"" is also pulled along by a remarkably straight performance from Owen Wilson. Still able to provide comedy at the right times, Wilson is restrained in his often over-jubilant personality. More of an internal being, Wilson's Ned Plimpton is considerably different to the usually 'cool' characters that Wilson puts charisma into. It's a change in style, and it's a change for the better.Also containing exquisite performances by Angelica Huston, Cate Blanchett, Michael Gambon, Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe, it's impossible to note a single flaw in the acting department of Anderson's latest feature.The reason Wes Anderson is such a popular director is not just down to an amazing script and his ability to get the best out of actors. The reason so many love this guy is because he comes up with some truly awesome camera work.In ""The Life Aquatic"", perhaps the two most beautiful sights are those of Anderson's sea life and life about the Belafonte. Creating a full size boat cut-section, Anderson is able to show characters walking from room to room, and the camera following them. The first vision of this idea is just so colourful and majestic that it is a beautiful technique which could do with more usage.The sea-life, like the Belafonte's internals, is also done using simplistic techniques. Rather than relying purely on genuine sea-life to be beautiful enough, what Anderson does is he adopts old style animation to create amazing sights. This is first evident when Zissou is given a unique seahorse as a present. Held in a clear bag of water, the seahorse is a multi-coloured piece of animation which would look at home in old children's films like ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" or ""Mary Poppins"". The animals are beautiful, and it was a masterstroke to have them animated rather than real.Finally, the other brilliant thing about ""The Life Aquatic"" is the soundtrack. Whilst occasional rock songs make their appearances, the vast majority of Anderson's soundtrack is one of two techniques. Firstly Anderson adopts very basic dance beats which are made using one or two repetitive beats. Suiting the mood perfectly, these tunes are often played at moments of bright colour.The second Anderson sound technique, and perhaps the most original sound in cinema for a long time, is achieved by the talents of Team Zissou member Pele dos Santos (Seu Jorge). Real life artist Jorge spends the majority of this film sat aboard the Belafonte playing his acoustic guitar. The genius however is that rather than playing an original piece, what Jorge has done is he has raided the collection of legendary musician David Bowie. Then, to add a unique spin to the idea, Jorge has translated the songs into Portuguese. What we receive in the end is a distinctively down to Earth feel with famous songs rejuvenated and marvellously placed into an already superb film.Wes Anderson is a director that countless actors would love to work with. A natural talent behind the camera, Anderson has been a success in the past, and he remains a success with this latest feature. There's little denying of the obscurity and general weirdness of ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"", with some amazing acting and some visual and sound touches of pure genius however, the film is well worth checking out.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

The whimsy and magical tones are simply ""gravy""!",10,7 March 2005,"I was kind of expecting one of those arty films that make you squirm a bit as you labor through it. I was pleasantly surprised! This was a great movie. I was entranced and entertained throughout. On top of being a great movie in and of itself, so to speak, it was also whimsical, and a bit of a fantasy, with a bit of the magical. I had read from critics I respect that it was a 'valiant try', but was a flop, at the end of the day. I know perceptions and opinions vary, and I am prepared to manage that. But oh my--- how could those critics have got it so wrong? 'The Life Aquatic...' is marvelous! The critics had not been overly kind to this film. Maybe they subconsciously felt that writer/director Wes Anderson had gotten enough praise and enough critical 'help' thus far in his career, and that somehow he was due for some comeuppance? Dunno... but I LOVED this movie.The casting was grand. I am not ordinarily a big fan of Bill Murray, but I liked him here. This was, in fact, the only movie in which I found him thoroughly likable, with the possible exception of 'Caddyshack'. I don't think he's the only person in the world who could have played an intriguing Steve Zissou--- picture Johnny Depp in the role??? Depp would also have good. Although Angelica Houston would then have been miscast as his wife, but hey. The way it was cast, with the super hot Cate Blanchett, the always likable Owen Wilson, and all the other quirky characters, played by such luminaries as Jeff Goldblum, Bud Cort, and Wilhem Dafoe--- was superb! One test for a movie's goodness is the watch test. During the film I never, not once, thought of the time, nor checked my watch. And when it was over, I was a tiny bit disappointed. Oh, I was satisfied enough, but I also wished for more. Like a great party that finally comes to an end. I gave this movie a well deserved 10 out of 10.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
71,Bolesroor,Perfection,10,6 November 2008,"""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" is a series of adventure films I grew up watching, and secretly I always wished I could be on Steve's team, asleep with the tranquility of the ocean floor or fighting for my life against a bloodthirsty jaguar shark. And with this brilliant movie, my dream finally came true...Bill Murray is the hero, the flawed leader of our crew, and if you ever wondered whether this hilarious performer could also act, could also move you emotionally, you are in for a wonderful surprise. Steve as an explorer is treading water; as a filmmaker he's washed-up, as a Father a washout. The only real reason for him to carry on is to seek revenge on the shark that killed his best friend. He'll hit the seas with his devoted crew for one last adventure...Director Wes Anderson is a god, or if not, well on his way to becoming one. ""The Life Aquatic"" is a wonderfully rich movie: a character study AND comedy AND adventure film with a heart that beats so loud you can hear it. Anderson constructs the fantasy of Steve Zissou so thoroughly he achieves reality... the ""Belafonte"" alone is jaw-dropping. The movie works on multiple levels at all times, and it always works. My favorite metaphor? Probably the skeptical audiences who judge Zissou's ""film"" at the beginning of the movie. But this is a movie too brilliant to review... it's just something you have to see for yourself. Bill Murray shines like a found diamond when given the chance to portray a three-dimensional human being... he is the heart of this masterpiece.Surely Wes Anderson is the architect... everything is beautifully realized, exquisitely designed.... I even loved the fact that he went with old-school stop-motion animation instead of slippery CGI. The man is a genius...""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" is a brilliant adventure and a beautiful film. When you're tired of torturing yourself with terrible movies it will be here... I promise.GRADE: A",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
72,lawprof,Somewhat of a Letdown,7,31 December 2004,"Bill Murray delivered one of the best performances of his outstanding career in ""Lost in Translation"" and I was primed for a reputedly even stronger one in ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou."" Instead I found a strong cast in a muddled story that reflects director Wes Anderson's indecision as to whether the film was to be a comedy, a fantasy or a serious look at relationships.Murray as deep sea explorer Steve Zissou is nearing the end of his long-running global, big celebrity popularity as a faux Cousteau. And there are plenty of references, verbal and physical, to the late, great scientist. There's a Moby Dick element, off center really, to the story as Zissou is bankrolled to find a near mythical shark that devoured his long-time partner and closest friend. ""Revenge"" is Zissou's one word explanation and justification for hunting down and killing a sea creature. Not PC, of course.Oh, and Zissou is also a Bob Ballard-type employing technology to search the ocean depths, here a motley mishmash of put-together-in-a-hurry tools. His ship's shop is a caricature rather than a clever send-up of the dependence on advances in extreme ocean-exploring technology that frequently highlight documentaries shown over and over again on cable.Anjelica Huston is fine as Zissou's still suffering but relentlessly supportive ex-wife. Owen Wilson as Zissou's possibly own son, the product of a long-ago liaison, is an act that straddles the extended adolescent romantic and the second banana buffoon. An actually very pregnant Cate Blanchett is a reporter running away from a bad situation as a married man's girlfriend. She's confused as well she should be. What is she doing with this madcap outfit? Blanchett gives her role her customary all (could she ever do less?) but she's wasted here.William Dafoe is first-mate, a funny but capable chap who hungers for Zissou's approval. He's funny but his interaction with both Murray and Wilson smacks mainly of a sitcom shtick.The romantic relationships here aren't interesting or even marginally funny, they're tedious.Murray has the ability unsurpassed by any other actor to project a knowing weariness at the vicissitudes of life, the central emotional outpouring that made ""Lost in Translation"" shine. Here the weariness seems to be due to having to deal with rapidly shifting tempi that reflect a confusing and, ultimately, unsatisfying tale.There are funny moments in ""The Life Aquatic..."" but the whole never equals the value of its too many discrete parts. Ultimately one word describes the film: camp.And finally in the end titles, the producer must have belatedly been informed that there's a real Steve Zissou who is acknowledged as a New York lawyer specializing in ""complex litigation."" Actually he practices criminal law in Queens, New York where there are lots of those cases, few of them complex. But it's never admitted that a Steve Zissou, deceased, a devoted Cousteau protégé, remains a stridently debated character in the annals and journals of ichthyology because of his early Sixties claim to have discovered the upstate New York spawning ground of the gefilte fish.Murray can do so much better and I hope he will soon.7/10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

74,movieguy1021,The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou: 9/10,9,28 December 2004,"Wes Anderson, Alexander Payne, Paul Thomas Anderson, they're all in the new wave of young directors with a few quality films under their respective belts. They have respect all around the world, and don't regress into the ""churn at least one or two out every year"" phase some directors are in now. The most unique voice out of those three is Wes Anderson, truly a love-him-or-hate-him director. It's probably about even, the number of people who loved The Royal Tenenbaums versus the number that hated it. Barely anyone saw Bottle Rocket, and an unfortunate few saw Rushmore. For the past three years, Anderson has been working on The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. When seeing the trailer, the same reactions-love or hate-prevailed. I couldn't wait to see it, and it turns out I survived the wait for a good reason.Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) is a Jacques Cousteau-ish oceanographer whose crew member, in the process of filming their latest documentary, is eaten by a mysterious ocean animal, dubbed the Jaguar Shark. Team Zissou, which includes Klaus Daimler (Willem Dafoe), his wife Eleanor (Anjelica Huston), and a man who might be his son (Owen Wilson). As they go out on the open seas, Zissou's rival Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) tries to catch Zissou in his unlawful ways (as it's illegal to kill that shark).There's a certain style that Anderson has in his movies. It's like this surreal world where crazy things can happen, yet everything is still in today's timeframe, similar to Tenenbaums and its lack of a location (375th St. YMCA?). Anything can happen. The sets are wonderful-instead of tricking the audience into believing it's a real ship, we see the camera pan throughout, much like a stage set. Any animation is claymation (colorful claymation, I might add). The whole movie is wonderfully visual. And, as is the norm for every quirky movie of recent years, there has to be at least one moments that's extremely beautiful. In Tenenbaums, I'd say it's the final scene, as the camera pans to everyone coming to terms with everything that has happened. In Garden State, it's the scene with ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" playing. And in The Life Aquatic, I'd say that it's probably the end, when they're all in the submarine. The anticipation of two hours, and great music playing in the background, with stunning visuals-how can you not like it? Although The Life Aquatic isn't as character driven as, say, Tenenbaums, that's not to say that the characters aren't quirky or anything like that. There's Pele (Seu Jorge), who just sings David Bowie songs in Portuguese (and barely anything else). Dafoe's Klaus is definitely the greatest character in the movie. You don't expect Dafoe to be able to pull off comedy at all, but he's the funniest character of all. You wouldn't expect him to pull off a German(ish) accent well at all, either. But it works. And there's the rest of the crew of the ship, who aren't really recognizable. But this is definitely Murray's movie. He's in almost every scene, he has some of the best lines, the weirdest character, everything. Murray's a great comedian, and his deadpan performance (somewhat similar to Raleigh St. Clair in Tenenbaums) adds to the movie a lot.I admire Anderson (and his new co-writer, Noah Baumbach) for being completely off the wall here, and stepping into action-movie territory (""We call them pirates out here""), completely randomly. But that's where I have my one complaint. Maybe it's just that Anderson and Baumbach were getting used to each other or something, but the story meanders somewhat. Throughout about an hour in the middle of the movie, the Jaguar Shark is not mentioned at all. It seems like the movie just has a completely different mission in the middle, and it's like a slap in the face when the plot comes back to it towards the end. But The Life Aquatic is very funny, nonetheless. The humor's not as quirky as Tenenbaums or Rushmore, so it's more accessible, and there's some truly funny stuff in here. Everything mixed together becomes one of the best movies of 2004. One that no one should pass by.My rating: 9/10 Rated R for language, some drug use, violence and partial nudity.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
75,WriterDave,I'm just about getting sick of these dolphins...,7,8 June 2005,"Wes Anderson is one of those directors so strange and quirky it's almost to the point of annoyance. Almost. After watching ""The Life Aquatic"" I thought to myself, well, that was different. Then I started reading some of the quotes on-line and I began to laugh out loud. That's the thing about a Wes Anderson movie, it's often more funny in concept and thought than in actual execution. This is why he seems to rely so much on comedic aesthetics (the fantastically detailed awfulness of the set designs, the eclectic music scores) than on actual story and character development (something that made his near masterpiece ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" so rich and enjoyable). Here's the pitch on this one: I mean seriously, now, who wouldn't want to see a movie with Bill Murray as an underwater oceanographer on the trail of the jaguar shark that ate his best friend? The execution is another thing. With some hilarious set pieces and stingingly deadpan dialogue dispersed throughout, this one ends up being a sappy little trifle about family (just like all his other films in one way or another). How sweet. Now give us something new next time, Mr. Anderson.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
76,EmperorNortonII,Anderson and Murray's Quirky Odyssey,8,19 February 2005,"""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" is the latest movie directed by Wes Anderson, and stars Bill Murray in the title role. Zissou is an oceanographer patterned after Jacques-Yves Cousteau, a has-been with a quest for revenge. After his partner was killed by the jaguar shark, he goes after the beast with murder on his mind. Following him is his faithful crew, which includes a perennially topless script girl, a Brazillian safety expert who sings David Bowie in Portuguese, his possible illegitimate son (played by Owen Wilson), and two camera-sporting dolphins. The story is strange and fun, and one facet is the marine life seen. Henry Selick takes the prize here, using stop-motion animation to bring such fictional creatures to life as the sugar crab, the crayon ponyfish and the backflip frog. Call it ""Moby Dick"" on acid! ""The Life Aquatic"" is more than just a sea cruise, it's an adventure!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
77,Horror-yo,"Pleasant though slow viewing, does not leave one indifferent",7,3 May 2019,"If you know Wes Anderson by now, you'll understand exactly where this movie comes from. This here is an adventure full of twists and turns, which goal is to find a mythical shark but is of course all about the humane journey. As typically for a Wes Anderson film, there is the older father figure and the rivalling young buck, and a distinguished British-accented female lead character right in the middle of it all. As typically, despite certainly not being uneventful the film is however slow, some longer films feel like a quick 2 hours, this one feels like a long two hours. It's intentionally steady with its pace, not necessarily to a fault but it definitely feels like a film created by a very subjective, particular mind that's going to do things a certain way and not concede an inch at that.Besides the pace, the deliberately long dialogue scenes, slow transitioning... the soundtrack is also very peculiar as always (here a brand of minimalist clicky electronic music with certain melody, at times melancholic), and the choice of actors is quite interesting: Bill Murray with not his first lead role for Anderson plays an atypical role yet again for the director, while Owen Wilson may surprise quite a few as the earnest, simple southern youngster. Of course funny 'guest appearances' like Jeff Goldblum or Anjelica Huston or interesting additions like Seu Jorge (the Brazilian black singer/guitarist) make for extra sparky flavor. Willem Dafoe (German guy) is also a regular for director WA and brings his own special presence and bit of oddness to the whole. Another unorthodox choice here is the decision to go for stop motion animation for the sea creatures, in 2004 when CGI was obviously decent for such big budget productions, clearly an aesthetic choice to render the visuals more dream-like and imaginative rather than the colder 3D CGI. The directing is of course the star of the show with Anderson's usual technical prowess, here the long takes with multiple rooms with different characters in the same scene scrolling up and down the ship within seconds one to the next. There is a strong emphasis on establishing an atmosphere of dull banality throughout, for e.g. the crew's documentary videos are pretty awful in production, and Murray's expressions (the main character therefor the thermometer) have a very narrow range whether he's just walking ahead or emotionally distraught. There's definitely a willingness to slow down the pace, and for the atmosphere to feel purposely ordinary or anti-heroic even.The dialogue is good and rather supports the entire movie as there are few pure action scenes and it is about two hours long, and despite there being a definite musical identity and presence in this film the general tone is dialogue-based. There may be a considerable amount of dynamic movement but the dialogue and interaction between the characters are consistently in the foreground.All in all, it holds up fairly well, as mentioned there's some interesting/unusual directing to look at, a bit of rare fun to be had, good acting on display and a story that somehow feels both pleasant and long. It's definitely not for everyone, and the magnitude in ratings seems quite strong - some feel it's an unprecedented masterpiece, others it's a complete waste of time, not easy to find a middle ground it would seem.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
78,MichaelMargetis,The Extremely Neurotic Yet Touchingly Hilarious New Black Comedy from Wes Anderson!,8,14 May 2005,"Whenever you go see a Wes Anderson picture you know it's going to be offbeat. He steers clear of mainstream projects, and succeeds in bringing you neurotic yet quality entertainment. His last film, 'The Royal Tenenbaums' was a brilliant achievement and the one that preceded that, 'Rushmore' was really nothing more than mediocre achievement. Anderson's newest flick 'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou' starring recent Academy Award Nominee Bill Murray, kind of falls in between 'Tenenbaums' and 'Rushmore' in quality. Well, okay it was way closer to 'The Royal Tenenbaums' in quality then 'Rushmore', but you understand what I'm trying to say. It's way more energetic and engrossing then the snorer 'Rushmore', but it doesn't come close to the excellence of 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. 'The Life Aquatic' is a great film, and perhaps the most original and peculiar film of 2004, but it just wasn't as great as I expected it to be. You see, Anderson's films were getting better and better as he progressed as a filmmaker, and 'Life Aquatic' is a little step down from his last project. Although I was a little disappointed, that's not to say I didn't fully enjoy this thrillingly alive and wholly original dark comedy from one of the most talented independent filmmakers working in the industry today.The story follows deep-sea explorer and documentary filmmaker, Steve Zissou (Bill Murray -- in a role very similar to his role, Raleigh St. Clair, in 'The Royal Tenenbaums'). Zissou is an odd fellow to say the least, and he explores the sea with his crew and best friend and colleague, Esteban du Plantier (Seymour Cassell). During filming a documentary about a jaguar shark, something goes terribly wrong and Esteban gets eaten by the shark. Zissou is saddened and angry by this, and forms a mission with the other crew members and his newly discovered son, Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) to find the shark that ate Esteban and kill it to get revenge. It's a wacky plot, and really only those with an open mind will be able to follow it all the way through.Cate Blanchett co-stars as a reporter writing a story on Zissou who joins their revenge voyage, so does Angelica Houston as Zissou's estranged wife. Willem Dafoe is hilarious as one of Zissou's crew members (he steals a lot of scenes), and Jeff Goldblum is convincing as a cut-throat millionaire who rivals Zissou. Owen Wilson is funny as Zissou's son with a southern accent, but the whole show belongs to Murray. He does such an extraordinary job in this movie. It's a surprise he wasn't nominated for at least a Golden Globe Award, because the actor never ceases to be funny in his role. Bud Cort, Michael Gambon and Seu Jorge (a Portguese actor who portrayed Knockout Ned in the indie smash hit from Brazil 'City of God') also co-star. The film's screenplay is for the most part incredible, and Wes Anderson's direction is nothing short of first-rate. Most of the film flows well, but the ending is extremely confusing (I won't spoil it for you.)In conclusion, 'The Life Aquatic' is definitely worth renting and buying. It's a great film, it's just not quite an excellent one. It may be too strange for most people, but those who like strange films will certainly enjoy this feature. I highly recommend picking up 'Life Aquatic' your next trip to the videostore, despite it's flaws. Grade: B+",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
79,loganx-2,"""Be Still Cody""",10,12 June 2008,"This is Wes Anderson's greatest departure from realism and into the realm of the fantastic. From the ""crayon pony-fish"", the Jaque Costeau outfits, the Mark Mothersbaugh(of Devo) pop song selection, the David Bowie songs in Portuguese, to the literally yellow submarine, we are granted a trip with a bygone hero on his last mission of revenge, love, family, and tragedy. The tone here is much more darkly and childlike, but the characters maintain their trademark Anderson deadpan sensibilities and sharp/awkward wit. What disappoints so many about this film, is that there is'nt an easy resolution. Paradoxically more than any other Anderson film this is his most fantastical and fatalistic. Steve Zissou learns all of his most important lessons far too late to do anything about them, there's a kind of division between the character and his life(the title after all is ""The Life Aquatic...with Steve Zissou), where like so many Henry James characters Steve just can't get himself together, can't catch the fish, can't get the girl, can't make the movie, and even as his long lost son is returned to him, his wife abandons him, and his financiers all but cut him off, he still can't get out of ""why me?"". For all it's rainbow claymation fish, and clever musical samplings the end is straight outta ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzia(an 80's film about superhero who was kind of the ultimate man), it's kind of a depressing film. Or at least the ironic tensions between the comedy and tragedy kind of flatten each other out.

Bill Murray. Owen Wilson. Cate Blanchett. Willem Dafoe. The list goes on. In such a bizarre film, the cast shows that they have a wonderful time. Although the script can be seen as realistic, it's the actual scenes in the movie, which gives an unbelievable experience. The movie is set in a unique world, where creatures have different colours and patterns which wouldn't find on an actual creature. The movie isn't full of jokes, but there are some which appear. There are even some laughs from scenes which are not designed as jokes. I couldn't help but laugh, at seeing Bill Murray run around shooting a gun. The film has some beautiful shots, and it's a wonderful idea to have the inside of the boat seen from a side view with a continuous camera going from one room to another.

It's a serious character study through an irreverent cartoon lens, it's deeply, deeply poignant and filled with sadness, just like Steve Zissou himself. The film is about a man coming to the end of his usefulness, and his life, the people around him are dying and he's less in control of all that he loved, and even more so, he may have very little love left in him, at least in a conventional way.
It's one of the most real approximations of life and relationships and age and the aching of human-ness I've ever seen. And it has a stop motion jaguar shark in it, and a Pirate shootout to Iggy Pop's search and destroy.
The ending reminds me of death, and the compassion and sympathy and empathy that a slow death sometimes brings.
I find this film bafflingly honest and unique. It's a little undiscovered, multicoloured, luminescent gem, buried deep beneath the ocean.

82,bsinc,"Nice little movie, not Wes's best though",7,24 September 2005,"""The Life Aquatic"" is not mr. Anderson best film, with ""only"" 90 minutes it frankly drags on a bit at times, yet still gives the average Wes fan at least a piece of what he was looking for. Me personally, I found it to be too much of a downer, from start to finish there was this minor claustrophobic-like tension (maybe due to a claustrophobic-like set) which just didn't feel very good. The good side is you will probably see mr. Murray's best performance of his career, the man has truly matured in the last past years. He plays the character of Steve Zissou with such ease and finesse (unusual for him-he really managed to control himself to not be his usual self) it made his mysterious looks into the distant sea look damn real and, for the lack of a better expression, very Steve Zissou-like. The set of the movie itself is an unusual thing, no point in explaining it, just the way it was presented made me feel more at home with the crew I guess. There is nothing particular I could point out why this movie didn't reach me, it's after all very typically Wes Anderson. Which is:A truly bizarre and intriguing story (more so drama) that is presented in a straight-faced, yet constantly comical way that will divide the audience into two halves. One half goes along with this almost fairytale-like story and it's protagonist, and eventually discovers a lot about this person, yet the ending leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. The other half just won't get any of this or will say that it's boring and pointless. Point taken, in a way. This movie won't make me grow intellectually in any way, yet strangely it felt that it should. It brought me more sad thoughts than happy ones, it eventually left me unsatisfied because I have no idea what I can do with a piece of somebody's imaginary life when so much more about this life interests me. It's a very peculiar feeling watching a Wes Anderson movie, and yet, when it all boils down to it, I will forget about the bad and totally unnecessary although scarce visual effects in ""Life Aquatic"" and give in to the very subtle and different approach to film-making that stands out strongly amongst mainstream cinema.7/10Recommendations: Wes Anderson fans-duuuuh, anyone looking for something ""different"" or nostalgic I guess",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

84,christian123,Not very enjoyable for me but it has its moments,4,7 May 2005,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou has some entertaining moments but in the end it's a disappointment. Oceanographer and filmmaker Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) heads out for his greatest mission, hunting down the Jaguar Shark that killed his best friend. Joining Team Zissou for this adventure are his illegitimate son (Owen Wilson) and a young pregnant reporter (Cate Blanchett), who only complicate matters, as the crew faces pirates on the high seas. The plot is something only a few directors would be able to handle well. I enjoyed The Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore, so I decided to check out Life Aquatic. While there were some enjoyable scenes, it wasn't as good as Wes Andersons previous work. I thought the film was above average but it wasn't really anything special. The cast does a pretty good job with the best being Bill Murray. He is very funny and gives a very good performance. Cate Blanchett was good though her performance was nothing special. Anjelica Huston gives a decent performance but she tends to play the same character in every film. Willem Dafoe gives a funny performance, though, his character starts getting annoying by the end of the film. Owen Wilson and Jeff Goldblum round out the cast while the former is pretty good while the latter's performance is pretty bad and I thought whenever he was on screen he brought the film down. The film plays for 118 minutes and sometimes it gets really boring. There isn't much behind the strong cast and director. The script was a little weak and some parts didn't really make much sense. There wasn't really a lot of likable characters either and by the end of the film I didn't care whether or not they found the Jaguar shark. The special effects look cheesy and while they did that on purpose, I thought they went overboard and found it stupid. The humor was really dry some times and that's pretty much the type of comedy you have in this flick. The trailer looked great but there isn't much beyond that. In the end. You should give this film a chance as there might be something that I missed and you might enjoy.

85,Marc_Israel_365,"""It's not a film it's a documentary""?",7,19 January 2014,"... is a line barked out by Steve Zissou, Bill Murrays' narcissistic Jaque Cousteau-like recreation, which sums up Wes Andersons' story of ""jaguar shark"" revenge. Of course, it is nether, as a film that won't take itself seriously via an appropriate cast of uncomfortable characters ends up coming across more of an artistic experience, even when the art is more mock then Monet. This isn't a ""This Is Spinal Tap"" where you know what you're getting, but kind of like the fictional adventure. You have a framework of what could happen and yet when it does, there is some storyline furthering that always comes back to Steve Zissou's self centered exploits. This wouldn't work without the fore-mentioned cast: Anjelica Huston as the ex-wife but smart member of Team Zissou and the key to past financing, Cate Blanchet as the pregnant aquatic magazine writer who won't play on the team (as it were) and William Dafoe, as the dedicated German Team Zissou member. While I never quite grooved the the lost son bit by Owen Wilson, these characters closer to him can poke a little through the exterior. Even Seu Jorges' character moves the ideal along while playing David Bowie songs on acoustic guitar and singing in Brazilian Portuguese (a weird combination which is always being recorded by the crew) and at times slips into English. He's shown a map of non- territorial waters as a member of the crew and asked do you know what it is. He responds, ""a map?"".

Plenty of laughs also come from the oddball trip, particularly when the team is confronted by pirates (the gunfire scenes are hilarious).Excellent comedy, well worth seeing.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
87,NoArrow,Strangely beautiful,9,13 January 2005,"Wes Anderson's ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is a sort-of inspiring movie about a burnout who finally decides to grow up. That he happens to be a documentary filmmaker/oceanographer is a quirk that causes the movie to avoid being depressing and instead makes it both visually and emotionally interesting, and very fun.The filmmaker is Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), who is blunt, insulting, smokes pot, and is probably the most condescending person anyone is likely to meet. He is still childish. He knows it. He goes through the world thinking that he's a hero. It's a pretty good depiction of what fame does to a guy. So he isn't pleasant, but it's because of his lack of connections with other human beings, and when he tries earnestly for the love of others we're kind of touched. He's like a mean teddy bear.The film starts at a premier of Zissou's latest documentary (""The Life Aquatic""), where we learn that Steve's lifelong friend and partner Esteban (Seymour Cassel) has been killed, eaten by a strange ""Jaguar Shark"". Esteban may have been Steve's only real connection, and so Steve is all but destroyed by his death. Steve decides to take his ship The Belafonte and his rag-tag crew on a quest to get vengeanceby exploding the jaguar shark with some dynamite.Steve isn't much of a filmmaker today, but he used to be quite good, and so when he tells his audience about his goal no one really tries to stop him. His crew is made up of half-a-dozen or so incompetent hero-worshipers who don their red tukes and their 'Zissou' logos with (very) blind pride. The crew includes sensitive Klaus (a very weird Willem Dafoe), computer whiz Wolodarsky (Noah Taylor), and Pele (Seu Jorge), an intimidating-looking Brazilian who sticks around mostly to serenade the crew by singing David Bowie songs in Portugese. Uh-huh.Steve has just been left by his latest wife, Eleanor (Angelica Huston), but joining him on this journey is a pregnant British journalist (Cate Blanchett) and Ned, a quiet, soft-spoken Kentucky air pilot who says that he might be Steve's son (Owen Wilson).Steve takes this well, he immediately takes a liking to Ned, but it is not as earnest as it should be. Steve wants someone who can always stick around, stay 'close' with him and never remind him that he's so washed up. I assume Esteban did this, and now he wants Ned to fill the role. In the beginning of their relationship this works, but Ned starts to grow more aware of Steve's blunt coldness, particularly when Steve refuses that Ned call him ""Dad"" on camera, and that he instead call him ""Stevezie"".Steve has also, as he calls it, ""developed a thing for the journalist"". He seems earnest about it, but it's hardly true, he just wants someone to replace Eleanor. Also, Blanchett and Wilson strike up a very low-key romance, though it might not be a romance, just a meeting of two souls who've been rejected by pretty much everyone else.So, ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is a bit of a tragicomedy. Yes, Steve's story, and his relationships with Blanchett and Wilson area sad, but the film absolutely loves its characters. They have likable quirks and unlikable quirks, but they're always funny, in that low-key, real-life, making mistakes sort of way. They're not perfect, but they're human, and so we love them.Most of the laughs come from Murray, in his blunt, condescending sort of way. The way he speaks of his crew, of the unpaid interns on board, of the bond company stooge (Bud Cort), of his rival Henessay (Jeff Goldblum) and of his 'closest' friends, is very, very funny. Murray's greatest comic assets are his face and his voice. Jim Carrey usually needs to fart a song or dance with a monkey to get a laugh, whereas all Murray needs to do is squint or put an ironic tone on his voice, and we laugh, a lot.The movie looks like it was a lot of fun to make too. The actors seem to enjoy their characters, especially Murray, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum and Angelica Huston. All are very funny, and give performances that are a little quirky, a little funny, and a little touching. Owen Wilson seems a little bored heremaybe it's because he didn't co-write this one (indeed, the movie isn't as funny as either of Wes Anderson's 'R' films).I have to single out Murray, though. His character is one of Wes Anderson's greatest creations, on par with Max Fischer, Royal Tenenbaum and Pagoda. He is perfect because he is quirky, but not inhuman. He has so many flaws and personal issueshe's probably one of the most human characters created this year. Murray's performance is great, too, probably his third best, behind his work in ""Rushmore"" and, of course, ""Lost in Translation"". Murray is getting increasingly impressive as he moves on in his careerhe won't win an Oscar for this film (and, sadly, probably won't be nominated either), but I can see him winning one sometime in the near future.An Oscar this movie should get is for Art and Set Direction. There are many visually interesting (and sometimes beautiful) set pieces, including a cutaway look at the inside of the Belafonte, Zissou's ship, and an abandoned, half-destroyed hotel on a small island. The film's score is also very good; it really feels kinda glorious when Steve and the gang are storming some ruthless pirates with the music pounding in the background.This is not Wes Anderson's greatest film (""Rushmore"" obviously takes that title) but it is very unique. There has been lots of bad buzz, and I was unimpressed when I first seen it, but it's a movie you have to think about after watching. The humor is mostly buried deep, but it's there, and the movie is delightful.8/10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Gwyneth is one of cinema's great chameleons - she really does have a very wide repertoire.To be honest it's a whimsy, it won't change your life and there are few BIG laughs, but little ones come along every two or three minutes.The set is unbelievably good. The best cutaway ship hull in cinema history and the music s sublime Bowie's best outing since that German heroin movie (Chriatian F?) Overall it kind of meanders a bit too much. Frankly not a lot really happens, but it is the sort of film that makes you glad the cinema exists because it's so cute.I'd give it a real strong endorsement, but if you don't like it, fair enough.

89,jonathan-577,as fun as it wants to be,7,19 May 2008,"As far as I'm concerned, the hollow whimsy here essayed is a distinct recovery from the hollow whimsy of The Royal Tenenbaums. It benefits from its long arm's length from anything resembling real life: the Cousteau shtick is an unexpected and improbable conceit, with cute CGI creatures everywhere and a breezy ensemble sensibility that gives another batch of great performers room to play while allowing us to forget what's missing at the center. From Gene Hackman we expect - and unfortunately get - unfulfilled intimations of substance, but from Bill Murray we just want that weary, sneaky amiability that dovetails so perfectly with Anderson's own sensibility. I don't know where his sense of depth and passion went after Rushmore, but self-confessed frivolity has its own - modest - rewards.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
90,glgioia,Quite Erratic With Wes Anderson,6,23 April 2005,"Anderson reworks, yet again, his father/son allegory this time within the framework of a Moby Dick meets Jaques Cousteau romp. All in all, its a sloppy and disappointing effort from the offbeat director/creator of Rushmore and Royal Tannenbaums, but one that isn't completely without its charms. We still find the directors trademark left hook dialog poignancy, although not nearly in the abundance we are accustomed to. The direction style is still refreshing and makes for interesting viewing. As always, the soundtrack is key to the experience, and also as always served up with innovation. I like this type of comedy, a sort of verbalized Buster Keatonism I suppose, but I know that with Life Aquatic, Anderson narrows drastically the bandwidth of critical acceptance and mainstream appeal, the latter for certain. Its completely out there in all respects, and the sneaking appearances of marijuana sorta makes you wonder just what the hell the filmmakers were thinking about. Cate Blanchett is so unbelievably captivating, that you almost don't realize how appallingly untrue her characterization appears. The same can sadly be said for most of the cast, with Bill Murray the lone exception. And in the end, there's just a little too much Buster Keaton, and too little coherent story telling. Ill call the special effects silly and unconvincing, but I come back to thinking perhaps this was the intention. Sponge Bob humor of the stupidity? I sincerely hope that an original like Wes Anderson does NOT succumb to the same success-fed mediocrity that has destroyed so many of his contemporaries, Tim Burton, Kevin Smith et al...If you are one of Anderson's true believers, you will certainly enjoy yourself, but I doubt if anyone else will.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Life Acquatic was distinctly unfunny. With shades of Moby Dick, Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) invites a long time fan who is possibly his son off on a mission to destroy a rare shark that ate a friend. Because of past failures, Captain Zissou can no longer get funding, but the fan, possibly his son agrees to put up his inheritance to support the mission. The crew Captain Zissou has had working for him is so pathetic that they can't crack an oyster much less a joke. Yet they go off into the unknown in search of the shark.

Anyone could have made a more watchable and enjoyable movie with all the film that was shot, and I mean anyone. There were some truly great lines and scenes, which saved the film for me, but the overall film was like an overlong Murray SNL skit, but not as funny. It really was just a bunch of skits put together in a more or less understandable story, but was in an obscure oceanography genre that few care about, much less really like. I saw ""box office failure "" after just a few minutes into it, and it never improved much. And, many of the terrific actors in it were merely thrown away, especially Jeff Goldblum and Michael Gambon. I sure loved their boat, but a great boat does not a great movie make.See Royal Tennebaums or Mt.

It isn't and it gets old real fast! OOOOoo look I am going to make this character topless for the first half of the film, and then not for the rest and never give an explanation why. OOOoo I'll make this guy air Kentucky yeah that's funny!! Oooo I know I'll make this character pregnant that's killer!! Here's the problem.. after 5 seconds it's stale.. like this film chewing on cardboard. Characters are never developed, the talented cast particularly Murray recites dialogoue in the most monotone stillted manner, and the plot goes nowhere. A father son bonding ends up having no merit.

94,bix171,Regressive,3,27 December 2004,"Wes Anderson's vanity project finds him regressing from the perceptive dissertation on American families that was ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" to the arch callowness of its precursor ""Rushmore"" and the result is a slight, intermittently amusing picture that dares you to get it but smugly predicts you won't. It's droll to a fault, with no real perception behind its drollness; in fact, there seems to be little worth examining behind its mellow cynicism. Bill Murray (cashing in on the world-weariness that made him so sympathetic in ""Lost In Translation"") plays a fading Jacques Cousteau-like documentation who rounds up his quirky crew for a voyage to find the mysterious ""jaguar shark"" that has killed his partner (Seymour Cassel); joining him is a young man who may be his bastard son (Owen Wilson) and a journalist (Cate Blanchett) on whom both father and alleged son develop designs. Anderson is content to let this loose framework remain unexplored in order to push his loopy characters and offbeat sidebars to the forefront and while some of the performers are admittedly funny (especially Willem Dafoe, who, from ""Wild At Heart"" to ""Shadow Of The Vampire"", always seems to be able to bring the audience in on the joke; and Anjelica Huston, whose deadpan is truly in sync with Anderson), whole sections of the film-such as an assault on the ship by Filipino pirates and the rescue of hostages-appear to be crafted as mere indulgences to be celebrated for their homage-filled zaniness. Anderson has a good eye for staging what he wants and, given something to say, it's clear he can make an impact. But it's also possible his time to leave a mark may have come and gone. The cute underwater effects are by Henry Selick and Robert D. Yeoman's cinematography is quite good, moving from exquisite, colorful clarity for the interpersonal scenes to gritty and grainy for the mockingly-staged ""action"" sequences.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
95,come2whereimfrom,wes does it again.,9,20 March 2005,"The life aquatic with Steve Zissou, is a brilliantly quirky film. But I suspect it may divide audiences. Those who loved Wes Andersons other works (Rushmore, Tenenbaums) will no doubt love this progression of his unique style, it may on the other hand (despite the all-star cast) not convert any regular cinema goers to the cause. None the less I thoroughly enjoyed engrossing myself in the life of Steve the washed up undersea explorer and his band of misfit sailors. In the same way that Tim Burton used the misfit card in mars attacks (a gambler, a pharaoh, an alcoholic and Tom Jones all escaping together) you cant help but laugh as team Zissou, dressed in all their silver diving suits and red bobble hats, storm the island to rescue the banks bonds man Bill from pirates. Anderson has a way of making the ordinary extra-ordinary and visa-versa. Like when a child presents Zissou with a rainbow coloured seahorse in a bag (the kind you get fish in from the fair) twists when the bag bursts and Zissou continues his walk with the creature in a champagne glass held aloft like an Olympic torch. The attention to detail here is as vast as the cast of characters is diverse and any review wouldn't do this film justice, it is scored superbly, acted wonderfully and directed with a unique style that is unsurpassed. Anderson is defiantly at the top of his game and I look forward to what ever he chooses to do next like a child looking forward to Christmas.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

97,refresh_daemon,"Good story, if you have the patience to wait for it to show up",7,2 December 2007,"This is the remaining film by Wes Anderson that I haven't yet seen and from what I've heard about it, I wasn't expecting much. But perhaps my low expectations turned out for the better because, in the end, I actually did enjoy this film, although it's not without its problems.In some sense, watching The Life Aquatic reminded me of the time that I read Moby Dick by Herman Melville. There are obvious similarities (voyage at sea, obsession in hunting a large fearsome sea creature), but it's not those things that I really wanted to compare with. When I read Moby Dick, it took so much ramp-up time to really get into the meat of the story, that I was profoundly bored for much of the start of the book. Likewise, The Life Aquatic's first half is impressively meandering and unfocused. There is a lot more time spent preparing for the voyage than there needs to be and many of the scenes seem to exist for character exposition, rather than carrying a significant weight when it comes to the story.This almost led me to giving up on the film, but I held out and was glad I did, because although the film flags for so long, the final acts actually have plot movement and build on the core story. And it's actually quite an impressive story about obsession, relationships and loss. The acting throughout the film is consistent and generally good. Wilson actually plays a rather straight character for once and I realized that it wasn't his forte, as his character, Ned Plimpton, has a tendency to be drowned out by the crazier crew that surrounds him.The film, even in its kooky world occasionally stretches believability without a strong payoff. The direction is standard Wes Anderson, taking off the use of color that he really developed in The Royal Tenenbaums and that he would further use in his following films. It's a very unique way of looking at things, so Wes does stand alone in his vision, but looking at this film and the rest of his filmography, I hope he doesn't get stuck in a need to make everything even more intensely his style, but uses it as a means to express the world that he's seeing.So, this is a problematic film, but I still like it in the end, once it finally gets into the story. It's hard to strongly recommend this film because of its problematic structure and the fact that it's a little boring for about half the movie. But it reaches a wonderful high in the end and finishes well, so it'll be hard for me to forget it. It's good, but not a must see. 7/10.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

The overrated Owen Wilson does nothing to help this mess. I stopped caring about this movie after a half hour or so. Willem Dafoe, Cate Blanchett, and Anjelica Houston waste their talent on this movie. What story are these people trying to tell and why should we bother watching it? I have absolutely no idea. This movie is one unfunny scene after another. The story is virtually nonexistent.

This is likely down to what I have come to expect from Anderson, I love his quirky dialogue and characters, but my favourite part of his style has always been the dazzling, symmetrical cinematography. The Jacques Cousteau parody element was funny and clever, this film would still work even if I didn't register this element. This could be seen as a point against the film, but I don't look at it this way, it actually makes me appreciate the film more for presenting this element with nuance. The main reason I don't enjoy this film as much as some other Anderson films is the story, I had very little interest in it. Bill Murray was good as Steve Zissou, Owen Wilson played Owen Wilson, and Cate Blanchett delivered my favourite performance, closely followed by Jeff Goldblum. Life aquatic is absolutely stylish, but again not in the way I was expecting.

100,Aly200,Wes Anderson's Most Underrated Film,7,20 January 2017,"Indie filmmaker darling Wes Anderson tackles a hilarious at-sea journey in this film that parodies the famous Jacques Cousteau and his oceanography legacy. However we have an Anderson-style Cousteau in the titular Steve Zissou (Anderson regular Bill Murray) who is out to find an exotic shark that ate his long-term friend and colleague. Murray brings his trademark dry wit to the role of Steve, quipping stinging one-liners with some crude but gut-busting humor. The actor also brings an old-world weariness as his character has to face the fact that not everyone thinks Steve Zissou is a wonderful person. His chemistry with the film's other eccentric personalities make for the film's best humor as they clash and bond in endearing yet occasionally misguided ways. Joining Bill Murray's title character are an eclectic bunch of supporting players within the director's wheelhouse. From Steve's right-handed German engineer Klaus, played in almost cartoonish fashion by the incomparable Willem Dafoe (Dafoe's accent alone is amusing), the subdued Noah Taylor as the crew's navigator, Angelica Huston as Steve's intelligent and put-upon wife Eleanor, Cate Blanchett as a sassy reporter stuck with the Zissou crew to cover Steve's voyage for the jaguar shark and Owen Wilson as airline pilot and possible son to Bill Murray's Steve all make up an endearing set of characters who makes us laugh and cry at all the right moments.The film's humor is trademark for a Wes Anderson film as the director enjoys tackling family dynamics. The director never actually confirms whether Owen Wilson's Ned really is Steve's son, but instead gives us bonding moments that tug at our heart-strings and the scenes where Steve and Ned disagree make us shake our heads at how childish the men can act but also evoke awkward laughs. So of the film's funniest moments come from the constant clashes between Owen Wilson's Ned and Willem Dafoe's Klaus as the two actors behave like squabbling siblings until their touching final exchange before tragedy befalls the crew. Another boon for the film is the director's musical choice of David Bowie songs which for the quirky comedy are beyond fitting. Actor Seu Jorge covers every Bowie in his native Portuguese (Bowie's own voice is only used twice for ""Life on Mars?"" early in the film and for ""Queen Bitch"" during the final credits) which brings a fun depth to the legendary rock star's whimsical lyrics. Go for an adventure with this quirky comedy and you won't be disappointed.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
101,roland-104,Willem Dafoe and a 3-legged dog outpace all the talented comedians gathered here,6,16 November 2005,"It's hard to know quite what to say about the humor, or lack of it, in Wes Anderson's latest film. In my opinion, most big production comedies these days tend to bomb because everyone tries too hard to be funny, to wring the last dumb laugh from every scene. Here's an instance where maybe people didn't try quite hard enough. Granted, Anderson is drawn to droll, offbeat comedy (""Bottle Rocket,"" ""Rushmore,"" ""The Royal Tenenbaums"") but ""Life Aquatic"" seems almost an anti-humor piece: rarely have I seen so much comic talent generating so few honest laughs.The result is not so much a send up of French ocean adventurer Jacques-Yves Cousteau's career  the manifest theme of the screenplay  as it is a parody of a send-up. A send down, perhaps? There are certainly some fine comedians at work here, including Anderson favorites Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Anjelica Huston, as well as Jeff Goldblum and even Bud Cort (""Harold and Maude,"" ""Brewster McCloud""), now pretty long in the tooth. It's as if these fine comic talents were trying to outdo one another in throwing away lines or acting the straight role. They have the collective force of a peeing contest in a hurricane.Nor is the thing adventuresome, pathetic or even earnest. Terms like lackadaisical and somnambulistic do come to mind.The plot, for what it's worth, goes like this. Renown pop oceanographer/filmmaker Zissou (Murray) is on the downslope of his career. He's incredibly vain, exploitative, lazy and self indulgent (the film is dedicated to Cousteau; one wonders, were he still alive, how he'd feel about this portrayal). On his latest voyage, Zissou loses his oldest and dearest associate in the briny, when the man is eaten alive by a beast Zissou calls a ""jaguar shark."" Narrowly escaping himself, Zissou vows to spare no expense to get revenge in a newly mounted expedition. Trouble is, he has no money or backers willing to risk more of their resources on a has-been. Even Zissou's wealthy wife Eleanor (Huston) is tired of pouring family dollars into his ventures; she not only refuses but leaves Zissou for hunkier pastures.Enter Ned (Wilson), who claims to be Zissou's bastard son, and who has inherited a cool $275K on the recent death of his Mom. Not one to shy away from opportunity, Zissou immediately confirms his paternity, makes Ned a crew member and reaches for the cash. He outfits Ned with the standard crew uniform: powder blue jumpsuit with a ""Z"" logo, custom cross-trainers labeled ""Zissou,"" a Glock pistol and a bright red wool seaman's cap.What the expedition's vessel (The ""Belefonte"") lacks in necessary equipment for the venture Zissou arranges to steal from his well-heeled rival oceanographer, Alistair Hennessey (Goldblum), who also happens to be Eleanor's former husband.Along the way romance, jealousy, murder, kidnapping, truth telling, reconciliation and, finally, a glimpse of the culprit shark all work their way into our attention. It all sounds so exciting. If only. Yet it's not exactly a bad movie to watch; it's better entertainment than you can find anywhere on TV. (How's that for damning with faint praise.) High points include brief animated fish forms by Henry Selick and several David Bowie songs performed in Portuguese by Seu Jorge, who plays one of the crew members. The end credits are especially catchy (the main cast members walk along a pier, the group adding a member each time that's actor's name flashes on screen, followed by Mr. Jorge sitting in front of an ornate stage curtain, playing guitar and singing behind the nearly interminable tech credits (I have rarely seen a neighborhood theater audience hang around for end credits like they did for these).Murray's talent for subtle facial acting, so well deployed in the complex context of ""Lost in Translation,"" is not as well used here in a less interesting, two-dimensional, unnuanced satirical role.With Cate Blanchett as a pregnant journalist, Willem Dafoe playing against type as a hypersensitive, approval seeking crew member (to me he's funnier than anybody else in this flick), and Leica the three legged dog (camera on a tripod?).I barely recommend this one solely on the basis that it is always wise to keep an eye on the work of Wes Anderson.

Not a single person in the audience laughed during the entire movie.All the characters in the movie are the quirky and annoying type that I have come to expect from Anderson. The only good point was the reporter character played by Kate Blanchet who was actually relatively normal. I don't object to quirky, but over-the-top quirky gets very annoying very quickly.

103,mr_popcorn,"McCheesy's take on ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou""",8,3 May 2008,"Wes Anderson is one of the most innovative directors who ever walked on this planet. His follow up film to 2001's 'The Royal Tenenbaums' - 'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou' was a blast. Bill Murray plays Steve Zissou, a world renowned oceanographer who, after his dear friend Esteban gets eaten by the mythical Jaguar shark, sets sail and attempts to hunt and destroy (with a dynamite) the creature who killed his partner.I admit I was a bit disappointed with this film. Maybe because I really loved this film way before I even saw it and expected this one to be real, real good. Like Second Coming good. I'd say not Wes Anderson's best film (I rated Darjeeling and Royal Tenenbaums a five) but it sure holds out on its own. You find yourself laughing at one point and then the next minute, you find yourself crying, which is rather odd because this film is 90% black humor.The star studded cast that includes Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Angelica Huston and Willem Dafoe were so hilarious. Now, that's versatility, most of these actors can be found in serious dramatic roles and it was such a treat watching them do a comedy. The character Klaus Daimler played by Willem Dafoe was so hilarious I was laughing with my guts out every time he's on screen.'Life Aquatic' is admittedly an odd film with odd characters.

Everyone, including Zissou, wears what seems to be a pair of light blue pajamas and a red knit top. I'm not sure if that may be a homage to the late Jaques Cousteau or not.It could do with out the profanity and the mild violence.

OK... so it's meant to be a semi-serious movie inspired by jacques cousteau then? if that's the case then someone that is into diving might enjoy it?... no. why? because it's boring. the script is nearly non existent at times, the editing slow and dull. the visuals uninspiring people that say this isn't meant to be a comedy are surely wrong then. clearly this is meant to be a tongue in cheek movie, all of zissou's crew hang around in identical orange coloured beanies. and they have matching pyjamas. the underwater life is intentionally made to look weird and very unreal and the whole movie in fact is made to have a twilight zone quality to it mainly what this movie fails to realise is that to someone like Cousteau, the underwater world was everything. and so concentrating on land based complications such as marital issues etc is missing the point entirely. everything would have been organised around what dive site to explore next. the movie therefore completely fails to capture the enthusiasm that a character like zissou/cousteau would have for that world and as a result its core is totally off base overall i think wes anderson is quite overrated as a director, and although i like him a lot murray is also overrated as a serious actor. only dafoe here hints at what this movie could have been like under the right comedic direction overall the concept is poorly executed and doesn't make for enjoyable viewing. maybe on paper this movie looked great. perhaps even commercial... it clearly did or else it wouldn't have been backed by Disney. however it hasn't been given the treatment it deserves and falls flat. it sent me to sleep actually, and i'm guessing that wasn't the idea..",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
106,patryk-czekaj,"Creative, unformulaic whimsy",7,27 November 2012,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is definitely not Anderson's best, but arguably the most eccentric piece of filmmaking. Once again, the director takes us on a magical, wonderful, whimsical ride into his peculiar yet amazingly stylish world, where cartoon-like vibe merges with the awesomely unique composition of colors. When it comes to photography, the overall result is definitely stunning. While the story might seem rather incoherent at times, the characters, and their bizarre and poignant attitude towards life, compensate for the superficiality of the narrative.Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), a pioneer of sea voyages and a well-received weirdo-filmmaker, decides to gather his crew of many fanciful mates, and embark on what will probably be their last journey. This time it's personal - Steve wants to avenge the death of his close co-worker. In order to do that, he needs to find a rare shark somewhere in the vast ocean waters. As ironic as it may seem, in this clearly peculiar team it's hard to find someone who even tries to think straight. Apart from the regulars - Steve's haughty wife (Anjelica Huston), a mysterious German loner (Willem Dafoe), and a few others - Steve finds an unexpected companion in the form of a man (Owen Wilson), who claims to be his estranged long-lost son. Then there's also the nosy yet fairly vulnerable journalist Jane (Cate Blanchett). As the team sails, the audiences observe their every-day actions in what seems to be a smartly-developed video-log. There's romance, mutiny, abordage, there are heartbreaks, fights, mysterious discoveries. And in all of that hides the bigger premise, which now involves not only finding the creature, but also rescuing a friend who was kidnapped in the process by a gang of tough pirates. Though Zissou finally finds his 'arch- nemesis', seeing how glorious and uncanny it is, the protagonist changes his mind and decides to observe the shark in all its glory rather than harm it.Great performances by a stellar cast enhance the experience of watching The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and cleverly cover up the artificial nature of the picture. It possesses an amazingly magical and enchanting aura, which - combined with the director's typical touch of heartfelt whimsy and many witty dialogues - provides for a somehow surrealistic adventure. It's yet another successful collaboration between Bill Murray and Wes Anderson. Saying that the film's odd, unformulaic and simply bizarre is a huge compliment to the work of those two inventive people.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

109,iago-6,Royal Tenenbaums II: Underwater Edition,4,30 December 2004,"It's well made, it's well acted, etc... so why do I just not care? Maybe because it's just so similar to Royal Tenenbaums, irresponsible dad with estranged children, blah blah blah. This is one of those movies that was perfectly pleasant to watch (until the last 30 minutes, when you just want it to end), but the more I think about it, the more annoyed I get.Cate Blanchett gets a lot more screen time than you would guess from the trailer, and as usual she's great. I've never understood the perspective of those who say Bill Murray is such a great actor. Is playing deadpan throughout (in this and every movie) really that great? It's always nice to see Angelica Houston. I liked sitting there looking at it, but I also like looking at a box of puppies, you know? So I say a big ""eh."" Maybe Wes Anderson needs to make a movie that isn't just the same characters, same problems, different setting. On the other hand Woody Allen makes movies, and Jane Austen writes novels, that are essentially all the same, with the same characters, and yet somehow they manage to make an individual impression and to each offer insights. If you're seeing a movie, you could do worse, but then again, you could just stay home.This is probably the last Wes Anderson movie I'll go to see.--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

111,schroeder-gustavo,Life Aquatic,8,12 March 2016,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is written, directed and produced by Wes Anderson. It tells the story of an oceanographer trying to get revenge on a shark after it ate his best friend. And for the most part, I really liked the Life Aquatic. Anderson's style resonates throughout the film: it's silly, goofy and bright. Some of it doesn't really make sense, but it's established by the tone of the film that that doesn't really matter. The cast is great: Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum and others. Almost everyone is great, especially Murray with his sarcastic humor that never gets old and Goldblum with his eccentric antics. For me though, hat's off for Willem Dafoe. He stole every scene he was in as the German engineer. He was so funny and just great. I have to say I did not like Owen Wilson in this, at all. He plays this pilot from Kentucky, which is fine as a character, but the problem is I didn't see the character in the movie, I just saw Owen Wilson trying to do a terrible accent. Either cast someone else or don't have Wilson's character be from Kentucky.Also, for me the movie is at its best when it's silly and joyful, but the movie does fall back to melancholy and drama at times and that for me didn't really work that well in this type of film after the tone of silliness was established.However, overall The Life Aquatic is a very good movie, with great set designs and characters and great silly creatures and props. Things you don't see a lot in movies anymore and I really appreciate those kinds of things. You can tell a lot of heart went into doing this and I love that. The Life Aquatic is one of a kind and although it may get tedious at times, it's still a project that was made with a lot of love and creativity, so I respect it for that.7.5/10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

113,ThreeGuysOneMovie,"not a film that everyone is going to enjoy, it is a film that many will love",9,3 June 2012,"To call The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou an ambitious and polarizing film would be selling it short. There seems to be two camps with regards to most of Wes Anderson's films. Film goers and critics, either love his quirky, absurdist storytelling, or they are annoyed by his chaotic character dramas. I most often find myself in the former camp with regards to his films. I had initially seen this film upon its 2004 release, but recently obtained a DVD of the film for a pittance on Amazon and re-watched it for this review.Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) is the captain of The Belafonte, and renowned oceanographer, who has fallen into a depression. His partner and friend Esteban is killed and eaten by a Jaguar shark, while making his most recent documentary. In addition, Zissou has marriage problems with his wife Eleanor (Angelica Houston), and has lost financial backing for his expeditions. His films and explorations, have lost relevancy, he is considered a washed up has been. Add to the mix the arrival of Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), who may or may not be a long-lost son, conceived with a former fling, and its enough to cause Steve to drink more campari and smoke more marijuana than he usually does.After securing financing for his revenge voyage, thanks to using Ned's inheritance. The crew sets out on the high seas to document and exact revenge on the illusive jaguar shark. The arrival of reporter Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett), only adds to problems and infighting with the quirky crew, including Klaus (Willem Dafoe), and Portuguese Bowie playing Pele' (Seu Jorge). What follows is an absurdist comedic drama, set in a fanciful and semi-blase world aboard the Belafonte. Put on your life preserver and take some Dramamine because its going to be a bumpy and wild cruise.While this is certainly not a film that everyone is going to enjoy, it is a film that many will love. Director Anderson manges to make us feel for his characters in a deep way despite their numerous eccentricities. Similarly, the plot of the film meanders about with what appears to be little direction. Somehow, the pirates, exotic sea creatures, bowie songs and bare-chested crew both male and female, all blend together in a strange fascinating tapestry. At its core the film is a look inside of the head of its auteur, his bizarre sensibilities and precise dialogue take us on a journey that you will find worth the trip.Like what you see here? Then check out our full site at 3guys1movie.comScoring a film like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is a difficult task. While this writer found the film an intoxicating cinematic experience, it is doubtful everyone will feel that way. My best advice would be to set aside any sort of preconceived notions about plot, and instead simply listen to the immersive dialogue, and try to catch some the minutia of detail, that Anderson sprinkles over the film like delicious powdered sugar.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
114,crculver,"Worthwhile on one or two viewings and (like all Anderson) painstakingly designed, but an often uncomfortable experience",5,18 July 2015,"Wes Anderson's 2004 film THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU centers on the personal dramas of the title character (Bill Murray), a Cousteau-like oceanographer who feels like he has reached the end of his career. After a jaguar shark kills his partner, Zissou vows to go on one last adventure to hunt it and kill it. As he looks back on his womanizing private life, a young airline pilot (Owen Wilson) approaches him and suggests that Zissou may be his father. This budding father-son relationship unfolds among the struggles of Zissou's crew to reach the last known whereabouts of the shark.Those who know Wilson's earlier films, especially THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS of 2000, will recognize many similar themes, actors and humour here. The setting is ostensibly in our own time, but with much retro design. Furthermore, that design is extremely painstaking, with everything created bespoke for the film down to the little labels on stuff. There are complex personal relationships and failed marriages. And the soundtrack is quirky, this time to an even greater degree (Brazilian star Seu Jorge singing David Bowie translated into Portugese and playing the guitar).However, there are some fresh new elements that keep this from being a mere repetition of his earlier comedy/dramas. There's even two shootout scenes, so Anderson certainly can't be hit with charges of making films where people just talk and talk in deadpan voices. A delightful visual touch are the fanciful sea creatures (stop-motion puppets, not CGI), and as I mentioned, the extremely intricate set design. Finally, whatever else one might think of the film, the cinematography of the helicopter crash scene deserves great praise for so subtly and gradually informing the viewer that something has gone horribly wrong.Yet, for its general entertainment on a single viewing (and there are enough interconnections in the plot and dialogue to make a second viewing worthwhile too), THE LIFE AQUATIC strikes me as Anderson's most uncomfortable film to date. Of everyone here, only Steve Zissou is presented with any sort of depth. Owen Wilson's character is about as vague and featureless as the jaguar shark himself, just one more obstacle thrown in Zissou's path. Bill Murray had already honed this type of grim middle-aged moper many times before, reaching his finest hour with LOST IN TRANSLATION, but here (as well as in BROKEN FLOWERS) he's obviously gotten stuck in a rut as an actor. Klaus, the German first mate, is a lame ethnic caricature played by an American actor.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
115,jaxbubba,Not Even for Free,1,16 April 2005,"Possibly one of the worse that I have seen. To call this movie bad, would be an insult to all other films that do not quite generate the stench that this film inflicts on the audience; therefore, I have dubbed this film as putrid, which is more apropos of the film's content.Coming off his Academy Award nominated role in Lost in Translation, Bill Murray stars as Steve Zissou, a parody characterization of Jacques Cousteau , the world famous oceanographer.While filming an underwater documentary, Zissou, along with his merry men of aqua mariners; lose a loyal and trusted crewman when he is eaten by a panther shark in which they encounter. With revenge in his heart, film in his camera, and the financial backing of Ned Plimpton played by Owen Wilson (who may or may not be Zissou's son); Zissou returns to the sea in search of the ravenous beast. Also along for the ride are Academy Award winners Anjelica Huston as Eleanor Zissou (Steve's wife); and Cate Blanchett as Jane Winslett-Richardson, a reporter and once avid fan of Zissou.I am just amazed that this much talent could produce such gobbledygook. Written and directed by Wes Anderson, this film is the epitome of stupidity. The editing is atrocious, and the film lacks continuity as the film's sequences jump hap-hazardously from scene to scene. The dialog is unfunny; spoken straight-faced, to give the appearance of seriousness no matter how ridiculous the circumstance. The audience is forced to sit dumbfounded staring at the screen, trying to comprehend the malarkey being offered as entertainment. I say, ""DON'T Do It!!!""

Having grown up during the 1980s, I still associate Murray primarily with films like Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day, and the like, however, a good portion of Murray's films have becomes the darlings on the independent film circuit. A couple of my students asked me if I had watched The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and I said that I had not, so today one of them loaned me his roommate's copy of the DVD.The Aquatic Life of Steve Zissou opens with a viewing of the title character's latest documentary in which his best friend Esteban is devoured by a Jaguar Shark. During the questionnaire after the films showing Steve Zissou informs the audience that in his next film he plans to kill the shark for revenge. However, these words are easier said than done because Zissou's ratings have been dropping over the last decade and companies are reluctant to finance his films. His falling popularity leads Zissou to indulge in alcohol to become more and more distant from his wife. Yet, it seems that Zissou's life is going to change when he meets Ned, a thirty year old man who claims to be Zissou's son. While neither affirming or denying being Ned's father, Zissou invites the younger man to come to his private island and later invites him to become part of his crew, however, how will the rest of the crew respond to this and how will Steve and Ned get along when they both have eyes for the same blonde, British reporter? The Aquatic Life of Steve Zissou consists of an interesting mix of live action and animation. While all the humans are flesh and blood, most of the aquatic life is animated and animated in quite bright, vivid colors thereby giving the film a magical realistic, surreal quality. Top this off with a soundtrack primarily made up of David Bowie songs, sung by the man himself and in Portuguese by one of the films actors: Seu Jorge, make the film a visual and aural delight, however, is the film enjoyable itself? I say yes, yes it is, but it is a film that tends to move a bit slow at some points and at others might seem quite pointless as a whole.

I loved Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, and Royal Tenenbaums. But I think that Aquatic was a miss for Wes Anderson.No, it wasn't a terrible movie, not by a long shot. NOR was it a brilliant movie. As for those saying I just didn't ""get it,"" well I did get it. The movie was boring, that is what I got. Like all Anderson movies, there is an eclectic cast of odd ball characters. My fave was Dafoe as the humble German servant who is finally elevated to ""A' team leader toward the end. The setups and set pieces were interesting, and performances all very good. But the camera seemed confined even on scenes that weren't on the boat and shots lacked depth all leading to a ""stage"" feel. Some of the scenes on the boat set played a bit too long, and came off less convincing and more ""play acted"" style with dialog scenes that needed to be tightened up. In all, the movie came off as stage play like. LOTS of wordy exchanges that many times add up to little. Not my preference, I don't like plays, I like movies. But that is one easily debated, go ahead set me on fire. I hate plays, unless of course it is one by Max Fischer.Of course this was a point heavily emphasized with the nature of the ship set and I understand that a ship IS IN FACT confining. But in movies like Das Boot, the filmmakers take that opportunity to take the microcosm of the ship and use setups that recognize the limited space, but also EXPAND that world for the audience. Difference in style. I didn't like the way it was done here. Go ahead, burn me at the stake.Murray was great, I loved his character. But the story languished for a good hour in the middle. Call it character development or texture, but I still fell off the boat, I was bored senseless. The movie needed pace and several attempts at comedy fell flat. I GOT THE JOKES, they just weren't all that funny. Toward the end, the movie rescued itself when the Zissou team rescues the bond agent from the pirates. From then on out it was fine. There was a kind of saving grace in the overall execution of the film. The performances and typical Anderson oddities made it interesting.

All his previous films have, to a great extent, been a case of love-it-or-hate-it, something that also goes for Life Aquatic.It's a film about film maker, and Costeau copy, Steve Zissou and his crew and family heading out on what could be a last mission, trying to find the mysterious shark that killed his best friend. Part comedy, part drama - and a whole lot of surrealism.Just like in The Royal Tenenbaums, Aquatic takes place in a sort of parallel universe. The characters aren't ""real"" and doesn't act like it either. With Tenenbaums it felt like they were testing how far out you could go, without being too pretentious and people still liking it - this time, it's even more weird, and the fine line between quirky fun and pointless fluff is crossed more than once.Bill Murray is great, but this is the kind of role he can do in his sleep, it's time for him to take on a more challenging script. The rest of the cast is made up of so many great actors that there's no way that they're going to get enough to do. I wanted to see more of them, so fewer characters would have been better.The plot gets too weird at times, and there's to much style in favour of substance. The literal fantasy world of the sea didn't really work either. The animation distracted from the other events in a way that the film doesn't benefit from. It's still a pretty entertaining film with some great moments and acting, but as a whole Aquatic never get's as good as Rushmore and Tenenbaums. [6/10]",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
122,Blade_Le_Flambeur,"A wonderful, quirky film - one of my favorites, if not no. 1",10,15 November 2005,"Eccentric writer/director Wes Anderson and co-screenplay writer Noah Baumbach tackle the high seas in this adventure story about a weary oceanographer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) as he tries to find the ""Jaguar Shark"" that ate his friend alive. What Anderson and Baumbach do so well is spin together a narrative that is both simple and complex, a wonderful, funny, passionate film that's richly laced with acerbic humor and strong performances.Zissou has reached the end of his line. His last few documentaries have flopped and his producer Oseary Drakoulias (Michael Gambon) is having a tough time getting funds. His wife, Eleanor (Angelica Huston) pays less and less attention to him and his nemesis Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) is beginning to interfere more and more with his research. On top of all this he discovers that he might have a son from a long ago affair, the quiet and simple minded Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) of Kansas. After the failed running of a documentary that shows his friend and mentor Esteban (Seymour Cassel) being eaten alive Zissou decides that it's time to make his last trek-find and kill the shark at any cost. Along for the bumpy ride are the usual cast of misfits, former German bus driver Klaus Daimler (an achingly hilarious Willem Dafoe), a nosy but professional, pregnant journalist Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett), and a Bail Bond Stooge (Bud Cort). This unlikely team, along with some other comrades of Steve venture dive head first into quite an adventure. There are some classic scenes, such as when Steve tries to confront the possibility of mutiny and some harsh and gritty scenes, such as when Filipino pirates attack and board Zissou's ship. This thick, rich plot is executed to the full extent by the talented crew.Anderson has a knack for making some off beat comedies with oddball characters (see 'Bottle Rocket' or 'Rushmore'). After getting an Academy Award nomination for writing 'The Royal Tenenbaums' Anderson made this film and his talent only develops with age. His first three outings he co-wrote with usual actor Owen Wilson however this time he employs the talents of Baumbach (who just recently came out with the acclaimed 'The Squid and the Whale'). The pair make a very fresh film that still fits in the mold of Anderson's previous work even if the other screenwriter has been changed. The photography and editing are vibrant without being overly glossy and there is a truly amazing soundtrack featuring some David Bowie songs in Portugese. As a director, Anderson is able to infuse a very life like yet subtle quality into his characters. Zissou is egotistical and even an ass yet there is something strangely likable about him. Klaus is a crazed German and Dafoe deserved to have been nominated for his turn. The rest of the cast also turns in some notable performances, especially in some rather intense scenes. It all works out well.'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou' is my favorite film. It's a rich mixture of wonderful chemistry, writing, directing, and wit.

With any luck at all he is going to nail an Academy Award for Best Actor in the near future if he continues to explore such oddities as ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"". Here we have the intelligent goof, the pseudo-documentary and a parody of all the scientific exploration teams ever screened, with particular attention paid to the all-too-serious TV wildlife features of the past. But it is the commingling of Murray's dead-pan lines, painful admissions, hurt expressions and a host of other vulnerabilities that takes this one over the top.Steve Zissou (Murray) is an adventure-seeking oceanographer of sorts; he is desperate for revenge on the shark that ate his long-time partner on a recent expedition. His efforts to enlist a crew and land financing occupy his immediate thoughts; no less attention must be paid to the appearance of a young pilot posturing as his son (Owen Wilson playing Ned Plimpton), his seemingly disinterested wife Eleanor (Anjelica Huston) and a bizarre collection of associates. This is not the scientific journey we would expect from the documentary-like title of the film; this is a fantasy hatched by director Wes Anderson, in his own words, from TV: ""The germ of the idea was the Cousteau stuff from TV that I watched growing up and Jane Goodall and National Geographic specials and Mutual of Omaha and Wild Kingdom and all of that stuff. Those hero scientists, which we don't have too many of those any more."" (http://www.cinecon.com/news.php?id=0412231). And certainly those nearly drab escapades were, like the recent ""Team America: World Police"" ripe for parody.Other than the language this film would be perfect for family viewing: there are howlingly funny scenes and less attention paid to strictly adult themes than might be expected. What we really should appreciate is Murray's work; just watching him (could he be less in shape?) as an ""action star"" is enough to reward us, to appreciate how out of type he is and how well he pulls it off. Murray (http://www.darkhorizons.com/news04/aqua1.php) admits that """"This is by far the hardest film I've ever done and the most physically and emotionally demanding, personally and professionally and I think the most ambitious"" and we should admire the risk and the result.It is possible that only those with a natural sciences background will appreciate ""The Life Aquatic"". There are just enough counter-logical moments to enthrall the anti-anal among us; after pouring over charts, Bill Murray is heard to say to a protesting assistant regarding a heading ""Your course is 4 inches, mine is only 1-1/2 inches."" Several mentions are made as to the base unprofessional composition of the crew, and several technical glitches beyond the ken of the staff plague the entire voyage.Rating: Three Stars.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
125,Doublej20005,A Bit Style over Substance at Times but Still Great,8,28 February 2021,"Wes Anderson is a director who has made numerous masterpieces over the years, but a couple of his films (e.g. Moonrise Kingdom) do slightly fall under the 'style over substance' bracket, and that's my main issue with this film. Most of the substance we do get is phenomenal - Steve has a great character arc, and the more genuine character interactions we get really do work at further developing the characters beyond the stereotypes they are given at the beginning. But I think that, with such a wide and varied supporting cast, a lot of them are pretty one note. Besides Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston and Owen Wilson, none of them are particularly developed, and having so many of them makes the film feel a bit overstuffed at times. That and the runtime was slightly too long for me - a 100 minute runtime and a smaller supporting cast would have made the film a lot better.Still, the dramatic stuff is top notch, the visuals are marvellous from start to finish, the performances are all great, the humour is mostly really good, and the soundtrack is also just fantastic. Most of all though, it is for the most part really enjoyable. It is a bit style over substance at points, but when Wes Anderson is doing the style it's hard to complain too much.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
126,emryse,Thoroughly Wes Anderson,7,6 April 2021,"Out of all the films Wes Anderson has made, you would struggle to find one more Wes Anderson than this. As with his other films the cast is jampacked with stars, with some highlights being Jeff Goldblum and. Willem Dafoe but all the cast bring some great performances apart from perhaps Owen Wilson, who I felt didn't really show much emotion at times, just kind of smiled awkwardly and talked.The cinematography in this film is great, as you expect from Wes Anderson, and it has some pretty massive sets, an amazing soundtrack and is overall a very solid film. However, while on paper this film seems great, in reality it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea. Not all the jokes land, characters motivations aren't always clear and the story jumps around a bit. This isn't one of Wes Andersons best films, but it is a very Wes Anderson film, a lot of people probably won't love this film but it's worth trying out, if for nothing but Willem Dafoe's German accent. :)",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
127,Balthazar-5,Why is it strange?,8,14 June 2005,"I ask the question because so many intelligent and not so intelligent critics have dubbed it 'strange' or 'odd'. The simple fact is that nearly all films, serious or funny, have either strange people or strange situations in them.Perhaps it is largely strange more because of its visual style than its content. In particular, the amazing cutaway boat (all praise to Mark Friedberg) gives the film the impression of a comic book without the histrionics (in the main) that tends to go with such a genre.Murray is fine, Huston is fine, Wilson is great, but with, perhaps, less of a part than he needed.Like Rushmore, that this film seems to recall more than Tennenbaums, this is the story of somebody trying to do something that he ""shouldn't"", and succeeding.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

You can't get away with showing modern movie audiences goofy special effects, you can't be simultaneously serious and ,yet, off-the-wall hilarious. You can't bend genres. You can't have intelligent writing with spontaneous improvisation. You can't implicitly break the 4th dimension!Then again, Writer-Director Anderson's work is so entertaining and so different from most other Hollywood creations that perhaps we should just let him go on breaking the rules.This movie is wistfully reminiscent of ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore"" while having a life of it's own. It's more sophisticated and ambitious.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
129,SquirePM,In this modern age...,1,22 January 2005,"In this modern age we always have a choice in how to measure things. We can take the high-tech approach or we can go low-tech. As an example, let us refer to a common phrase that we all think we understand, yet so very few of us have ever actually measured. Using the low-tech approach would require two things we already have available to us, a common ruler and any old portable timepiece, be it a wrist watch, a wind-up clock or a battery powered clock. Then we would have only to go outside and hunt around for a while until we found a snail, lay the ruler down next to it and observe the passage of time until we had enough data to compute what a snail's pace is. Or, using the high-tech method, we could go see this movie, with its tens of millions of dollars expended on marvelous cameras and the latest in lighting, and I guess some CGI too. This method would also reveal the meaning of snail's pace although it would cost us money and an interminable amount of our time. But at least it would give this film some purpose, a slight usefulness that it lacks standing on its own. It's your choice, but I recommend the ruler-and-watch method. It's cheaper, faster and a lot less infuriating.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
130,Boggman,Waterworld.....,6,10 June 2005,"""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is an odd & fairly amusing movie with little splashes of comedy throughout. While not a great movie, its worth a one time watch.Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) is a documentary film maker (he makes ocean/aquatic related films), who seems to be losing his edge with the public. When his assistant Esteban is murdered by an unknown sea creature that Steve labels ""The Jaguar Shark"" while shooting a documentary, he decides to exact his revenge by filming a ""Part 2"" in which he seeks out to find the creature.Along for the ride are his team of loyal companions, including newcomers Jane (Cate Blanchett), who is writing an article on Steve; and Ned (Owen Wilson), who has mysteriously appeared as Steve's long lost son (although neither are sure if Steve is actually the father) The movie consists of some pretty funny gags while on Steve's boat, and is quite colorfully filmed. The digital animation of the sea creatures is also a nice humorous touch. Basically the movie follows the relationships of Steve and his crew, along with the developing relationship Steve is having with Ned and Jane.Steve is played very low-key by Murray, and the performance pays off. Blanchett is fantastic as always, an Owen Wilson does some fine work as the subtly quiet Kentucky raised Ned.The script in ""The Life Aquatic"" isn't that strong, and the real presence of the film is easily formed by its established actors and colorful direction. The humor of the movie is geared more towards older adults (30+); and younger twenty somethings, teenagers, and children will no doubt find the movie pretty boring.However, as a film for adults, ""The Life Aquatic"" manages to stay afloat without sinking.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
131,daveisit,"Hey, Paint Your House",7,22 April 2005,"The Life Aquatic spends a lot of time setting up an adventure which ultimately gives closure but takes a long time coming. While we are waiting, a fantastic character comedy takes place. A slightly off beat and quirky script allows the audience a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood dribble. Writers Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach should be applauded. The entire cast without any exceptions are absolutely brilliant. Bill Murray has to be one of the most underrated actors going around. This is not to say he is not recognised as a talent. More that he has an ability to be convincing in both a serious and comical role.Perhaps the biggest highlight from the movie are the sounds of the scuba diving and battle sequence tracks, reminiscent of the early 80's video games.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
132,the_Poppuns,"I loved it,",10,31 December 2004,"but I'm not 100% sure I know what happened. (spoilers) This movie reminded me of Big Fish in a way. With both movies, you leave the theater not sure what was reality and what was just a fish story. At one point in the Life Aquatic, when it suddenly becomes more of an action film, I thought 'okay this whole thing is a film within a film'. But by the end, I wasn't so sure. And the thing is, I really don't care. I enjoyed it either way, and would be perfectly happy to never find out.Willem Dafoe. In a perfect world he'd win an Oscar for this performance. I've loved him since I first saw him in Streets of Fire. IMO, this is his best work. He was so fantastic, that even the pom-pom on his hat was expressive.Bill Murray. I don't know if this was specifically written for him but once you've seen it you can't imagine anyone else in the part. I loved how he was caring and indifferent at the same time. He seemed to walk that line, if there is one, very easily.This movie is just joyous. There are some scenes in it, that I don't know how they ever got through without giggling. But I don't think it's just a comedy either. I think it's a love story. I've read some reviews that have said that there isn't any sentimentality. They must have gone to the bathroom for two hours. Unless the only way they identify emotion is if someone is crying their eyes out. I thought this movie was so sweet. Even if it was saccharin, it was still sweet. Everyone seemed to care and be really openhearted. Especially Klaus, but everyone wanted to be loved and they were willing to put themselves out there first. You had two characters vying over a wife, two characters vying over a father, two characters vying over a woman who was vying for someone else's husband, people going to rescue someone that would get left behind in most movies, mementos from days long gone, someone who just loved Ziggy, everyone's sorrow over leaving a friend behind... people were emoting all over the place. And I want them to love me, too. I want to be part of Team Zissou. :) The soundtrack is great. The costume design is great. The yellow submarine is great. I'd really like to see it again.

133,hhfarm-1,Some good lines but overall dull and contrived quirkiness,4,23 June 2006,"Ever go to a family gathering, eg. a Thanksgiving, with someone you just met? The family thinks that they're really different and goes out of their way to prove it to you: there are a million inside jokes, none of which are ever explained to you; they laugh constantly at the simplest lines; everyone has a quirk or two which is revealed to you with great glee; they're forever saying how you'll ""get it"" if you manage to survive the holiday hahahahahahaha.If you enjoy this kind of thing, you may like Wes Anderson. ""Royal Tennenbaums"" was just an extended version of a weird family. Much like most theatre, the characters speak in isolation from any plot or character development so that the fabric of the story is unnecessary. The author merely intends to grind his/her point home.""Life Aquatic"" is a variation on this theme: Bill Murray's extended family is on his boat and a quest for a killer shark. Various family problems/ issues surface and are worked out (or not). No one really interacts with any depth: it's as if they're each in a separate bubble that slightly rubs against other bubbles. There's no chemistry, depth, feeling, character development, consistency.Anderson's defenders no doubt love this ""quirky"" feel as it's so like real families who don't actually interact. Yeah, OK, maybe on stage people are like this.One of the tragedies here is Bill Murray. He's been sleepwalking through movies for 10+ years. He's always the same guy who mostly watches as the world goes by, occasionally delivering a funny line. Here it's just more of that, but sometimes in a scuba outfit.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
134,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Anderson's Most Ambitious Adventure To Date,8,16 January 2005,"Internationally renowned oceanographer Steve Zissou is about to embark on his most ambitious adventure to date. He is vividly determined to avenge his partner's death by tracking down the elusive and mysterious Jaguar Shark, should it even exist at all, that ate his best friend during the filming of their last documentary together and destroy it. Joining the rest of Team Zissou for the voyage are a young co-pilot from Kentucky named Ned Plimpton, who may or may not be Steve Zissou's son, and a magazine journalist sent to interview the documentarian for a cover profile. Unfortunately, the expedition does not go as smoothly as might have been planned. Steve not only has to deal with his co-producer and estranged wife, the brains behind the operation, but also a severe lack of funding, pirates, a kidnapping, and a near mutiny. The story for The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou may appear to an unfortunately substantial majority of the viewing audience as an ambitious retelling of the classic sea-legend of Moby Dick but thankfully Anderson's noble storyline effort has far more heart then that. Simply put, this is about a man who comes to the realization that he is a failure in life, both as a scientist and as a family man. Zissou's redemption near the end of the film is that he never was what the commercialization or even his own personality on screen built him up be beyond that of a vivid storyteller. That is who Steve Zissou is to Steve Zissou. And, though it may not seem like much to some people, it is a decent enough existence for him and he comes to accept it, be it requiring the loss of a close friend to fully comprehend this revelation.True, his name included within the title of the film automatically deems him the focus of the feature in the eyes of an awaiting audience, but beyond the simplistic, Bill Murray's sarcastic nature and suppressed appearance defines the character of Steve Zissou and gathers the full attention of those who come to the understanding of Wes Anderson's brilliant screenplay. After losing his best friend to the mysterious Jaguar shark, Zissou's world comes crashing down around him and failure confronts him in almost every aspect of his life. His explanation to Ned as to why he did not want to become a father to him, or to anyone else for that matter, may strike some people as overtly harsh at first but as one digs deeper into the failure of Steve's life that he is just coming to realization of, it eventually becomes quite reasonable and even acceptable. Owen Wilson, who has become yet another staple of a Wes Anderson film, works well opposite Murray in the role of Ned Plimpton, or as he is later called Kingsley Zissou, a man who may or may not be Steve's only son. The conversations the two of them have throughout the film, the most notable being the scene where Ned tries to come up with a nickname to call Steve, opens the audience up to the difficulty they have establishing a relationship together as family. Cate Blanchett, who by sheer luck for the role became pregnant right before shooting began on the film, radiates on screen, both literally and figuratively, as magazine journalist Jane Winslett-Richardson who comes aboard this voyage to interview Steve Zissou. Several moments of comic relief, possibly the only instances where members of the audience bored with the rest of the film may recall enjoying, come in the form of Willem Dafoe as Klaus Daimler. Despite there being a clear abundance of odd-ball characters aboard Team Zissou, Steve being among them, Klaus stands clearly above the rest of the supporting cast, offsetting the film's more seriously toned atmosphere and message.Overall, and with all joking aside, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is without a doubt writer/director Wes Anderson's most ambitious adventure to date as few beyond his consistently increasing circle of cult followers, and quite possibly even a meager amount within, will judge the face value of the film beyond what is skimmed on the surface. The problem with films such as this one is they tend to perform better, critically and financially, in two key areas  one, as a word of mouth picture (sadly to say, this film failed to receive much of a substantial backing despite sold out shows in New York and LA), or secondly, strictly as a DVD or VHS rental. The Life Aquatic, and, to be honest, most Wes Anderson films in general, is one of those rare films that require numerous viewings with careful attention to details and specific lines of dialogue in order to fully obtain the emotional direction and deliberately embedded message the filmmaker is attempting to express. In all likelihood, The Life Aquatic will end up being a financial failure for Touchstone Pictures, given the fifty million dollar production budget and its less then impressive opening weekend numbers in wide release, but in giving them credit there are few studios this year that can stand proud and claim that their film was a noble financial failure if anything else. Yes, the pacing of the film is gradual and not everything that is touched on thematically in the film is laid out on a silver plate for everyone to indulge in but perhaps that is reason enough why this film should be appreciated more then it has been. Those that walk away from this film appreciating it not only for its breathtaking cinematography and creative backgrounds but also for its ingenious style of direction, brilliant use of dialogue, and thematic messages that require actual thought, will give The Life Aquatic more then any money in the world could.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
135,garyvanhorn,I can't decide if I like the movie or not.,5,11 January 2011,"The Life Aquatic is difficult to pin down as a film. I can't say I really liked the film but I didn't think it was bad either. It occupies a sort of limbo. There are flashes of brilliance in the film, poignant moments and at times genuinely funny in a very creative and original manner, but for some intangible reason it just doesn't come together as a cohesive work.The film centers around an aging oceanographer named Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) and his crew as they set about making a documentary. After losing a crewman to the ""jaguar shark"" Zissou sets out to get revenge. Before the journey begins he meets with Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) who may be his son. Plimpton joins the crew and sets off with his father into the high seas. Also joining them is Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett), a reporter working on a story that could revive Zissou's flagging career. Zissou and his crew intermittently annoy and spar with arch-rival oceanographer Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) and that rivalry is pure comedy gold.The story is very offbeat and at times completely silly, yet the movie never truly embraces the comedic aspects nor does it fully explore the serious sub plots that litter the film. Without an identity the movie seems to wander from scene to scene, not quite connected but still telling a story of sorts. The movie has true potential that is never quite realized, leaving me to recommend that perhaps you see it, but don't expect too much.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

I mean, what is this crap? The story is about a sea captain who is like Jacque Cousteou or some sort, trying to find some sea creature that ate his friend.This was so boring I could not believe it. I like art house movies but this is plain stupid. The biggest disappoint for me is Bill Murray's career. What happened to him? He came out in Caddyshack and was one of the first cast members of Saturday Night Live! Do you become not funny as you grow older or is he just bad in choosing his script? I have no clue but I talked to that friend who loaned me his screener copy and his response to my question is that Bill Murray is trying to be like Tom Hanks, someone who has done both comedy and serious acting, with critical acclaim.All I can say is he should return to his comedic roots; if not, try to pick a better script.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
137,jax713,An o.k. video rental,4,26 August 2006,"Visually splendid, good casting, and an original story idea combine to make this an interesting video rental because it offers new flavor combinations the way Dots candy comes in so many colors. Bill Murray has suddenly aged into a romantic lead, something I find hysterically funny...and unbelievable. I can see men with similar machismo any day of the week at my local grocery store. Granted they may not have Murray's comedic talent, but that's beside the point. While older women in films have gotten more buff, I really hope Murray isn't going to be the new standard for male screen lovers because that just isn't fair. His deadpan persona and doughy looks cannot convey anything near the magnetism that an old Jack Nicholson or Sean Connery still do with their balding heads and paunchy middles. Having Murray portray such a character is asking - and presuming - too much of women moviegoers. It's a type of propaganda that is just as insidious as the silicone and pouty lip female love object. I can't say, as others do, that Anderson is some kind of cinema genius because his films always look like experiments to me. Surely as he matures, his films will also mature into the kind of stories that will engage me enough to forget the time instead of wondering ""How long is this movie?"" or ""What is the point?"" Anderson may be a current trendy object of admiration for a small segment of movie fans, but for me he is still in middle school, where I can smile at his film projects because they present a youngster's enthusiasm and love of the craft. Memorable? No. Entertaining? Only slightly and mainly because of the casts he assembles...you can leave the screen for a trip to the john and not miss much. Charming? Kind of, like a kid who tries so hard to impress. For me, the best thing about The Life Aquatic was watching Willem Dafoe portray a character so completely off the map that it took me a few minutes to recognize him. He is a scream here and I'd love to see him in a real comedy. The video revolution is great for many reasons and one of the biggest is that you don't have to pay full theater price to watch would-be film makers' experiments. Just because something is different, doesn't make it better and Anderson needs to work on getting the ""home movie"" feeling out of his films.

As far as ""dramatic-development"" goes, it does not meet the targets it sets for itself - rather, the important dramatic elements it works so (terribly) hard to setup have no power left by the time we get to them. There are quite a few dramatic red herrings also i.e. The pregnancy (?).I had to constantly check with myself that I was indeed following what really is a simple story, however the over-complicated script made me resent the input of certain characters and the downplay of others.Bill Murray character is BY FAR the most interesting character, but even his portrayal could seem inconsistent. There a very few deliberate jokes, rather Steve Zissou's perplexing character sort of bumbles through situations acting on impulse and compromising his integrity to fulfill the goal(s) he's set out to do (which I couldn't remember).

I got this for my birthday just a little while ago; I did plan on seeing it so that worked out nicely. Steve Zissou is a washed up oceanographer who makes documentaries and swears revenge upon a mythical jaguar shark that ate his friend right in front of him. The main idea of the story is to invoke revenge upon the jaguar shark (i.e. blow it up). Right in the beginning we're introduced to Ned, who may or may not be Steve's son. Steve ends up taking him under his wing and makes him a part of Team Zissou. Together possible father and possible son hunt the jaguar shark. The over all movie does concentrate on the hunt, even though at some points it really doesn't seem like it. The movie isn't laugh out loud funny either.

142,HiddenVoice,"A very original , offbeat and fascinating disappointment that is worth watching",8,12 April 2006,"I refrained from writing a review to this film, mainly due to my disappointment towards this film.Along with this ,I HEART HUCKABEES was one of the films I highly anticipated, films that I was looking forward to.However, HUCKABEES disappointed me as well at first.But after two or three times of viewing I fell in love with that film.Steve Zissou's partner has been eaten by a supposed Jaguar Shark.He declares to track down the shark and kill it.Then as he is about to begin,he discovers that he has a son that he never new existed,or may be he did.So him and his son and the rest of the crew embark on a journey that is less ordinary and sad and pretty weird.Coming off with satisfaction in the end.Here it is a different story.Watching it the very first time,I saw something offbeat, original , fascinating and a bit touching even when the film was lacking emotional impact.However, I was expecting far more.The film had many WES ANDERSON touches but it felt distant from his previous achievements, and didn't felt like a WES ANDERSON film sometimes.His serious-comedy attitude was at times absent.It was a completely different approach made by him and I admire his work but there was somethin' that kept me disappointed.After repeated viewing I was satisfied, just satisfied.No more ,no less.Not that it contains hilarious moments or something.It's a DRAMEDY and it works that way.It's just that it neither focuses on the drama nor the comedy well.It may be a disappointment but a rather fascinating one, an interesting one that still entertains and makes you laugh while also feel a little sad for the characters,which are brought to life.Its dry,quirky humor really works most of the time. That is because it had Bill Murray in the lead role,finally collaborating with Anderson again.Whatever role you throw him in ,he always stuns you with his performance,always leaves his mark of perfection and you can't help it but love him.I love his comic talents.They are different from all those comic actors.Here that is only half true.The rest of the cast is just on par.Wilson and Blanchett both shine in their parts,Dafoe is great as usual.The performances and the film felt shallow and sometimes Murray looks really bored,sometimes bored to death.There are those awkward ,weird moments that are funny but they never connect to the story and most of the time you have no idea what the hell are they doing.It seems like as if they really were shooting a documentary without a plot.Sometimes the plot seemed implausible and unconvincing.And a whole lot of time it looked like a mess going no where.When I reviewed this film I never felt like giving it a high score.It probably didn't deserve it or I liked the score I gave now.It's a unique film in its own way.It's one of my sidelined films,that need no comparison with other films.Every time I watch it ,I like it even more.It makes me feel good and leaves a smile on my face.But still by the end,it leaves me with a mixed reaction.On the plus side the sets were very wonderfully created.The Belofonte was a revelation and the crew of documentary filmmakers was funny.It was creative and wildly imaginative design,really quirky.This is a film worth watching ,especially when you are a WES ANDERSON fan. This Aquatic life of Steve Zissou is still charming and successful despite its disappointments.Maybe repeated viewings will get you liking this film a lot.B.....3.4/5",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
143,dutchs-1,What Didn't Work?,6,28 March 2009,"I just rented this film and I'm still trying to sort out what went flat. It has a top notch cast. The story line has several intricately intertwined threads with a bunch of rich interpersonal relationships to explore (the plot line about the shark is almost peripheral). The behavior of Zissou's crew is realistic (I've been on a research vessel) and the cutaway set used to portray movement about the ship in continuous scenes is ingenious. And yet halfway through I was thinking ""man, this is tedious."" Not boring - I was never tempted to fast-forward - but tedious. It's shelved as a comedy in my video store, but the scene where Owen Wilson drops into the water without his breather, maybe half an hour into the film, was the first laugh, and nearly the only one.I think it's that Bill Murray just drags when he's trying to do drama. He can play comedic roles with serious overtones (Groundhog Day) but it this film he seemed more lethargic than anything else. Everyone else seemed to have OD'd on Prozac as well. In fact Owen Wilson was the principal spark of life in the film. Honorable mention to crewman Klaus, who is an emotional rival to Wilson for Zissou's friendship. (Did anyone else half expect Klaus to turn out to be another long lost son of Zissou? It didn't happen, in case you're wondering.) There are some downright dumb things in the film, though they don't account for the overall flabbiness of the movie. The underwater scenes are self-consciously hokey. They start off in Italy, sail just a few days and are hijacked by Filipino pirates. At this point the film loses control and careens between suspenseful, comic and tragic so awkwardly it's as if they pulled scenes at random out of a hat. The crew is blindfolded and terrified of being murdered. Yet somehow they never disarmed everybody. Zissou gets loose and he and the pirates shoot it out, spraying bullets like crazy without hitting anyone, except for one pirate, who gets killed. The pirates, armed with automatic weapons, flee from one guy armed with a Glock. A Glock with a 500-round clip, apparently, but still. They track the pirates down to their lair, where Zissou finds that rival Jeff Goldblum's whole crew has been murdered. Yet after they rescue Goldblum, all he can talk about is the need to ""crew up from scratch."" A tragic ending to a film is just fine if there's a legitimate dramatic reason for it. Owen Wilson dying in a helicopter crash just as they're closing in on the shark seems more like it's merely tacked on to jerk us around.The R rating is for a few perfunctory scenes where a script girl appears topless, plus the odd F-bomb. If you saw this edited for an airline movie or TV, you'd never even know they cut anything.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
144,underfire35,One May Have To Test The Water Before Swimming With These Guys..............,7,22 July 2005,"As THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU opens, we meet famed oceanographer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), who is premiering his latest ""adventure"" to an audience in France. During this recent expedition, a member of the crew, Esteban (Seymour Cassel), is killed by what Zissou contends to be a ""jaguar shark."" When asked if he will continue to seek this mystical creature, he states that he is going to find it and kill it. From the brief description above, it may be hard to imagine these opening scenes as being humorous, but they are. They also serve as the spark point for the ""plot"" of THE LIFE AQUATIC, which is the latest surreal comedic drama from director Wes Anderson, who has taken as his inspiration the films of Jacque Cousteau. Now I have put the word plot in quotation marks because most of the sequences in AQUATIC serve as vignettes, each with distinct internal stories, that in an indirect way advance the actual story (the quest for the shark). This is made all the more apparent by brief interludes of a crew member, played by Seu Jorge, performing David Bowie tunes in french. These scenes with Jorge (who also translated the songs) serve almost like a curtain in a play, something that obscures the transition to the next act. This theatrical tone is also present in the large cross section mock-up of the ship which Anderson uses for more lengthy tracking shots (which would have been impossible on a real ship). This is the technique that is employed as the ship is explored and the crew introduced: Eleanor Zissou (Angelica Houston), Steve's wife and the ""brains of the operation""; Klaus Daimler (Willem Dafoe), a German seaman with emotional problems; Vladimir Wolodarsky (Noah Taylor who was great in SHINE) is the communications/radar operator who also composes the music for the Zissou films using two small Casio keyboards (AQUATIC's actual score, by Mark Mothersbaugh, is wonderfully cheesy); various members of the underwater camera crew and the ship's ""interns"" who are put to manual labor and other unpleasant tasks. There are also many subplots: one involving Zissou's producer, Oseary Drakoulias (Micheal Gambon), who continues to have problems generating funds for the antiquated cinematic adventures of the fading oceanographer. There is also Zissou's rivalry (both professionally and personally) with a well financed ""corporate"" explorer (Jeff Golblum). Jane (Cate Blanchett), an attractive reporter, joins the crew to write a story about the ship's exploits. She ends up falling for Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) who may or may not be Zissou's biological son.As you can probably deduce, THE LIFE AQUATIC has a vast array of story lines and characters. It is for this reason that the actual plot (shark revenge) is kept open and abstract. Anderson is more concerned with the interplay of the large cast than with any linear progression of the story. It is this fragmented style that allows the film to diverge in many bizarre directions. The humor of AQUATIC is very dry and self-effacing, which helps in the transitions from wacky physical humor to warmhearted drama to fairly graphic violence. It is actually the scenes involving foreign pirates who hijack Zissou's ship, and the subsequent resolution during a rescue operation, where I laughed the most. I'm not sure what that says about me, per se, but it is to Anderson's credit that such episodes do not sabotage the entire film. That said, the unevenness of the events feel somewhat disjointed at times and if a viewer does not accept Anderson's sly tongue-in-cheek humor, THE LIFE AQUATIC could give the aesthetic of a jumbled mess. One has to, in a certain sense, ""dive"" into AQUATIC, suspending disbelief and rolling with the choices the director has made. I do respect the film for taking chances and not pandering to popular taste, but for a production that received such a large theatrical release it would seem to have somewhat limited appeal. THE LIFE AQUATIC seems to be continuation of director Wes Anderson's overall vision. The one thing that it does suffers from is that his previous film, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, was damn near perfect. To make such a film so early in one's career, means that all others will be measured against that high-water mark. Now this is, admittedly, unfair but I am going to do it anyway. AQUATIC lacks the chemistry in the cast of THE ROYAL TENEBAUMS (or RUSHMORE for that matter), which makes this large ensemble piece feel a bit clunky. Anderson seemed more sure of who to use and when for the right effect in TENEBAUMS. This was helped by an extraordinary central performance by Gene Hackman who was much more giving and low key in contrast to Bill Murray. Murray is good, but has a performance style that is somewhat distracting. Actually many of the leads (Murray, Defoe and Goldblum included) each have such a distinct presence that they don't blend as smoothly into the larger work. Wilson, Blanchett, Gambon, and particularly Angelica Houston, seem to understand the dynamic better. They downplay their parts, which is especially crucial in the oddly sweet relationship between Jane and Ned. THE LIFE AQUATIC takes a while to get going, but in the end, I enjoyed the film. There are many memorable moments and clever asides and I applaud the filmmakers for using stop-motion animation (produced by Henry Selick of NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas fame), not CGI in the creation of the film's many whimsical sea creatures. It is Wes Anderson's knack for character design and ultimately his (borderline obsessive) attention to the smallest details that continue to make his films a rewarding experience. 7/10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
145,marimbadaddy,Two hours of my life I won't get back,2,12 November 2005,"With a spectacular cast, beautiful scenery, and an interesting premise, Life Aquatic would hope to be a great film. Unfortunately, the producers forgot that you also need a fluid script, and a good editor to make a good film. At least the actual film echoes the fiction in the movie of the bumbling inconsistent leadership of the project's leader. If one looks at the film in that perspective, it is a work of genius in life imitating art.The film is weird and quirky. That is it's best quality. And if that is what you are into, then this would be a great film. The actors do a great job with the little scraps of soul that the screenwriters actually included on the page. (We assume that there was in fact a written script as there is a great cast, many of which are experienced enough to read into, and make good judgments on a script.) There is a very subtle depth to each character, but the actual interaction between the characters falls way off target, probably because it didn't exist on the page.With Bill Murray as the lead I was expecting laughs. The best I got was a mild half grunt at one of the really weak jokes. The main character, Steve Zissou smokes marijuana constantly throughout the piece. Perhaps that is what the audience should do to make this seem funny. Perhaps that is what the writers, producers, director, and crew were doing throughout the process, in the effort to make life imitate art.The cinematography is inconsistent. There are times in which the camera was shaky, like the director was going for a documentary feel, and other times the camera was rock steady. These times are not easily confused when the audience is looking through the on camera -documentary camera which is supposedly held by a middle-eastern cast member.The editing is poor as the movie is exceedingly slow paced. There are extraordinarily long gaps at the end of scenes or moments in the dialog where one can only surmise that they were going to put in a laugh track to help let the audience know where the humorous moments were to allegedly occur. The poor cinematography is also highlighted by the editing as one scene goes from shaky to solid, back and forth.If you are a Bill Murray fan, you will want to see this as he is as sarcastic as ever. But expect to be disappointed and unfulfilled by the overall lack of a plot. I'm glad I rented this, and didn't spend the eight bucks to sit through it in a theater. Then I'd really be upset.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
146,imdb-45,"Hilarious, requires knowledge of older documentaries, hits or misses",8,25 August 2016,"If you're over 30 or 40 you've probably seen the older documentaries. My parents are big fans of Cousteau stuff, which is really dated by today's standards. This film is a quirky, very funny parody of a ocean explorer who is well past his prime. His old films are the over the top, contrived but supposedly spontaneous majestic ocean nature documentaries. And if you've seen them, it's funny. It's more of a character study of a team that is doing what it can to placate a legend in the field of oceanography and also can be a bunch of stooges, since the captain is focused on a senseless revenge mission.This is a totally hit or miss film. Like it or hate it. Get it or you don't get it. So I get the high ratings and think it's hilarious. The joy isn't in the plot itself as to what specifically happens but the funny journey along the way towards the unknown confrontation with an old enemy. There are some subplots, such as the ""is he or isn't he"" the abandoned son of the captain along with the love interest that is somewhat in between the Zissous.What I like about this film is that at least it is an original effort and not yet another rehash of something else. It's humorous, not intended to be taken seriously at all and completely an exaggeration and satire of a time that is long gone and probably relates far more to an older generation. This is why you'll see many ratings from younger people who just hate the film, not getting the joke that this is a Cousteau parody, something they have never seen or a time which they experienced.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
147,coldstick,Not Anderson's Best,5,17 August 2005,"I was a big fan of Anderson's Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums, but Life Aquatic was pretty average. Its flaws are pretty easy to pick out. The film is too long and predictable, and not very exciting. The dark humor and drama from Anderson's earlier works are missing. The pirates in the movie didn't seem to have much of a motive (except that there would have been even less story without them kidnapping someone for the crew to rescue), and there were too many characters (why was Jeff Goldblum even in this movie?). The one thing a movie like this would have had going for it was the laugh department, but sadly, it didn't deliver much there. There was a lot of potential in this flick, but in the end, it didn't amount to much. I wouldn't really recommend it unless you're a die-hard Anderson fan.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
148,segratz,A disappointing Anderson Film,1,27 December 2004,"I like Wes Anderson films - I enjoyed Royal Tennanbaums and Rushmore. They both had a strange quality to them, with this weird alterna music that appealed to me. I HATED this movie. His movies are becoming almost formulaic - Anderson attempts to do the same thing he's done in all his movies, and this time it fails horribly. The characters lack emotion and the story is boring to watch. The father-son relationship that is established is eye-rolling bad, and the ending is unsatisfying. PLUS Anderson's directing and editing is sloppy - his shots are imperfect, imbalanced, and distracting. Example: In one scene you see Kate Blanchett's character interviewing Bill Murray - in the background there is a kitten. Every time they show Bill Murray that cat is in some different spot, or not visible at all! I have no idea what Murray was talking about because the poor directing made me lose focus. Or maybe it was shot that way on purpose - but that seems really stupid to me.I went with three others to this film, and we were all hugely disappointed with it. So were most other theatergoers I heard when we walked out. This time around, I just didn't 'get it.' BEWARE! Especially if you didn't like other Anderson films.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
149,elitt,A Slow Expedition,4,1 June 2005,"I guess I don't like Wes Anderson's movies. I sort of enjoyed ""Rushmore"", but I never got into ""Royal Tenebaums"", and this movie bored me to tears. Bill Murray plays Steve Zissou, a sort of Jacque Cousteau type explorer, who goes on a quest to seek out revenge on a jaguar shark that killed his friend on a previous expedition. Zissou and his crew are a group of eccentrics including a Portugese guy who likes to sing David Bowie songs. There's also an abundance of sub plots including one crew member who maybe Zissou's real son.Murray has completely redefined his career from a fun loving guy who made comedies for the masses to a cranky fellow who now takes on more serious dead pan roles in smaller films. I like the old Murray who made me laugh in ""Stripes"" and ""Groundhog Day"". This new Murray seems very grumpy and watching him on screen I get the impression that he would rather be doing something else. This might be an unfair assessment but Murray used to make me laugh. He doesn't anymore.This movie has its moments. It's clever at times and I thought many of the little creatures were cool and imaginative, but man is this movie slow. It took forever to get going and once it did, I didn't care if he found the fish or not. Wes Anderson's movies are all like this and generally all star the same cast. He is very clever at times with his writing and there are parts in all of his films that make me laugh and smile, but he shoots on such a dead pan level and at such a slow pace that this viewer gets bored.

150,Toph-22,Typical Anderson,7,21 December 2020,"I´m a big fan of Bill Murray and I like Wes Anderson respectively his way of directing movies. Movies by Anderson are not classic comedies. They are comedies mixed with a kind of fantasy elements.The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou clearly bears his signature. You notice this relatively quickly after inserting the movie. I always like it when you can tell who the director is just by the way it´s made. The Life Aquatic triggers exactly that feeling.There are several characters, each of which is special and remain in the memory. The dialogues are often funny and there are a lot of affectionate moments. The locations are exceptional and rich in detail throughout.That all sounds very good for now. Unfortunately, the story could not convince me. The story is definitely unique and imaginative. However, you get the feeling that individual subplots do not contribute to the overall plot. As a consequence, the story often runs into nothing.Nevertheless, a good movie which you can watch safely. If you´re a fan of Anderson´s movies, you can´t go wrong anyway.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
151,Lt_Coffey_182,Excellent use of imagination fronted by an excellent cast,8,9 February 2007,"As a big fan of Wes Anderson and Bill Murray, Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou was a real must see for me and I'm glad to say I really enjoyed it. As with all of Anderson's films, this is not a hilarious comedy, it opts for subtlety instead of obvious jokes which perfectly suits the pacing of the film and its context. In terms of nonsense and lunacy, Life Aquatic far outstrips Anderson's previous work which is definitely a good thing as it compensates for the lack of obvious gags. As with Royal Tennenbaums, Anderson finely balances between comedy and tragedy, making sure that all human emotions are accounted for in hope of reaching the audience on some sort of level which is achieved in this film with an immensely personal storyline that runs parallel with Tennenbaums; estranged fathers building a relationship with their offspring after they have grown up. Whilst this issue is more ambiguously approached in Life Aquatic, it is still done with sensitivity and sincerity and thickens up the crazy plot with a gentle undertone. The relationship between Zissou (Murray) and Ned (Owen Wilson) is very interesting as their relationship develops from strangers to a much closer relationship. There is a great emphasis placed on social relationships as the film not only investigates Steve and Ned's relationship but that between Steve and most of the cast. This must clearly reflect Anderson's opinion on human nature, possibly that people are shaped by their interactions with other people.Anderson's distinctive style is all over this picture; the narrative structured out in stage play format is the most obvious aspect but it is Anderson's wild imagination and experimental set designs that make the film so enjoyable. The scene where Zissou introduces Ned and the audience to his boat is beautiful as it feels so intimate and flowing. The stop motion creatures used in the film are not especially realistic but they add to the films seemingly magical element and to the surreal context of the plot. Clearly, Anderson was given a much bigger budget for this film which sometimes ruins directors but with Life Aquatic, it has helped a director's extraordinary vision to be realised without compromise. The uniform design is very funny and the way that each crew member's red beanie has a slightly different design is another subtle quirk within the film (I now own a replica of Ned's beanie!).Once again, Anderson has provided an all star cast who all give understated but great performances. All understated that is, with the exception of Bill Murray! Although he is not displaying his trademark sarcastic wit, he is completely wired; yelling profanities and emptying pistol clips at a rate of seconds. Murray gives such an enjoyable performance but underlying this is a vulnerable performance which garners a great deal of sympathy as a character past his prime or is he? His grief at the loss of Esteban seemed very genuine and his self loathing was portrayed very convincingly. Owen Wilson is in somewhat of a departure to his usual role as the obnoxious side character as Ned is much more sensitive and much more poignant in the film. I really liked Wilson after seeing this and You, Me and Dupree was brilliant at infusing his previous persona with this performance. Blanchett, Huston, Goldblum and Dafoe are all brilliant as the supporting cast, each adding layer upon layer on the emotionally rich plot. Dafoe's character as the fiercely loyal German who is constantly worried about his importance is an exceptional character who provides laughs and appears to be the glue holding the Belafonte together. Life Aquatic is a great example of an ensemble cast working as it showcases brilliant actors who all have so many different things to offer performance wise.The music in the film is simply brilliant. The idea of having Su Jorge perform David Bowie songs in Portuguese was an inspired decision as it makes the audience react to the song but also is greeted with unfamiliarity as the lyrics are alien to what we're used to. It was also clever including him in the crew as it is believable that a member would bring an acoustic guitar along to provide some entertainment. The song during the boat shoot out by Iggy Pop is excellent and compliments the scene perfectly, almost as if it's the music video for the song. Also the music played in the crew's underwater earphones is simple but very enjoyable as it is just like a drum track that Zissou could well use for one of his scenes within the picture. The music seems to be part of the film, not just something to activate another one of the senses.The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou wonderfully demonstrates how strong imagination can be in a director's arsenal and how simple methods can be the most effective. Wes Anderson has firmly established himself as one of today's leading directors and writers and this film must surely be his masterpiece. Murray, after the excellent Lost in Translation, has firmly re-established himself in film after a couple of years in the wilderness and, as a massive fan of his, I am so glad. Memorable in so many ways, Life Aquatic is one of the best films I watched in 2006 as it had so much to offer, strongly recommended.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

The crew consists of quite a good cast of actors including Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe.After hearing some of my friends say good things about this film, I thought that I should see it.

I got caught up in Zissou-Mania in September of 2004, I went to see a movie at a local theater and the trailer for the film was shown, and I knew that I must see this film or I would die. It just looked so damn wonderful! I knew with Bill Murray, Willem DeFoe, and Jeff Goldblum on board I couldn't possibly be disappointed (and I wasn't). I was counting the days until this movie came out, I went and saw the film with the trailer (Shaun of the Dead) six times for it's own merits, but each time, the Life Aquatic trailer was there to welcome me back to my favorite seat. The day finally arrived that this came out, I drove 15 miles to a theater that had it (the first couple of weeks were limited release), I bought some Sour Patch Kids, a large orange soda, and some Junior Mints, sat in a seat near the screen-as I wished to be as near to the action as possible-and the show began. Wow! Just Wow! Everything I had hoped for had come true. Every part of the film, was just undeniably great. Bill Murray especially, was in top form-and this film was mostly finished before his Oscar nomination. If ever an actor made you believe he was who he was on screen, you must admit that it was Bill Murray as Steve Zissou. And what makes the performance even better, was that this film deviates from ""reality"" on a fairly regular basis. But for all the rainbow sea-horses, neon colored lizards, glowing jelly fish, and Jaguar sharks, I never-not even for a second-doubted that I was peering into a pivotal time in the lives of Steve Zissou, Ned ""Kingsley"" Plimpton, Clause Diamler, or even ""The Bond Company Stooge"".

And I had heard good things about this film. But this film bored me. I couldn't even sit through the whole thing. I tried so hard to keep my eyes open but it became so tedious I had to get up and leave. I don't know how many times I nearly fell asleep. I'm not saying it was a bad movie. It was just boring and there was no action at all. I guess I'm the kind of person who is more interested in films that actually have a climax. Or at least an interesting one. This film had no climax! And I was disappointed. I remember Owen Wilson and Bill Murray having a few funny lines but it still didn't keep me enthused. And I remember Owen Wilson having a terrible accent. I think it was supposed to be a Kentucky accent but it just didn't come out right. But I still love him.

As if that wasn't enough, Murray's quest also sees him deal with pirates and mount a hostage rescue ""manoeveur"" in some unexpectedly funny, exaggerated and exciting action sequences, mostly to the tune of some acoustic David Bowie.Murray's performance is great, and is well complemented by the supporting cast. Huston's sharp and indifferent comments make her coldly amusing, Dafoe's intense emotions and German accent make him very entertaining to watch, and Wilson's slight awkwardness make him endearing, as does his unconventional relationship with the somewhat lost pregnant journalist, played by Blanchett.If you are willing to check disbelief at the door and enjoy dry comedy, then this charming and surprising little film is one you shouldn't miss.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
157,brainofj72,A Beautiful Modern Fantasy,10,27 August 2005,"""The Life Aquatic"" is most certainly an unusual film. It's something of a collage of colorful imagery, fragmented shots, quirky music, strange characters, bizarre situations, and amusing montages. But if one had seen Wes Anderson's previous films, one would expect nothing less.It can't really be helped that there be a certain amount of hype around Anderson's name, after all, his films ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" both generated vast critical acclaim and three of this young director's four films have already received the Criterion DVD treatment. Is the buzz warranted? I say, absolutely. Anderson has created some of the most vibrant, vivid, unique, and off-beat films of the last decade, and ""The Life Aquatic"" is no exception.The film follows Steve Zissou (Murray), a formerly glorious oceanographer whose latest documentary, which is about his closest friend and colleague, Esteban, being eaten by a ""Jaguar Shark"", receives a less-than-glorious reception. Steve then announces he plans to set out on a voyage to film part two of his documentary, which will follow him and his crew as they attempt to track down the alleged ""Jaguar Shark"". Along for the ride is Ned (Wilson), someone who may or may not be Steve's son; Jane (Blanchett), an up-and-coming journalist doing a story on Zissou; Klaus (Dafoe), the eccentric German first mate; a Portugese, David Bowie-covering weapons expert; a no-nonsense tech expert; a usually semi-nude female crew-member; a band of unpaid interns; and several other quirky personalities. Other characters include Zissou's estranged wife, Eleanor (Huston), and her former husband, Alistair Hennessey (Goldblum). On the journey, the crew encounters money problems, relationship issues, and...pirates.The film takes place in a vivid world that is somewhat inside Steve's head. A colorful world where the creatures are claymation and where Steve can single-handedly ward off kidnapping, gun-wielding pirates to beat of The Stooges' ""Search and Destroy"".I do warn you though, if you are not a fan of dry humor, this one's most likely not for you. The movie's loaded with it, in all of its off-beat, tongue-in-cheek anti-glory.There are some wonderful acting performances throughout, including an exuberant Bill Murray, who just loses himself in the character of Zissou, a subdued Anjelica Huston, whose subtle sly grins and deadpan delivery develop her character far more than anything else, and a spirited Willem Dafoe, who manages to make a German accent sound funnier than I ever imagined it could.If you enjoyed ""Rushmore"", ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", ""Punch-Drunk Love"", or ""I Heart Huckabees"", then you most certainly should not let this charming, oddly beautiful little film pass beneath your radar.9.5/10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
158,feelinglistless,feels like a big screen remake of an old Hannah Barbara cartoon,8,28 August 2005,"Not a criticism, but The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou feels like a big screen remake of an old Hannah Barbara cartoon. You could imagine, some time in the 70s, in the style of the old Godzilla series, Steve and the crew discovering a new species each week with each episode ending with a short film of the animal they've found and one of those moralistic things saying how we should treat wildlife and the environment with respect. It's an oddly melancholy you see, filled with a sort of restless contemplation on lost innocence, which is possibly why people who have seen the film tend to be disappointed. It's funny, but in a sad way. You tend to laugh in that way people do over a beer remembering something which happened ten years before when everything was crazy.Much of this is to do with Bill Murray's performance. His work here is largely very understated -- he understands that Zissou's best years are behind him and that he's effectively playing a version of his old self for appearance sakes. To a degree that's actually were Murray was a few years ago turning up in the things like Larger Than Life with an elephant as a side kick, so thanks to Wes Anderson for Rushmore and saving Bill and us from the decline. There are moments when we get to see the Murray of old and in fact his Ghostbusters persona even pops up in one particularly unexpected scene.And thanks to Wes Anderson for this film. It's yet another recent example of a director exercising their own film making style, presenting the audience with a choice of following him or missing out on the discreet charms he is going to be offering. There are scenes which are entirely based on the audience needing to be in on the joke and judging by the almost silent crowd I watched it with I can only imagine we're a very small but lucky group.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

160,AW_McGOWAN,Just Another Wes Anderson Movie,5,30 November 2020,"Barring his wonderful animated features, Wes Anderson's movies are very hit-or-miss for me. While suitably entertaining, they always aim for style over substance, and that style can oftentimes feel gimmicky. 2004's ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is no exception to this rule.The story starts off pretty captivating. Bill Murray plays Steve Zissou, an aging television oceanographer. After an elusive Jaguar Shark eats his partner, the title character sets sail to avenge his comrade. Along the vengeful voyage, Zissou is accompanied by a quirky crew, a pregnant reporter (Cate Blanchett), and a man who may or may not be his son (Owen Wilson).Because this is a Wes Anderson film, the plot comes with a grain of salt. Starting in the very first scene, comedy downplays the revenge theme and the texture of Steve's universe feels apart from reality. This is, of course, highlighted through Anderson's signature visual tastes - symmetrical frames, vibrant colors, and CGI that intentionally lands somewhere south of realism.With such a great premise, I wish the movie leaned more towards adventure. While Zissou does come into contact with pirates, abandoned islands, and enemy oceanographers (the principal of which played by Jeff Goldblum), the world still feels oddly small. Meanwhile, subplots often get in the way of the hunt for the shark.If only ""The Life Aquatic"" could have narrowed its focus a bit. Then it wouldn't end up overfilling its plate. Personally, I would have preferred it to be a Wes Anderson-infused retelling of ""Moby Dick."" Others have made the connection between Melville's classic novel and this seafaring flick, but there is too much else going on in the film to sustain the association for me.Steve Zissou is no Ahab. He is a tired old man. In fact, he is one of the least likable characters that Bill Murray has portrayed, even if he does reach eventual redemption. All actors deliver fine performances in the movie, but none really stand out, except perhaps Willem Defoe as Zissou's ardently loyal right-hand-man, Klaus Daimler.""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is a lot to look at - intricate sets, bright colors, and a star studded cast. For those who enjoy Wes Anderson's take on cinema, it is enthralling and will probably satisfy on all fronts. For average moviegoers, though, blind to directorial staples and relishing in the medium for story rather than art, it doesn't quite stick.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
161,gurghi-2,Wes's World,8,2 January 2005,"While eviscerating ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" some are taking the opportunity to retroactively review Wes Anderson's entire output thus far. Having missed the boat, they're still sending us cables insisting that it is going to sink.They decry the singular design of his films and dismiss the considerable compassion and warmth with which he treats his characters. They ghettoize him as the latest ""savior of independent film-making"" (a straw-man argument if ever there was one) or they minimize his distinctiveness both as a visual stylist and a writer of comedy. Most unfortunately, they neglect to recognize how Anderson, through the visual, aural, and dramatic elements in his films, examines the act of film-making itself.Would it help to mention that Martin Scorsese named ""Bottle Rocket"" one of the ten best of the 1990's? To cite the literary and film predecessors to whom Wes Anderson is indebted, and how he fuses them into something all his own? To quote Kent Jones of _Film Comment_, who calls him ""the most original presence in film comedy since Preston Sturges""? No matter. Why Wes Anderson is derided and filmmakers such as David Gordon Green (""All the Pretty Girls,"" ""Undertow"") and Sam Mendes (""American Beauty,"" ""The Road to Perdition"") emperors whom, in my view, wear no clothes are heralded, is a mystery to me. I suspect it may have something to do with the unmistakable imprint Anderson leaves upon his films, and that as such they are not waiting to be discovered or explained by the arbiters of taste and importance.Yes, it's all here again in ""The Life Aquatic"": the taboo female, the fractured father-son relationship, the (increasingly, with each film) despicable protagonist, the folly of the showman, the crimped-together family of eccentrics, the intricacies and importance of correspondence, the font Futura, the iconic costumes, the popular-song score (an element warranting separate analysis), the seemingly arbitrary use of slow-motion. There is no mistaking a Wes Anderson film for anyone else's.And a Wes Anderson film is, first and foremost, a comedy, albeit one unlike the Adam Sandler-Will Farrell-Jim Carrey antic histrionics, bloated ""SNL""-style skits, fantasies of romance, and feature-length sitcoms that pass for ""comedy"" today. There is such a paucity of fully-realized, director-driven comedies that ""The Life Aquatic"" may not be appreciated for its best qualities. Reminder: a comedy need not be desperate, loud and crass, nor artistically unambitious.The one glaring error in ""The Life Aquatic"" is its lack of narrative thrust, that it has nothing to consistently propel us through its diverting episodes. No *one* thing to pull itself along, mind you; there's just too *much* going on, too *many* threads to be tied together. The film's intended emotional heft is lightened, and its humor lessened, because it doesn't have the tension that a serviceable story provides. More than could be fixed by editing, this appears to have resulted from the overstuffed toy-sack nature of both the script and production design. For ""The Life Aquatic"" to achieve its ambitions, Anderson would have had to heed one phrase, that old adage from high-school English: Kill your darlings. But given millions upon millions to see my own dreams realized, I probably wouldn't self-censor, either.And what darlings! There is enough detail here to fill a dozen features. If the movies are, as Orson Welles said upon being allowed (for a time) the run of the RKO Pictures lot, ""the biggest electric train set a boy ever had,"" ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is Wes Anderson's deluxe Lionel engine on a platform filling the lobby of Grand Central Station. As such, it is most remarkable for its accoutrements, like the radio-equipped dolphins, or the put-upon interns, or the myriad idiosyncrasies of the research ship Belafonte.That more detaillovingly rendered as it iswas not sacrificed for the movie's greater good makes me worry that Anderson is inordinately enamored with his affectations, a post-college hipster who still defines himself by his clothes, collections, and opinions. But I will accept his first three films as evidence of his heart, and look upon ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" as the growing pains of a developing artist.(As for those who chide Anderson for his inept staging of action: no, the Ping Island sequence isn't executed well, but you can't accuse him both of stagnation and not extending himself- and even so, there's still the marvelous set of the decrepit hotel to ogle.)Wes Anderson's four features are, like them or not, clearly and undeniably the work of an individual artist, and this alone makes them unique and significant in this age of pre-fab franchises. If only, for every ""National Treasure"" or ""Fat Albert,"" there were two ""Life Aquatic""'s.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
162,johnfos,Love it or hate it?,9,24 July 2005,"Judging from previous comments, opinion is divided on this film -- most people seem to love it or hate it...Certainly if you're expecting laugh-out-loud comedy you will be disappointed. The comedy offered here is much more quirky and perhaps even whimsical.And if you're expecting a movie with a brisk pace, you will be forced to change gears and sit back and (hopefully) relax and enjoy. The first hour of the movie is really quite slow.Eventually, though, the somewhat convoluted story-line begins to cut in, and things pick up, until we quite warm to the odd character that is Steve Zissou. In the end we actually empathise with him. (Images of Jacques Costeau also come to mind at several points.) Tasteful renderings of a series of David Bowie songs (many in Portugese) helps the movie along and contributes to its exotic flavour.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
163,cglassey,Only occasionally funny. A huge mess of a film,6,12 June 2005,"This film rang false to me on several levels. The characters seem realistic and have realistic problems but they do unbelievable things. Is the film a comedy? If so, then why do so many people die in the film (at least 2 on screen, at least 15 off screen)? If this is a comedy, why does Bill Murray's character talk about being washed up and act washed up. He is a depressing character to be at the heart of a comedy.Is the film supposed to be a drama, a serious portrayal of an aging adventurer who doesn't know when its time to give up? If so, why are the underwater sequences shot like cartoons with animated fish and fake underwater sets? And what possible character would lead his largely incompetent group of divers in a commando style raid on a suspected pirate hide-out? Its absurd. Little in the film suggested Murray's character would even consider such a course of action. Where is his background in the U.S. Navy Seals that might explain behavior? The film is a mess. Parts are funny and the hints of a good film are in this but overall, its a failure.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
164,tvalstar99,Good but not as good as the Tenenbaums,7,2 March 2005,"This movie gets a 8 from me, because it isn't as good as the Tenenbaums.What lacks in The Life Aquatic is the tempo. It seems too long. The Royal Tenenbaums were short scenes, very powerful with great acting. This movie has some great acting, but misses the powerful scenes. The story on the boat on Owen Wilson and Blanchett is not entertaining enough and director Was Anderson takes too much time for them.I found Willem Dafoe's roll not the most brilliant part in his career to be honest. There are some fine scenes in this movie and enough dark, dry humor just as I expected. But not as good as I hoped for. Still this movie deserves an 8 for it's visual jokes, humor and very entertaining scenes and it does have it strong short scenes, just not as many. And I just love these kind of movies.The conclusion for me is that this is a fine movie in Wes Anderson style but it could be a little disappointing after The Royal Tenenbaums. The costumes and the settings are brilliant as is the soundtrack. I really enjoyed the soundtrack!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
165,Theshapeshifter,It's sink or swim...and they chose to sink!,5,17 July 2005,"It was a somewhat mostly good movie, though few others that I watched it with agreed. The film seems to possess great special effects but it, for the most part, is very dull in the first thirty or so minutes.Luckily afterward, it takes itself up with funny and snappy writing and scenes. For the most part though, it seems to carry itself on in a monotone manner in the beginning. I watched this movie trying to capture the jokes, but very few of the jokes are comprehensible. Luckily, the action scenes clear the boredom right up. Bill Murray's monotone voice seems to do the film a good deal of justice, and Willem Dafoe's pseudo-grouchy character supply the film with tremendous laughs. Simply put, the plot is that of a documentary maker who wishes to seek revenge on the ""Jaguar Shark"" which killed his partner while filming an adventure, and thus, the documentary maker sets to kill the shark aided by his crew of ragtag oddities and getting himself and the rest of the crew in unpredictable predicaments along the way.All things considered, a somewhat good film for...a somewhat older audience. Leave the kids to watch something else if you watch this film. Trust me.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
166,Zen416,"Quirky, amusing film",9,1 October 2008,"I caught this one on cable and it took a good 10 or so minutes to get into the movie.Once I did, however, I really enjoyed it. There are some crazy, fantastical bits to it (the odd, not-found-in-nature-in-our-reality fish Zissou and company encounter) but it's still a cool ride once you ""accept it for what it is"" as someone else wrote in the comments section. Bill Murray is the master of playing the dead-pan protagonist types whose wry observations are not laugh out loud funny but amusing in a low key way nonetheless. Owen Wilson was the surprise here, playing the sympathetic role of Ned Plimpton who's seeking out Zissou for personal reasons with a nicely mellow performance. There are some great talents along for the ride (Angelica Huston, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum, and Willem Dafoe, to name a few) and some really cool, quirky and humorously bizarre characters in Zissou's oddball crew. There's a bit of violence half-way through the film but for most part, this movie was oddly amusing and memorable. I'm glad I saw it and I'd recommend it to people who want something weird but not too heavy and off of the beaten path.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
167,royale_w_cheez44,A mixed bag with moments of brilliance,7,13 August 2005,"I saw this movie with high expectations. Having never seen any of Wes Anderson's films but hearing wonderful things about them, I thought that The Life Aquatic would be superb. For lack of a better term, I was disappointed. Perhaps it was because I was unfamiliar with Anderson's style or because I simply wasn't in the mood. What didn't I like too much? First off, the humor. It was WAY too smug. Much of it wasn't really laugh-out-loud hilarious, or it was just really dull. Perhaps all of Anderson's films are like this, but I was hoping for some great laughs. To me, this movie was a better film about the relationship between Steve and his son (played by Owen Wilson).Next, I'd have to say the pacing. Some really long stretches of time are kind of boring and lifeless. I know many people are going to disagree with me, but I was constantly checking my watch to see how much longer I'd have to sit through.Even though there were aspects (mind you, big ones) of the film that were good. Let me start off by saying that the cast is perfect. Murray, Wilson, Cort, Goldbloom, Dafoe, and Blanchette all give wonderful performances. The cast is pretty much perfect. Owen Wilson and Bill Murray work together amazingly as father and son who see things very much differently.The imagery in the film is also pretty wonderful. The look of the sea life is all very creative and cool, and I really liked the style of the art direction.The end of the film: wonderful. As Steve sees the jaguar shark that killed his best friend, he has a change of heart. Astounded by its beauty, he can't bring himself to slay it as he had set out to do. This moment is amazing, and Sigur Ros provides for some moody but hauntingly lovely music (Starálfur is the name, I recommend you download it). At that moment, the film actually kind of fulfilled my expectations.Then again, I hear that this film gets better with multiple viewings. Perhaps someday I might watch it again and I might agree with moviegoers who adored it.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

170,ms_jade_li,Another Wes Anderson Winner,10,1 January 2005,"For those who feel they still possess the components to qualify as being human, please go experience this film. Not being a fan of watching trailers of movies I want to see I tried to stay as blind as possible before going. All I knew going in was that it was a Wes Anderson film with Bill Murray and a few of the cast from his previous film The Royal Tennenbaums.I've been a long time fan of Bill Murray, ever since his lounge singer bit on SNL, the crazed groundskeeper from Caddyshack, and Stripes from the Harold Ramis as writer/actor comedy days. Owen Wilson's brother stole my heart in the Tennenbaum movie, but I've always been appreciative of Owen's aura. Add Anjelica Huston's haughty, mature beauty and you've got the ingredients for a cake made in heaven. Put them in the hands of master chef Wes Anderson and you've got a piece d'resistance.In case you are too young to remember when we had only 3 channels on the TV and viewers were used to the same programming week after week for years, you probably don't remember The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau. Over the years millions of us watched Jacques and his crew go on underwater adventures and tell us things about seawater creatures we otherwise never would have known. Director Anderson's film is a tribute to Cousteau & Company in his achingly beautiful, funny way.Continuing with the chef analogy, Anderson throws a bunch of ordinary, yet of exceptional quality, ingredients into the pots and lets them mix marinate in your psyche and soul and spirit. He knows how to serve each course in the cinematic banquet. You don't know what's coming next but you know it's going to be delicious.Exceptional ingredients besides the cast -- every single cast member, including the 3-legged dog shines -- include exotic locations, soundtrack, dialog, and the sheer humanity of the plot.Bill Murray deserves best actor and Owen Wilson best supporting actor nominations for their roles. Wes Anderson best director nomination. Technical nominations for sound and cinematography as well.Blessings and congratulations to all involved in the making of the film. Thank you for keeping it real.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
171,LG72387,A Funny and Original Wes Anderson Film,7,31 December 2004,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is your typical Wes Anderson film. It is a funny and original comedy from the man that brought you Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums. The screenplay for this film is brilliant and should deserve much more praise than it is receiving from critics. The plot centers around a 52-year old oceanographer named Steve Zissou who is searching for the infamous ""Jaguar Shark or whatever it is"" that ate his best friend and fellow oceanographer Esteban. The only scientific purpose he has to finding this shark is cold blooded revenge. Sounds like your typical revenge story, right? Wrong! This film is not about that at all. It is about how one man's life has affected all of the other people surrounding him. The whole film centers around Steve's relationship with his son, Ned and even has them fighting over a reporter doing a story on Steve named Jane. She is pregnant and doesn't like to curse in fear that her child may garner a bad influence from it. Throughout the course of the film, Steve attempts to get to know his son all while attempting to find the ""Jaguar Shark or whatever it is"". Wes Anderson has created a sophisticated comedy in which the characters are extremely developed and interesting. Bill Murray gives one of the best performances of the year as Steve Zissou and critics are underscoring the weight of his acting. He gives Zissou so much depth and personality that whatever he does on screen is funny. The movie works because Murray steers the character in the right direction. He is a lazy, pot-smoking, potty-mouth oceanographer who steals credit from other people. He is the worst guy to hang around with because he doesn't know what the hell he's doing or maybe he just doesn't care. He is so laid back that if you attempt to have any relationship with him, it goes sour. The only relationship that works with him is the one that he has with Ned. Steve doesn't discover that until the very end of the film when he decides to be the father to Jane's son, which is what Ned would have been had he survived. Bill Murray gives subtlety to his character and that is what makes his performance and the entire film amazingly good. There are also terrific supporting performances in the film from an all-star cast manned by Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Angelica Huston, Jeff Goldblum and the magnificent Willem Dafoe as Klaus, the German cameraman who steals the show in this film. Dafoe is perfect as Klaus and he is perhaps the funniest character in the entire film. The choice of music is brilliant and carefully chosen as it is in every Wes Anderson picture. The underwater world is vivid and highly imaginative as Anderson chose to have all the creatures appear animated. It gives the film a type of Burtonesque quality and a certain creepiness and dark edge to it. However, it is still amazing to look at. The action sequences with the Pirates are sophisticated and hilarious and it shows the genius of the script. The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is one of the best films of the year and Bill Murray even gives a better performance than the one he gave in Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation. Those of you who are fans of Wes Anderson will not be disappointed.Lenny's Grade: A-",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
172,MatBrewster,A Little Disappointing,7,3 May 2005,"Read all of my reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com Wes Anderson pictures are always an event. His first three pictures (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, and the Royal Tenenbaums) have all been brilliant bits of quirky genius. I have waited not so patiently for his fourth picture, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, to make it to France. Though, I tried to read little in the way of reviews, I couldn't help but notice quite a bit of negativity being garnered its way. After viewing the film, I too, couldn't help but feel a little let down, but this has more to say about my expectations of a Wes Anderson picture, than the actual picture itself.Bill Murray proves once again that he is a better actor post 50, than anyone could have imagined. He plays Steve Zissou, a Jacques Cousteau-esquire oceanographer who has seen better days. He has spent the last decade scrounging harder and harder to find the funding for his voyages and the subsequent documentaries from them. It seems the critics have been harsher as his fans have become increasingly few. The film opens with Zissou showing his latest documentary to a bored audience. He is attempting to find funding for a second voyage, one that will allow him to exact revenge upon the jaguar shark that killed his friend. He finds the money through Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) who may be Zissou's son, but no one is really quite sure.Zissou and his might-be son, are accompanied by a rag tag crew and a reporter, Jane Winslet-Richardson (Cate Blanchett) who forms some kind of love triangle with Zissou and Plimpton. Aboard the rusty, ancient Belefante all hands set out to find the mythical shark. Though before they find the beast they encounter many adventures such as found in any road trip film.Anderson fills his film once again with plenty of quirky, odd ball characters. This time he seems to have filled the action as a means to play homage to various movies and television shows from the 70's and 80's. There is an action sequence towards the middle that is straight out of a Charlie's Angels or A-Team episode. The much discussed animated fish seem to be copied from the Incredible Mr. Limpett. Many of the camera movements, including extensive use of close up zoom on a single character only to zoom out and zoom out again to find the character surrounded by others, seem to be out of some classic television directors guide book. Before I realized Anderson was mimicking that style I was annoyed with the whole thing. Once I caught on I found a few of these moments to be brilliant put-ons, but often I felt like I was watching the last 15 minutes of Adaptation. Where yes I get the joke, and yes I find it funny, but it got tiresome rather quickly.One of the joys of The Royal Tenenbaums is that each character is fleshed out to some degree. It is a large ensemble picture, but even the smaller roles have moments in which to give them some dimension, to make them real. The Life Aquatic similarly has a large cast, but all but the major characters are never given a chance to become three dimensional. Why, for instance, does the navigator spend most of the film topless? If this is to present that she is a free spirit, why does she argue with Zissou over sailing over unprotected waters? Or why is she so upset with him for stealing the equipment? Her character is given no reasoning behind her behavior, and her actions only force the plot along without any purpose. She is not the only character like this. Either Anderson is again mimicking the plot less plot-lines of classic television, or he has done a poor job of filling in the details of his characters.There are many things that work in the Life Aquatic. Bill Murray proves again he is more than just a funny, funny man. The characters that are filled out, are aptly acted. Though just what is the deal with Cate Blanchett's accent? She sounded like she was still hanging onto a bit of Katherine Hepburn. Anderson has again made a fun, funny, quirk of a movie. Yet, when compared to the rest of his output, I can't help but feel a little disappointed. Here's to his next film, and hoping his brilliance continues to shine for a little while longer.More reviews at www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
173,grenmonkey,A brilliant movie with it's leading star in a perfect shape,10,18 January 2010,"Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), the legendary oceanographer in the likeness of Jacques-Yves Cousteau, sets out for a spiritual crusade of some sort after his best friend Esteban (Seymour Cassel) is eaten by a mysterious ""jaguar shark"". A mixed group of individuals follow him for this sea voyage of his - including a journalist Jane (Cate Blanchett), Steve's wife Eleanor (Anjelica Huston) and a man named Ned (Owen Wilson) who thinks he just might or might not be Steve's son. Though armed with dynamite and the will to use it, Steve's chase after the shark ends up being more of a journey into understanding who he really is as a person - as a person who seems to have seen his better days.The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004) is a great film. I like everything about it - the imaginative cinematography, the retro-pop soundtrack, the diverse script and the great ensemble cast that is just perfect. I consider this to be the finest example of Wes Anderson's (the director) offbeat style of comedy and drama that blend together creating something great and unique, something to remember.The brightest star of the film is unquestionably Bill Murray, whose performance is the heart and soul of the film. His excellent dry delivery of both comedy and drama is what defines the mood of the film and is what makes the character of Steve as interesting and captivating as he is.The movie isn't perfect. The script could have used some rewriting as some of the dialog-heavy scenes feel a bit stretched and the film ends running a bit too long. Still, the movie is filled with brilliant scenes and such a great atmosphere through-out that the minor problems in the script are hardly a complain.A brilliant movie with it's leading star in a perfect shape. I recommend you get past the ridiculous sounding story premise and the goofy poster and embark on the journey with Bill and the others, it'll be great. 4/4",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
174,axeman-9,Did you get it? I think maybe I did.,8,3 January 2006,"A quick browse through the comments for this film shows up certain facts quite starkly...1. A lot of people watched it because it's a Wes Anderson film.2. A lot of people thought it was going to be an out-and-out comedy.3. A lot of people don't get it.I have never seen a Wes Anderson film, indeed I have to put my hand up and state that I hadn't even heard of the man before I bought this DVD on the spur of the moment and watched till the credits. Also the only thing I knew about the movie was that it had some strange effects in it, something that quickly becomes evident, and it's quite intentional.I don't know how precisely to sum it up, and frankly I think that's a good thing. It's not a comedy, although it's definitely fun to watch, and it's not... well, it's not. It's an experience. We are taken along for the ride on a kind of cut-price, rapidly fading and thinly disguised Jacques Cousteau style adventure, and the plot is used as a rope from which to hang a lot of little vignettes and character development as we go on through the movie.The characters are each annoying, likable, lovable, dumb, funny and serious, the way real people are. The audience are asked to sit back and let the lives of the crew wash over them as the adventure unfolds, and we see it all and are by turns charmed, entertained and wounded as the story unfolds. The underwater scenes, rather than being hyper-real as one might expect in this day and age, are mixes of live action, CGI and colourful stop-motion animation, all dayglo coloured and completely unreal looking. Some of the events and creatures the crew run into are just as bizarre and completely fake looking, as the director intended. I leave finding the reason for this up to you, although I have my own ideas why.I enjoyed the movie, it was an experience and it was thought provoking in a way that most modern films aren't. It used very obvious visuals as metaphors, it had characters we liked, hated and cared about and it had genuine pain and laughter in the mix too. Yes it's a bit messy, a bit unreal, a bit tragic in places, but it made me damn glad I'd watched it and gave me a hankering to check out old Jacques Cousteau documentaries again, since they got the look and feel of the boat and it's motley crew so right. If you haven't seen this film, go watch it and enjoy it for what it is, not with a preconceived notion of what to expect.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
175,mullermike,Wes Anderson has gotten too impressed with himself,4,4 November 2006,"I might not be the best judge for this movie. I fell asleep from boredom and never really figured out what was going on during this one. I hadn't heard good things about this flick. However, I've been a fan of Wes Anderson ever since Bottlerocket came out (that film has proved to be his best). I didn't bother when it was in theaters. Recently I saw it at the video store so I paid my $4, got home and popped it in.A cousin of mine described this movie as Wes Anderson imitating Wes Anderson. I didn't get the same notion, yet I will say this. Anderson hinted at pretentious indulgence with Rushmore, upped the ante with The Royal Tenenbaums, now he's created an entire movie out of it. What do I mean by pretentious indulgence? Well, in Bottlerocket you had a movie dominated by interesting characters. The story was solid as well. You combined the two and the result was an unforgettable classic (according to me at least).But with each followup film Anderson has forgotten to create vivid characters. Only Gene Hackmans character from Tenenbaums was a character with any life. His films now consist of mopey duds that stare blankly into space. His characters don't speak as much because not much is going on -- there's no script to work with. Does he want the viewer to figure out everything? He's forgotten that his job is to entertain and maybe getting us to think. He certainly didn't entertain and the only thoughts I had were how dull this movie was.The characters of this film also had a major flaw -- they were imperfect people but you despised them. At least Hackmans character from Tenenbaums and the morons from Bottlerocket (especially Dignan) were likable. Despite their weaknesses (and recklessness) you couldn't help but warm up to them. The characters in Life Aquatic (aside from Wilson) were cold, cruel, and not the slightest bit charming. Not only that but the overwrought atmosphere made it impossible for one of them to stand out. Anderson was obviously going for subtle humor. The characters were always subdued -- even when hijacked by pirates. Deadpan humor worked in Airplane but not here. Instead the humor seemed calculated and mean spirited. The blaze attitude also seemed apathetic, as if the characters themselves were about to yawn.I also found the profanity in this movie untimely. Foul language can add humor but it can also debase a film. Yes, it debased it this time around. And when Goldblum's character smacked the dog, I wanted to smack him. Here Anderson had a dead scene so he went for shock value. He's never had to rely on shock until now. This dog slapping, an obvious attempt at humor, reinforced what was apparent throughout the film -- none of the characters were likable. If Goldblums character had stood out and we actually liked his sleaziness maybe this cheap gimmick would have worked.Sadly Anderson's career path is headed to the ash heap. Tenebaums seemed like a breakout and luckily he still packs his movies with good tunes. But his movies have become slow, weary, overblown affairs. I know the artsy fartsy crowd loves Anderson's fascination with his own so-called genius. I hate to offend the urban snob community but this movie lacked substance and style and it shows that Anderson isn't living up to the potential he displayed in Bottlerocket. Hope he can awake from the hypnosis that is destroying his films.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

It's a different movie, but both have one thing in common:The creators of the films both wanted to create something unique and different.I admire film makers that don't recycle the same ideas over and over again. Unfortunately, taking risks means that the mass-market appeal maybe less than if the film maker decides to play it safe, not take any chances and serve more of the same. Remember, the most popular flavor of ice cream is vanilla and the most popular car is the achingly boring Toyota Camry. Is it any surprise that Hollywood gives us the same thing over and over and never tries to give America anything unique to entertain us?I really liked the movie and gave it an 8 out of 10, but I also think it may not be right for everyone.I do, however, guarantee that you haven't seen anything like this before.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

181,roger-212,"Affectionate and sentimental, more texture than text",8,28 January 2006,"Who would have thought that Wes Anderson's latest would be an unofficial ode to the melancholy joys of making films? Wes Anderson's commentary basically states as such, and the joys of ""Life Aquatic,"" especially on repeated viewings, bears it out.Anderson's works seem to find their audiences once they've gone to DVD. I remember hearing how disappointed people were in ""Royal Tenenbaums"" after it came out in theatres (""It ain't no ""Rushmore""), but it getting a new lease on life (and popular acclaim) on DVD. Likewise, ""Life Aquatic,"" which people REALLY hated during its theatrical run. Like ""Tenenbaums,"" ""Aquatic"" is a loosely structured ensemble piece, centered around a not-very-likable character and his extended family. Here the lead is Bill Murray, who's misanthropic and iconic charm overpowers the mood of the film, affecting everything in it. Finally, we have Bill Murray in the center, as the lead of an Anderson film, not just a small character. He fits into Anderson's world perfectly.With a larger budget, Anderson has managed to create a much richer mise-en-scene here, with incredible production design (that boat!), uniquely beautiful Italian locations, and (as usual) carefully composed and edited set-pieces. Yet all this work in the sidelines - his ""texture"" - almost overpowers the ""text."" Anderson and his co-writer (Noah Baumbach, of ""Squid and Whale"" fame) spend much more time on Zissou/Murray, and his personal and professional crisis as the film unfolds. (These crises may have been going on for years.) But Zissou is never one to complain, or to state outright what his crises may be, so the more we're allowed to observe him, the better. He comes across as a smart-ass misanthrope, but actually he loves the extended family around him. Even Owen Wilson the interloper. Zissou's barely articulated sarcastic asides may be directed at himself.The production design, the ship, and all the visual clues in the b.g. (from action figures, beat-up editing equipment, 2-d animated aquatic life in the background, etc.) all contribute to our understanding of Zissou. Perhaps at the expense of his other characters. But since Zissou's back story is more rich, contradictory, and seeped in popular and oblique cultural echoes (Jacques Clouseau, Yellow Submarine, film festivals, Cinecitta, etc.) the time is necessary, and rewarded.Shifts in tone within the film (especially the pirate attack half-way in, the obviously ""fake"" fish) have bothered many viewers, but are ultimately part of the texture of the film's world view. Interestingly, I consider this film to be very sentimental, in spite of its surface ""coolness"" and overt ""hipness."" It's a film of great subtleties and buried treasures, and aesthetic grace notes that harken back to, and suggest a real fondness for a previous innocent age, when adventurers went and made nature films and had them shown on t.v. for us kids in the 60s and 70s.SPOILERS - I talk about the thematic end of the film (if not the actual facts): Ultimately the film is an affectionate study of an aging filmmaker, not sure what his legacy is (a son? a series of ""swimming"" films?) who's a father figure to a ragtag collection of strays who go along with him to be a part of something, and maybe be valued, at least for a while. And Steve Zissou wouldn't have it any other way. Passing on that Zissou ring to the little kid, to make sure the legend stays alive, is the final revealing moment.(Nice ""Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai"" walk thing at the end also. They're a team forever.)",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

It is the writing and direction that make this special. Murray's performance strong as well. I like how the animals are animated making this the opposite of a real nature documentary.I imagine this movie is too subtle for most people.

The cast looked awesome and the concept was killer, seemed like a perfect fit for Bill Murray and any time you add Willem Defoe you have a movie. Well Bill did what he does and Willem was fantastic in his little role, but the movie was anything but. I'm not really sure how to describe Wes Anderons style but I would say his other movies are less laugh out funny and overload of amusement and whimsy (some might call smart comedy). I just enjoy watching them, there is just so many unique directions he takes with his movies and the characters are very eccentric which makes for a enjoyable experience. This movie had just some awful moments, including several A-Team moments of shoot outs and bits of strange violence, which is all good by me but it doesn't fit in here at all. Literally you turn to the person next to you and say what the hell just happened, boats and fishes and then knives in people and Bill Murray with a gat! Then the story, it starts out about finding the killer shark and ends with the killer shark which were my favorite parts, but what happens in between is just jiber jaber. I couldn't tell if this was a story of revenge, an old man's last journey or a father son story. The characters felt really dry and they didn't have the same feel as the other movies.It just didn't work for me, I felt awful after seeing the movie thinking it wasn't worth the wait and the price of the ticket. I really hope that maybe watching it over might stir something, but I'm pretty sure it was a questionable story line and when Bill Murray said it was a mess he wasn't being sarcastic he really meant it was a mess.

186,Spod-3,"Clever, but not funny",6,27 May 2005,"Many people have been disappointed by this movie as it was misleadingly shown as a sort of broad comedy in the trailers, even though Anderson is not known to make that sort of film. If it's a comedy at all, it's quite a black one, and much of the humour is wry to the point of being imperceptible. I sat through this without once even feeling like laughing, and there are some quite downbeat moments as well. I think most people would be advised to avoid this unless they have seen Anderson's previous films like The Royal Tenenbaums and enjoyed them. It's certainly not a film with wide appeal.

With ""The Life Aquatic,"" Anderson has made his strangest and most unique film. I mean, how do you describe a story who main storyline involves mythical jaguar sharks, cannibalistic pirates, three legged dogs and bi-sexual oceanographers? The film is very eclectic. However, whereas Anderson's other works were tied closely together under a prevalent theme and plot, ""Life Aquatic"" kind of floats about like a stoned jellyfish. Is that bad? No, not at all. This was an interesting trip and I will always pay to see Bill Murray. I enjoyed this almost comic book adventure. I enjoyed the David Bowie songs done in Portuguese.

Steve isn't smartest apple in the tree, but he has a lot heart. The supporting cast for this movie is very strong, with some famous character actors, stars you hadn't seen in a long time along with some unknowns. You'll be drawn into the movie.I would say thou the movie as a whole won't be it, without Bill Murray, he's the heart of this film makes it breath.If there was comparison of experience, i'd have refer to the (1984) The Hotel New Hampshire. Thou this movie by far superior to Hotel, but the way events accrued and how it ends. It DOES remind me of that film.Go see it, go rent it, see it for yourself.

189,superscal23,"""I've never seen a bond company stooge stick his neck out like that""",9,27 December 2004,"The Life Aquatic is an excellent movie. I have come to learn that Wes Anderson is a very polarizing figure among movie fans. I don't really have an opinion about that one way or another. I thought Bottle Rocket was okay. I haven't seen Rushmore, and I didn't care for The Royal Tenenbaums. Unlike most people, I didn't let my opinions about Anderson determine whether or not I liked The Life Aquatic.Bill Murray stars as Steve Zissou, a wannabe Cousteau who his past his prime as a documentarian. As the movie begins, Steve is screening his most recent effort, and it falls upon deaf ears, even though it includes the killing of his best friend, who is supposedly eaten by a Jaguar Shark. For their next film, Team Zissou plans to hunt down and kill the Jaguar Shark, and the plot is kicked into motion.Team Zissou includes the standard Anderson circle of oddball characters. The two that stand out are Klaus, played wonderfully by Willem Dafoe, who is constantly looking for Steve's approval; and Pele, who spends his days singing David Bowie songs in Portugese. Early in the film, we meet Ned Plimpton, played by Owen Wilson. Ned is a pilot for Air Kentucky who thinks he may be Steve's long lost son, and Steve doesn't necessarily disagree. So, Ned joins Team Zissou. Joining them on this adventure is a reporter played by Cate Blanchett, who will be documenting Team Zissou's newest adventure for her magazine.They board the good ship Belafonte and set off on their journey. The ship looks, like Steve, that it passed its prime years ago. They have managed to turn a beat up old ship into a technologically advanced film studio and research lab at sea, but none of the high tech equipment ever works. We learn that is mostly because nobody cares enough to fix anything when it breaks. Early in their adventure, Team Zissou encounters the sea lab of their nemesis, Alistair Hennesy, played by Jeff Goldblum. They find nobody is there, so they break in and steal some equipment, but the only thing they ever get any real use out of is the cappuccino maker.A good portion of the film is a series of sight gags and inside jokes that have half the theater laughing and the other half wondering what everybody's laughing at. For example, Team Zissou's crew of interns do nothing but get coffee and carry equipment, while wearing shirts that simply say ""intern"". Also, all the interns must share one gun. If you've been an intern, these are some of the movies' best jokes. If you haven't, then you probably won't get the full effect. I find this to be interesting personally. However, if you're one who prefers gross out, fall out of your chair comedy, then this movie may not land with you.Eventually, Team Zissou ventures into unchartered waters where their ship is hijacked, of course, by Filipino pirates. They are about to kidnap Ned and possibly kill some interns when Steve decides to take back his ship. He pulls out his gun, shoots several of the hijackers, and drives the rest of them from the ship. I know that doesn't sound like comedy, but this is Bill Murray's funniest sequence since Stripes. The sight of him storming the deck in a bathrobe and a speedo to get the hijackers off of his ship has to be seen to be believed.The hijackers don't get Ned, but they do take Bill, the bond company stooge, as a hostage. So, Team Zissou's mission strays for awhile as they must rescue the stooge before continuing on their quest for the Jaguar Shark. The rescue attempt and recovery is the film's best scene. Team Zissou storms an island, complete with their 3 legged dog, and Steve once again takes down the hijackers, while rescuing both the bond company stooge and Hennessy, who the pirates also have hostage.I haven't read this is any other reviews, but I found this film to be a giant inside joke about the movie industry. Steve carries a gun because that's what they do in the movies. He pulls out the gun and threatens the reporter because that's how a person gets what he wants in a movie. Steve takes down hijackers, because he's the star of the movie, and that's what the star of a movie does. At one point, he is opening up to Ned about his problems, and when listing what is wrong with his life, ""my film has no distribution"" comes before ""my wife is leaving me."" One is accepted into Team Zissou when Steve determines they can have a red hat and a speedo. They discuss the Team Zissou logo, and if it needs modernizing so they can market it better. Everything Ned wears early in the film, including his boxer shorts, proudly displays the Air Kentucky logo.Steve Zissou is a great character. It's different kind of role than Lost in Translation, but Murray is just as good. Roger Ebert said it best in suggesting that Steve is a man who is ""simultaneously depressed that life is passing him by, and that it is taking so long to do it."" Team Zissou fulfills their mission of finding the Jaguar Shark, but the ending is bittersweet and poignant, not satirical and funny. Based on the rest of the movie, I would have preferred satirical and funny, but it didn't detract from the overall film for me. The Life Aquatic is Wes Anderson's best film, and one of the best of 2004.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
190,DocIndy,Possibly not what you would expect,6,1 January 2005,"Visually a very attractive film. Another example of the depth that Bill Murray can bring to a role, but not quite up to his performance in ""Lost in Translation."" Some of the difference in the two films comes down to the character Bill plays and the script he has to work with. Of course ""Lost in Translation"" had a different subject and did not present itself as a comedy even though there were some funny scenes. The adds for this film do present itself as a comedy but even though funny at times it did not leave me with the feeling that I had seen a comedy. Some of that has to do with the ending. I cannot say that the ending was ideal. It was one of those films that when the credits began I thought ""so this is how it ends?"" By comparison ""The Royal Tennebaums"" was overall a funnier film. Both films are undeniably quirky. The characters in this film though are not ones that as a whole I found interesting or very believable.

I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but The Life Aquatic left a lot to be desired for me as a Wes Anderson fan. Bill Murray's performance was as good as advertised, but the character of Steve Zissou didn't reach me the way Anderson's previous protagonists have. Watching this film I felt very detached from what was happening. There were moments in the film of pure genius, like the clips from Zissou's documentary archives, and some great quirky characters, like Willem Dafoe's Klaus. All of these positives however did not make up for the lack of cohesiveness in the script and like I said in the opening, the lack of heart. In the final 10 minutes or so we begin to see some real Wes Anderson-like feel good moments, which true fans know what I mean. For me however, these moments were too little and too late. Funny film but a step down from what Anderson and company have done in the past.

194,weekly-movie-review,The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou is one of my personal favorites from director Wes Anderson.....,9,19 June 2009,"The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou is one of my personal favorites from director Wes Anderson. It's about an ocean-life documentary maker Steve Zissou and his struggle to find the elusive ""jaguar shark"" that killed his co-worker. Circumstances are further complicated when family drama, budget cuts, and a pirate attack all seek to destroy his mission. Anderson uses some of his regulars such as Bill Murray, Anjelica Houston, and Owen Wilson who once again deliver quirky personalities to the screen. Willem Dafoe also turns in a memorable performance as one of the sensitive shipmates. What sets this movie apart from other Anderson films though, is the animation and sets. Several times the focus of attention is on almost cartoon-like fictional ocean animals, like the aforementioned jaguar shark. Even though the animation appears very non-realistic, there's a certain art to the images and brings back feelings of child-like fantasies. Great humor abounds and the soundtrack is composed mostly of indie covers of David Bowie songs, so this movie does not disappoint. -JNJ",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

198,kerangador,A Scuba Diving Movie Parody,10,18 December 2008,"I watched this movie in 2004 expecting it to be another Royal Tenenbaums type of film - which I enjoyed, very much. I was disappointed. It seemed a bit too contrived. I put it on the shelf- or should I say my sister borrowed it for 5 years, had a baby, and afterwards I took it back. The DVD I mean, not the baby.I had gone scuba diving since 2007 - and had been watching hours of scuba diving, undersea films and documentaries - like Diving with the Great White Shark.Then I rewatched this The Life Aquatic again - and I found understood its genius for the first time. And I also appreciated its dead pan humor even more so.Its also a very philosophical film like the other Wes Anderson's films - its a film about heroes getting old and frail, its about children finding that their parents can be very human and flawed and accepting that.For those who hated the film. Its OK. Never mind. Go scuba diving. Then go watch all those shark, nat geo, discovery, documentaries - the ones where the camera focuses on the shark hunters in pensive moods or striding purposefully onto the board, or finding things in the water FOR THE FIRST TIME (with the camera men already on location filming the jokers).Then watch this. You'll get it.But having said that - this film could have done with some editing. There were several unnecessary bits that could have been removed to improve the pacing of the film such as:1. The scene where Ned is on the telephone to his airline boss telling them that he's going on a voyage with Steve and won't be coming back soon and that someone else is covering for him.

199,Absyrd,Wes Anderson's Best...,9,30 June 2008,"And considering his outstanding filmography, this is more than a mere praise. The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou is an eccentric, bizarre piece, it holds an optimistic atmosphere with cheerful underwater creatures and joyously colorful sets, but its substance is more pessimistic, at times perverse. The film holds subtextual themes such as lust, kidnapping, murder, revenge, but despite all the films inner negative cynicism, its unique atmosphere gives it the feeling of an uplifting road movie. Because of this intriguingly contradictory bafflement, the film is an achievement of unpredictable allurement. Are the consistently cold themes but light mannerisms going to lead to a tragic aftermath, or an uplifting conclusion? While its sullen quality does mostly take over the film's atmosphere, I can't deny it also holds a fair share of light, brooding humor. Before I continue confusing you with a painful attempt at explaining the directors true objective, let me tell you what the film is about on the outside. A failure of a documentary filmmaker, Steve, and his long-lost son, Ned, embark on a quest to search for a man-eating shark who killed Steve's best friend. Accompanying them are Steve's intelligent, but hardly humble wife, his film crew, a pregnant reporter, and a group of college students. Both Steve and Ned fall in love with the young reporter, and this enforces the two with endeavors of loyalty and betrayal. Eventually, when a group of thieves kidnap a member of the group and hold him hostage, they make a change of plans and embark to rescue him.It's this kind of quirkily absurd plot Wes Anderson practically trademarks, he's known for his mostly episodic structure, for the usually pseudo-comedic entities his films hold, driven by the essential dark character study he puts into all his films. His characters tend to give in to personal desire's with sexual or cynical behavior, betraying those around him, with guilt and without pride. Anderson reveals the imperfections of humanity, but he also realizes that a ""flawed human being"" is an nonsensical phrase, because all human beings have felt lust, or have told a lie at one point, or have hurt another person's feelings, or conceal some negative emotion or connotation about a certain person or entire community, no one can be deemed innocent or pure.The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou works in the fact that while it's an enticing visual accomplishment, it's also an achievement in creating three-dimensional, relatable characters, with intriguing situations that reveal the dark side of human nature. But despite all the sullen, at times tragic subtext, the film is an absolutely hilarious, bizarre, almost surreal excitement. This only further proves what a distinctive and legendary director Wes Anderson is, and I very much anticipate his next film.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
200,simpletonistic,The Movie Quixotic: A B+ Masterpiece,9,8 April 2005,"Bill Murray (who plays the Jacques Cousteau-on-pot Steve Zissou, an underwater documentarian) is just one of many eccentric characters inhabiting Wes Anderson's ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou."" Throughout this wacky film he competes for our attention, not only with various other human wackos; Owen Wilson (who plays an airplane pilot from ""Air Kentucky,"" Ned Plimpton, who may or may not be Zissou's son), Willem Defoe (the mildly Nazi-esquire, Klaus Daimler), and Jeff Goldblum (who plays Zissou's documentary-making nemesis, Alistair Hennessey); but a host of brilliantly animated aquatic and land-lubbing creatures, ranging from rainbow-colored jellyfish, a radiant lemon-colored lizard, rhinestone sailfish, phosphorescent carp, paisley octopi, and sugar crabs, to crayon-colored pony-fish, and the illusive star of the show, a Jaguar Shark. The latter sets the plot in motion when it eats Zissou's beloved partner while he and Team Zissou are filming another of their underwater docudramas. While the film never achieves high-comedy, or even deigns to make any point, it never wanes in its ability to keep one guessing, chuckling, and entertained. As wacky as Zissou and his crew are, one can't ever accurately predict what direction they will go off on in pursuit of his prey. Their quest takes place on the good ship BELAFONTE, which Anderson initially presents in cut-away, subsequently employing it as an educational model and as setting for a scene or two. It's neat gadgetry, like the animated creatures, and its' sublime use is another one of those intangibles that makes this movie worthwhile. Another bit of inscrutable genius: the presence of a lithe, beguiling Portugese shipmate who spends most of his time on deck singing Davie Bowie covers in his native language. Again, wacky, but appropriate to this very whimsical film. Assessing and abetting Zissou on his quest are Cate Blanchett (who plays a 3-months pregnant, seemingly soon to be a single mom Brit journalist, Jane Winslett-Richardson) and Angelica Huston (playing Zissou's ex-wife, Elanor Zissou). The former has issues of her own to deal with: impending break-up, career opportunity, a newborn, and, despite Zissou's failed attempts to romance her, she seeks solace in the arms of Ned. When out of his arms, she follows Zissou around, snooping out possible story lines for the article she may or may not write for a magazine. As usual, Blanchett is at once beauteous and entrancing, ever the attention-grabber. As for Eleanor, well, she fesses up to having an affair with Hennessey (who ends up fessing up that he is ""part gay,"" to which Zissou replies, ""Aren't we all?""), which riles but does not distract Zissou, but shows her loyalty to her ex- by agreeing to unleash some family funds to fuel Team Zissou's chase of the Jaguar Shark. En route, they do what ever needs to be done to keep their quest going, be that robbing Hennessey's at-sea observatory, using Team Zissou's decrepit helicopter or overcoming a band of South American pirates who kidnap a bank agent put on board to oversee Zissou's spending of loan money. Just as the film never achieves high-comedy, it doesn't necessarily achieve the high-drama of a vigorous cat-and-mouse game either. Yet, in Anderson's hands, the film never lies dead in the water, there's always the next challenge to overcome to keep the chase going. Murray, master of the deadpan, even during a shoot-out with the pirates, is amusing. The supporting cast performs admirably, like a band of very sea-worthy shipmates. The end result, a minor masterpiece. While not innovative, far from commonplace.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
201,lucasespindola-91322,Wes Anderson at his finest,9,19 January 2021,"There is so much good about it, it is hard to find where to start. It is a hilarious dry comedy done perfectly, like a Marc Maron show. It is also a beautiful movie, like anything Wes Anderson does. But it doesn't stops there. It is emotional, it has action and it has a meaning. Just like The Grand Budapest Hotel, it goes beyond pretty shots and funny jokes.
William Dafoe and Bill Murray deserve a lot of praise, delivering such complex characters with such ease. Matter of fact, all of the cast is great, with incredible performances that never take the focus away from the adventure itself.
The soundtrack is a character of its own, with Seu Jorge playing classic Bowie songs live.
In short, it is awesome. It is funny, sad, shocking and, more than anything, one of those movies that warm your heart just a little bit.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

I'm sure that is what the authors would like, but he is not. Steve Zissou turns out to be the loud-mouthed head of a bumbling group of undersea explorers.What mild amusement there is in this situation fades long before it is over despite some nice bits of animation. However, so many people seem to have liked this that you end up thinking that perhaps you are just a Philistine, and really should be looking for ""deep meanings"" as the film grinds on. Nonetheless, I found myself wondering, between yawns, just why two excellent actresses like Anjelica Huston and Cate Blanchett decided to appear in this piece of junk.Fortunately, we had recorded the film on our PVR, and could just erase it afterward. Otherwise, I would resent having spent anything to watch it.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
203,CharlesVonFunhammer,The Low Down on the Life Aquatic.,9,19 December 2004,"Word. This review shall be written mostly for huge/obsessive Wes fans, as I am indeed one myself. This review's aim shall be to put an end to the disparity of reviews I've seen so far. People either love it or hate it, it seems.Here we go. The good: The Life Aquatic seems much more openly funny than his previous films, all of which are hysterical, but with few deep belly laughs. This film has those laughs. It's got great performances and is is deeply confident in itself. The film is an adventure comedy, even if it's not too heavy on the adventure. It should be taken as an adventure comedy. It's not the dramatic piece that tennebaums was. It's really funny and has these moments in it that will make your heart skip with joy. The look of the film is great. Wes's mise-en-scene is better than anyone else working out there today. He seems conscious of his auteurism, and you'll definitely see the things that you've come to expect from wes films. That's part of what's great about his films is that you can walk in and tell it's a wes picture just from style.The not so good: While it's a great film, it seems unfinished in some regards. This might be because the film was a bitch to shoot (from everything I've read) but it just doesn't seem completed. Shots cut in the middle of them, and there are continuity problems. I'm not ready to dismiss these as unintentional, but there's something about them that didn't work for me. It might have been trying to be documentary-esq like ""the life aquatic with steve zissou"" but it wasn't as executed as well as it could have been. Also, (and there may be a spoiler) I didn't really feel that Wes earned the death at the end. There's so much going on the film that we never really get to focus in on one thing, and therefore are not as emotionally invested as we could be. Yeah, I know that Wes's films see thing ironically, sad and funny. I just feel like if you're going to get that serious (and he's been working his way up to killing someone throughout, ie. Luke Wilson attempted suicide) you should do more to earn it. I think style clouds a little bit of the substance and there could have been more real emotion, which, while I know it's not what he's going for, could have elevated this film from 10 to 11. I'm really going to have to see it again before I can really figure it out. There's so much going on that it might be hard to digest after having only seen it once.The film is definitely worth seeing, for wes and non-wes fans alike. While I delight in every awkward pause, every offensive joke, every pan, tracking shot, zoom, and sad joke, I think other people will enjoy how wes plays with convention. Wes Anderson is reshaping the way movies are made and in 5 years all comedies will be like Wes comedies - it's happening already (I heart Huckabees, Garden State.) The man is a genius, and while this film stumbles and might not completely succeed, it rocks harder than anything you're going to see this holiday season.Peace, mam, (sbl)",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
204,snazel,"Fun, Refreshing but not 'Genius'",7,4 January 2005,"This film isn't genius. This film isn't perfect. Sometimes the adoring fans of Wes Anderson tend to blow his films out of proportion. While I admire Anderson's work, (Rushmore and Tenenbaums especially), I am not prepared to place Life Aquatic into the realm of 'genius'.What Life Aquatic is however, is a fun, refreshing film that takes the word 'whimsical' to a whole new level. You get the sense that the actors and crew had as much fun making the film as you will watching it.Life Aquatic, has fantastic moments, scenes that make you laugh, scenes that make you chuckle, scenes that are technically creative as well as ones that are just performed with razor precision and skill, by its accomplished cast.It can drag a little in its second act and it ultimately can fall a little flat, when it tries to resonate emotionally, simply because the characters and settings are often so surreal and whimsical that you lack a lot of empathy for the characters on screen.None the less, this is money well spent, if you enjoy films that creative and refuse to follow the cookie cutter formulas that dominate Hollywood fare these days.This movie also has a love affair with the romanticism of Jaques Cousteau, it is at times a parody of the action-hero film and also plays and toys with the icons of marijuana sub-culture. Most of all though, it delights in showing off its technical prowess both in camera work, comedic timing, imagery, scenery and digital animation Life Aquatic is well crafted, well performed and at times utterly delightful. It is not without its flaws here and there, but overall, you'll come out of the theater with a smile on your face, at least I did.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
205,starrywisdom,Flatter than a Flounder,3,22 December 2007,"Many years ago I had the pleasure of writing for and directing Bill Murray (and Laraine Newman, and John Belushi, and Jane Curtin) in radio spots for CBS Records. It was the very early days of Saturday Night Live, and most of the cast was happy to get extra radio work; we were all the same age, and we had the best time working with them.Well, the outtakes from those studio sessions were a million times more laughworthy than the whole of this alleged movie.Murray, so entertaining in other work (and whose improvisations and between-take chatter on my radio scripts were so brilliant that I wished I could have used THEM as the spots instead), is here monotone, monochromatic, purely reactive and a dead bore.The only character with a speck of life, the very appealing Owen Wilson's Ned, was pointlessly killed off. And the rest of the cast, all of whom I ordinarily enjoy, were simply wasted.I don't find a shred of humor, spark of life, or snap of wit in the whole of this mishmosh, and it amazes me to see the reviews it's garnered here. There's no accounting for taste, I know, but I found ""The Life Aquatic"" dreary, stale, flat, dull and...the cardinal sin...unfunny.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
206,DJMo,Wes Anderson's genre-bending adventure is my favorite film of the year,8,2 January 2005,"Wes Anderson's genre-bending adventure is my favorite film of the year. Add action and pseudo-documentary to his usual mix of offbeat drama and tongue-in-cheek dark comedy, and you have a quirky, winning combination. The cast is strong throughout: Bill Murray brings a unique energy to the screen and imbues his character with the complexity and edginess necessary to drive this rather unconventional mid-life crisis story; Owen Wilson's deadpan delivery as Zissou's possible long lost son works well; Willem Dafoe is funny as a jealous senior team member; Anjelica Huston is a commanding presence in her smaller role, sometimes even stealing scenes from Murray; Cate Blanchett is lovely as a pregnant journalist whose incisive questioning and romantic impassability rub Zissou the wrong way; Jeff Goldblum is hilarious as Zissou's ambiguously bi archrival; and Seu Jorge is a great supporting cast member who helps segue scenes with fun Portugese renditions of David Bowie songs. Initially, the atmosphere may seem lighter than that of Rushmore or The Royal Tenenbaums. However, the humor and quirky plot do not mask the dark undercurrent or detract from the poignancy of the film's climax. Although the screenplay seems a little bit more disjointed than those co-written with Owen Wilson, the playful randomness is a welcome element in this adventure and I didn't feel too much was missing from Wilson's absence in the writing department. The set pieces and costumes are appropriately weird and wonderful and Wes Anderson is certainly in his element with effective use of color (i.e. the helicopter scene), music, editing, shot selection, CGI, and mise-en-scene (especially the intro, the entrance and exit of key characters, and the ending).",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
207,Leafsman_69,"Pleasant Surprize, But Only for Certain Viewers",7,9 January 2005,"The Life Aquatic is very overlooked in theaters. I understand why this is the case. Advertising is not excessive, allot of the actors are not popular to the younger generation, and the title does not make much sense. However such elements do not deter ""The Life Aquatic"" from being a good movie. Indeed there were shortcomings, such as the length of the film which could have been a half hour shorter. Also the fact that the plot was often distorted and left many, including myself, confused at times.With the negative aspects out of the way, its time to state the positive. First and foremost the film was unorthodox, numerous CGI and location/setting interjections. This movie is an escape from the rest of the theater world where top notch actors team up to bring in a new trend in moves. This trend would originality... which has been lacking for a few years now. this is one of the few movies not based on a sequel , historical event/character or comic book. The basic plot of the movie involves Murray and his oceanography team setting to see in last ditch attempt to film a successful sea documentary. Just before Murray and his team are about to leave the docks, his son appears (Owen Wilson)who quickly becomes an honorary member of the Zissou ocean crew. Jeff Goldbloom co-stars in great fashion, although i feel he deserved more screen time as he does in all his films. William Defoe is excellent as Murrays loyal sidekick and Angelica Houton is great as his wife who questions her motives for being with him.The actors fit perfectly into their roles, the film is visually appealing, loaded with dry humor and will make you think for at least 24 hours after you see it. However this film is only for those who prefer movies with such ingredients. If you are one of those people. spend the admission, sit back, relax and enjoy.

Nobody would subject themselves to that much suffering. OK, maybe people into SM. But you would really have to be a class A sickie.There is no plot and it is confusing trying to determine what kind of film it is supposed to be. I mean, if Marlon Brando had suddenly started singing and dancing in ""The Godfather"" it would have made more sense than this movie. If the weirdo murderer in ""No Place for Old Men"" had done puppet shows before killing people, it would made more sense than this movie. If Captain Kangaroo had gut shot Mister Green Jeans and held Bunny Rabbit for ransom, it would have made more sense than this movie. This is not the worse movie every made.

210,abelka-91121,The Life Aquatic orthe story of a strange documentary,8,28 May 2020,"Wes Anderson has always dealt in his films human to dissect the human soul. To understand the other person's spiritual crises. This was represented by Darjeeling Limited or at the Grand Budapest Hotel.Yet Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is a different kind of journey into the human soul. That's how we find our other half. In this case, the one who can set an example for us. An abbot.The cast is also great. Bill Murray as Steve Zissou is brilliant, this is the best role of his life I think.Owen Wilson's character is a true adventurous soul, portrayed by the actor with the right emotions.
Willem Dafoe is a real old sea bear.He always knew where his place is, what he wants, his goals are accurate and well understood. he visual world is brilliant. The sea shots are nicely recorded. And the documentary parts are done precisely and precisely. We feel like we're there underwater with the diving team or living life on board with them.The scenario is fantastic. Wes Anderson has always looked after the story, and especially the drama, and here it is no different.Overall, this is a very good movie, sometimes towed at the pace, but still an enjoyable piece.

211,zingbot,Another great film by Wes Anderson,8,28 March 2006,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou carries on the legacy of Bottle Rocket, Rushmore and the Royal Tenebaums with great aplomb.In a world where most films seem to be more of a chore to watch and have no lasting impact on the viewer, we are lucky to have film makers such as Wes Anderson. It is good that a film can split opinion so much that you either seem to REALLY love or REALLY hate The Life Aquatic, rather than it trying to appeal to everyone and anyone for revenue and box office ratings. I know some people who absolutely love it, to others who hate it with a vengeance. Whether we have been conditioned to need thrills and special effects every set portion of a film is a possible reason. I think that Woody Allen films have the same effect, either it appeals to your nature or it really doesn't. That has to be a good thing.Having watched and enjoyed all of Wes Andersons films there is natural progression from the very bare (but still excellent) Bottle Rocket, right through to the more adventurous Life Aquatic. The common feature is the attention to detail and the little things in the dialogue and visual points that make the film so appealing. A lot of time and effort has obviously been spent making the film, with the cut out ship showing the various cabins being really great, and stupid but excellent bits such as the Team Zissou Adidas training shoes.The acting is first rate. Bill Murray as usual plays the grizzled old has been perfectly. Although all of his roles seem the same these days he is so good at it and such a good actor that he gets away with it. Owen Wilson is excellent as the long lost son, with Willem Defoe in a smaller but equally great role, and Anjelica Houston playing the ex wife just right.The whole plot revolves around the hunt for the elusive Jaguar Shark which apparently killed Zissou's partner, with various adventures along the way. Once again nothing earth shattering happens but the small points such as Zissou taking on a whole army of pirates whilst never getting shot and the rivalry with the rich Jeff Goldblum make the whole film special.The CGI is excellent, not that it looks realistic, but because it looks so fantastic, with the candy crabs and other weird creatures visually stunning and very funny. The ending when they actually find the Jaguar shark is brilliant.I cannot recommend this film highly enough. If you want to smile throughout a film, from Portuguese Bowie to great witty dialogue to crazy CGI animals, The Life Aquatic has it all. Just don't complain to me if you don't like it!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
212,jcm800,"Boring, Put me to sleep. Good music though.",2,13 January 2007,"Well, what can I say. I don't know much about this Wes Anderson chap that some reviewers are so impressed with. I have seen ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", and I can honestly say that neither of those pictures did anything for me either. The music in this picture is the only strong point I can recall. The Portugese renditions of some of the David Bowie classics were quite enjoyable. As some of the tracks were playing I felt like I had heard the music before, but it had just enough of a flavor change that I couldn't pin down what song was playing in a number of places. I didn't find the characters believable, which I gather is the object in this picture. I wasn't particularly aware of any direction or plot that the picture was pursuing. I guess I don't see what's so funny about Bill Murray frankly. The last picture I remember seeing with him in it was ""What about Bob?"", and I didn't think that was all that great either. I kinda liked Bill in ""Stripes"" and I liked him as Todd on the old Saturday Night Live episodes, but this picture did nothing for me at all. I actually couldn't wait for it to be over, so I could say ""Yep, I saw that and it sucked."" Your mileage may vary.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
213,JohnnyNoGood,"Worth seeing, despite flaws",8,11 January 2005,"I'm sure everyone already knows the plot, so I'll spare that paragraph. ""The Life Aquatic"" was a worth-while film. The characters were very interesting and each one, in spite of their rough edges, add so much to each other. But the characters, mainly Zissou, don't seem to change. They all are well-established and have motivations to get what they want, but throughout the film, no one (except Owen Wilson) are altered by the journey for the Jaguar Shark. I thought the plot was simple enough to house the wide array of characters, but also included enough side-plots and mini stories to keep the audience attention. The best part of ""The Life Aquatic"" is the range of emotions. About 4 completely different genres are found within the film. And even though such contrast might make it hard to categorize, it's somehow finds it's niche without a niche. ""The Life Aquatic"" is a very enjoyable movie. I liked it from start to finish and it never hassled me to take notice of certain things or decipher any convoluted scenes. It was simple and had such great dramatic scenes.

217,ellieforpeace,I would recommend The Life Aquatic to almost anyone.,6,12 July 2009,"I will start off this review by saying I would recommend The Life Aquatic to almost anyone. I actually really enjoyed this movie. However, there is something in it that doesn't quite work. There's something that Wes Anderson, the director, is missing in this one. I am a fan of his. I think The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling Limited are quite brilliant and well-crafted movies. The Life Aquatic, I believe, is him trying to find his very definitive voice.When Wes Anderson's first popular movie came out (preceeded by the less well-known Bottle Rocket), Rushmore, it was lauded with mountains of praise, some proclaiming it the defining movie of the nineties. People must not have seen anything else like it. It many ways it's an important precursor to Napoleon Dynamite's mood. And yet, it is his most mainstream movie. The Royal Tenenbaums was a more personal affair, to spectacular effect, and box office scorn. The Life Aquatic came next, which in mood and appearance was more acceptable to a mainstream audience, but again, made very little money. Because it still is very bizarre. After that came Wes Anderson's most refined, and most Wes Anderson-y film, The Darjeeling Limited.But The Life Aquatic is about an estranged and moody marine biologist (more, ""marine adventurer"") named Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) who meets his thirty-year-old son (Owen Wilson) for the first time. He immediately likes him and takes him on a trip of vengeance for the ""Leopard Shark"" that killed his best friend, Esteban. On the trip, they fall for the same journalist (Cate Blanchett), and other things happen like pirates and such.It's crazy, but Wes Anderson has the remarkable ability to make bizarre circumstances almost normal, or just quirky. And The Life Aquatic is quirky to an extreme. To the point where it doesn't really work properly. Or maybe the ultimate matter-of-fact tone of the entire movie doesn't quite fit the circumstances.Steve Zissou is a great character, though. Bill Murray plays him wonderfully. As does Owen Wilson with Ned, and Cate Blanchett as the journalist, whose name happens to be Jane. And everyone else. Anjelica Huston plays the same character she always does in a Wes Anderson movie, the wry, all-knowing, all-powerful, omniscient mother/goddess, present in The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic, and The Darjeeling Limited. She is the source of all the wisdom in the movie, all the revelations. The characters are not allowed to live without her permission. Her absence (and the absence of any mother figure) is very noted in Rushmore. Her presence literally rules over all of Anderson's movies, especially in absence. It's a very peculiar thing, that should probably be discussed in full in another place.The Life Aquatic is just too eclectic for its own good. Despite the Wes Anderson, Noah Baumbach collaboration (The Squid and the Whale, Margot at the Wedding), it doesn't quite work. That's all I can say about it. I do want to reiterate, I like it, but almost not. It's a fun movie nonetheless. With something to learn.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
218,BeautifulDisaster5287,Basic Premise of said film:,8,29 December 2010,"OK so this movie is basically about a washed up documentary film star/director who goes on an adventure to find the mysterious Jaguar Shark that ate his best friend. Along the way there's tons of drama and funny stuff going on. It's hard to explain what the film is really about, but it's worth a watch or two (it's a lot to get the first round so another might be needed...or wanted).Why is it worth a watch? For the following reasons: 1. Bill Murray 2. It's a Wes Anderson movie so you know it has dry humor and great actors and a weird plot line and yea. Wes Anderson kicks a**. 3. WILLEM DAFOE my favvvvvvvorite (and soooo funny!) 4. It's unlike anything else out there. 5. Cody the dog. I want him. 6. The animation is awesome.Nice Touch: Throughout the film, they play David Bowie songs which is awesome in itself, but then they have this amazing black guy with a guitar who sings the same David Bowie songs in Icelandic which is even more awesome...I want the soundtrack.Best Lines: 1. Festival Director: ""That's an endangered species at most. What would be the scientific purpose of killing it?"" Steve Zissou: ""Revenge."" 2. Bill Ubell: ""No Captain! That's Cedric. He's a friend."" Steve Zissou: ""Merci, Cedric. Remind me, we'll send him a red cap and a Speedo."" 3. Jane Winslett-Richardson: ""In twelve years, he'll be eleven and a half."" Steve Zissou: (pause) ""That was my favorite age.""Best Scenes: 1. The whole ""Boat tour"" where Steve is explaining all the compartments. 2.The whole scene on the Ping Island. 3. Finally seeing the Jaguar Shark (andd Sigur Ros ""Staralfur"" is the song in the background which makes this scene steal the film)P.S. Towards the end of the film, they totally hit you with a curve ball which is actually pretty sad, but you probably won't cry or anything...because the movie is really funny. 10 points for Wes Anderson for making this movie...and 10 points to Bill Murray for just being Bill Murray. 8.5/10 Stars.I do more reviews at http://dianalynn5287.blogspot.com/ Look me up gurlllll",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

While I thought the lead characters (Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem DaFoe, Jeff Goldblum) were well cast, the script was abysmal. Jacques Cousteau would be spinning in his grave if this is supposed to be something serious based on his work. The comedic elements were too farcical and far-fetched to be really funny, with lots of languid script forays into self-conscious dialog and idealogical thought. (Big yawn goes here!)In my opinion, Bill Murray is at his best in this movie when he's parodying the boring educational films we've all seen in school classes, with the ubiquitous stiff scientist reading his lines with little or no inflection and totally stilted movement. In general, I've enjoyed Murray's performances in ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Caddyshack"" as well as the ""Ghostbusters"" films and his SNL performances. It's only fair to mention we didn't care for either ""Lost in Translation"" or ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". There were scattered laughs at the screening I attended, and I laughed occasionally myself. However, this movie was vapid and self-conscious and I wouldn't have paid to see it. The film smacks of real cinematic amateurism, especially in photography, editing and continuity. Items on tables jump around. In one shot, you can see the camera crew reflected in a shiny picture on the opposite wall. Some of the hand-held camera work was so jumpy it was impossible to watch. I left the theater scratching my head. But Mom would be proud – I loved the animatronic creatures – the rainbow seahorse and other fish and the real three-legged dog (that barked with its mouth closed in one shot). Also, much of the exterior photography in Rome, Florence, and Naples, Italy is beautiful. I loved their locations. The film made me want to go back to Italy soon. Worst film of the year? Probably not. It isn't even Christmas yet and there are a couple on my list already. An Oscar to Bill Murray? I don't think so, unless there are a lot of people in the Academy who think this particular emperor has new clothes. This film was a big waste of time and I wouldn't recommend it. My advice? Go see ""The Aviator"" or ""Sideways"" or ""Kinsey"" instead. I'm giving it a 'D' – for dumb dialog and dubious plotting. Of course, as with all cinema events, 'Your mileage may vary.'",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
221,strezise,"understated, mildly amusing, not for all tastes",6,15 October 2005,"This is a film you either get or you don't. I found myself mildly diverted rather than enraptured. I rented it on the basis of the cast, which is amazing, including Michael Gambon, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, plus several others who can hold a film on their own. So this offbeat tribute to Cousteau with the well-worn theme of a film within a film had a great deal going for it (as well as sorting out their relationships, Bill Murray and his crew are making a documentary about Murray's revenge-based quest for a Jaguar Shark). However, the dialogue isn't that sharp; in fact it's pretty ordinary, so you have to be amused by the numerous visual gags that surround it and numerous references to other films. Without the wonderful soundtrack, much of it courtesy David Bowie, I think it would have fallen flat. Frankly, I found much of the film derivative. It should have been dazzling.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
222,Caliann,Quirky Yellow Submarine,7,13 June 2005,"Expecting nothing because of poor reviews, I actually enjoyed LIFE AQUATIC. Engaging lethargy and truth seem to be Murray's new acting hallmark, as in LOST IN TRANSLATION and THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS. In fact, AQUATIC is easier to assimilate than TENENBAUMS as the scenery's exotic (fake and real), the sets are novel (rooms in his ship are shown in a cutaway view, the rooms stacked on top and next to one another), and Murray, Huston, Wilson and Blanchett as well as Dafoe and Gambon are swell actors to watch in action. Murray plays Steve Zissou, a caricature of Jaques Cousteau. His recent movies have been flops, no one will stake him to his next exploration, and his wife (Huston) is bored and takes a vacation in her ex-husband's villa. Then, unexpectedly a young man who might be his son enters Zissou's life, reinvigorating him emotionally and financially as the kid has an inheritance that floats the next exploration. And off we go on Zissou's quest to catch the shark that ate his pal. In one of the final scenes, it all comes together when Zissou finally catches up with the elusive Jaguar Shark. He and his team watch the glittering creature swim in and out of view from their little submarine. It's the end of a long quest as well as a long emotional journey for Zissou. He asks, ""Do you think he remembers me?"" Then you realize what the movie's all about - a man's need to feel connected to other human beings, NOT a FISH. It all boils down to being recognized, remembered, and someone else giving a damn.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
223,spec-4,Holy cow this was a bad movie,2,28 February 2006,"can't understand all these good reviews. They must be from intellectual, pin-head wannabees because this movie was just terrible. Review from the same people who gave On Golden Pond an Oscar maybe. If you like movies forget this one. I kept waiting for a payoff that never came. If this is an art film (as some other reviewers state) then it's art like the crucifix in the urine jar is art. There were some clever moments, but what a waste of time. I feel like suing to get those two hours of my life back! You know, there's a reason these ""art films"" don't make any money: they're horrible. No one goes to see them, only pseudo intellectuals who never completed high school and think that by watching these films they have learned something about the social structure of our civilization. Or, maybe those watching it were high on something, you'd need to be for this thing to be entertaining.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
224,zwirnm,Interesting Without Ever Actually Being Good,3,16 March 2005,"A tremendous disappointment, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou the most recent Wes Anderson film, falls apart on a host of levels, remaining interesting at times without ever actually being good. You've seen the trailers, so I won't go into the plot, except to wonder why exactly Anderson thought the life of a Cousteau-inspired underwater explorer and filmmaker would make a good backdrop for a musing on fatherhood and mortality. (On the other hand, I couldn't figure out Tannenbaums either, although I loved Rushmore and thought Bottle Rocket was impressive for a first movie.) I'm increasingly convinced that Anderson wants to tell Important Stories With Morals about families, responsibility, etc. but that the only tools he's ever been able to use are zany characters with idiosyncratic behaviors in peculiar settings. So he has started to misapply the techniques that worked so brilliantly in Rushmore, continually upping the weirdness quotient: first a lonely, manic and desperately romantic kid in a WASPy prep school, then a family of genius misfits, and now a madcap oceanographer and his band of explorers. Unfortunately, he's not figured out where to play up the zaniness, and where to focus on the stories. As a result, Bill Murray - whose work has been simply astonishing in a lot of films - is now getting reduced to a stock character, a washed-up legend who is bitter over the poor decisions made in his life while pining for the glories of his prime. He's good in Life Aquatic but he has too little to work with. Of the Team Zissou squad, Anjelica Houston is touching at times, as is Cate Blanchett as a quietly miserable English journalist. Owen Wilson is -- well, what the hell is he? The issue of his purported parentage is never resolved, although it's strongly implied that he's not Zissou's child after all, but is meant to represent Zissou's urge to serve as a father figure. The hick Air Kentucky get-up and accent are pointless, and go along with the weird CGI fish as Andersonian self-indulgence. And if we don't care about the characters and their relationships with one another, what's the point of all the family moralizing? The rest of the actors in the film - a long list including names like Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, and Michael Gambon - might just be slumming.Things that deserve merit in the film, however, are the brilliant set-design to show the interior of the ship, the lovely tropicalía renditions of David Bowie material by actor/singer Seu Jorge, and the clever name of the ship, which is a great pun.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
225,AGale10495,"Not terribly funny, and boring",5,18 July 2005,"I rented this upon recommendation from a friend, he claimed it was weird but cool or something. And it was either this or the pianist, so we didn't feel like getting depressed.It has a star-studded cast: murray, Wilson, houston, defoe, blanchett - but it doesn't help. The acting is decent enough, but the story lacks interest and it doesn't really keep you watching. I found myself looking at my watch a few times.In addition, it's supposed to be a comedy but there are only like 3 semi-funny parts. The rest are just bland and sometimes stupid. The story is original enough, but overall it's just not an entertaining movie.Skip this one....",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
226,chrishend,Do the interns have glocks?,9,31 December 2004,"How does one comment on a Wes Anderson film after only one viewing? Impossible. A complete waste of time.But I've got nothing better to do, so what the hell ...I enjoyed the movie. Did I ""Rushmore"" enjoy it? No. Did I ""Tenebaum"" enjoy it? I'm not sure. Parts of it.One thing I've noticed about Wes is, the more times you watch his movies, the more you like them. Much of the humor is EXTREMELY subtle, although completely brilliant, and the details are such that one can pick up things even after a 20th viewing. Rushmore went from a movie I loved to one of my all time favorites. Royal Tenebaums went from a top 150 to a top 20 (and if you've seen my top 100 list, that's a pretty impressive achievement).This one started out particularly slow I felt. The beginning scenes with all the ""society"" figures about seemed a little odd. A) they were watching deep sea documentaries, and B) Wes seems kind of speechless in those types of environments. I didn't really get much from this movie through the early parts. Even with the crew introductions and setup, which one would normally think would be enjoyingly odd in a Wes Anderson film, fell somewhat flat.I think it was about half-way through when things really picked up for me. The robbery of his nemesis' station and the pirate attack was when I finally started getting fully interested. The bond stooge as well as the intern that remained with the crew because he wanted to ""see you get that shark"" even though he took a sword cut in the neck were all hilarious (and the rest of the interns quite rightfully only got Incompletes for their grade. Bunch of quitters). I found lots of tiny things that I thought were very funny, although there were times when i was the only one in the theater laughing heartily. Overall the movie was less funny than his first 3, although I personally laughed enough. Wes has always demanded a lot of his audiences, and this film is no exception.The movie didn't wrap up quite as well as Rushmore and RT, but it still managed to pull off that bitter-sweet sentimentality that is very particular to Wes Anderson films, and the existence of which rightfully gives Anderson his occasional ""genius"" label. In its own way this movie is as beautiful as any of his other films, and on its own terms is completely original to cinema, and therefore completely worth viewing.I won't tell you what # ranking I gave it. For some movies you can do that. But this isn't a film one should judge as to whether ""its got a good beat and is easy to dance to"". After another 5 or 6 viewings I'll have a better feel for it. Too early right now.As a small aside, I wasn't sold on the Portuguese Bowie songs. Those that know Bowie well probably enjoyed it more, and thematically I must admit it was a good idea, but for me I didn't recognize most of the songs and they just seemed a bit out of place and superficially interjected into the story. Wes puts together amazing soundtracks and I think the Portuguese might've cost him a chunk of one of his strengths.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
227,Mark-InTheUK,As awful as the The Royal Tenenbaums,1,27 November 2005,"As pretentious as it is unfunny. The first half hour, like the Tenenbaums incidentally, sent me to sleep. It had the same over stylised staged shooting and the same boring, dull, lifeless pace. With an almost identical cast the director has shown he lacks any imagination and still pines for the success of his only decent film, Rushmore; but has not matured since then. He hasn't learnt what made Rushmore watchable and his latest fiasco's drivel.When you look at the potential of the cast, except for Huston whom I've never enjoyed watching and is very over rated as an actress, you'd think that something could have come from this. Bill Murray is one of my favourite comedic actors - from Stripes to Translation he's been fabulous - and one of the reasons I thought I'd give this a go. But Wes managed to squeeze all life out of Murray's talents.Not even worth spending a boring Sunday afternoon with: avoid it.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
228,ELB-6,Not Anderson's best work,5,10 October 2012,I've seen several of Wes Anderson's films. I think 'Life Aquatic' fails on as many levels as it succeeds. It's a very well-shot film: Anderson has an amazing eye and can really stage a frame. But the story/script doesn't allow this often gorgeous-looking film to really achieve much of anything. I was thoroughly charmed by 'Moonrise Kingdom.' Seeing the difference between these two films I think the fault with one (Life Aquatic) and the success of the other (Moonrise) lies with the script. Give a good director a good script and s/he can do wonders. Give a good director a bad or problematic script and sometimes s/he can work wonders but more often than the holes in the script doom the end result.I think the bad (and often unnecessary) CGI did 'Life Aquatic' a disservice as well as its uneven score. One of the things that made 'Moonrise Kingdom' so fantastic was its magnificent score.My 2¢.,The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
229,Mighty_sheman,"The new Cure for Insomnia, The Life Atrocious",1,13 May 2005,"Well I don't quite know where to begin. I dragged a friend along to see this despite his obvious trepidations reassuring him that it would be great. We should have took a jar of 'happy pills' along for the ride, goodness how they would have been appreciated!I find it quite hard to describe how awful this film/abomination really and truly is, but I will try. This film is like a tree in the harsh mid-winter that has tragically had all it's branches cut off. Did that description seem mildly poetic/artistic and open to interpretation yet completely pointless? If yes then it's a perfect description of this film! It is an experience quite beyond compare. Get a bunch of aged but acclaimed actors together and you would rightly expect fireworks what you get is horrific and wholly unspectacular. I don't blame (all of) them because I highly doubt there was any script to work with. There was once an appalling soap called Crossroads that was filmed live in basically one big take, this was what TLA was like except NOTHING interesting happened and the scripts were burned before the actors got into the studio, as an experiment you see. the pauses are not for dramatic effect it is just the 'actors' trying to remember their next line, nay make up their next line, and the whole story as they go along. I was just waiting (hoping) for Bill Murray to turn to camera and say, straight faced, ""sorry guys I forgot my line"" and send the audience into rapturous laughter, it didn't happen. He should have retired after Groundhog Day. Then you have Owen Wilson, pffffffft, well if it's not enough for him to be the same dull unfunny character in EVERY film while struggling to be 1 dimensional never mind 2 dimensional, in this he comes complete with a (bad) southern accent, oooh MR Wilson with your acting skills you are really spoiling us! You know your in trouble when the only character you can connect with is a bemused three legged dog. The whole thing might have been one big joke and the OTT ridiculous action (I use the term loosely) sequences may have been intended to be ironic or amusing but I did not laugh once, neither did anyone in the cinema. In fact their only audible sounds were groans and clattering as they left early en masse, the first time I have seen that in a British cinema (we usually have a higher tolerance for mental torture) and I had to physically restrain my friend to prevent him leaving, he died from brain wastage like some others around us. This film has NO dry wit, we invented it and this is not it, this just lacks any interest or humour (besides immature drivel/stereotyping) whatsoever. The film hardly even manages to look good, it's all pretty monotone and the sets rather shoddy and repetitive. spoilers*The director already spoilt it actually.What happened in this film? who the hell cares? Some guy went on a boat with a bunch of monosyllabic idiots and acted out some adlib soap opera and his son (or not) died tragically in a helicopter accident (hardly surprising as it looked like it was made out of lego) and took a loooooong time to do it. Some people said they found it 'touching' and 'profound', please, I have had cups of tea that were more profound, and memorable. Not one character had anything to mark him/her out from the next dull idiot you would only wish a slow death upon, this is the worst advert for story writing and character development EVER. Even worse than Mulholland Drive! I gave that 2 stars for artistic value, TLA does not deserve such generosity or respect, it should be shown to all film students as an example of what happens when you leave out all the ingredients that make a good film. In fact I put this below Battlefield Earth and the Butterfly Effect as the worst film I have ever seen. At least in those films SOMETHING happened. I like films that are thought provoking and subtle, maybe open for the viewer to interpret. I also like films that have interesting characters that do interesting things! Look at 21 Grams, that does all of the stated, this fails (miserably) to deliver on all counts.It's another sign of the complete implosion of (western) cinema, something has gone badly wrong somewhere. The critics love such dross because it's different, it's all another case of the 'Emperor's new clothes' syndrome, please DO NOT listen to 'movie critics' these days, go and form your own opinions as these robots are probably paid to say good things or are too scared to break from the crowd and speak their mind about such films as this. I think film makers have just run out of things to say, they have no message to give us so blow smoke in our faces instead, sure they still have imagination when it comes to technical matters, but when it comes to substance they are bereft of ideas. So many films are just 2 hours of nothing, and if a film is left to interpretation by default it MUST be genius, it's often a case of the viewer being FORCED to do what writers can't, add fiber and value to meaningless stories. Are they afraid to add interesting events and, god forbid, some character and emotion for fear they'll loose their valuable kudos points, or are they simply not capable/bothered anymore? This film will have it's audience but they are probably people who want to be with the 'in' crowd, students (same thing?) or the type of people who go into modern 'art' galleries and look at a display, a chair thats fallen over or something, and SAY ""wow! That's powerful stuff."" If you enjoyed TLA I highly recommend The Cure for Insomnia!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

And it's also very moving, as well -- a good thing. Bless the producers. If it weren't for them, this imaginative and completely satisfying movie would not have been made. I can hardly believe this example of cinematic perfection is actually a ""Hollywood"" movie.This movie is so brilliant and unusual, it's cast so sublime, its palette and cinematography so knock-out beautiful, and the score and CGI so perfect, it instantly became one of my most favorite films of all time, and I have pretty much seen 'em all. Bill Murray and the entire cast, including Cody the dog, are flawless. The writing and direction inspired. I enjoyed every second of this film and watched it four times in three days, before reluctantly returning it to Netflix. Needless to say, I am buying it ASAP for my collection.

231,bob.gladish,Another Bill Murray Slightly Quirky One.,8,25 June 2005,"Coming exactly one year after ""Lost In Translation"", I now think I have a true handle on Bill Murray's screen persona. Billl definitely is a one-trick pony, and he uses it to full advantage in this one. Murray has the ability to control the whole tempo of a movie in which he is the feature performer: just like ""Lost In Translation"", every thing goes at a very slow, low-key, syncopated pace. Everything seems slightly dreamy-like: the lights and cultural oddities of a schizophrenic Tokyo in ""Translation"", the tragic events of ""Aquatic"". Murray goes through his paces in an almost trance-like state. And it works.The script is excellent. Murray's Steve Zissou is a fascinating person. The movie is a great portrayal of a man whose empire is unraveling before our very eyes. We can see his career as a documentary-making oceanographer (a la Jacques Cousteau) gradually become unglued - partly because of bad judgement, partly because of bad luck, mostly because it was just his time (just like a star athlete, who inevitably loses that magic).Once again, I really like the work of Cate Blanchett. I saw her Katherine Hepburn in ""The Aviator"" just before this one. Great stuff - but she's just as good here, as the very direct, no-nonsense quasi-journalist who manages to lift Zissou out of his hazy funk. Not so great are Owen Wilson, as the maybe son, and Wilhem Dafoe, as the oddball first-mate. But what I really dislike the most about this movie is the very poor underwater scenes. They are poor animations that don't even resemble what's beneath our seas. There could have been a lot more actual underwater footage, that would have given a authenticity to the underseas. This cartoon-like approach just doesn't cut it. It's like Wes Anderson, the director, decided too many underwater scenes were too difficult to try to recreate under actual conditions so why not animate them. Increasingly, directors these days are using animation to diversify their story-telling, and often, it works. But I don't like it here.What I most like about it is that I just know it is going to leave me with a very lasting impression, just as ""Lost In Translation"" has. Bill Murray's creation of a man with a hazy, existential reaction to modern life has created a mood in me I will never forget.....strangely, kind of like the kid in ""Napolean Dynamite"".",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

The understanding of human behavior and sociology is just incredible. He knows people so well, that he can accurately parody any scenario against the absurdities behind them. The Life Aquatic is no different. The humor is so dry it only registers if you're truly paying attention. The script rewards you later for doing so. It's like a true documentary that occasionally checks up on you, and it's damn hilarious. You won't laugh out loud at it, but you damn well should appreciate it.

239,littlemes,Anderson does it again,8,10 December 2004,"Steve Zissou: A legendary oceanographer past his prime with a shot at redemption. The (possible) son of his he never knew he had appears. A mission of revenge against the shark who killed Steve's best friend. Trouble between Steve and a popular rival, as well as a love triangle. An attack by 'pirates' and hostages taken. A chance to rescue said hostages, prove his quality, and save his marriage and career all at once.THIS is a Wes Anderson film? Proudly, yes. THIS fits into the idiosyncratic world and style he's created in his previous three films? Perfectly. Director Anderson (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums) manages to do his work one better by combining a more 'traditional'/mainstream plot line with the unique characterizations, original, out-there dialogue, unique comic timing, and stylized use of color and music(David Bowie tunes in Portuguese! Yes!) that he's known for. Anderson knocks another one out of the park. If you're a fan and settle easily into the worlds he shows us, it's another fine, if slightly distant at first, chapter in his career book. What about if you're not into his films or haven't been exposed to his method? Not sure what to saygive it a shot like the rest of us did a few films ago and enjoy the ride. Continuing his repertoire of melancholic, well-meaning visionaries who affect all around them, Anderson (and first-time collaborator, writer/director Noah Baumbach) tells the tale of Steve Zissou, a Cousteau-esque explorer whose endless deadpan docudramas (used to) enthrall the public and wealthy benefactors. Steve's new film, The Life Aquatic part one, ends with the death of his best friend Esteban(eaten!). After its mixed reception he is determined to take his aging boat to sea again with his ragtag crew (and a handful of unpaid college interns) to chronicle part two: where he will encounter and destroy the 'jaguar shark' who killed his friend. Ned Plympton (Owen Wilson) arrives at the post-show benefit to meet Zissou, and mentions the possibility of being his son. Despite the mutual uncertainty they bond, with Ned becoming a part of Team Zissou; much to the chagrin of Klaus(Willem Dafoe), the whiny yet big-hearted third-in-command. Dragging along a pregnant, snippy yet admiring reporter(Cate Blanchett), the perpetually stoned Zissou's mission becomes more about soul-searching instead of simple revenge...after raiding his rival's radar station for supplies and non-malfunctioning equipment(Steve's ship, the Belafonte, is art-directed right out of an alternate-universe 1970's), the boat is attacked by scavengers, and Steve and crew must step up and do the right thing. Bill Murray, as Zissou, wins in another understated, subtly downbeat performance. The entire cast is enjoyable and game for the strangeness, even if the style and offbeat humor may distance some viewers from having any immediate identification with the characters. A proud-to-be-weird Moby Dick as only Wes Anderson does them, THE LIFE AQUATIC takes some time for one to settle in but does just that as the story gets increasingly strange-plot discussions are useless since they don't effectively convey HOW it's staged here. Some years ago, indie filmmaker Hal Hartley directed a film titled AMATEUR which reflected, supposedly, how he felt directing an action/thriller plot. Known for his deadpan comedies, Hartley didn't alter his approach one bit despite a plot line you'd expect an action/suspense director to tackle. Anderson goes for a similar take here.When events take a turn for the James Bond-ish in The Life Aquatic, it will be jarring for those who go in expecting the standard storytelling you would usually get from this plot. Can a Glock really hold 40+ bullets? Can someone have an deep yet casual conversation with three slugs in the heart? It's obvious that Anderson doesn't even care, and that's what's REALLY funny. He cares about his characters and wants to get them through their journey. (wait for the hilarious scene where Steve gets his rage on and turns the tables on his captors..priceless) Anderson also nicely leaves out the standard heart-tugging or adrenaline-laced scores when tragedy strikes or the pace quickens. Kudos to the decision to use retro special effects and deliberately fake seascapes, somehow it helps you buy this world. Most of the colorful sea critters they enounter are stop-motion throwbacks lovingly rendered by Henry Selick(Nightmare before Christmas). If you're an Anderson junkie you know exactly what you're getting yourself into. Others? Take a chance. Explore the deep with Team Zissou.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
240,nmibaker,A Painting of a Movie,9,4 August 2021,"This movie is so much and so little at the same time.The pure artistry of Wes Anderson sold the film for me from the beginning but I think the rest of the characteristics continued to sell me more and more.The best part of this film is how each frame is so detailed and intricate to paint an amazing painting. Wes Anderson always does a great job doing this, however I especially love the shot of the ship as if you sliced it in half and opened it up to see whats going on, almost like a doll house. His attention to detail is insane.Of course whenever Bill Murray and Wes Anderson work together theres always a magnificent outcome. I like how their partnership keeps each other going. Not that Wes Anderson needs Bill Murray to create amazing films, but how he always has him there for support. Not gonna lie though, Bill Murray might need Wes Anderson to keep his career relevant. I think some of the best acting we've seen of Bill Murray has been his characters in his Wes Anderson films.After reading some facts from the trivia section on here, I found out that parts of the film were based off a true story. This makes me laugh because there was a real person as eccentric and 'weird' as Bill Murray's role and I'm interested to find out more about him. Of course now that I'm writing about it, I can't remember what his name is, whatever.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
241,eemodork,work of genius,10,15 January 2005,"This movie is spectacular.to start, the script is Andersons strongest and most imaginative work yet. I loved the dialogue, the slight swagger the words gave bill murray(who was awesome).the directions was almost directed like a play... which works so well. The cutout for the belefonte, that follows from room to room was perfect for this movie.the acting was extremely strong in this movie. This is an ensemble movie, but some performance that stood out were Bill Murray(he is the greatest living actor today, IMO) Owen Wilson( his death scene was so sad, yet Owen played it with such class and dignity, something i never have seen from him before) Angelica Houston( she was kind of bitchy but in a loving sorta way and was still able to come off classy), Willam Defou(effin funny... Anderson and him should do more work together), Jeff Goldblum(who is hysterical as well in this movie).and the music was perfect... all the David bowie covers were great, and the ping island theme was so funny, when bill murray danced and it just fit the movie perfectly.the only thing i would complain about is more of the music and the sea creatures... both were incredible, and i wanted more, especially from the observation hole... would have made this movie a bit more vibrant and fantasy like, but still its an awesome movie and I would still give it an A.I didn't think if Anderson could top himself after the royal Tannenbaum's, but i was wrong.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
242,BobsBrotherFutureman,A rare kind of beauty.,9,6 May 2005,"This is Wes Anderson's fourth movie and while it is not his finest, it is still fabulous. A quick note, I always find it amusing that most reviewers go out of their way to make reference to Wes in their film while when reviewing something like ""Sideways"" or say ""Finding Neverland,"" you would not expect to see the same respect paid to the director. Wes certainly has made a name for himself.The story is about Steve Zissou, an oceanographer who's best friend was killed by the mythical Jaguar Shark in his last voyage. He vows revenge on the shark but things are a little complicated when he is introduced to his long lost son, Ned Plimpton, his wife separates and one of his men is kidnapped by Filipino pirates.Sound a little overly complex? It is. My first screen writing professor HATED when a filmmaker would have too many subplots, tangents and characters. He often complained about that in my writing. It is a dangerous thing to do, however, Wes does it well. The beauty about Wes is that he is optimistic in regards to his characters. Although the world is full of disappointment, the characters may not be fit socially or anything like that but they attempt to leave a dent in the world with what they do have. There is a lot of sharp writing here and while it may not have as many quotable lines as his previous efforts(""little bananas,"" ""That's the last time you stick a knife in me,"" etc), he certainly does well.The film has a lot of rare unique characteristics to it, and that does not just refer to the stop-motion fish or the portugese Bowie music. Like a good director, Wes pays close attention to every detail in every scene and it pays off.The problem with Wes's films is that they are all billed as straight out comedies. I was reading a moviefone article that billed The Life Aquatic as a ""dramady"" and that is the best way to describe his films. His use of drama and relationships is what makes Wes stand out so much. Don't get me wrong, his movies are often hilarious but can make you cry moments later. The movie is about struggling with age, lost brilliance, a parental relationship, loss and redemption. It is a film that must be viewed more than once and while it may be a bit too absurd for many, there still is a lot of humanity to the film. I give this film my highest recommendation and applaud Wes, considering the fact he is one of the best current filmmakers.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
243,Kurt_Cocaine,"A dream come true,",10,26 December 2004,"This film is fantastic, I don't really like Wes Anderson that much, but I've never hated a Bill Murray film, First, the imagery and art direction is quirky and light-hearted, I love the red hats and tacky Addidas shoes, and Wilem DaFoe looks generally amusing in short-shorts, Second, the soundtrack is good, the original music is scored by Mark Mothersbaugh of DEVO and the songs that Uganda sings and plays are Potugese translations of classic David Bowie songs, Third, Owen Wilson performs fantastically as Ned Plimpet, the man who may or may not be Steve's son, this is the first film in which I didn't totally hate Wilson's performance, I actually cried in the theater when his Ned died, and finally, it has the single greatest line in film history, ""F*cking amateurs, you left your dog here, you idiots!"" Well worth the admission and yes, believe the hype on this one, Oh, and props to them on the faux-Costeau documentary sequences where Zissou constantly points to the wrong objects on the diagrams, charts and maps,I had a hard time keeping a straight face seeing this, do not take this as one of those ""Everyone should see it"" reviews, it IS a Wes Anderson directed/produced/written comedy with Bill Murray in the star seat, so it is offensive and bizarre, so if you like satire and enjoy unique cinematography, check this out, if you hate anyone of the key players to the film ,I probably wouldn't suggest this to you,",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
244,davidgkimberley,I love Wes Anderson,8,4 January 2012,"There is an incredible ambiance about Wes Anderson films, some sort of weird, wonderful and this is definitely true for The Life Aquatic. Bill Murray plays Steve Zissou, an renowned oceanographer whose moment of glory seems to have passed. The film starts with Zissou showing his latest film in which his best pal, Esteban, is eaten by what he calls a ""jaguar shark"". After the showing Zissou meets his long lost son, Ned, (played by Owen Wilson), who gives him the funding to make another documentary in which he intends to kill the so called ""jaguar shark"".What follows is an adventure / comedy type film with a fantastically strange, but wonderful, cast, costumes, settings and story. Whilst Bill Murray's deadpan display is most prominent, all the other performances are really good and special kudos to Klaus who I thought was great fun. Wes Anderson's directing is also on point. The initial ""tour"" of the boat is really cool and the way the camera moves from room to room (or set to set) is very simple but works very well throughout the film and I reckon a few action directors should take heed. The action sequences themselves and the CGI moments look almost cheap or over the top, out of film school or something, but this actually worked well with the (dare I say it) quirky spirit of the film.Without having seen it its really hard to explain why one might think the film was so great given how reasonably bog standard it sounds. There just feels like there's more to it than there is on face value and I, personally, always get this good feeling after watching Wes Anderson films that's kind of hard to explain, like you've witnessed something wonderful or achieved something great. Definitely one to watch.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
245,dbuffalo,The most perfect thing that Bill Murray has done on film in the last 10 years is NOT this film,1,25 December 2004,"The most perfect thing Bill Murray has done on film in the last 10 years is hit a perfect drive on the flat fairway of some hole on a Japanese golf course in ""Lost In Translation"". Sadly, that's the only thing. I think Bill needs to tee them up and quit making films. His late career is an utter embarrassment to us all.Remember my bias: I like Bill Murray the actor and comedian, but he in my opinion starred in the worst film ever made ""Where The Buffalo Roam"". This one, if not beautifully shot, would be right there with it in terms of its low standing.Never have I seen a collection of overpaid actors whose careers are in steep decline as I have in this thing. Wes Anderson, who is the father of twisted psychological comedy dealing with either forbidden, hindered, or unwanted relationships (Rushmore for example), has cast Bill Murray in the goof ball protagonist role that Jason Schwartzman played as Max Fischer in Rushmore. If Bill had been 16 and precocious, he could have gotten away with the stupid humor in this film. But sadly, Bill is 55, overweight, seemingly uninterested in the role, and forcing the smart-alack bad boy image he could get away with two to three decades ago.I am an old-school constitutional libertarian. I do not believe that anyone has the right NOT to be offended. The first amendment is the first amendment regardless of how my buddies on the left want to trash it (and our political freedoms). Regardless, Bill and Wes, through this script utterly trash in unfunny ways about every stereotypical underclass. If you are pregnant, gay, lesbian, a female in general, someone with money (and the good sense not to spend it on tripe which is how you ended up with it), or committed to a true cause (this film is practically a public urination on the reputation of Jacque Cousteau), your interest group is pretty much savaged. I love satire (and so should anyone else). This script is not satirical, however. It is angry,boringly repetitive (I lost count of the use of the term of term ""bull dyke"" early on in the film), unfunny, and forced. This movie might even be a metaphor for the process Wes Anderson used to make the film. Wes schmoozes some bored, knuckle-headed old money people to bamboozle them into making a satire about ocean exploration. Somehow, through his goofy wit and charm, he convinces a few boobs to send some money his way so that he can create a visually beautiful dud which, if the sound were just turned down and the actors ignored, might make a wonderful 1960s-style travelogue.Willem Dafoe is also utterly ridiculous in this film (not funny, professionally ridiculous in very bad sort of way). Angelica Houston attempts to be a true-life Morticia Adams and fails horribly (her hairdresser and make up artist should also be publicly flogged for their work). She doesn't work as a silly heiress either. If you rent Rushmore, you will at least understand the interplay of characters in this film. Before you see this film, I think it best for you to rent Rushmore, a bizarre but at least mildly interesting film. If you hate Rushmore, by all means, don't waste any more money by seeing this one. If you rent it and like it, then if you feel charitable and want to see how similar concepts are utterly butchered by a writer/director and a cast of misfit overrated actors, then blow the other 10 dollars to see this. I just hate for people to waste $10 on anything, so don't say I didn't warn you.As far as Oscar nominations, I would like to find that brass-knuckled bouncer named Oscar and nominate him to visit the people who were stupid enough to make this film. If he is still interested after performing that hit, then go find some of the people who acted in it. Hint to Oscar...Bill is on the 7th tee (and he should be forced to stay there for the rest of his natural life).What I wrote above, amateurish, unfunny, and generally in bad taste as it is, is funnier than anything in The Life Aquatic.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
246,montecristo42,The Best Line of the Year (SPOILERS),9,10 January 2005,"Wow. I thought this movie was good, until Team Zissou came upon the mythical shark and Zissou asked the question ""I wonder if it remembers me?"" with tears in his eyes. At that point, the movie became great. My fiancée and I had gone to the theater to see The Aviator. When that sold out, we tried to get Hotel Rwanda tickets, but that sold out. The Life Aquatic was our third choice, and when I originally saw the trailer, I thought ""that looks good, but maybe it'll be a rental."" I was overwhelmingly surprised. The movie is funny, intelligent, and yes, poignant. And Bill Murray was fantastic. I'd say he deserves the Oscar, but Jamie Fox does too for his career performance in Ray. In that one scene, Murray conveyed so many things with one line--he understood. He understood that all his life, all he ever wanted was to be remembered. He understood that that was pathetic. He understood that Ned Plimpton had probably asked the same question to himself his entire life, concerning his father that never was. He understood that the shark didn't remember him, even though it had had a profound impact upon him. He understood, in turn, that he had had a profound impact upon people he didn't 'remember' such as Ned as a child and his fan base.Willem Defoe shined as well in a quirky, but excellent, performance as a German engineer who adores Zissou. The humor was off-key, but hit every time.Now, I want to see Rushmore and The Royal Tenanbaums. THank you Wes Anderson and Bill Murray.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

The only reason I have rated this film as a 4 is because I was sucked into it by the preview.I loved the preview (all good parts of the movie are in the preview) from the first time I'd seen it, and so I made the 1+ month long wait visiting The Life Aquatic website to satisfy my tastes so that I could get through a few weeks. Bill has always impressed me with his acting and spirit, but I found The Life Aquatic to be boring and dull, lacking any kind of enthusiasm or for that matter, life itself.I wanted depth, comedy, quaint clay effects and a good time... what I got was a soda without the carbonation.Life should not be dull, yes we have our ups and downs, but do we have to emphasize our tragedies through lackluster displays of grimy, muddy, depressed and spiritless films?

The acting is terrible, the direction from Wes Anderson stinks, the sets look fake and extremely cheap, the story is confusing, the entire film isn't funny, Owen Wilson's part in the film is a joke, Willem Dafoe's part in the film is horrible, the creature effects look stupid and childish, there is no action, the movie is very slow, the movie is very boring and idiotic and Bill Murray has ruined his career by taking part in this lame and wretched film!I can't believe that most of the film critics love this film! They must be completely nuts! Most critics gave this piece of junk a better review than Raiders Of The Lost Ark! Some even insisted that Bill Murray should win the Oscar for Best Actor! They are insane! Further more I can't believe that anyone would make this movie, I mean everything about it stinks! Wes Anderson (who directed the terrible film ""The Royal Tenenbaums"") has proved yet again, by directing this film, that he is the worst director on the face of the Earth! If you thought Lost In Translation was bad (and it was) then you will start crying when you see how awful this rotten film is! And for all of the crazy people here who actually loved this film, I suggest that you go to a mental institution for some serious help! I mean come on! On this site, Golden Eye, a wonderful 007 film, has a lower rating than this movie! How could people like this trash better than a 007 film! Those people must be nuts! I hope that Wes Anderson (whom I hate with all my heart) is thrown in jail for life for making such a crappy film! This movie stinks beyond your wildest dreams! Wes Anderson should be paying people to see this awful sorry excuse for a movie! But people wouldn't watch this movie even if he paid them! That's because watching this movie is inhumane torture! And for those of you who said that you wanted to see this movie twice in the theatre, you must be insane!!!!!This movie deserves a -10 but since 1 is the worst rating that you can give here, I'll have to give The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou a 1.

253,ColtSeavers,It's an adventure !,9,11 October 2006,"This film was probably the most enjoyable cinematic experience I have had in years - since I saw American Beauty, probably. It was the first Wes Anderson Movie I watched (meanwhile, I have seen them all), and it may very well be the best. As Bill Murray correctly states in the Bonus Material on the DVD ""it's so full of content"", you hardly know where to begin: An aging adventurer (Steve Zissou), whose fame is fading, has to confront the fact that he is being overtaken by younger people in almost every respect (a younger researcher who is ""getting all the grants"", a guy who may be his son and gets the pregnant girl Steve wanted to get). For a long time, he struggles to get back in control, sometimes in pretty bad mannered ways, but in the end he realizes that life IS NOT controllable but ""an adventure"" (the last sentence spoken in the movie), that this is what makes it so fascinating, and that the unpredictable journey of life makes no sense without the company of people who are close to you (Wes Anderson's well known family-theme). The movie also makes a strong statement in favor of dreaming, innocent ""childish"" fantasies (stop-motion ""sugarcrabs""), and explorer spirit, which give life meaning and direction. What makes it so extraordinary is the mixture of such serious topics and the lighthearted, sometimes absurd presentation (the uniforms and speedos, the cross-sectional ship scene, Bowie-songs in Portguese, silly action sequences, unreal underwater expeditions). The tragic, the touching and the ridiculous are simultaneously present all the time, just like in life. This trademark principle of all Anderson movies has probably been most perfectly implemented in ""The Life Aquatic"". It was a lot of fun to read some of the more negative comments here, written by people who were obviously disappointed because during the entire movie no-one holds up a sign explaining the message, the humor is slightly more subtle than in ""Jackass"", and there is only a handful of minor explosions. Never mind, folks.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

It's just not engaging, it feels too much like a parody to involve the viewer. It's not a comedy either, which is why a moment or two in the film take you by surprise and feel out of place. Bottom line, you should see it if you expect an odd movie that just keeps on being odd and doesn't really go anywhere, but has its moments and includes the refined acting of Bill Murray of the kind seen in ""Lost in Translation"" (not too mention the uncharacteristic character played by Willem Dafoe :-)",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

It has some memorable moments, but overall, it doesn't work, probably because it, and the audience, doesn't really seem to know what it actually is.Is it a comedy? It has a few funny bits.Is it a drama? It has a few moments of pathos and some explorations of hero worship, fatherhood, and mid-life crisis.Is it an adventure film? There are a few attempts at excitement that fall curiously flat.Is it a sci-fi/fantasy? Actually it seems pretty rooted in a warped reality, except for the exotic (computer-generated sea creatures.) Is it a satire of documentary film-making? It has several sequences that seem to imply this.Is it an homage to Jacques Cousteau? There are a few moments of admiration for the undersea explorer. (The boat is not called ""The Calypso"" but ""The Belafonte."") Is it a parody of Jacques Cousteau? The fake documentary movie clips seem to be poking fun at the late, great oceanographer.Is it a Bill Murray vehicle? Although Bill Murray is the star, and he is playing the type of laconic cad he has excelled at playing in the past, he seems to be phoning it in here. (I guess he already, more effectively, used up his ""guy-in-his-fifties-experiencing-midlife-crisis"" shtick in ""Lost in Translation"".)

257,reverb_88,"Somewhat troubling, but ultimately satisfying.",10,3 January 2005,"""The Life Aquatic"" I had been looking forward to this movie since its earliest stages. I remember getting on the internet and looking all over the place to find those first pictures of Bill Murray in his blue suit and red cap. ""Rushmore"" is probably my favorite movie and I have an enormous love and passion for his other films ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", so I was VERY interested in his first real ""big"" film. Well, I saw it and it's no ""Rushmore"". But I also have to ask myself: What is? ""Rushmore"" affects me in a weird way. I could watch it 100,000 times and still not be tired of it. Where ""Rushmore"" was extremely tight, ""The Life Aquatic"" is really really loose. It's literally all over the place. The plot veers into strange and wonderful sub-plots that don't really add up, but still manage to intrigue you. I couldn't really describe how I felt about the film. I liked it, of course. But then again, this IS Wes Anderson, one of my favorite directors. How could anyone in their right mind not enjoy an underwater adventure movie with animated sea creatures, action scenes with pirates, and...Bill Murray?! It's impossible not to smile. It's impossible not to enjoy yourself and I think that's where the strength of the movie lies. Just shut up and watch. Of course, that's really hard for me. I was troubled by the movie, but I was also filled with the same wonderful sensation that I get from every Anderson movie. It's not the ""Rushmore"" buzz, but it still feels incredible. This guy is probably the most creative filmmaker on the planet. It is an awesome movie even though it doesn't always work. Some people will probably tell you that Anderson is wearing thin or that his style is getting worn out and won't last much longer. I've thought all of these things as well, but I don't want to see Anderson fall. Holy crap, we need him. I need Wes Anderson. My entire life passion could be totally different if it weren't for ""Rushmore"". I can't imagine a world without his brand of film-making. I can't imagine a world without his brilliant characters. A world without Max Fischer, Kumar Pallana, Royal Tenenbaum, Dignan and Anthony, and Steve Zissou?! No!!! That would suck supreme! A supreme suck!

258,chucksnow5,Jacques Cousteau Takes it...,6,14 May 2005,"While I don't consider this as good as the 3 other Wes Anderson films, it is still far superior to the ""You got served"" ""Triple X"" ""Mission impossible"" crap that Hollywood insists we endure.Like most of Andersons films the story really is superficial. The true film is about the relationships between the characters, and their backgrounds. The dialog, backstory, history, and psychological make-up of the characters, and the nuances of the situations are what drive the film. What we have been indoctrinated to know as ""plot"" falls by the wayside.This film is obviously a poke at the Jacques Cousteau films that I loved (and made fun of) as a young man. The ship in the film is named 'Belafonte'. Cousteau's ship was named ""Calypso"". -Who was the King of Calypso music? Harry BELAFONTE.Cousteau started his career by inventing the SCUBA apparatus (Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus), became a global leader in underwater research, and then ended his career by narrating films about mundane surf creatures. (""In a flazh zee muzzer tertle terns on our cameraman, Shee attacks heem, eet is all we can do to escape alive."") Cousteau's Calypso had a Helicopter and a Hot Air Balloon.Cousteau was so popular that John Denver (at the height of both their popularities) sang a song about Cousteau's ship! (Calypso) The Life Aquatic is not as tight as Tennenbaums, nor as engrossing as Rushmore, but it is eminantly as watchable. Like the other Anderson films it cannot be watched once. If you watch it once you'll find yourself going back to it again and again, studying it, looking for things you might have missed...And isn't that the point of film making?",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
259,hall10000,Is there life on MARS.,6,8 March 2005,"THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU a film by Wes Anderson.What defines a cult film? I don't know, one thing I do know though is that you can't truly consider yourself to be cool if you haven't seen RUSHMORE. Risking being called an eccentric I proclaimed that the rebirth of Bill Murray as an actor, if he ever was one, did not happen when he was LOST IN TRANSLATION but it did take place at RUSHMORE, both films share one thing though, MURRAY is always trying to score younger chicks and guess what he does in AQUATIC anyway in the acting college of life there are actors who went to RUSHMORE and others that just didn't. Steve Zissou, filmmaker-oceanographer, lost his partner eaten by a shark while filming his latest movie, now he embarks in a new mission to avenge his friend and kill the beast. Max Fischer said it best ""you have to find something you love to do and then do it for the rest of your life"", Mr Anderson not only wrote that line but took it as a way of making films. The most important thing in art is to find your own style and then make it unique, Wes Anderson has achieved that and although most people won't like it the man has a particular vision full of trademarks. Bill Murray goes hand in hand with that vision sharing the ironic quality of making people laugh with seriousness, is all about restrain and straight faces kind of the opposite of what Jim Carrey does. Is also compulsory to have at least one of the Wilson brothers and to be honest I'd have Owen Wilson writing rather than acting based in the fact that I can't see his nose, literally speaking. Another trademark and probably Anderson motto is ""characters are more important than plot"", get a billion actors to wander along the worlds you create so nobody notice that there is nothing actually going on. The downside to this is that the screen can feel a bit busy sometimes and no one is really defined. My personal favorite is Pele Dos Santos who seams the scenes together with Bowie's song covers that also set the dramatic tone perfectly in both the soundtrack and the movie, if you don't like the movie you can always play the game of guessing what songs is he covering, difficult task even for a Bowie fanatic like myself. A bit of trivia, his name is a composite of two of the most famous Brazilian footballers ever, the national team never lost when those two were playing together. Another one, Anderson always closes movies in style and slow motion, kind of living the best for last. AQUATIC have them all and this is a very dangerous game to play because you live and die with your characters, if the audience doesn't connect with them the movie will sink like the TENEMBAUMS, he plays it safe here choosing another of his obsessions as a lead man Mr Jackes Costeu, a pretty healthy fixation if you ought to have one and the main reason why the movie worked for my this time around, everybody likes Costeu. Wes Anderson makes us laugh again and I wonder if he'll ever know he's in the best selling show is there life on MARS?***",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

He's found the perfect characters for his personality. Another stellar job.And once again Wes Anderson joins a few other recent directors in weaving great music into his movies.

261,pjcarline,In the shadow of its precursor,7,28 February 2005,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is director Wes Anderson's fourth film, centring around the adventures and mishaps of offbeat aquatic director Steve Zissou. Zissou (Bill Murray) is in the depths of a mid-life crisis. Facing dwindling interest and disinterested audiences, his latest picture - charting the whereabouts of the mythical jaguar shark - has fallen on deaf ears, and the creature has chewed his best friend Esteban (Seymour Cassel) into the bargain. Zissou's second marriage to his disillusioned ""rich bitch"" wife Eleanor (Anjelica Huston), is very much on the rocks, while his nemesis Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum), is ready to pick up the pieces. Seeking revenge, Zissou embarks on a final mission to hunt and destroy the jaguar shark on his decrepit vessel, The Belafonte. Joining Zissou are Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) a Kentucky pilot who may or may not be Zissou's son, and pregnant, bubble-blowing British journalist, Jane Winslett-Richardson (the enchanting Cate Blanchett), who is compiling a no-holds barred piece on the ailing star. On board, 'Team Zissou' consists of an unnecessarily large and slapdash crew, featuring a crazed Teutonic (Willem Dafoe), 15 unpaid interns and a Portuguese acoustic guitar player with a penchant for David Bowie. Members are uniformly kitted out in matching retro track-suits, red bobble hats, speedo's, Glock's and the sadly discontinued Adidas Zissou range. After a battle over finances (extravagant Zissou has a sauna room on board, while interns sip Moet over dinner), Ned conveniently assists with funding the operation, thanks to a $275,000 trust fund, and the large ensemble cast head into unchartered and unpoliced waters. For fans of Anderson's previous work (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums) there is much on offer. The camera effortlessly pans throughout the interior of The Belafonte, with the set resembling the interior of an ant hill as the assembled crew go about their daily lives. Anderson leaves nothing to spare with his famed attention to detail, with each room featuring an array of history, literature, pictures and pastimes. The Life Aquatic is a dry and sardonic take on the life and works of Jacques Cousteau, featuring some amusing staged discoveries of previously unknown species and imaginative computer generated creatures, with scenes bound together by the Portuguese Bowie-inspired soundtrack. Yet, in compiling a review of The Life Aquatic, it is impossible not to mention Anderson's 2001 masterpiece, The Royal Tenenbaums. Both films revolve around a deeply-flawed male central character, struggling to come to terms with middle age and the responsibilities of fatherhood. Yet, while Tenenbaums features a glorious array of well-rounded - albeit dysfunctional - characters, it is tough to name a character within The Life Aquatic which strikes the same chord. While Murray is exceptional as the laconic and frequently dismissive Zissou, the viewer remains firmly at arms length, and other usual show stoppers (Wilson in particular), struggle to get past the first dimension. As a film in its own right, The Life Aquatic is a brave and wonderful spectacle, but when placed alongside Tenenbaums, there is a disappointing sense of deja vu. It seems Anderson's first collaboration with new writing partner Noah Baumbach is essentially re-charting old waters.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
262,JMSchmidtty,"Funny, Sad, Quirky, Entertaining",8,6 July 2014,"Very often I find that Wes Anderson's films only get better with every viewing, and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is no exception.On the first viewing, I had mixed feelings about it, but on the second viewing, I realized how great it was. I say if you feel you didn't quite get it the first time around, watch it again.The film's strengths are, mostly, the strengths that can be found in all of Wes Anderson's films: the music (Seu Jorge's renderings of David Bowie into Portuguese, as well as Sigur Ros' ""Staralfur"" during the climax), the production design, the acting (with props to Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, as well as Jeff Goldblum, whose performance I feel is often overlooked), as well as the cinematography (props to Robert Yeoman).The film's theme, I feel, is for the need of something central to our lives. Steve's longtime best friend dies at the beginning, his wife leaves him, and he's got little funding left. He puts two things at the center of his life: his supposed son Ned (Kingsley), and the jaguar shark that supposedly killed his friend.Even though the film's central theme is rather sad, the film is absolutely hilarious. There's a lot of Anderson's trademark dry humor and quirkiness present, further enhanced by Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas)'s stop-motion creature effects.So I say, watch this film. If you feel mixed about it, watch it again. It may be better than you remembered.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
263,spludwig26,'Life' stays afloat in a sea of weirdness,7,19 April 2005,"Writer/director Wes Anderson (""Rushmore,"" ""The Royal Tenanbaums"") has always produced strange films with rich characters and a little bit of heart. His fourth and latest adventure, ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" is no exception, but it is his worst to date.We begin at a European film festival where Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), a washed up leader of sea-faring documentary filmmakers, is showing off his latest film, ""The Jaguar Shark Pt. 1."" The film looks like an old documentary you'd watch in elementary school because the teacher was feeling lazy.Zissou is on his last leg as a professional and is desperate for revenge. While shooting his latest film, his best friend was killed by a mythological shark. To exact his revenge, he plans to take his diverse crew out once again and film the shark's demise.Meanwhile, Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), is a young pilot for Air Kentucky that approaches Zissou with the notion that he may be his son. Ned's mother has recently passed away and he only has rumors that have guided him to Zissou.The motley crew is comprised of several fine actors, including William Defoe as a German ""engineer,"" and Angelica Houston as Zissou's brilliant wife. Jane (Cate Blanchett), a reporter, also joins the trip so she can write a cover story on Zissou and provide a love interest for Steve and Ned.Overall, the film is a slow-moving oddity that immerses us into another world. Rather than attempting any realism, Anderson and co-writer Noah Baumbach, have created an alternate universe where pirates are still attacking ships and the fanciful fish on display are computer animated. I enjoyed the unique sets and inventive atmosphere, but I did not care much for the thin story.For much of the first half, the audience is given the idea that a deeper plot might bubble up, but it never comes. The film treads water for the last half, slowly sinking into its shallow waters. In compensation, the audience is provided with developed characters. Anderson decided not to focus on story so much as developing his leading man. Zissou is an ambitious asshole who always has a frown on his face. Like many other Anderson characters, Zissou is a flawed protagonist who learns a lesson or two about life.Thankfully, Murray's great performance makes the film better. Murray characterizes Zissou so well that we feel like we actually know him at the film's end. If 2004 had not been so saturated with good acting performances, Murray would likely be up for an Oscar.Wilson also provides a notable performance, where he's not allowed to be the smart aleck he usually plays. Ned is a quiet side-kick who thinks before he speaks and somehow Wilson manages to pull it off.Also enhancing the movie is the great soundtrack. Anderson has always had a knack for selecting pop songs that match his movies' moods. In ""Life,"" many David Bowie songs are sung in Portuguese, providing dreamy music that cannot be completely understood.""Life"" is a full-fledged Anderson movie and anyone who has enjoyed his previous efforts will likely like this one. Anyone who hasn't liked Anderson's films should stay far, far away. The film requires a lot of patience, but sticking around until the end makes the movie more than the sum of its parts. It appears that Anderson is so hell-bent on being different from his predecessors that he has lost some of his magnificent charm. He used to have his head in the clouds, but now he's lost in outer space. Let's hope Anderson can come back down before Hollywood makes him walk the plank.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

But than we went to see it and left the there very disappointed. We didn't even finish the movie because it was that bad. We must have left about more than halfway through the ending of the movie. It was not as funny as it looked. I don't think it was the actor's fault because they were acting what they were being told to do by the director. But the acting was bad. I mean the actors just seemed like they didn't really want to do this movie and like they were bored out of their minds. Also the screenplay just got boring after awhile due to the fact that it took them a long time to get to the point of the film and all these things were happening that you just got confused about what was going on. Overall this movie was pretty disappointing and failed to capture my attention so if you want to see it, wait and rent it so that way if you don't like it you will have at least saved some money.There were some moments that could have been really funny and were but than the bored acting ruined it.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

267,square-peg,Same old thing,9,26 September 2005,"Which, for Wes Anderson, means something rather special. Great soundtrack, integral to the plot, a stately way of telling a story, a plethora of essential characters, whose lack of lines to say has no bearing on the importance of their place in the movie. What's it about? The same thing as the other films of his I have seen - The Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore - this weird and wonderful world, the people we are drawn to and build community with, the things that drive us apart. It also makes me laugh. Just when you think it's getting a bit soapy, there'll be a three-legged dog, a heroic bond company stooge, a fish that looks almost, but not quite like something you'd see on the Discovery Channel. And just when it's getting so strange you're beginning to feel like you're observing creatures who live on the far side of the moon, you'll hear something that was said to you when you were twelve, or see something that happened to you just today.

268,daniel-mkatz,"Brilliant, unpretentious, charming",10,23 July 2005,"Well exactly as my summary says, this is a very well made straight-out unpretentious movie about a fading wildlife-film director's attempt to re-create his past success that made him some sort of cult phenomenon. Reading a few of the other reviews, I think this is evidently a ""hate it or love it"" film, however a lot of people seem to have missed the point-I don't think this film was really intended as a comdey, to me it was more just about the relationships and interactions between the various characters and maybe even an exploration of the human spirit.The motivation for this project is revenge on the ""leopard shark"" that killed his best friend/long-standing partner and there is a lot of emotion on the way, including an inspiring relationship between him and his long lost son, whom he has never met but was a huge fan of his as a boy, and the constant drama between him and his wife, who's father's money has payed for his entire career.Wes Anderson has excellent cinematography, with some great CGI, depicting marine life in a very retro fashion, and beautiful landscapes, as well as a very well put-together soundtrack including Sigur Ros, The Stooges and Ziggy Stardust era Bowie played in Portuguese with a classical guitar accompaniment. We also see Bill Murray at his best as well as a heart-warming performance by Owen Wilson, who I am not normally a fan of. The script is also very well written and the story is so well put-together that even an attack by pirates or looting a large scientific institution seem plausible in a serious movie about an oceanographer!

It was not interesting. The characters were not believable. The effects weren't very special. The script is one which should never have been read and accepted by anyone other than actors who are desperate for work. No producer in his right mind should have thrown away money on this project. My wife gave up and went to bed after the first 35 minutes. I stopped watching after the first hour.

271,-611,What the heck was this about?,4,26 March 2006,"Maybe I'm not in the right demographics for this film, but I couldn't grasp the humor. I grew up on Jacques Cousteau specials and expected this to be a satire or parody of them. And there are some items like that, such as the red hats and the ship named ""Belafonte"" (instead of ""Calypso""). But Steve Zissou seemed less a parody or satire of Cousteau than a recast of a jerk in place of lovable Jacques. Parodies usually exaggerate the subject, but this seems to go 180 degrees from it. Instead of a classy, principled, passionate Frenchman with a close-knit family, we get a crude, materialistic, bored American who has explored more moist places on land than undersea.Throughout the movie I kept wondering if the director either a) doesn't really know much about Cousteau and doesn't really care because that's not the point or b) knows MUCH more about Cousteau than I do, such as his personality in making documentary film deals, and is lampooning that esoteric material.Maybe it's like one of those dry New Yorker cartoons. If I look at it long enough, maybe I'll get the jokes.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
272,JimBurd,Utterly Bad,2,21 December 2006,"Are you kidding me!?!? This movie was just non-stop stupid. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 1 was the (real-life) photography. I realize that this is a fantasy, but I just didn't ""get"" this film. The over-all story line was weak and silly. The bulk of the acting struck me as being too wooden, and being that way on purpose. The animations were cartoonish, and always stuck out as being such. Again, this seemed on purpose.This movie had gotten such good reviews, that I figured that there had to be some redeeming value that I had not seen. I watched the movie all the way through to the end, thinking that something would happen to change my impression of the film. All it accomplished was that it wasted another hour of my life.If you watch this movie and like it, then more power to you. But if, like me, you're halfway through this film and you're thinking it is extremely dumb, then you might as well eject the DVD because it doesn't get any better.This movie probably appeals much more to Bill Murray fans, which I admit that I am not. But given that, I still thoroughly enjoyed Scrooged and Ground Hog Day, so I don't think that this explains my dissatisfaction with this film.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

274,madpenguin41,An enjoyable disaster of a film,6,29 December 2004,"""The Life Aquatic"" is a righteous mess of a movie. Less a coherent piece, and more a series of vignettes loosely tied together by a rough sketch of a plot, the film is so hit-and-miss that it is nearly impossible to give a basic opinion on it. In the end though, it holds ones interest, (mostly) justifies its length, and is overall entertaining and charming, almost in spite of itself.This is certainly the weakest of Anderson's films. Yet, a bad Wes Anderson film is still better than a lot of filmmakers' best films. And ""Life Aquatic"" isn't by any means BAD. What sets this one apart from his other three gems is that while his films very much create their own world, they contain characters and events that keep them just this side of total inaccessibility. That really isn't the case with ""Life Aquatic""... it's a major plunge off the deep end. In addition, the artistry of his trademark melancholic humor is lost here; where his films have previously managed to explore the humorous aspects of the tragic (""Royal Tennenbaums"" really perfected this), ""Life Aquatic"" just alternates between tragedy and comedy without ever finding any real balance or sense of congruency.The comedy definitely works better than the tragedy in this film. At times, it even seems that incredibly dark plot twists are included only to reach a punch line. For example, a violent pirate attack puts Steve's entire crew in great peril, yet the scene turns outright hilarious when Steve grabs a gun and goes on a rampage shooting all the pirates, all the while wearing a Speedo. Other highlights include the goofy keyboard music piped into the diving helmets, the albino scout dolphins which Steve can't manage to ever get to go scout, and the theft of all the on-board equipment of a colleague. Another humorous element is how unbelievably ridiculous all the computer-generated sea creatures look. Seriously, it looks like they were designed in MS Paint, printed off, then pasted on top of the film. I don't mean this as a criticism... I'm sure the effect is intentional, and it is definitely amusing.I'll be honest: thematically, I have no clue what is trying to be expressed with this film. Perhaps Anderson means this as a commentary on film-making in general. Maybe knowing there was no real way to follow up a masterpiece like ""Tennenbaums"" he just decided to make a film so insular that it only has meaning to him. Maybe the entire meaning of life is being revealed in this movie. Regardless what the idea is, I'm missing it. And ultimately, the movie didn't really make me want to care. Many elements of the plot indicate that some profound message is trying to come through: the death of people near and dear to Steve, the wrangling with the idea of a father/son relationship that begins when the son is 30, the mid-life loss of former glories. Yet, the presentation of all these elements is so totally incoherent that it doesn't really encourage the viewer to sort through this mess to discover the meaning.I also have not figured out exactly how the music choices even remotely fit with the film. Much of the soundtrack consists of glam-era Bowie classics played on acoustic guitar and sung in Portugese... no, I'm not kidding. Why? I have no clue, but it is sort of fun to hear, and a nice testament to the talent of David Bowie that all these melodies are instantly identifiable even in such radically reworked form.Ultimately, ""The Life Aquatic"" fails to really accomplish much of anything other than be bizarrely quirky and hilarious, which it is frequently. There's nothing wrong with making a film that is only these things, it's just that much more is clearly intended, and those elements unfortunately fall flat. Nonetheless, it is a quality piece of entertainment, well worth the cost of admission, and is certainly unique. In short, it is neither as good or as bad as anyone says it is.Score: 6/10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
275,shabulia,"A Royal Tenenbaum in a wet-suit,",9,14 May 2005,"""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" stars Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Houston, Willem Dafoe and is directed Wes Anderson. Bill Murray is a washed up Jacques Cousteau type that makes documentary films as he goes on his voyages and sea adventures. His films used to be great and carried a large fan base. As he has gotten older, his fans have begun to dwindle and Steve's behavior has not helped his reputation. On his latest voyage, his best friend is bitten in half and killed by a mysterious fish. This fish's given handle is the Jaguar Shark and may not actually exist. During the premiere of the first half of this new documentary, Steve declares war on the supposed Jaguar Shark and finds out he has a son (Owen Wilson). Steve adds his new found son to his expedition team for the second half of his documentary and his quest for vengeance. Along the way, Steve's wife (Angelica Houston) and pregnant reporter (Cate Blanchett) join the adventure. I'd love to keep going about the plot, but hey, watch the movie yourself...I know I may be in the minority here, but I truly love this film. Don't get me wrong, people will like the film if they like this style, but I think I loved it more than most. It is up there with Wes Anderson's other triumph, ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" The humor is dry, the writing is full of whimsy, Bill Murray is wonderful (again), and the direction reeks of Wes Anderson.This movie is just a joy to watch. The visuals compliment the story and style perfectly. The use of stop motion animation is expertly done and gives Tim Burton a run for his money. The set design, mainly the ship called the Belafonte, works well as the characters walk through each room until they get topside. As seen from the side it looks like a cut out drawn in a textbook. The stop motion animation and the cut out set are obviously fake but only add to the charm of the film. In any other movie, these effects would stick out like a sore thumb. In ""The Life Aquatic"" it works because of Mr. Anderson's expert direction and sense of style.Bill Murray. This man has achieved a status most other veteran actors can only wish and pray for. His recent works are a wonderful mix of emotional drama and dry comedy. Here, he demonstrates that he is a master of his craft and gives us yet another brilliant performance. If you are a fan of his recent works, this will only fuel your admiration for him as an actor. If you haven't seen anything he's done lately and only remember him from Saturday Night Live or Ghostbusters, this is a great place to begin a new appreciation for him.Another part that compliments this film so well is the soundtrack/score. The sequences where Steve Zissou's documentaries are being filmed remind the viewer of the music in the films we all had to sit through in high school. It fits perfectly. The songs performed by Seu Jorge are merely David Bowie songs sung in Portuguese and played with a guitar. Each song is recognizable and gives so much personality to the film. Any fan of Bowie's work will feel compelled to add this soundtrack to their collection.I am sure you get the idea that there are many factors here that make this a great film. I admit it isn't for everyone. Dry humor is hard for some to swallow. If you are one of those people, stick with Ghostbusters for your Bill Murray love. This film will not change your taste on Bill Murray's recent work or on this type of film. But, if you loved ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and movies of the like, this is a great movie for you to consider. Also, I highly recommend finding the two disc Criterion version of the film if you are a collector. Film buffs, like me, will appreciate the supplemental material. Beyond all that this is a great movie for those that go for movies like this. If you are feeling 50/50 about it then give it a shot. Most likely you won't be disappointed. You may even love it as much as I did.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum, Willem Daffoe, all did a superb job at portraying Wes Anderson's very contemporary comedy/adventure vision on-screen. 2004, not a year of special effects or a huge line-up of movie artistry (like the year 1999), but definitely a year of capturing contemporary humanistic evolution and unique directing without virtual or special effect domination.The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is a fun enjoyable film with unique comedy.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
277,regjer,The reason this film exists is to delight in watching Bill Murray.,6,22 January 2005,"The reason this film exists is to delight in watching Bill Murray. Actually, I am sure Wes Anderson would not agree as he has labored to create an entire world in The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, inhabited by singular characters interacting in a very busy plot. (Sofia Coppola got it right in Lost in Translation where she placed Murray within a sparse canvas and allowed us to delight in Murray almost distraction free, creating a much better film as a result.) So let me back up and say watching Bill Murray is the primary reason I would give to see The Life Aquatic, and even if it were the only reason, it would be enough.There is much plot in this film, too much in fact, and very little of any consequence. To summarize, as the film opens Murray's character, Steve Zissou, is taking questions before an audience who has just watched his latest nature documentary. We soon learn that Zissou has had a storied past of film-making and celebrity  sort of a Jacque Cousteau rock star. But for the past decade his popularity and film making ability have been fading, along with his bank account and neglected ship. The rest of the film is the cursed adventure of the making of his next, and perhaps final documentary. The project's purpose? To find and kill the Jaguar Shark that killed his long time partner. ""What scientific purpose would killing the shark serve"", asks a staid biologist from the audience? After much thought Zissou comes back with, in matter-of-fact deadpan, ""Revenge"". The moment is hilarious and representative of what's in store. Which is a black comedy of disaster after disaster made light and hilarious, by Murray's apathetic, listless deadpan. The move is 1/3 Jaws, 1/3 Fargo, and 1/3 The Big Lubowski (with a dash of absurdist Rambo thrown in during the boat hijacking scene.) You wonder why Anderson went to all the trouble of creating this fat plot (I have not mentioned Owen Wilson as Zissou's (possible) abandon son, Cate Blanchette as the disillusioned reporter, or Angelica Houston as the feed-up lover). Why create this singular world, down to such fine details as inventing spectacular aquatic species? What is most worthy in Life Aquatic are throw away moments between the band of quirky characters: William Dafoe and his insane allegiance to Zissou and The Team, Goldblum as Alistair Hennessey, Murray's arch-rival and foil, sitting on his perfect ship in white robe and flip flops talking with Zissou about how much it will cost to save his ship and crew, the banker stooge telling Goldblum we ""f'king stole it"" when asked about why they have his espresso machine. The characters are fantastic, unique, and so damn funny. And Anderson has set-up interactions which perfectly exploit their quirkiness.But in the end Life Aquatic is too adrift in its own insular creativity to speak outside its frame. You laugh uproariously but are not touched; no thoughts are provoked. Is this a failing in an absurd comedy? Yes, but only because it seems Anderson intended more. (It would be ridiculous to level this criticism at purposely shallow (though hilarious) films such as Airplane or the Naked Gun.) But in Life Aquatic it seems the final scenes are intended to be emotionally cathartic for our protagonist, Zissou, - to make us realize Zissou has an empathetic emotional core (triggered by the death of his (possible) son) beyond what his deadpan suggested; however, it didn't work.Ultimately it is a film where the characters win (with the possible exception of Wilson's) and the story fails.Should you see it? Yes indeed, to delight in Bill Murray.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

The dialogue is forced and awkward, the music is of variable listenability, and the characters are barely relatable. I will give The Life Aquatic an extra point, however, for the sometimes beautiful and unusual cinematography.The one word I should use to describe this film, after all, is ""puzzling."" Events haphazardly lead into one another (or don't, occasionally), and important plot points appear, disappear, then reappear. (Was this intentional? Who knows?) In the midst of pondering one dilemma, I would find myself hearing another play out, and my poor brain, which has never itself been immersed in the movie-making world, couldn't keep up.It seems that The Life Aquatic was created for the sole amusement of its creators. One handicap this movie lacks, however, is predictability. I suggest renting it if you're a weird person; you might enjoy it.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

You have to like offbeat, under the radar (and well over the radar) type of humor like Steve Odekerk (the thumb series and Kung Pow)... Oddly, I enjoyed every minute of it, OK maybe not every... but what a well built off kilter structure Mr Anderson built, like one of those naive visionary sort of sculptures that the city can't decide to tear down (dangerous, ugly to some) or make into a theme park. Thank the gods that people other than Woody Allen (some of whose films I can watch more than once... the ""funny ones""...) are taking this auteur thing seriously.

Don't get me wrong, it did have a lot of funny moments and a lot of the characters were greatly portrayed by the actors.I thought the real problem was that the movie itself did not have a real direction in regards to plot. Also the actors parts, in regards to their motives and goals were also uncertain. From what I saw, it was pretty scattered in many cases. I understand that they were trying to make a documentary on a shark, but it seemed to me like they had nothing better to do with their time.Overall I'd give the movie a 5 out of 10. Like I said the actors were not bad, neither was the humor, the movie itself just simply needed to take a specific path.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Everyone in the film is wonderful, with the exception of Angelica Huston, whose one note portrayal of a bitchy wife/ex-wife is a puzzle. It is fun to see Bud Cort in another great movie - Harold and Maude rocks! There is both amazingly funny comedy and touching drama, AND the music is phenomenal - just hearing the Zombies ""The Way I Feel Tonight"" is worth the price of admission. Seu Jorge is a natural doing the GREAT Bowie classics in Portugese accompanied by acoustic guitar! At least SOMEONE still knows how to make a decent movie in Hollywood! Sure to become a cult classic.

284,generalmaz,Evidence of Wes Anderson's growing talent as one of today's most brilliant filmmakers,8,9 May 2012,"There is a strange gap between the perception of Wes Anderson's films and what they are actually like. Pop-culture seems to believe them to be utterly light and quirky pieces, with no emotional core beyond a happy ending and maybe some faux-melancholy. While somebody could potentially see this in one of his less-dark films (say Rushmore) if they tried really hard not to penetrate the surface, there are obviously darker forces at play within his movies - despite all the weightless imitators they have inspired, his works are emotional, often devastating pieces. And with The Life Aquatic, he takes one more step from his cheery chic with dark tones comfort zone into bringing these masterpieces to the true emotional and dramatic level he is capable of. Sure, not all the film works - some elements of it gel awkwardly, and while Bill Murray and Owen Wilson handle it perfectly, not all of the performances benefit from the non-reactionary style of acting that has become Anderson's trademark. However, the bits that work (largely contained within the film's shattering third-act) stand proud as among the most-brilliant pieces of cinema the 21st century has produced. There are many young filmmakers who's cinematic maturations I'm watching with relish, but Wes Anderson's is one of the most fascinating. Much like that other genius-Anderson, he is growing from a precocious boy-genius to one of America's most powerful storytellers. Here's to Moonrise Kingdom!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

True, many of the genres I have a liking for are perhaps a little old fashioned now, war, Westerns and the like. But comedy? Love comedy, me! I have been known to have to have been extracted from the floor having watched Trains, Planes and Automobiles, Man With Two Brains, Stir Crazy, and so on and so forth because I have been gasping for breath from laughing so much. I can even sit down and enjoy gentle comedies, for example What Women Want, Miss Congeniality etc. I have even been able to sit through the Royal Tenenbaums. I love Bill Murray,I adore Anjelica Houston, I quite like Owen Wilson, I think Willem Dafoe is beyond superb. Cate Blanchett rarely disappoints, Michael Gambon, well, he is pretty good too in most of what he does. So, in summary, I am pretty easy to please. I love my movies, I enjoy watching many fine actors, old and new. So my question people, is this, what the hell was this about? Funny? No. Good story? No. Pretentious? Yes. This is the first movie I have watched that I have ever felt the need to comment on for being so awful, and that includes shockers like Alexander! I beg you, please tell me where I should have laughed. Please tell me what the 'hidden bits' were. Please tell me why I am an ignoramus. I feel like this is the story of the Emperors Clothes, a great review, everyone finds this funny, so you go and see and agree because you feel if you don't then you are showing yourself up for being unworldly. Well sorry, this is Jackson Pollock, it may look pretty good and meaningful for some people, but for me it is an unmitigated mess, and worse of all, a total waste of time. I want to occasionally think, but not for comedy, if you want me to laugh, then hit me with a visual or gag that is OBVIOUS, not be so pretentious that I have to work at laughing!

The movie is filled with interesting moments but no compelling storyline. Even the actors, and Bill Murray is typically wonderful, play out their characters but the problem is that the characters are fairly shallow. Shallow not in mean but shallow as in 2 dimensional. Tom Cruise could play these characters with depth. Keanu Reeves could play these characters with depth. I'm not putting a bum rap on the actors, I think Wes just disappointed us a little.

You actually know all the characters and it has some funny moments and isn't all about dumb jokes. It's more smart comedy. Steve Zissou who Bill Murray is of course, was great because we all know Bill is one of the best actors, but in this one he actually made you feel what he was feeling. Especially near the end when they see the Jaguar Shark and he asks if it remembers him because it had taken his best friend and his son. I also liked seeing William Dafoe as Klaus because its way different from the Green Goblin or Boondock Saints. Owen Wilson is great and you can tell he likes working with Wes. More than half the cast has worked with him so you can tell that they appreciate the movie. Well if you haven't seen this great movie go out and see it.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Its no wonder the company he works for is going out of business, the movie shouldn't have been released.

This movie has poor dialogue, no story, and boring characters. I loved the preview, but If you saw the preview, you saw the best of it, and actually the only good of it. The director has a total lack of understanding of story telling, pace, camera work, use of lens, rhythm, taste, etc. Also the movie is racist towards Asian people... I don't see nothing different from mainstream Hollywood. This seems to be a movie shot by a ""private college"" kid who has access to a lot of money to waste... an awful work that tries to imitate the movies from the 50's and 60's or an Ed Wood from the 2000's but it just doesn't work at all.

294,lipsucka,wes misses mark - weakest effort yet,2,7 February 2005,"i am a huge wes anderson fan. loved his three previous movies, but The Life Aquatic is a big mess. i'm not sure how to describe how this movie fails.conceptually speaking, the film's got a good message. taken literally, it's a story about a man (bill murray) hunting down the beast that killed his close friend. but the metaphor here is about facing things in life that are frightening, unknown, and carry a heavy emotional weight. it's a great concept and had i not seen the film yet, i would automatically assume that wes anderson would be perfect for it. his movies have always contained an underlying sense of sorrow and/or loneliness, and this story is along those same lines.it's been about a month since i saw The Life Aquatic and i can't tell you much about the characters, the dialog, or the story itself. Bill Murray was flat throughout the entire film, Cate Blanchett put forth a good performance with what she had to work with, and I was completely confused about the relevance of Owen Wilson in this picture. In short, Life Aquatic tried to do way too much without investing purpose or meaning into the characters.The sets were quirky and original, however, unlike Wes' previous efforts, they held little relevance in the actual story. It's almost as if a Wes Anderson copycat tried directing this movie and totally missed the point of building an original set.This film needed a character like Royal Tenenbaum, played by Gene Hackman, to steal the screen and tie everything together. Hackman grabbed the audience's attention and held it. In his character, you understood the family tension and everything made sense. Murray, unfortunately, does not have that star power, at least not in this film. He comes off looking weak (not as a character, as an actor), cliché, and even pretentious.Owen Wilson, one of the funniest actors of our time, is strangled by blandness. Bland dialog, bland back story, bland.I give this movie a 4, and that is being gracious. 2 or 3 is probably more accurate.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

It wasn't one of those movies where I felt afterward, ""like wow, I'm about 88 minutes closer to my inevitable demise."" It held my attention. I even thought some of it was funny. But still.It's not like it was bad, because it wasn't. Everyone involved did their jobs properly, except for whoever wrote the script/endless-string-of-clichés.Seriously. Could this possibly be more of a ""Let's get the team back together for one last game against our hometown rivals"" type of movie? And it would be one thing if it stopped there.It doesn't. Throw in one relationship on the rocks, a paternity subplot, the ever popular ""cute silly foriegner,"" and, you know what, I really don't have the patience to list all of the clichés. To give you an idea, about 1/3 of the way through, there is, very much, a non-ironic montage. Yes, that's right. A montage.Fact is, Murray is best in the following two types of movies: A) Films (such as Caddyshack, Groundhog Day, and Ghostbusters) which are just sidesplittingly hilarious and B) Ones that are serious and/or sweet without pretension (Royal Tennenbaums, Lost in Translation) Unfortunately, this movie was neither one.6/10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

All of the Actors in the films did a stunning job of understating comedic elements while still allowing the big picture to surface. I laughed when it was called for, but once again Wes Anderson finds ways to really import reality into some very unrealistic settings. The colors and creatures in this film were beautiful and very creative, as well as some of the places the set introduced.

298,chrisq28,"Better Than Most, But That's Not Saying Much",8,18 March 2005,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is director Wes Anderson's fourth film. I should mention that I've loved every one of Anderson's previous films in the following order, favorite to least-favorite: 1. ""Rushmore"" 2. ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" 3. ""Bottle Rocket""It's hard to put a place number on this one, and I generally prefer critiquing a film on its own merit rather than against others of the genre, or others by the same director. Since Wes Anderson is such a unique director though, I think it would be appropriate to review this movie in comparison to his others. The film is about Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), an explorer who has become famous with his increasingly poor documentaries on nature and wildlife. At Zissou's latest premier, a film that features the death of Zissou's longtime partner, Esteban, he meets a man who is rumored to be his son, Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson). While in the crowd, Ned addresses Zissou: ""What will be your next adventure?"" ""I'm going to find it (the shark) and I'm going to destroy it. Possibly with dynamite."" Zissou puts together a group of shipmates that consists of himself, Ned, Jane (Cate Blanchett, a journalist doing a piece on Zissou), Klaus (Willem Dafoe), and other various eccentrics in order to film their newest documentary and avenge Esteban's death. The result of their quest and the plot itself isn't the point of this movie. The movie is about the way these characters interact with each other--and of course, it's all centered around Bill Murray, who does an effective job in his familiar role as the tired and jaded but otherwise amusing old guy. ""I'm sick of Bill Murray playing the sad old man,"" a friend of mine said. ""It's not a character I have any sympathy for."" ""You're not supposed to like him,"" I said. ""You're just supposed to understand him."" In knowing this, and the fact that the film simply isn't any more than a bunch of quirky people in a boat, the film becomes easier to love. It's funny, it's bittersweet, and it's enjoyable. That isn't to say that it's without fault. ""Wes Anderson knows that he's clever, and it's hurting him,"" I wrote in my notes as I watched. Roger Ebert calls this ""terminal whimsy"", and I agree. I really hope Anderson experiments with other styles of film-making, because if he can't do any more than this, it will expose him as a shallow director. I believe ""Rushmore"" is Anderson's masterpiece, and the two films subsequent to it have been slightly watered-down versions of it. Stylistically, thematically, and even with the same actors. If I had to put Anderson's films in order of best-worst after having seen Life Aquatic, it would look like this: 1. ""Rushmore"" 2. ""Royal Tennenbaums"" 3. ""Life Aquatic"" 4. ""Bottle Rocket"" Wes Anderson is a good director (and a fellow Texan!), but I think he can't escape himself--to the point that he's almost self-parodic. He's also brought himself down to earth with this film (it could have gone either way after ""Tennenbaums"")--he's not so much a giant with the potential to do anything, but more of a cult director. When he goes up against often-compared latter-day directors--P.T. Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, for example--there's just no question that they're out of his league. Anderson has made a number of very good films, but at the end of this one, I found that I didn't feel anything more than amused--not precisely what he was going for, I think. 7.8/10.00 for ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.""",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
299,paulkayefan,Too Much Money Ruined a Great Director,2,6 March 2005,"They say that money corrupts. It seems fairly obvious that this was a film with a bit too much budget and not enough editing. While I'm a fan of Anderson's work from Bottle Rocket to the Royal Tenenbaums, this film has turned into the Spruce Goose, big, ostentatious, and barely gets off the ground. The effort, it seems, was spent on the production budget (the finely animated but ultimately useless sea creatures and the cutaway boat) rather than editing the script (we need Owen Wilson back, his voice is essential) and editing the film (2 hours is 30 minutes too long). The laughs were fairly cheap and the characters were thinly developed. Much of the plot wasn't resolved and the characters were left without much to think about after the credits rolled.Jeff Goldblum, while slowly drifting away in my praise (except for The Fly), does the best work in the film. As for Bill, well, he plays the same character with the same motivation as his Lost in Translation turn.Cut the budget, and Anderson and the others will be forced to think think think and the next film will be much more compelling.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

This surprised me since I expected a comedy, but got something that seemed incredibly bland to me. Murray's acting did not seem to involve any real enthusiasm for the role or the project. I would say the same about Angelica Huston's performance. I was surprised that I reacted better to Owen Wilson, an actor whose roles I generally dislike.

The score was spectacular, mixing Bowies actual recordings with the Portugese covers of Sue Jorge was ingenious. In my opinion the story bares some resemblance to that of Moby Dick, in that the main character is the Capitan of a ship and is bent on finding a sea creature for, at first, revenge... but draw your own comparisons.All in all, the movie was stellar and grabbed my attention from beginning to end, although, it is definitely one of those films that you either like or dislike, and i obviously liked it. I recommend seeing it even if your friends say that its bad, i only rented it in the first place because it was all they had at Video Connection one lonely Friday night and i needed something to watch, and all of my friends, none of whom know what their talking about, trashed it never the less i found it beautiful, hilarious, and over-all an absolutely stunning work of art by Mr. Wes Anderson... also, if you saw it and liked it, you should check out the Royal Tenenbaums, also directed by Anderson, it is almost as good as the Life Aquatic.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
303,dragavan,Very Good but not Great movie about cooky characters dealing with a mid-life crisis,7,10 August 2007,"I was never a fan of Jacques Cousteau, but I have seen many of his TV specials over the years growing up when they were new, so I was familiar with what this movie was basing the characters and humor on. I am also a fan of Bill Murray, both the old goofy Bill and the elder statesmen Bill as of late, so I knew I would like his performance, but I wasn't sure the movie as a whole would hold up to my tastes.Technically this movie is fantastic. The sets they built (especially the crosscut version of the ship) were quirky and very fitting. The use of stop-motion animation was a great choice, as it added a sense of life and a little surrealism to the underwater scenes. The editing and the technical stuff was fine, but what really made this movie work for me was the sound and music design, especially the widespread use of on-set music performed by one of the actors. It was great hearing classic David Bowie tunes performed acoustic and in Portuguese. This pushed my review to a higher rating.The acting was good, for the most part, but very little of it is what I would call great. Bill was amusing, as usual, but several others were not that great (I'm looking at you Owen). Overall the performances worked, but that's not a glowing a review. The story is a little convoluted, with several threads tracked through it, but none of them are really that important since the movie is really just about the characters. The final walking scene is very worth watching, as it says a lot about them without any words.As for what the DVD contains, this is a Criterion Collection so I have higher standards for them. Unfortunately this doesn't live up to the usual standards I expect from them. Still it has deleted scenes, a little behind the scenes, and a commentary track, which was recorded in a crowded restaurant and has to often bleep out names (making it hard to listen to, even for me). On a normal DVD I would give these a pass, but not for a Criterion Collection.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

306,donut44,If you want to know if you should watch this film,6,13 December 2005,"Decide on what kind of film you feel like seeing and what kind of films you like. Liking Bill Murray is not enough to see this movie. This is not, What About Bob or Ghostbusters. This is not a slap your knee comedy either.In describing what this movie is though, too many people are trying to make themselves feel good about themselves by saying that in order to like this movie, you must ""get"" the jokes. This is not an intellectual film that will go over your head in any way. Instead, like one person commented, this is a dry humor comedy. If you like Bill Murray in his roles of other Wes Anderson films or Lost in Translation, than you will like his role here. However, that does not mean you will like this film. You don't need to ""get"" anything, you just must like a dry comedy where the jokes are not just thrown into your face. That has nothing to do with intellect, that has to do with what kind of movies you like.I personally like dry comedies and would recommend this movie as a renter when you feel like sitting back or laying down for a ""chuckler"" of a movie. I am glad I never had to spend 15 dollars on the movie and glad I watched it on a weekday when I was not in for a great movie, but then again, how many times do I ever see a ""great"" film. Only through trial by error with a lot of films.The film however is carried by Murray, IF, you like Bill Murray. I do and I enjoyed his role as well as Willem Defoe's. I like Owen Wilson, but felt like he was wasted in this movie (I don't mean like he was on drugs though). The computer animation used throughout the movie for not just animals, but for sets, was very poorly done and took away from the film. The plot was slow, which is fine, but it was a little too slow for this film. And last but not least, being a dry humor fan myself, this film lacked enough of it.Like many films, I recommend this one, but go in with the right frame of mind. I give it 6 out of 10 because I liked it, but it was not a ""great"" film deserving of even an 8, but I think 6 is good. I also realize that me liking it does not mean everyone should or will and thus I grade it on being a ""watchable"" movie. Many people grade a movie on its artistic nature but that is so bogus. Movies are for people as entertainment. This movie is entertaining, but not for everyone.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
307,allucaneatbuffet,one of my favorites,10,11 August 2006,"This movie was easily one of my favorite movies of 2004. I really enjoy most of bill Murray's films. When I saw the trailers for this movie, i knew i needed to see it. Having previously enjoyed Wes Andersons ""The Royal Tanenebaums"", i assumed this movie would be similar. However, this movie is sort of a love it, or hate it film. If you like smart, dark comedy, i would definitely recommend this movie. Unfortunately, unless you can pay close attention, some of the jokes will fly right over your head. I had to watch this movie multiple times to really enjoy the majority of its jokes. But every time i watch it, i catch something new.If you watch this movie, watch the window behind Zissou during his interview with Blanchett.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
308,Satinewannabe,Boring,1,8 August 2005,This is the most boring movie. It is suppose to be a comedy and there are not more than a couple of OK one liners. For a comedy that is 2 hours long I would think that they could actually stick in some humor. I love off the beaten track comedies but I guess I just didn't get this one. I thought the idea sounded funny but they didn't go anywhere with it. There are a lot more serious moments than funny ones in my opinion. I hope Bill Murray can actually find a funny script soon. I am not surprised this did not do well at all at the box office. In my city the movie was gone in 2 weeks. I thought it was just because the other movies out at the time just had more publicity/good reviews. No offense to people who liked it but I just can't see why.,The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
309,lukasmatkovicdm,Another Wes Anderson joint,8,27 June 2020,"I think this is Wes Anderson's most underrated film. Sure it's far from his best but it's nice and pretty film. Zissou is very relatable and developed character. Like all of his films it's about growing up (or in this case growing old) and finding purpose. Steve finds his purpose and finally saw sharkthat he wanted to kill for so long. I don't think it did that theme as good as other his films tho. It's self aware and humor is very laid back as usual. Tone is really nailed because even in emotional scenes there's humor sparkled throughoutso scenes like that aren't tone deaf. There's a lot of his style here like zooms, whimsical tone and miniatures. Film looks beautiful and it's laid back at first but more and more becomes energetic and near the end of the film it turns laid back again. It's very funny and humor is really subtle. Directing and staging are top notch (like I need to say that). Characters are memorable and fun and the actors did a good job but nothing outstanding. But Bill Murray was excellent had great comedic timing and great chemistry with Owen Wilson. I love relationship with these two. It's really goodly developed. Film has documentary vibe to it. I don't think his style really fits all that much. The second act is repetitive. Subplot where they save Jeff goldblum can be cut out from the film entirely. Supporting characters were fun but I only saw actors. Film has a lot of forced dramatic moments like death of Owen Wilson was not set up and forced. I think some things like relationship between the reporter and Owen Wilson was one dimeonsional.
Overall:Fun film that has great protagonist style directing set of characters and acting but some things just kinda knocked it back from being one of his best films.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
310,Oneohtrixxx,"Fun, Imaginative, Tragic, and Bowie...",10,15 December 2004,"I cannot express in words how many different styles of film making Wes Anderson combined into this masterpiece. At one point hilarious, sometimes even action-packed, while other times, you may feel a tear forming. Wes Anderson deserves major credit for this new addition to his excellent films.The stop-motion animation, although underused, was extremely imaginative and is a lost art nowadays in movies that should be taken into consideration. The premise itself was great, but when you watch the film, you almost forget that the sole purpose of the film is to confront the jaguar shark, as you become connected with the characters emotionally.Overall, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Seu Jorge (whose Portuguese interpretation of ""Space Oddity"" nearly drew me to tears with laughter) Cate Blanchett, and Owen Wilson, I applaud them for making such a great film better, Wes Anderson as well.Excellent music, great acting, teary moments, and action-packed rescues make this a definite 9.5/10!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
311,clbobman,Beautiful. I really wish there were more movies like this.,10,8 July 2013,"Beautiful movie on every level; dressed cunningly as a comedy I think this film is really about the myriad difficulties we face functioning as human beings, and particular the difficulty of being a creative dreamer.The quality of the cast shows us in what high standing the director is currently held, and the casting is beyond perfect: it is inspired. Bill Murray, as team leader, Steve Zissou, is part of a cast that includes; Willem Dafoe, Angelica Huston, Jeff Goldblum, as well as a slightly younger generation of players: Cate Blanchett, Owen Wilson and Noah Taylor (with a great Australian accent). This is basically my first Wes Anderson movie. I may have seen a little of the Royal Tenenbaums years ago but I know very little of this director apart from the ravings of many people who I trust. I am very impressed and will now be checking out all his videos.I think the foundation of this film is the ancient idea of the completely flawed, human hero who continues to follow his dreams despite numerous setbacks. He is no superman: in fact he needs others in an almost symbiotic way, but it is this complete emotional honesty that enders us more and more to the Zissou character. In interviews, Bill Murray has stated that this was one of his toughest films to make, yet one never senses this watching the movie. Perhaps this unseen, creative difficulty just endears us to him even more.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

It has to be the worst film I've seen for a long time.I read the reviews, hilarious adventure? I didn't laugh once in fact I've never been so bored.My husband watched it with me and shares the same opinion that the film was a load of tosh.P.S. Husband says the only redeeming feature is that Robyn Cohen has a great set of jugs and gets them out two or three times during the course of this movie. Other than that no redeeming features.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
313,movieman1964,Brilliant!,10,29 December 2004,"'The Life Aquatic' is possibly Wes Anderson's best film to date. I loved 'The Royal Tenenbaums', and 'Rushmore', and for the first few minutes of 'The Life Aquatic' the similarities between the other two films had me wondering if this film wouldn't simply be Anderson rehashing the same material. That isn't the case at all! Anderson creates a believable world with rich characters who pull you in to the story early on in this adventure. The unexpected move into action-movie land is a good choice and Anderson pulls it off wonderfully. I want to note that Angelica Houston does it again! She is a superb screen actress who adds so much to this film. Every scene she is in is a treat. Bill Murray, whose acting is always dead-on in Anderson's films, is a genius at bringing Steve Zissou to life. A WONDERFUL FILM!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
314,MovieMannia,Anderson Succeeds In Spite of Critical Hammering,10,4 January 2008,"This movie got really hit hard by the critics, being immediately dubbed as a huge disappointment. This is due primarily to the fact that the joy and brilliance of any Anderson film can't be truly appreciated in one viewing. I remember seeing Bill Murray on a talk show say that he had just seen the movie for the third time and had just realized that Anderson had nailed the film.The problem and joy of Wes Anderson movies is that they must be seen more than once to even begin to be understood, and in many cases, to be enjoyed. They typically amuse me the first time around but I rarely get them. They become increasingly funnier, however, the more times that I see them. Anderson gets a lot of his humor out of going against the conventions, avoiding the big and easy comic payoff's, and being funny by doing what one wouldn't expect to be funny. And I also begin to enjoy the films more when I start to get my brain around the themes that he's exploring. They're usually so delicately suggested that it takes a while to really understand what he is indeed saying.Anderson totally delivers on everything one could hope from this movie. In fact, this may be one my favorite of his films. It has really grown on me. I can watch it over and over again, and it is always entertaining.My fond feelings toward it are due primarily to the fact that this is Anderson's version of an action/adventure movie, a genre I've enjoyed since childhood. I didn't realize that this was in fact an action movie, however, until Steve Zissou takes back his ship from the pirates in an Iggy and the Stooges sound-tracked blaze of gunfire and explosions. The excitement escalates as they set sail on a mission to rescue the bond company stooge. This genre reflects the theme of the film, that life is an adventure. Consequently, it becomes a movie that is emotionally charged by child-like desires of film, while satisfying my intellectual adulthood through its unconventionality and intelligent ideas. I can relate to this film in many ways. For me, success was easy when I was young, but as an early adult, I was dismayed by the challenges and disappointments that can easily occur. Failure became a real possibility. I no longer looked at the world with wide-eyed optimism and I lost my enjoyment in it. It wasn't until I accepted the bad with the good and kept persevering that I was able to be happy and successful again. I think this is a universal experience, whether it happens to a child, teenager, young adult, or middle-aged adult. Disillusionment can take all of the fun out of the adventure of life. When truly thrown into the challenges of life, when success doesn't come easily, when happiness must be fought fordepression, sadness, and lethargy can result. It isn't until one accepts the good and bad of adventure that one is able to get back into the swing of life and find success again, and in essence, find adventure.At the end of the ""The Life Aquatic,"" Zissou accepts both the happiness and sadness of adventure, and in so doing finds a sense of satisfaction, purpose, rebirth, and success. And we as an audience are both enlightened and entertained from witnessing it.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
315,dlavizzo,Don't Listen to the Critics,8,16 March 2008,"If you listen to the crits, this movie was universally touted as ""Wes Anderson's worst film"". However, what most people don't understand is saying that is like saying ""The Last Judgement"" was Michelangelo's worst painting - it's still a work of genius.Personally, I thought this was one of Wes Anderson's better movies. It's much better than his later work - The Darjeeling Ltd. Bill Murry takes what could have been a slapstick, comical role and brings to it a depth of character that makes you feel something for him. If you can sit through this movie and not feel sorry for Steve Zissou, you have no emotions, or have forgotten what watching movies is all about.I would recommend a showing of this film to anyone who enjoys intellectual, surrealist comedy. Without giving too much away, the last scene between Steve and Ed is amazing, and the final scene of the movie is one of Wes Anderson's best yet. Not a ""must-see"", but watching this movie is doing yourself a favour.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
316,TomatoElephant,They made it again...,9,30 March 2005,"It seems like Wes Anderson and Bill Murray created new genre which can be titled as ""realistric movies"", where you get everything from smart jokes to very tragic moments.

Whole crew did it so well, that while you are watching it, it becomes part of your life - actors (I was impressed by transformation of Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett and Willem Dafoe and really enjoyed Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and Seu Jorge), cinematography, plot and crappy but computer graphics makes it so presentable to any kind of audience. Bill Murray seems to find his corner and continue to make progress there. This is the third movie of that kind after ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""Lost in Translation"".

317,trueman-1,Disappointing,5,3 September 2005,"My wife and I are big Bill Murray fans and judging from by previous user comments we though might be a decent enough movie to rent - we were disappointed. I guess I should have been suspicious when it was categorized as both a Comedy, Adventure AND Drama. It certainly felt like the producers didn't know where they wanted to go with the film and at nearly 2 hrs it definitely drags and you're just left waiting patiently for them to wrap things up.This is unfortunate given all the comic talent gathered for the film - it had a couple funny lines and some quirkiness but these were immediately off-set by some tragic or dramatic event which readily did little to advance the plot. Bill Murray never readily gets a chance to cut loose. He's shown smoking pot from start to finish - something I'm not too sure the producers weren't doing while piecing this thing together.The direction and editing were terrible and the camera work made you feel at times you were in the documentary they were (badly) producing. The CGI effects looked like something you'd find on a video game or a dated screensaver. Also there was just too many characters popping in and out of the picture but no real development actually occurring - case in point Murray and his wife are on the outs - we are never sure why or what causes them to separate or later reconcile. This is just a readily badly done film which is too bad because it didn't have to be so.5 out of 10 (just for Murray)",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
318,kodave,Not Anderson's Best,6,26 December 2004,"I enjoyed Anderson's three previous movies, so expectations were high for this new one. Therefore, I have to say it's slightly disappointing. It takes awhile to warm up to the characters, although the acting for the most part is great, and the first 45 minutes seem choppy.One problem is that there are two main plot points: the search for the Jaguar shark and the father-son relationship between Murray and Wilson. However, neither are that convincing and I believe Anderson's quirky, dry style actually gets in the way of developing the characters and their relationships.The Bowie songs are done in an inventive way, but they don't seem to be in the film for any good reason. Contrast this with Rushmore, where the songs and music fit with the movie.The performances are good. Murray is funny as always and it's hilarious to watch him as some sort of quasi-action hero in some scenes. Maybe it gets better on second viewing, but for the first time around, the film was kinda letdown considering Anderson's previous movies.6/10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Beautifully shot and never predictable, even when there's no action or laughs I'm still amused.This isn't Anderson's best movie; it doesn't have the laughs of Royal Tenenbaums, but it is still full of fascinating characters, ludicrous situations, majestic scenery, and great dialog.I can't understand why this movie would get bad reviews. Critics are always bemoaning the lack of originality in Hollywood. Life Aquatic doesn't have a single cliché, one predictable moment or line, it's fresh and eye-popping ... why?

When his best friend is killed by the mystical jaguar shark, he sets out on a mission to seek revenge. Zissou's son Ned (Owen Wilson), a pilot for Air Kentucky, shows up and Steve takes him on the voyage, along with a pregnant reporter (Cate Blanchette), a German who's always in shorts (Willem Dafoe), Zissou's wife (Anjelica Hustin) and a Brazilian guitarist who sings David Bowie songs (Seu Jorge). Oh an Jeff Goldbloom fits in there somewhere, for no real reason.This movie had great potential but falls short. I laughed once while Bill Murray danced to some techno music but that's it.

Zissou's goal is to destroy a mythical shark that killed his friend.Many hilarious delays include, bankruptcy, modern pirates (a scene where Steve steals a 9mm pistol and takes care of the business himself, hilarious) and another death to which I will not reveal to you.I was also very,very pleased with the ending.An excellent adventure comedy.9/10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
323,cwd9000,Perhaps the best film I have ever seen,10,15 June 2005,"I saw this film back towards Christmas, around its release. I was immediately hooked. Everything about the film was simply amazing.The film circles around a washed up oceanographer, Steve Zissou (Bill Murray,)whom is trying to find the mystical shark that ate his best friend, Esteban, and destroy it, but he doesn't know how, maybe dynamite... Zissou decides to go out on perhaps his last adventure with his wife, Elenor (Angelica Huston) and the rest of his crew.The Life Aquatic goes so much further than that though. Zissou discovers that he might be the father of a thirty-year old pilot from Kentucky (Owen Wilson). If anything, the film turns into a self-discovery story.Everything about this film is just simply amazing. The cast for one; Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Angelica Huston, Jeff Goldblum, Willem Dafoe, Cate Blanchett, and even Bud Cort (Harold from ""Harold and Maude""). Secondly, the production quality is incredible. The ship in the movie was completely fabricated to look like something Jaques Cousteau would journey around in. Wes Anderson even had the film company pay for an entire island, just for the film. Everything just looks authentic.Another great part of this film is of course the top-notch acting. The emotions displayed are just deep and completely unexpected. Steve often snaps in anger while Ned (his ""son"") is one of the most innocent looking guys I have ever seen. Willem Dafoe is ridiculous in this film. You're very used to see him playing a serious role, using his deep voice, but in this film, he plays a bit of a side-kick with a funny German accent. Who would possibly think of something like that (Wes Anderson).If you want a good movie that will play with your emotions and make you laugh at the same time, go pick this one up.

I saw Royal Tenenbaums and had nothing good to say about it afterward, and I could've cared even less for other Wes Anderson movies. But it just so happened that when I saw Life Aquatic advertised on TV I thought that the cast looked promising and the movie could be interesting, but that's as far as I went. I had no real intentions to actually see the film. I did, however, see the film in theaters because I was outvoted by my friends on what movie we'd be seeing that night. It turns out that Life Aquatic is surprisingly good. It's funny, stylized, and a great movie for viewing in the theater. Some movies are good for renting, some for buying, and some for viewing in the theater. It's the more grand films that deserve to be seen in the theater, and Life Aquatic didn't form any regrets.

I know where the humor of this movie is coming from. At an intellectual level I understand the jokes, but they just don't make me laugh.Wes Anderson wants to populate his dumb story with lots of low-key humor. But this kind of humor is nothing compared to the elegance of Jacques Tati or the subtleties of the dialog written by Alexander Payne or Jim Taylor (Election, About Schmidt, and Sideways). And I'll give you an example from The Life Aquatic: the red hats. Everyone on the Belafonte ship is wearing one, even when they go to film festivals and wear tuxedos. Anderson thinks that just having everyone wearing a red hat is funny. But I'll paraphrase Chuck Jones, a guy who knew about making people laugh: ""the key for comedy is not to open a funny door, but to open a door funny."" Don't get me wrong, I love dumb stories when they are fun to watch. But I had no fun watching this one. I can picture the two writers, self-congratulating themselves for how smart they are (and believe me, they are smart, but they wrote crap this time).

The characters have a life of their own that makes you think that you know them from before. And you love them for that. Bill Murray is just wonderful, though it's hard to realize if he is acting at all. That's the key of his greatness as an actor. I don't think he's ever accomplished that level of intimacy with a character since Groundhog's Day. It's the same with Owen who seems so sincere in his role that you believe him completely. And you feel like he's a forgotten friend from somewhere else. The music and the CGI images are so original, so modern and so anachronistic at the same time that make the perfect complement for this weird story that is, in fact, a work of fantasy about what could have the life of a maritime show celebrity as Jacques Cousteau. There were moments when I saw this film that I did not know if this was a dream or if it was an actual movie. Who are these people who have had the courage to go ahead and do this lovely film that touches you in so many ways with its melancholy and its hints at the meaning of friendship and fatherhood?

Despite not being up to my expectations in that regard, this movie was extremely interesting and while not offering anything greatly new or original, it managed to keep my eyes stuck to the screen till the very end. This was mainly due to the performance of all the actors especially Bill Murray who puts on a fantastic performance despite being mostly himself. Now coming to a few action scenes, there appears to be an inexplicable invincibility of Bill Murray's character in fighting Pirates. It seems as though the director simply wanted to get over with the scene. Then, very little emotion is shown when a life is lost. -1.

There were some enjoyable moments but I'd never rate the movie any higher than a 6. The score wasn't nearly as strong as Wes's prior movies, and most of it was comprised of Portuguese acoustic versions of David Bowie songs which got pretty old after about the 17th.

If not for the perspective of arguing with rental clerks, having them calling ""the manager"" and so on, I would have demanded my money back. Just to make a statement's. Speaking of taste, this movie was worse than ""There's Something About Mary"", although we were spared a Cameron Diaz lead. Might as well had her in the cast, why not? The bottom line is, Why? Why did you bother gathering decent actors, making them recite the ridiculous script and then releasing this thing? If it was a spoof, it was not funny. If it was drama, it was unacceptably bad taste. Maybe it was a drama of a spoof or a spoof of a drama of a spoof -- I do not know.Bottom line -- steer away.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
334,drake-stanton,A bizarre journey with an illuminating cast,6,13 August 2008,"Featuring an illustrious cast of actors this film falls short of its potential although it is still very original and entertaining. Murray's performance as Zissou is excellent and it seems like the other actors tried a little to hard to mimic Murray's comedic style, which simply can not be done. Owen Wilson gets my nod as one of the TOP 5 WORST accents of all time. His supposed Kentucky accent is a far cry from anything legitimate as he loses and gains it back several times within certain scenes. I don't know how the director could have let that go, but it truly makes his character so unbelievable it threatens to ruin every scene he is in. As usual Willem Dafoe is brilliant. The story itself is rather loose, but it works since the film is sort of shot in a documentary style. It is a little long and parts seem a little drawn out. I've seen other people rate this movie a 8 or 9 and that is way to high. Even compared to other odd-ball comedies I think this movie doesn't quite rank too far up there. The sets are extraordinary the acting is great, minus Owen Wilson and the music is exceptional as well. Overall a good viewing experience especially those in the mood for a fresh and original comedy based on it's quirky and well played characters.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

I finally got around to seeing it and I don't think I've ever been this pleased with a decision of mine to get off my PC chair, and see a movie since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.Wes Anderson is easily one of my favorite filmmakers. His style, his writing, his directing, and just his overall way of making films has to be the biggest breath of fresh air in cinema as of lately. Rushmore is GREAT, and it's one of those movies where the more I watch, the greater it becomes. The Royal Tenenbaums is actually just... easily one of my favorite films. As much as I love Rushmore, Tenebaums just hits the ground running with everything that made Rushmore great. So far Andersons films have been funny; actually, downright hysterical. They've even been deep and emotional under the surface, and the characters in his films are just COMPLETELY memorable. I mean, Tenenbaums has some of my favorite characters to come out of a movie ever. Not only that but his movies look fantastic and feel extremely original. Also, his musical choices are outstanding and really add to the overall mood and style.The Life Aquatic is no different.After hoards of critics made it out to be a disappointment, I went in there expecting something inferior to the previous films because critics mostly went ""omg"" over them and mostly trashed this one -- Someone remind me to just ignore their existence. Please. This was anything but a disappointment, this was anything but a drop in quality on ANY level. There was hardly a point in the movie where I wasn't at least grinning from ear to ear when I wasn't laughing (sometimes hysterically - which is rare for me), either at it's style, it's subtle humor, or it's awesome direction. There's even some risky humor in there that I admire it for. The acting is tremendous also, each actor was just...fully their character to an impressive extent, much like in Wes's previous works. You don't get that all the time in movies. it's part of what makes each film with the credit ""Directed by Wes Anderson"" so special. There's also a scene near the end involving a shark that's just pure cinema magic; I can't talk about this movie and not bring that one up.So no - hell no, Wes didn't disappoint me. Not one tiny bit. From Rushmore to this, it's just a trilogy of great cinema (I have yet to see Bottle Rocket). It takes a certain type of person to really appreciate this film, I'm glad I'm one of them.As far as I'm concerned, 2004 at the movies closed out on the best note it could have.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
336,mightyalgo,A divisive issue.,8,13 May 2005,"The history of film reviewing is littered with reviews that just don't like the film and can't see any merit in them. It therefore follows in the reviewer's head that all movies that he or she doesn't like must be intrinsically bad films, with very little to recommend them.In some cases, (Highlander II, The Phantom Menace, Matrix Revolutions) this is born out of despair over what might have been. In other cases, it is born out of simple incompetence or irrelevance on the part of the film maker (Scary Movie, etc.) It is my belief that negative reviews for this film and others like it come from the first of these two instances. You went to this movie expecting a laugh out loud comedy from an undoubtedly funny screenwriter and director, but it is clear that this was never the issue with ""The Life Aquatic"". It is to my mind intended to explore the main character and his reactions to the events around him. The presentation of a son he has never seen, and all the trials and tribulations of the ensuing month completely change this man's life.For the better? Perhaps not, but it is the examination of change this movie is all about. Zissou lives in a false world, heightened in our minds by the frankly absurd collection of sea-life with which we are presented. Sugar Candy coloured crabs for one, serving as a cute, yet meaningful force at one key moment. The falsity of the world and situation - even financially we are uncertain how such badly presented work got him this far and he seems to be on the edge in every conceivable way. That he does not fall apart completely (although the casual outbursts of extreme violence do seem to hint that way) is a testament to how he grows and is, to an extent reborn through the events of the movie.Such a deep, nuanced performance is exactly what Bill Murray seems to be carving out a niche as recently. There is a lot of common ground between this character and that of ""Lost in Translation"", and it is the balance of subtlety and sudden bouts of the fantastically ridiculous that makes Murray's recent rebirth so popular. He is light years ahead of classic performances like Ghostbusters or Groundhog Day now (though there were few better at such parts at the time).No film is complete without its supporting cast, and Wes Anderson seems to attract the finest actors around. There is not a poor performance in the whole film, and even relatively small parts are well thought out and worth attention. The use of Bowie in Portugese is yet another distancing move, making this appear to be some strange parallel world.Owen Wilson seems to be gearing up for bigger and better things with every performance, doing a good job of matching Murray's subtleties without trying to outdo his acting chops, which would unbalance the movie completely. Willem Defoe proves that his silly Green Goblin was just an aberration after all, and luckily is becoming a more common sight on our screens.This movie is not entirely without fault, however. If I may be so bold as to question an Anderson decision, I would say that the ending is a little of a tired device, and that he could have cut 15 minutes of the film without losing too much of the pace and story. With that in mind, and approaching this with no preconceptions (after walking into Lost in Translation expecting a no holds barred zany fish out of water comedy - damn me for not reading reviews before seeing films!), I can say that this film is worth anyone's time, if only to have it elicit a reaction. Plus I have a thing for Cate Blanchett, but don't tell anyone!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
337,Im_Disappointed,Quirky and Self-aware masterpiece,9,1 March 2016,"I cannot believe I allowed this comedy gem to slip through to the catcher without even a bunt attempt from good ol' Jerry. Arguably one of Bill Murray's greatest performances and certainly his best since he entered the ""bored Bill"" stage of his career. The cast is stellar and the performances are top shelf (in particular Willem Dafoe who steals every single scene he is in). I loved it so much I watch it twice back to back. So many stand out moments of hilarity, but my favorite are the subtle ones: Steve Zissou showcasing the mikes in their diving helmets and the little dance he does when the music starts. Steve Zissou - the nature-loving documentary star - flicking the cute little gecko from his hand like it was a used cigarette butt. Jeff Goldblum ""I fold"" *takes pistol shot in the gut* Dafoe's perfect acting during the ""step over the line if you want to leave the ship"" scene.

I've had a hard time with a few movies that just didn't live up the ad campaign, and it's always a tipoff that when a studio spends as much on ads as it spent on the production there are serious problems. This is just such a wet turd that I do not know where to start. Leaving aside the fact that there are no Asians (which I will give Bill Murray a pass on this time because he had so darn many in Lost in Translation) here they are trying to parody Jacques Cousteau and they can't even make it funny. Even Spongebob does a better job. At least the cartoon fish were well done. Perhaps if they just farmed out the whole thing, and had the characters drawn, it would have been worth watching. On TV.

Imagine you had to think of a comedy story , using all of your favourite actors and come up with the entire script in 10 Minos... that is what Life Aquatic feel s like.Its worth watching for Willem Defoes portrayal of the emotional German and Bill Murray delivers a few fine one liners that stick in your mind for weeks.But overall, its not a great movie and will not be remembered as such.

The movie was billed as a comedy but the very funniest bits, in fact the only good bits are what you see in the trailers. The rest of the show can't make up it's mind about what type of movie it should be and fails to be any of them. The main quest of the movie, the hunt for the leopard shark, is lost until the director seems to remember it at the end. You can just see him thinking, ""Oh, yeah.

You see it for maybe three seconds, and no re-peeks. A letter seems to fall under the same treatment. Gotta get the DVD.The early Firesign Theater albums were weird.

342,brian.bush,Let it sink in...It's brilliant!,10,7 January 2005,"I am always surprised when I meet someone else that really loves Wes Anderson films. I assume his films are too stylistic, or too smart, or just too inaccessible for the masses. Shame on me.In any case, I'm at it again. I keep thinking people might miss the point or they might not see it like I do.This is a beautiful film about how an 11 1/2 year old boy sees the man he thinks may not only be his hero, but also his father. Before Ned Plimpton entered Steve's life, the once great adventurer had been reduced to a boring, unintelligent has been.Ned reawakens Steve. Their adventure begins and ends with tragedy, but what is in the middle is the part that really matters. Zissou becomes that hero of the 11 1/2 year old boy's imagination. He has shoot outs with pirates, discovers unimaginable creatures, rescues his friends and enemies from certain death... all the while reconciling each of his relationships that had become strained over the years.Steve isn't the pitiful man he had come to accept. He is once again a success and loved by the masses. The climax will hit you out of left field like ton of bricks.I expect that several of the qualities of Steve Zissou are autobiographical nods to the man that is becoming the world's greatest auteur. Anderson seems to consider his film crews as more of a troupe, a team, or a family. I suspect he would be just as likely to risk his life to save the financial guy that happens to speak Pilipino, because he's a human being, too.I can't wait to see this one again.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

While the characters were kinda flat most of the time, when they did display emotion it actually meant something. It's more like real life in that aspect. The story was fairly interesting and the subtext drove the story more than anything; yeah, Steve was getting a crew to take revenge for a beloved crew member, and his best friend. But by the end of the movie, Steve realizes that getting revenge and making a documentary out of it really doesn't matter that much: it's about relationship. It's about reconnecting with the people you love and treating people with respect. Steve learns that not everything is about his fame and his drive to make movies, he can just love the sea. He can love his passions. He can love the people around him. At the end of the movie, he doesn't care about the product he made and doesn't even go to the premiere of his documentary. He sits alone outside, when eventually his biggest fan in the film (a children, and a representation of the next generation) appears. Steve gives him a ring that used to belong to his son.

Every single one of the main cast clearly relishes their role in this film and deliver a superb performance. Bill Murray is his usual comic genius (I must admit, I have a thing for Bill Murray films), Owen Wilson showcases his comedic talents, Willem Defoe excels in a rare comedic role as the sulking Klaus, Jeff Goldblum is on top form as the smarmy Hennessey, Anjelica Houston is...still fairly creepy but good. The visual style is very different and quite artsy, but it works somehow and gives the film part of its charm. The soundtrack is excellent, I'm not a huge fan of David Bowie but the way his songs are incorporated is genius (I won't spoil it). This film has everything, comedy, action, emotion - stunning.

Bill Murray (Steve Zissou) is improving with age like a fine wine, and his emotional depth is finally finding vehicles for expression. Steve Zissou is a low-rent Jacques Cousteau who has fallen on hard times. His wife (Angelica Huston, stunning as always) is unhappy enough with him to leave him for his arch-rival (Jeff Goldblum) who also happens to be her ex-husband- and may or may not be gay. Steve's films are not making money, his backers are backing out, his equipment and ship are old and malfunctioning - and his best friend has just been eaten by what may or may not be a jaguar shark. As he struggles to put together an expedition to kill the shark that ate his friend, he is joined by a pregnant journalist (Cate Blanchet) who plans to trash him in the press and a young man (Owen Wilson)- who may or may not be his only biological child (Steve Zissou, it is believed, shoots blanks). The writing is wonderful, the story quirky and funny, and the cast is superb. Rivalry, loyalty, piracy, courage, dignity, mixed with self-doubt, yearning,and closure make ""The Life Aquatic"" the very adult comedy it is. I don't think too many adolescents will get it.

348,bwam2mil,Anderson's Mis-steps,6,2 January 2005,"before i begin my review, i want to say that wes anderson is a great talent, and his knack for character and small detail remains unparalleled by most modern directors. all his films - rushmore in particular - are very charismatic and vibrant.his latest, however, is definitely a step back. like rushmore and tennenbaums before it, life aquatic deals with themes of regret, familial relations, and personal accomplishment. however rather than truly exploring these ideas through character relations, anderson's script (written without usual partner owen Wilson) uses them as merely as springboards to put characters in wacky situations. the film lacks the depth of anderson's previous works and feels particularly flimsy.perhaps this can be attributed to anderson's growing obsession for detail. i read in an interview that he was supposedly trying to be less meticulous on this one, but if that is in fact the case there surely is no evidence of it. anderson beats us over the head with the small stuff, from the crew members backgrounds to the plans of the boat. this makes for a very interesting film visually, but certainly does not advance any major ideas or themes, and at times hurts the film.i sincerely hope that with his next film, anderson explores some new territory, as far as character development and theme are concerned. Steve Zissou just kind of felt like a hodge-podge of Mr. Blume & Royal, only not as interesting. to end on a positive note, the cast is superb (altho cate blanchett gets annoying quick), the music is brilliant, and the visual style is still distinctly wes.i'd give it a 6 out of 10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

350,jon6810,A Caricature of Entertainment,10,29 May 2006,"Wes Anderson understands the world in a way that I cannot comprehend. He finds satisfaction and amusement in things that I don't see until he points them out to me. This wonderful awareness has given Anderson the ability to create masterpieces, like The Life Aquatic, from seemingly-utter nothingness.The narrative of The Life Aquatic blends all the elements of pure cinematic entertainment: a sympathetic protagonist who is heavily flawed, a sweeping story of that protagonist's fall from grace and his subsequent climb back to the top, over-the-top action sequences, father-son relationships, unexpected love, tragedy, death, beautiful cinematography, excellent casting, innovative camera shots and the idiosyncrasies of a talented director. These traits alone would make The Life Aquatic an entertaining movie, perhaps a bit forgettable.However, what makes this movie extraordinary is its unparalleled use of dry wit as a vehicle for humor. Clearly, no better choice could have been made for attempting this than acquiring the services of Bill Murray.Think of it as the continual use of sarcasm. Almost every moment of this movie is sarcastic in one way or another. The Life Aquatic is constantly making fun of the exact type of movie it is - and there are layers upon layers of this lampooning that burst from Anderson's creation.For example, Steve Zissou is likable, flawed and makes decisions with a contagious confidence, just like the legendary protagonists of dramatic epics (think: Han Solo, William Wallace et al.) However, he is obviously an idiot. He makes poor choices that should almost certainly kill both his crew and him. But then again, his stupidity consistently works out for the better - so it is funny AND we, the audience, don't feel silly routing for him.A book could be written citing all the examples of layered humor in this film. I've seen it roughly 100 times now (at least) and am STILL finding new things to laugh about. The point I hope you take away from this review is that Anderson was able to combine the great elements of a standalone narrative and turn them on their heads, using them to ridicule the narrative itself. The movie works as both an engaging drama AND an ever-surprising comedy - simultaneously.This is my favorite film of all time.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

It's like a peter pan adventure, but set in our world. bill murray (steve) has created his own fantastyland on earth. the contemporary mockumentary style filming makes this an independent film worth watching, just as good as Lost in Translation.

If Wes Anderson's previous movies suffered at all it's because the humor was way to subtle. Baumbach's obvious humor at least let in a few overt jokes to compliment Anderson's usual style. From the beginning this movie is set in a semi-reality with every sea animal being fictionalized. I think his line of thinking was that he couldn't make consistent realistic underwater scenes so he decided to do them fake instead, and it works. The soundtrack is still the best in the industry although the guitar stuff by pale(or pele) can get annoying.

The characters in, ""The Life Aquatic"" while funny and quirky at times came off as caricatures with no real believable drive behind them. As a spoof of Jacque Cousteau and Johnny Quest there are definitely some funny moments but the story comes off as flat and turns into a bunch of ""Oh, isn't that odd"" moments. Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, Owen Wilson and Willem Dafoe have a great chemistry together (Dafoe steals a lot of the movie and Cate Blanchett is an amazing actress and needs to be doing more comedy) I guess with this incredible cast and with Wes's history, I was just expecting so much more.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Steve decides to take his crew on an adventure to find and kill the shark while filming a new documentary.The movie starts off by showing the latest Steve Zissou documentary, in which we see, his friend die. Steve then states that he is going to find and kill the deadly shark after an overnight drunk in 10 days.First off, the movie is great. It has a weird cast of comical characters, most notably Steve Zissou, played by Bill Murray, who is the deadpan oceanographer in charge of Team Zissou. Also, there is odd CG animation, and most of all a genius-like randomness to it, like the sudden gunfight on the pirate island, which makes Wes Anderson at the top of my writing and directors lists.Secondly, the movie isn't just laugh-out-loud stupid comedy. No. It is ""smart"" comedy. But that's not it. The movie will be totally funny, and then suddenly become sad. It has a wide range of emotions that make the film work.Finally, some would say The Life Aquatic is a movie for Wes Anderson fans, people who liked Bottle Rocket (1996), Rushmore (1998), and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001).

Without its charming, unique appearance, it would have been tedious, lame, and veeery long.The child-like, sweet, soft and bright-colored sets and animatronic objects, joined to the sun-saturated, parched ancient Mediterranean locations, gave an effect I've never seen before, and probably will again. You could easily see derivation from ""The Yellow Submarine"", but compared to that, this is softer, bitter-sweet, gentler, not so manic. It was more like the appearance of ""Peewee's Playhouse"", or a children's book illustration. Even after I had granted to my fellow-viewers that it had only a hollow shell of a story, I was still enjoying the glowing pale yellow, golden, and aquamarine tones with splashes of geranium red that appeared everywhere.I have to admit that the actors took this whiffle ball and ran with it. They were all oozing charm. Cate and Owen look gorgeous. Angelica Houston filled out her role admirably. I had gotten pretty tired of Bill Murray's schlocky world-weariness, but it was revived in this setting.I think maybe the fault of many movies today, is that film-makers have learned to give an extremely realistic veneer (by cinematic style and acting technique) to very artificial constructs of plot and ideas. It is refreshing to see one that is sophisticated, and carefully made, that makes no pretense of reality.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Only later did I find out that they had the same director.This type of humor, though somewhat amusing, is not for every public. Its rather odd, and though not quite like British humor, it is dark, sublime and sometimes even a bit macabre.I was disappointed to only laugh out raucously once during the movie (sorry for those who might think it cruel): When Zissou (or whatever the spelling may be) had Hennessey on board, and the latter smacked the three-legged dog on the head with a newspaper for whimpering.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
361,amb102,Laugh out loud fabulous,9,24 December 2004,"The Life Aquatic is a must see for the holiday season. I was fortunate enough to have had an advance screening of the film and ever since I have been trying to get people out to see it. Wes Anderson is a genius and he follows up his other amazing films (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums) in great form with The Life Aquatic. The film is captivating and hilarious, a rarity in comedies today. With creative and witty humor you are guaranteed to be laughing the entire time. Bill Murray shines as he usually does, bringing back why we loved him so much in movies like Groundhogs Day. Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe, and the rest of an all-star cast make this film truly stand out from many of the other movies coming out this holiday. You will laugh out loud and find yourself actually getting into the characters even though in the beginning you would never imagine that you would. It is truly an experience.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
362,OrinAGN,A wonderful moment in cinema history,10,11 April 2005,"I thought that this movie was a terrific film and a welcome treat from the hum-drum monotony of Hollywood. Wes Anderson is a wonderful director, and this is even better than his other films (Rushmore and The Royal Tanenbaums, for example). Bill Murray (who has been in a few of Anderson's other creations) and Wes Anderson seem to have the Midas touch.Bill Murray brings me to the next spectacular feature of this film. The cast is superb!! Bill Murray plays an oceanographer on a quest for revenge. Angelica Houston (who is still a site to behold after all of these years) is his wife. Willem Dafoe plays the hilariously odd First Mate. Jeff Goldblum takes on the role of Bill Murrays rival. Cate Blanchett does a bang-up job as the reporter doing a ""puff piece"". And it is all tied together by Owen Wilson, who despite his comedic gift, plays a rather subdued character in his performance as Bill Murrays son. The soundtrack to the movie was outstanding! But I will admit that I loved it mainly because I am a huge fan of David Bowie (seven of his songs are featured in the movie). Seu Jorge, who plays one of the crewmen on the ship can be seen and heard throughout much of the film singing a Bowie song in what I will assume is his native language. And I wont spoil it for you, but the song featured towards the end of the film is a real knockout! On top of that, Mark Mothersbaugh delivers a fantastic, amusing, and moving score.The cinematography is wonderful and the computer animations are sublime and surreal. The humor is top notch and features Bill Murray at one his highest points. I could rant all night about this piece of cinema gold, but I will let you go back to living your lives. I give this movie my highest recommendation. Also, if you liked this film I highly suggest that you check out Lost In Translation (also starring Bill Murray as well as a wonderful supporting cast).",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
363,stoned_and_dethroned,Great,8,28 December 2004,"'The Life Aquatic' has been greeted with a somewhat icy reception from critics, but so what? This film includes a scene in which Bill Murray singlehandedly takes on an entire crew of pirates, forcing them to flee his boat, with the Stooges' ""Search and Destroy"" providing the soundtrack. It also features Seymour Cassel, Knockout Ned from 'City of God' playing guitar and singing Portuguese versions of David Bowie songs, the use of the term ""bulldyke"", and Murray responding to a criticism of his most recent documentary as ""fake"" by pulling a gun on the reporter and angrily asking ""does this look fake?"" And, I repeat, Bill Murray fights pirates, with the accompaniment of Iggy and the Stooges.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
364,Becklin,A Really Good Movie,10,24 October 2005,"First of all, I love Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson movies. If you all haven't seen their movies (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums)you need to rent them and enjoy. This movie was so touching. A son who's mother recently died introduces himself to his was-famous, washed up father. A woman reporter unsure of her future with her unborn child who was sired by a married man (though not to the mother). And a man who's career is almost gone, his wife is leaving him, his best friend was recently eaten by a shark, and now is facing his son whom he's ignored for the last thirty years. The story is amazing, the animation is very cool, and the documentary feel of the movie is great.

365,renau-1,Enjoyed it tho mindful of the clock,6,10 January 2005,"Those who went to film school probably enjoyed it; those who didn't could probably take it or leave it. If you're in for self-conscious storytelling, textbook sight gags, and ironic deployment of movie cliché, then you'll like The Life Aquatic. Having said that, I enjoyed it - it was different. If Mr. Anderson didn't try so hard to be quirky and worked more on story and script, it would have been masterful. Still I'm awe-struck with his rich imagination. The red-cap-and-speedos gag throughout was great. The ship-tour sequence was interesting and seemed to draw inspiration from the ""sepsis"" sequence from Three Kings. But just when the story seemed to venture into something unironic and enlightening, Mr. Anderson's hipness gets the better of him - he doesn't risk enough in the end, so the ironic clichés are all you get. Too bad, because the premise is hilariously promising. It's not so much whether you ""get"" it (really, there's nothing to get save for a couple of modish film-school gimmicks), but whether you want to watch 2 hours of a quirky young director's search for something to say. I suspect one day he'll find it...just didn't happen in this movie.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

You could really see the relationship grow through out the film.I have never seen a movie with so many complex characters in such a short time. You really feel like you are part of the crew as you are join the crew on their adventure.

367,fragbait,Beautiful - Bill Murray shines.,8,20 April 2005,"'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou' is a wonderful trip down memory lane, taking you to the 70ies or so with all its flashy and colorful décor.The story deals with the struggle of Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), an oceanic explorer that has already passed his prime. He is in the middle off a mission to hunt down the mysterious 'Jaguar Shark' that had taken the liberty to eat his long-time friend, Esteban du Plantier (Seymour Cassel), when he is suddenly confronted with family affairs he tried to hide from for a long time.The character of Steve Zissou, which is of course strongly inspired by Jaques-Yves Cousteau, has a long rivalry with Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) concerning his oceanic success as well as his wife Eleanor (Anjelica Huston), which gives both Murray and Goldblum the opportunity to shine in their roles. They are supported by a great cast, including Cate Blanchett (as Jane Winslett-Richardson), Owen Wilson (as Ned Plimpton) and Willem Dafoe (as Klaus Daimler), which I think was crucial for the film to work. The coloring is just perfectly oversubscribed, and the music, which was written by David Bowie, is performed in Portuguese and fits terrifically with the theme.This tragicomedy-cum-homage is more than an occupation for one evening, it's a beautiful and fascinating ride. There are several scenes that will make you laugh out loudly, some that will make you cogitate, and few that may make you cry. You sincerely loved 'Dawn of the Dead'? Then don't watch this film. This film is not suited for either the dull or the fast-moving people out there, you will have to take the time and engage with this subtle, self-ironic masterpiece. If there is something negative to say, it would be the computer graphics. Yes they are there, at times, and they cannot keep up with the film's ambiance.Overall, I give this film 8 out of 10 points.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

I believe this is how the movie was marketed, and would explain the poor box office showing of this movie.However, this is more a story about life than a comedy. Sure it has a comedy wrapper, but a wrapper is usually thin and inedible compared to the candy inside. This is not your typical candy, but it is fruitful in many ways.

370,Ultimatelistguy,Worst Movie Ever Made!!!,1,27 May 2005,"This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. Murray must have been really desperate to take this one. Goldblum was better even in ID4. Wilson does better with Jackie Chan. I feel sorry for Willem Defoe- I mean, come on, Platoon to this? Shame, shame. Angelica Houston is her usual horror house ugly self and Kate Blanchett's accent is just as painfully annoying as it was in Aviator. That's just the acting. The story sucked!!! How boring can a ""comedy"" be. If you ""get"" humor out of this there is something wrong with you. It is so dreadfully terrible. I saw it on video, but I would have walked out on it in the theater. Wes Anderson is an idiot with NO TALENT. Anyone agree?",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
371,sassbox222,Pretentious Junk,1,13 August 2005,"I just rented ""The Life Aquatic"" on DVD last night. I had high hopes for this movie. Bill Murray is one of my favorite actors. I love his earlier comic work; Groundhog Day is my favorite movie ever and Murray's performance is what gives that movie its magic. Murray also has been impressive in less comedic roles lately. Lost in Translation was a very well done and poignant film. Based on the previews, TLA looked like an off-beat comedy - perfect for someone like Murray, I thought.The rest of the cast is also impressive. Anjelica Houston and Cate Blanchett are both very talented actresses. Heck, I even don't mind Owen Wilson; I think he's kind of cute. With a cast like that, TLA had so much potential to be great. What a disappointment it turned out to be.As I mentioned earlier, the previews for TLA gave the impression that it would be a comedy, albeit a little weird. This is very misleading. The film is not funny - it is not a comedy and it isn't clear what exactly the film is supposed to be. Is it art house? Drama? Comedy? All three? I couldn't tell because TLA does all these things so poorly. It jumps from one boring, unfunny scene to another. There is little sense of connection between the scenes. The plot is nonexistent. Now I don't mind minimal plot movies. Lost in Translation barely had a plot, but it was still a great movie because of the characters. In TLA the characters are terrible. You do not get to know the characters and subsequently you just don't care about them. A real shame, considering the talented cast. Bill Murray brings none of his talents to his character - watching Steve Zissou is about as interesting as watching paint dry. Murray looks like he's bored by playing this part - perhaps he already knew during filming that this movie would be such a stinker.Overall this movie is a great disappointment and a waste of time. I cannot believe it is getting such high ratings from IMDb users.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
372,ari_kranios,7 out of 10 for originality,7,20 November 2005,"A really strange film this one is. But if you do have the time and want to get something completely different out of a film, like the very usual entertainment and standard plot line that most films offer WATCH THIS FILM. A very DETAILED film that draws lots of focus onto unusual elements like colour, dialogue (a genre in itself) and unusual characters as well as animation. Where you think everything is set in stone and you know things about the characters and the film is going to end in a certain way, things pop up and surprise you, like Cate Blanchett's brilliantly put together characterisation or the choice of fish and underwater world they have put together and expect the viewer to assume that all this is REAL. Nothing is real in this film. It challenges your concept to the core. That's why it's so easy for someone to fast forward the DVD or get bored and walk out of the cinema. It actually takes effort and commitment to this film to sit down and watch it. See it, also because it will challenge your ideas about set DESIGN, and screen writing. Yes, brings back lots of memories of the Royal T's BUT it has gone a step further, has been less commercial, more risk taking and more fantasy driven.

He loathes the shark, he only wants to destroy it, to hurt it, to make it PAY...But when he finally sees it, when he is finally in front of the shark, he is stunned... he is out of words... and he has no dynamite...He can do it, for many reasons, but the main reason, is because he has seen the beauty of it, and found how empty he would be, how stupid he would feel if he did it, if he even still had the desire of doing it...The same thing happened with me and this movie. I really wanted to hate it. I needed to hate it. But I couldn't. Cuase it was beautiful, and honest and... and the shark scene, was like a mirror...

Retrospectively, I'd be more entertained watching Keno on TV (you swedes know what I'm talking about). After a glimpse at the trailer I had expected a straightforward comedy. This movie was very bizarre and not to my liking. Some scenes I did get, but mostly I just shook my head in confusion. In its defense there is some humor and you probably won't fall asleep, but if you haven't seen it and expect a ""Jim Carrey-funny"" movie - don't bother.

It's flashy and colorful, sure, but exclusively in the visual sense. The characters are lacking in every department, the acting is passable, and the movie itself lacks any sort of depth or character. The plot trudges along over its two-hour run-time with no direction or destination in mind. The man singing Bowie in Portuguese, I believe, was a nice touch. Overall, it's a weak, yet visually striking and unique movie abundant in overqualified actors as underdeveloped characters shuffling along an underwhelming plot.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Steve Zissou is suffering from a PTSD episode from the death of his friend due to a shark attack. (As to Slaughterhouse 5, don't watch the movie, read the book.) As Steve travels through his life he encounters parts he regrets. Steve Zissou drives away the pirates using a Glock and more bullets than can be counted. His crew is able to overcome an entrenched group of pirates with guns. His academic enemy is wounded in the fire fight, appears to be dead and then is up and walking around. The son he never had shows up magically wearing weird clothing. He is able to put all of the interns, dead people into a magic submarine and find the magical killer shark, but not destroy it.

378,piolet,Understated comedic brilliance,8,10 June 2005,"Wes Anderson (director and co-writer) has a very active imagination. It rarely comes to a boil but it is always simmering, often just beneath the surface. This movie gives us an intimate look at Steve Zissou's life as he tries to put together a big undersea project. One outstanding actor after another trickles into view, some just saying a few lines yet adding great color and depth to the proceedings. One might view Zissou's erratic career as tragic and perhaps he sees himself this way. Yet he has such wonderful toys to play with- research vessels, islands, helicopters. This movie is full of unexpected fantastical details that imbues the film with a magical aura despite the earthiness of some of the main characters. Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Anjelica Huston, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett, Michael Gambon, Willem Dafoe are all excellent. The story structure is a little weak, but this adds to the realistic feeling of a project-in-progress. There may be more throw-away lines here than in any other film. Any fan of Wes Anderson's earlier films (Rushmore, Royal Tennenbaums) will love 'The Life Aquatic'.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

It's very well-made, the actors are superb and the intentions are honourable but somewhere in the mix Wes Anderson has failed to produce anything more than a boring and somewhat pretentious film. Where the quirky humour, wry characters and intricate plots in ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tennebaums"" worked to their advantage creating fresh films with style, ""The Life Aquatic.."" is repetitive and droll. The highlight of the movie is the excellent Willem Dafoe as the sensitive German, sadly underused. Murray is as excellent as he is in all Anderson's and the rest of the cast give all in earnest (would have liked to see more of Michael Gambon also). On paper, this must have looked like an actor or a film fans, dream production - what we're given is version of The Emperor's New Clothes.

Upon revisiting Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, I still hold out that these movies are appealing to only a select few. Life Aquatic on the other hand, is a much better film over all. I would go so far to say it is the best film to come out of America since ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". Anderson makes a logical progression with his imagery, telling his story in cuts rather than just following one guy around the entire time. There's a thick, action-oriented plot that doesn't become weighed down in realism, but withholds information so that we are left the task of immersing ourselves into the movie (which that decision is wise, because movies that give you everything only appeal to a select few). The characters are fully developed, the images are beautiful, and of course the sound mix helps the story, rather than being an interesting side note.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

385,bjorn27,"Sleepy, hollow",6,2 January 2005,"Does Wes Anderson have anything new to say? Life Aquatic is enjoyable only if you have inoculated yourself against disappointment.There are many things wrong with Aquatic, but most fatally, the characters are dull, and Anderson rarely does the hard work of establishing them or giving them dimension. We never get into Zissou's head like we got into Max Fischer's in Rushmore, or Royal's in Tennenbaums. Part of this is Murray's fault. His performance is superficial: the deadpan delivery, wan sighs, and eye-rolling, which were ingratiating and affecting in Lost in Translation, are mere shtick here. He's a natural actor, but he's not a profound one, and he's not good enough to carry a picture. He's certainly nowhere near Hackman's class, and the difference shows. Anjelica Huston is good, but she's not given much to do.Life Aquatic is indie-lite, appealing mainly to those for whom a bright colour palette and a fashionable patina of irony is reward enough. But look a little deeper into this watery void, and you'll see Anderson's trademarks (the stone-faced ethnics, the deadpan humor, the once-charmingly contrived supporting characters with their outlandish and never-varying uniforms) calcifying into cliché. There is far too much quirk for quirk's sake, and too little depth of theme. What was once beguiling and fresh is now formula.

Watching the movie is like participating in some exalted somnambulist's ritual - a subjective proposition. At times, The Life Aquatic hearkens to the surrealism of The Magic Christian, but it is more multidimensional and complete in its approach. Wes Anderson has tautly crafted a vision of reality in which Bill Murray can reach to the depths of absurd deadpan. Zissou desperately requires Godot, for the story is not so much about outward appearances as it is about the invisible connections that operate behind the scenes.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

388,mlg-2,Not Wes Anderson's Best,6,30 December 2004,"First, as you can tell from the other comments, if you aren't a committed Wes Anderson fan, you should give this film a pass. I heard several ""worst film ever"" comments from my other movie goers, and I could I understand where they were coming from. I didn't agree (by a long shot), but the film lacks some key ingredients that his other films had. First, there wasn't a single character I cared anything about. Even Gene Hackman's twisted Royal managed to elicit at least a grudging fascination from me, whereas this collection of deadpanning oddballs did nothing. Also, where a number of reviewers mentioned ""lots of plot,"" it wasn't in any kind of coherent narrative structure. Now, these things wouldn't matter so much (at least for me) if the film had been consistently clever, imaginative, funny, etc.--but I didn't find that it was. There was way too much capital Q Quirkiness (or quirkiness for its own sake) as well as too many flat sequences. In the past, Bill Murray has been the foil for the intense characters--here, he's not only the focus, but he's surrounded by othersOwen Wilson, Jeff Greenbaum and Anjelica Hustonwho are all taking the same ironic, deadpan approach. That's why Willem Dafoe's wackily (and intensely) homoerotically- charged Klaus is so much fun. And for those who appreciate the concept of an apparently never-ending supply of David Bowie songs sung in Portuguese to a softly strummed classical guitar, there are plenty of very smart and inventive moments. They just don't add up to a satisfying whole. And if you aren't the kind to get off on the above-described Bowie tunes, stay far far away from this film.My favorite small bita quick roller-coaster of a tracking shot as our heroes make their way up a beach in an action sequence reminiscent of the Beatles' Help.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

When I watched this movie I couldn't help but being amazed at how accurately the behavior of the common human being was filtered into these characters...watch it and I'm sure you'll notice similarities between some of these guys and the people you have to do with everyday.The reason why people think this movie is so weird, I think, is because it doesn't follow movie standards: Situations develop out of nowhere, people do incredibly unreasonable things, (SPOILER!!)People die(END SPOILER!!)...this kinda stuff happens everyday. Granted, it usually doesn't involve strange marine creatures or run-down research boats, but if you generalize from what happens on-screen to what happens around you, you'll see it. In real life, unexpected situations come out of nowhere about three times a day. People die at a very high rate, and very unpredictably at that. People are stupid, do stupid things, and change their minds constantly.Seriously, The Life Aquatic is possibly the most accurate rendering of the human condition that I've ever seen, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. 10/10, highly recommended.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
390,floyd-russel,"Meh, seen better",3,31 March 2012,"OK, so this movie wasn't funny, wasn't touching, wasn't anything really. Why can't people just be honest on this site? Why does everyone have to give it 10s to try to throw the average off? The movie had several pretty major flaws. The characters were really poorly thought out and the dialog went on forever with very little of the wit of Wes's prior films. There were some enjoyable moments but I'd never rate the movie any higher than a 3 or 4 max. The score wasn't nearly as strong as Wes's prior movies, and most of it was comprised of Portuguese acoustic versions of David Bowie songs which got pretty old after about the 17th. Owen Wilson also had a pretty poor Kentucky accent that didn't take long to get too annoying. Altogether a disappointing effort from a good director who has done better and will probably do better again.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
391,gero2006,One Of My Favourite Movies,8,17 November 2012,"I can't write an objective review of this movie. I look back on my life and I know that I am Steve Zissou. Nope I don't sail around on the Belafonte but in so many ways I recognise myself transposed into celluloid. This movie is an account of my personality by someone who neither understands, nor loves, nor forgives me. I watch and I laugh but with the pained laughter of self-recognition and passing spasms of shame. I ask new acquaintances to watch this so they are up to speed on my reality and can either opt in or out. It saves me having to explain the gap between how I live and the 'real world'. Who cares about the real world? The real world is my jaguar shark... it eats my best friends. I have seen other Wes Anderson movies but they don't resonate for me like this one does. Lucky I guess. Every now and then I stand in the dark and cry out Esteban! Esteban! But doesn't everybody?We're a pack of strays, don't you get it? I gave it only 8/10 because there are flaws if you just consider the movie as entertainment rather than biography. The bits that drag for me are the bits which don't remind me of me, don't make me laugh, do not feature the dolphins and/or Angelica Houston (i.e. I just don't enjoy all the bits with Cate Blanchette and Owen Wilson, they don't remind me of anything, they just feel like a tacked on story written to make this story appeal to people who are not Steve Zissou, not me, or not like me i.e. 99% of the potential cinema audience... what a sell-out, blah).",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

The sophomoric send-up of Cousteau is adolescent and ridiculous. Were scenarists paid for these lines and ideas (?) which made no one in the theater laugh even once? It goes on and on and on forever. I certainly hope the actors had a wonderful holiday while shooting on location because they did NOT seem to enjoy appearing in the film. They threw away their lines and showed no involvement not interest in the movie whatsoever, although their lines were certainly not the least of what should have been thrown away.

393,orlaithcasey,Disappointing!!,2,21 February 2005,"I am a big fan of Andersons, having greatly enjoyed both Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore. I was also blown away to see the cast that was in this movie. I was so excited to see it, and was so disappointed when I did. It is the second time in my life I have walked out of a cinema theatre, so it's not something I do likely. But it just didn't happen for me. I felt all the effort was put into the set, which looked great, but I was so so bored by the script. I waited nearly i hour by which stage I couldn't hack another David Bowie tune in Portugese. It was just grating on my nerves. I am so surprised because this would be the typed of film I usually enjoy, some of my favourite movies last year include 'I heart Huckabees' sideways, 'station agent' and 'Napoleon Dynamite' so I figured this would be just my cup of tea. I like quirky comedies and black humour, but this movie just made me a feel a bit seasick. It was all over the place and the pace was very jumpy.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

I loved it, and I recommend it to anyone who is tired of the ""basic formula"" of movies (stupid plot, boy meets girl and falls for her, does something stupid, nearly dies a bunch of times, insert car chase, in the end they kiss and make up). I only own 3 non-children's movies, because I very rarely watch them more than once, but I will own this one. Owen Wilson's character was wonderful, Bill Murray proved, again, why he is absolutely wonderful. I loved the ""interns"" and the wonderful use of unnecessary effects. A+ A+ A+!

Bill Murray with his cute little red cap doesn't cut the mustard in this one. There were some visually pleasing jokes in it, see the remarks about the seahorse and the crabs elsewhere, but the main characters seemed drab and made of cardboard. It might have made a nice twenty minute short. For whom would this flick be interesting?

396,RedLlama,Wes Anderson = Irreverent Genius,10,15 December 2004,"Although I admit that I may be a bit biased toward Wes Anderson movies, (this is inherent in self-admitting fan status) I truly believe that this is the best film I've seen this year. That is a bold statement considering that the movie crop this year was certainly above par.Once again Anderson proves the value in exposing the beauty held within the odd/eccentric/borderline insane people of this world. In this film Anderson maintains his wonderfully understated, yet uproarious style that was present in both Tenebaums and Rushmore. This film is superior to both of these for many reasons ranging from a truly bitchn' soundtrack to the tongue-in-cheek epic nature of the plot. I don't want to spoil the fun of this film before it is released nation wide, but take my word for it-GENIUS!!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
397,ragingbull1980,Critics have forgotten that this is a comedy,10,28 December 2004,"Somewhere along the lines, the film critics and masters of so-called 'high art' lost their grasp of this Wes Anderson film. I have read review after review about how the movie fails to find the ""sweetness"" of films like Rushmore, and that it fails to be interesting on any emotional level. Well, isn't this a comedy? Last time I checked it was, and a hilarious one at that.One of the great things about this film is how it lampoon's every potential moment of emotional depth into something over-dramatic and purposefully clichéd--furthermore, it even triumphs in making fun of 'reality TV' to some extent, as Steve Zissou tries to find countless ways to incorporate the real-life drama he can't even comprehend into his documentaries.The films overzealousness and unevenness is what I actually love about it. Like other films deemed too ""ambitious"", it rolls all the dice and taking the risk paid off: I laughed until I cried.All of this however, isn't possible without Bill Murray. His portrayal of Steve Zissou truly is something deserving of an Oscar. How could this film live without Murray setting the tone? The film is funny, but only if you believe what the character Steve Zissou is all about, and that's why Murray is so important to this movie--without discrediting Jamie Foxx, a truly great actor in his own right--people can do impressions like Foxx's Ray Charles--but how many actors create characters so original and absorbing that without them the film cannot exist? That's Murray's gift here, and his is the best acting job of the year.I would have to go one step further and say that perhaps the reason critics hate the film is that it blasts the very high-minded pretentiousness that clouds their minds: maybe they just don't get it because they ARE a bunch of Steve Zissous. If you saw someone making fun of you on screen would you like it? Probably not. But hey, no matter what the critics say, everyone else in the world who isn't caught up with themselves should go to this movie and enjoy it. If Anchorman hadn't been released this year, it would have been the year's best comedy--but it's a deeper film than Anchorman (of course, what isn't), an Oscar-worthy film that is serious about just how darn funny life really is.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
398,paulkirk-1,Not too shabby.....,8,26 December 2004,"Wes Anderson's ""Life Aquatic"" is what happens to that kid you had as a friend who always had the best stories to tell when you were on a long bus ride on a field trip or sitting around a campfire with the other Boy Scouts. The rest of us grow up to have workaday lives, but Anderson has decided to hold on to that sense of fascination and wonder we all used to have. He puts that on display in ""Life Aquatic,"" a rambling fish story of a fish story. ""Life Aquatic"", like other Anderson movies, is a Calliope of a film: incredible visuals, a great cast and script and, probably just because it seemed like a good idea, it has a Greek chorus of one fashioned by a guitar playing Brazilian who also doubles as a shipmate on the ""Belafonte"", the Jacques Cousteau-like oceanographic institute run by Bill Murray's character (Steve Zissou). (Even the ship's name is a good joke; Harry Belafonte is known for calypso singing; Calypso, of course, is the name of Jacques Cousteau's famous research boat.) And even though the movie is supposed to be about Zissou's search for the shark that killed his best friend, it's really about reminding us that the journey we go on to find the answers to things can be as magical and wonderful as we want it to be.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
399,warpbeam,2nd Time is a charm,9,27 December 2004,"I have just watched this film for the second time and I must admit, like other Anderson flicks it gets better each time. I did notice a lot more of the great details he always seems to include. I was a bit surprised at the amount of violence, a great deal of guns were displayed throughout entire movie, which to me was a little disappointing. I thought the choice of ""beastie-boy-like"" techno music in some of the scenes was brilliant. Some of the laughter was forced, Royal T's and Bottle R's laughter came a little more uncontrollably, however, that is not to degrade the film mainly because it takes a much more serious tone. I think interesting tragedy is that Zissou hates fathers yet he's willing to adopt a 30 year old man (when he knows he's sterile, two dolphins, and at the end of the film he's carrying a small child. Overall I gave it an 8, it's a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys good cinema.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
400,patangello,The Life Aquatic Review,9,29 December 2004,"Writer/director Wes Anderson kinda missed me with Rushmore, but he really had me with the Royal Tenenbaums! I loved the whole feel of that film with the monotone speech and the actors showing little or no emotion/expression. I'm not sure why exactly, but it was deliciously drab and offbeat with kinda dark humor that has turned it into one of my favorite films in recent years. The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou has that same tone and feel and it just cracked me up! Bill Murray plays Steve Zissou, an oceanographer known for his documentaries. When a ""Jaguar Shark"" eats his comrade and best friend, Zissou declares at the viewing of his latest documentary that he has sworn revenge on the mythical creature and will hunt it down if his life depends on it. He rallies his crew, including his wife Eleanor (Anjelica Huston) and a man claiming to be his long lost son by the name of Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson). Ned is welcomed aboard with the phrase, ""get him a red hat and a Speedo."" A movie like this is all about the subtle touches. The entire set of the ship from the side is shown to you in a tour of the boat. The submarine was named after his old girlfriend (Ned's mother), but the name is crossed out and replaced. The quirky Team Zissou aboard the Belafonte includes: Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), the slightly crazy leader who is a subtle playboy. His heart is reluctantly in the right place.Eleanor Zissou (Anjelica Huston), Steve's wife and the brains behind the team. Steve is lost without her and her parents' money.Klaus Daimler (Willem Dafoe), Zissou's new right hand man. He longs to be needed, wanted and recognized.Anne-Marie Sakowitz (Robyn Cohen), the organized, sole woman of the ship who seems mostly concerned with bathing her bare breasts if the temperature is above 30.Pelé dos Santos (Seu Jorge), a shipmate with a passion for singing David Bowie songs in Portuguese while playing a classical guitar.A reporter by the name of Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchet) joins the adventure for a cover story on Steve. She's pregnant by somebody else's husband and falls for Ned, much to the dismay of Steve.Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) is Steve's nemesis, another oceanographer with unlimited funds and all the perks of being famous.In the midst of hunting the Jaguar Shark, pirates storm the Belafonte and Bill Ubell (a lawyer brought on to keep the investors happy) is kidnapped. The journey suddenly changes course and now Team Zissou must save Bill! The things about this film that I loved: The animation of the sea creatures. Though realistic in movement, all were very bright in color and seemed just a bit off. I found this very comical for some reason.The music. Don't get me started, but Devo front man Mark Mothersbaugh scored this film! The tunes include everything from full orchestral pieces, to toy instruments with a drum machine, to my favorite old Devo tune, ""Gut Feeling/Slap Your Mammie."" Something about resurrecting that 1979 song for a brand new film just got me all giddy! The performances. All were great! Even with the dark undertones and black comedy, the over 2 hour film kept me mesmerized.Things I didn't like about this film: Pretty much nothing to complain about!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
401,stevejohnsenson,I would like join Team Zissou!,9,9 January 2005,"In this delightful film, the distinction between artist, author, and recipient blurs and becomes indistinct as this work explores the activities of contortionists, spiritual voyeurs and lyrical activists, alike, notwithstanding the obvious comparisons people will make with Debi Pike, spouse of the Troubadour. Actor Bud Cort (playing Bill Ubell), in homage to ""Harold and Maude"", comes full circle experiencing both the allegorical mock suicide attempt and ultimate resurrection during the outworking of the story (though I'll refrain from the details to avoid a possible spoiler). The soundtrack, in deference to Ziggy Stardust, Bowie, and all of those weaned on the radical musicalists of the 1970's made me weep in pleasure and recollection. This is urban mythology presented in a manner which brings Bowie, Bono, and Finis Dake together in a phantasmagoric orgy of Dake-Bonoist ecstasy. It is a folk tale for the 21st century and beyond. Classic archetypes of tragedy, death, love, and resurrection and interwoven into the subplot, belaying this entire work into our collective anxieties regarding the futility that lies in attempting to establish a personal legacy.It isn't difficult to pay attention to this cinematic Emergency Broadcast, networked between all the bare breasted Barbies and Butches of the world and exuding an unremitting montage that obfuscates the distinction between looking at an image and giving it to someone else. The mental imagery and etymological collage overlap each other, creating a salient textured mass of sensory immolation which provides ENDLESS opportunities for subversion. This film is a comedic paradigm shift, impelling one to grasp the real and the fantastic in a bonoistic conversion of delight and sorrow. I can't recommend this any more than I already am. You will want to watch this movie over and over again.Give me my red hat and speedo today!!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

I should have asked for my $1.50 back! My friends consider me a connoisseur of bad movies and truly lacking in taste. Even I hated this one. It appears that neither the screenwriter nor the director could decide whether the film should should have been a comedy, serious fiction or art film. It can not be taken seriously as a comedy and is devoid of any artistic value, and for the life of me, I could find nothing socially redeeming about the film. I can only sum it up with words best pinned by the the US Supreme Court, and say that the film lacks ""any artistic or socially redeeming value"". It is a sad thing indeed to that this film has meet two of the three requirements to be classified ""Pornography"". Once again, Hollywood has proved that the movie going public will pay to see anything. I recommend this movie to people have know someone that really hate and want to see suffer. My advice to them is invite them to the movie but bring either as gas mask or air sick bag for yourself as this is a real stinker.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
403,austingrrrl,Imperfect But Well Worth Seeing,7,13 January 2005,"I enjoyed watching the Life Aquatic immensely, as will any Wes Anderson fan. That said, it's not his best film. For starters, the editing simply wasn't as tight as his last two films. The result was a film that drug at times then awkwardly transitioned to intense, exciting moments.Cate Blanchett's character was interesting but slightly underdeveloped. The resuscitation of the father-figure-and-son-figure-fall-for-same-British-chic thing from Rushmore seemed like a bit of a cop out at times.Owen Wilson - who I have mixed feelings about anyway - detracted from this film albeit only slightly. His acting relied too much on the classic Owen-Wilson-playing-Owen-Wilson schtick a la Bottlerocket only this time with an (inconsistent) accent. The primary problem with his performance was that he just couldn't pull off the needed chemistry with Bill Murray.That said, the gorgeous aesthetic of the film, great animation, and outstanding performances by Bud Cort and Jeff Goldblum make up for the film's occasional shortcomings. Bill Murray and Angelica Houston had solid performances. Anderson treats the viewer with scene after scene of subtle treats and inside jokes. The soundtrack is, as usual, wonderful.My only other regret is that the voice of writer Noah Baumbach - whose films Kicking and Screaming and Mr. Jealousy are both excellent - never came through in the way I expected, esp. in terms of witty, quick-paced dialogue.Overall, this film is well worth seeing. Perfect for a weekend afternoon.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
404,dennison-3,Are you kidding? This is not funny in the least!,1,17 January 2005,"I've never been so disappointed with a movie in my life. There wasn't anything remotely funny in this film; only what you saw in the trailer which the second time around got a smile from me. Other that that the movie was dragged out and boring, with too many pauses, poorly written dialog, and too simple of a plot, with one foreseeable direction. Bill Murray's character is as boring as the one he played in Lost in Translation. By that I mean flat, dead, and lack-luster. I loved Bill Murray in Scrooged, Ghost Busters, Groundhog Day, Caddyshack, & The Man Who Knew too Much; but I wonder if his latest films are bad because he's feeling old? I hope not because I think he has a lot more energy than he's showing on the screen, so he should stop taking boring parts. I didn't care for any of the characters, and couldn't connect with any of them accept for maybe Owen Wilson and a young reporter on board. I felt the whole movie was dreary & depressing.

However i was very disappointed with Life Aquatic. It was just boring, and too slow. There was maybe one funny scene. But this is just my opinion of course. If you are going to see an Anderson film i would definitely recommend watching Rushmore or Royal Tenenbaums first because Life Aquatic might put you off. Maybe i just didn't get this film but i couldn't watch it again, unlike the other ones. Hopefully his next film will be an improvement.

406,dragon_git,"Fun, deep (search) ha!",9,18 January 2005,"OK, I've already had a hat trick with this movie and I'd have to say it's just as good the third time I've seen at as it was the first. My opinion of this film should be more legitimate than others, because I dislike every other piece of work Wes Anderson has made. I find Rushmore and The Royal Tennenbaums to be pretentious and completely unenjoyable. So, having seen the preview for the film, I already saw two strikes against it: strike 1, West Anderson. Strike 2, Owen Wilson, who has starred in such piles of crap as Shanghai Noon, Shanghai Knights, and Starsky and Hutch. If that no-talent loser Ben Stiller was in the cast, I would've stayed miles away from the theater. I don't understand why everyone thinks he's so funny, he stars in movies where he gets continually screwed over while displaying the full gamut of emotions on the spectrum (of emotions), ranging from: extremely quirky and neurotic to somewhat quirky and neurotic (yes this is a Maddox reference).Anyway, all that aside, it's very difficult to not enjoy this movie. Even though we know practically nothing about the characters, it's easy to relate to all of them because they're all caricatures of our own sociological tendencies. Yeah, Zissou is playing a dead pan has-been jerk, but you can't help but root for him and all the rest of team Zissou. The humor is irreverent, and the flawed characters are endearing, and if you can't just sit back and enjoy it, you have no soul. And besides---the soundtrack! Perfect. And I don't care what anybody says about the inclusion of the Sigor Ros song: it's happening at a moment where not only is Zissou accomplishing his mission while simultaneously failing it, he is at the same time feeling something he has never felt before because it relates to situations with two of his closest companions (can't spoil it).My favorite part: the helicopter crash. Watching it go down from first-person viewpoint with the tip of a Zissou shoe on the floorboard riding it's way down to the water, then sudden bursts of water, then red, white, and more water and more flashes... it's just a perfect example of perspective. And if you think a big fiery explosion would work better then just go watch another Bruckheimer movie.

407,xsfanning,Great Film,10,26 April 2005,"This is in my opinion Wes Anderson's defining film it has his unique sense of humour, his characteristic nostalgic atmosphere that was present in Royal Tennenbaums and great direction that takes you deep inside the characters. In my opinion it defines his work as I have understood it and I really enjoyed the underlying father-son theme with Owen Wilson and Bill Murray's respective characters. I look forward to seeing his next film - I understand its going to be animated though which may take away from the superb acting that has been present in his previous films. Perhaps the reason I enjoyed this film so much though was Bill Murray in the title role. Up until now Wes Anderson has employed Mr. Murray as a supporting actor but when you put Bill Murray into lead role it suddenly becomes a Bill Murray movie and no longer a Wes Anderson movie. Bill Murray's film history is a mix of relatively bad Hollywood pictures and off-beat and unique dry comedy but they all have some common denominator that Bill brings to the screen. I cant name it but its present in all his films from Where the Buffalo roam to Scrooged to even... What about BOB, urgh! I feel this film is a great step for Bill Murray and certainly a the same for Wes Anderson but Anderson may have to take a back seat to the cult phenomenon that Bill Murray has become.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

409,Evantheus,Solid,9,11 May 2005,"Yes, Wes Anderson strikes again. Although I consider Rushmore and the Royal Tenenbuams superior to this flick, Life Aquatic is still a fantastic viewing. Anyone accustomed to Anderson's style will no doubt appreciate this eccentric genre-switching film. It may be advertised as a comedy, but I think of it more as an off-beat humor adventure. This film reaffirmed my belief that Bill Murray is a comic genius. Furthermore, this film is one of the few that genuinely maintains a humorous tone even during true action scenes; a fine line that pure directorial and cinematographic wit allowed the actors to easily walk. I couldn't give it a full 10 because of what I consider a lack of response to the death of a main character at the end. Wilson, Blanchett, and DaFoe turn in marvelous supporting roles.

The real treat here is Murray who plays a profoundly self-absorbed egotist who is flash over substance.....and even his flash is quickly dimming. One of his strengths has always been his comic expressions and here he raises them to an art-form of subtle hilarity. The zenith of this humor lies in a brief, albeit hilarious dance scene where Murray demonstrates another piece of his character's useless underwater exploration gear.The supporting cast is also very strong and features Cate Blanchett, Owen Wilson,Angelica Huston and a latent homosexual Jeff Goldblum (I always wondered) and a truly bizarre and brilliantly unsettling Willem Dafoe.The ending left me wondering what I missed since many characters speak in fake accents which can be hard to understand and I was eating potato chips throughout the film. I can't help but think one of those little exchanges that I tried to lip read wasn't some sort of theatrical epiphany? Regardless, Murray's character develops wonderfully from a shallow, insensitive ass into that of a self-aware, insensitive ass with comic delight and hardly so much as an apology. Even if the ending didn't bring together all the parts to a satisfying conclusion......the parts themselves were well worth watching!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

A disappointment, with a stellar cast. Don't waste 2 hours of your life watching this incoherent garbage. The plot is horrible and sad, not tied together very well, and not humorous at all, as we were led to believe by the previews.It starts as a potentially good story, with a ""Jacques Cousteau"" type Captain and a film crew making documentaries about ocean adventures.

But it's difficult to see the appeal of this film.First of all, the film does not have a very strong plot. It is just a bunch of random events loosely strung together. This does not necessarily make the entire film bad, it just doesn't keep your interest for very long.The lack of a strong storyline could have been overcome by strong performances by the actors. Unfortunately, the film does not deliver in this respect either. The characters are completely uninteresting and forgettable. Bill Murray plays the same character that he did in ""Lost in Translation"" (which was also a dull film IMHO).The worst thing about this film is that it tries to be funny, but it just isn't.

I'm ashamed to say that the first time I rented it I popped it out of the player after only a couple of minutes. I must have been in the mood for an action flick at the time. I gave the movie a second chance recently and was impressed by this film.The actors are at the top of their form. Cate Blanchett's character is beautiful, pregnant, fiercely independent, and yet vulnerable. Murray is revealing how broad his range is once again. He shocked me with his talent in the remake of Hamlet, impressed me with Lost in Translation, and now somehow has combined the putz he often plays with an extremely complicated character that few other actors could manage.The comedy is fantastically funny and is a fresh change from the 'Oh no, I plugged up the toilet' humor that has been so prevalent recently. It's still ludicrous at times and yet the viewer welcomes it and enjoys it.Overall, I gave it a 9 out of 10.

You just knew right then it was not going to get any better if you stayed. An utter suck-fest from start to finish. And boring too. The actors seems to be on autopilot,but who could blame them? None of the characters were particularly engaging. Irritating yes,engaging no. And what was with the guitar guy? All I was asking for was one stray bullet,just one... There seemed to be only a halfhearted attempt to make the film interesting.In fact the ""old Zissou shows"" featured in the movie had more energy and direction at times.You can only force so many smiles at the odd fashion and color coordinating before it gets very tired,as did I.And when the only touching performance is from a three-legged dog you know this'll never be in your DVD collection.Ever.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
416,mongy_mac,"Funny, entertaining and just great",10,18 April 2006,"Ah the Life Aquatic (with Steve Zissou I might add) is yet another example of why the combination of Wes Anderson, Bill Murray and or Owen Wilson is a winner. The humour is delivered in both subtle and laugh out loud variety, and will probably be lost on the majority. However if you think yourself capable of not only sitting through an unusual film, but also understanding unusual humour without complaining or falling asleep then this film may be for you. Bill Murray displays why he has ceased to be merely a ""funny guy"", with yet another performance worthy of praise. His portrayal of an ageing oceanographer struggling to cope with the demise of his career is excellent, and Murray easily deals with the tougher issues the film throws up for his character. Owen Wilson shows, as he has previously in Anderson films, that he is not only capable of more serious roles but actually very good at them.I honestly can not recommend this film enough if you are looking for something other than another action film.""You left your dog, you idiots""",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

418,varekamd,The plot is about an oceanographer that hunts a shark. The movie is about a man who is afraid that he is running out of things to enjoy in life.,10,17 June 2006,"This is my favorite movie. It is not a comedy. Simply because you laugh at what the characters say does not make the work a comedy. When Bill Murray falls down the stairs in the Hotel Citroen, it may initially seem funny. Wes Anderson plays this up with the way the camera follows Zissou down the steps. Then he breaks out the line- ""We'll give them the reality this time- a sad old man, marriage on the rocks, with no friends and everybody laughing at him."" Funny stuff. The Life Aquatic is a sad story that is told in a funny way. The acting is wonderful all around, the plot is well-thought out, and the camera work is amazing and beautiful. I also really enjoyed the computer animations sprinkled throughout. Wes Anderson makes some truly beautiful statements about life- does the shark remember Zissou? Has everything he's done made any difference? It's a shark, kids. A computer animated one at that. But the important thing is that Zissou is not alone in that submarine. Everyone else remembers him. It's a nice thought that Anderson has expressed beautifully.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

When he says, ""I wonder if it remembers me"", I can't help but to get a little lump in the throat. For those folks who said they disliked the ending, I have to say, you didn't get the movie.

421,atsmith567,The most awful film experience of my life!,1,11 January 2007,"The Life Aquatic is pure pretentious trash, devoid of humor, wit, and even theme. With this film, Wes Anderson has proved himself to be one of Hollywood's most overrated filmmakers. Watching this film actually makes me question his sanity.Wes Anderson seems to find humor in superficial, pointless things, such as red hats, sneakers, and characters' accents. Why are red hats and sneakers funny to Wes Anderson, or to people who actually claim to like this movie? I am baffled. There is no wit or cleverness involved in giving characters red hats and sneakers. It's a non-sequiter, and not even a funny one.And why are people with accents so funny to Wes Anderson? I have an answer: he is racist. The audience is supposed to laugh at the fact that there is a German, a Brazillian and an Indian on Steve Zissou's crew, simply because these people are not Americans. These characters do and say nothing funny. A Brazillian man singing David Bowie songs is not funny. Wes Anderson is just so unfamilliar with non-Americans that it's funny to him. Everybody who wishes to pretend that this is a good film is forced to laugh along.This film was unbearable!!!!!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Oh yeah, this would be cool. It must have seemed cool at the moment, but apparently nobody checked it after they sobered up. It's like they ran out of money and time and just didn't care. The only real question I have is how did they get that great case, Angelica Huston, Bill Murray, Kate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum, William Dafoe...What a colossal waste. The only and I mean only positive feature of this film was the cool soundtrack by Seu Jorge singing David Bowie tunes. That at least provide some small relief from the tediousness of this film.OK, I feel better now.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
423,mjs320,Wes Anderson's new formalism,10,19 December 2004,"As any fan of director Wes Anderson will tell you, the choice of music in Anderson's films is always of special interest, often reflecting his subject with a particular slant. In The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Anderson provides a large serving of early 70's David Bowie. The film boasts Bowie's own recordings from the era, plus laid-back cover versions and an Iggy and the Stooges track mixed by Bowie. Of course, David Bowie in the 1970's  during his Ziggy Stardust period  was a dramatic and inspired performer, but his roots were in the theater. When he left glam rock behind for Philly Soul and Krautrock, it became clear that Bowie never really was Ziggy, that it was all a great performance. Bowie may be the key for understanding The Life Aquatic. The film is much like a great Bowie tune  glitzy and bold, but all performance.The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou signals a new formalism in the work of Wes Anderson. Substantive character analysis and tear-jerking reconciliations take a backseat to a focus on aesthetics. The film runs through the motions of rich storytelling but never grants plot or character privilege. Anderson's attention remains fixed on form, shuttling from educational wildlife film-making to experimental montage, from cameras that rock with the sea to bold Kubrickian symmetry, even from widescreen footage to a television-scoped aspect ratio. And while it is carefully composed  far more, say, than Anderson's formative Bottle Rocket  its camera-work retains an appealing looseness that was often lacking in the rigor of Tenenbaums. The Life Aquatic may be Anderson's supreme case for style as substance.But I am already hearing audiences complain that Anderson's new distance from his characters is the great fault of The Life Aquatic. One might have to agree: while it is ludicrous to claim that all films require textured characters to succeed (see Kubrick's 2001), The Life Aquatic does spend time on character relationships and on scenes of emotional catharsis. The problem is, these scenes don't take the foreground and they feel like copies of similar scenes from Rushmore or Tenenbaums. There are in fact, many correspondences between The Life Aquatic and Anderson's earlier films: Bill Murray's Zissou is essentially a version of Murray's character from Rushmore and the Murray and Gene Hackman characters both from Tenenbaums; and Anderson's stock themes  fatherhood, the role of dead friends in one's life  recur here as well. Such similarities may lead one to conclude that Anderson is treading water, but there is something else at work. The similarities are too bold, too blatant, and too exact. There is a scene wherein Zissou is reconciled to his nemesis Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) when he remarks that everyone is ""part gay."" The way the moment functions dramatically is near-identical to past moments in Anderson's films where a single utterance breaks down the barriers between two people. (See Ben Stiller's line in Tenenbaums, ""It's been a tough year, dad."") But the ""part gay"" reconciliation is a joke, and it does not move one profoundly. And yet it does. The moment works if we know the world of Wes Anderson, if we know from his earlier films how it must function emotionally. Anderson may no longer be so deeply in touch with his characters on screen, but they are still the same Wes Anderson-types, and we remember what makes them tick. Anderson has built himself a troupe of stock characters, earning the right by now to simply use them in a visually dynamic storyline. And while the script still rounds the same emotional bases, hitting nearly identical moments of catharsis, it is now simply a show, a performance, a great Bowie number, without any real piercing depth. Yet, through a familiarity with Anderson's oeuvre, we can transfer much of the weight of Rushmore or Tenenbaums onto these characters and scenes; in fact, we are invited to do so. With this hard- earned elbowroom  with the ability to use complex characters without having to create them again before our eyes  Anderson can devote his full attention to form, and he delivers the greatest aesthetic statement of his career.Another thought: I saw The Life Aquatic with a sold-out crowd in New York City, and the mood in the room after the credits was decidedly hesitant. I heard one patron remark, ""It wasn't as good as his other films."" Another said, ""I would have walked out if it wasn't for Willem Defoe."" These comments struck me as strangely familiar, before I realized what I was remembering: the opening scenes of the film itself, when the crowd feels that Zissou's new oceanographic film is not as good as his others, and we see a couple walking out on his Q & A. It seems that Anderson has embedded his film with a resistance to criticism he may have anticipated. While The Royal Tenenbaums was highly beloved, it was also criticized by Rushmore fanatics for being overly formal. Anderson may have anticipated greater concerns on this front with The Life Aquatic, and so he depicts a filmmaker defending himself against claims of ""unrealistic"" film-making. That Zissou's critics are shown as cold-hearted may be Anderson's veiled critique of content-minded crowds bemoaning formal projects. In this regard, The Life Aquatic recalls Woody Allen's Stardust Memories, wherein Allen plays a filmmaker whose fans prefer his ""earlier funny films."" Anderson may be deliberately recalling Stardust Memories to signal a shift in his own artistic direction. But audiences have a hard time seeing new work as a stage in an onward progression; they want what they liked before. But if you want Rushmore, go rent it. The new one's The Life Aquatic, and it is both different and the same, exactly as it should be.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Suffice it to say that those two hours would have been better spent watching Price Is Right reruns. I truly believe that everyone has the right to their own opinion but I CANNOT understand how ANYONE, smart enough to read, write and use a computer could have thought this movie was good. Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett - I've never seen a movie so bad and dialog so wooden that otherwise OUTSTANDING actors look like amateurs. You're not supposed to notice that they're acting, right? Is the fact that Owen isn't writing on this the reason it's so lame? Is he ""the brains"" behind the duo?I have to find a way to recover from my disappointment. Part of me would love to sit down with one of the 'fans' of this film and get inside their head. Because believe me, I WANT to love this movie. I'd settle for liking it, or even thinking it was okay. But the sane part of me is going to move on and not invest any more into what has been the biggest disappointment of 2005 for me.

I was confused, however, when it kept getting blasted by film critics. Then I figured it out: the critics that disliked Life Aquatic didn't know all of Anderson's work. If they had, they would have realized that the very dark (despite some funny moments) Royal Tenenbaums was the anomaly in the catalog. Royal Tenebaums is an excellent film, but in many ways is very different from any other Wes Anderson project. Life Aquatic deals with some weighty issues, but still has that underlying innocent quality that comes through in Bottle Rocket and Rushmore.Ignore the critics; watch this film again - no matter how many times you've seen it I guarantee you'll pick up a new subtle joke or twist - and you will find that this might be the film that best captures what Anderson is all about as a filmmaker.

Various reviews have come out about the latest Wes Anderson creation, most of them contrasting with each other - either that it is brilliant beyond belief or idiotic and contrived. Upon exiting from the show, I'd say that I sit closer to the former opinion. It was hilarious, but not in a sight-gaggish, hey-look-at-me-I'm-funny way. Some of the scenes are shockingly amusing (note to self: never fold in a card game with pirates), but the characters within aren't really aware that they're part of the joke. Bill Murray does a masterful job portraying a straight-faced, aging pseudo-Cousteau, as opposed to most of his earlier work which mainly consisted of latent humour and generally wacky behaviour. Won't give anything else away, rather than to encourage people to go out and see this movie. 3 thumbs up!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
427,HankToms,Without A Pulse,6,22 December 2004,"I wasn't terribly impressed. The momentum pretty much peaked in the first half. By the time the film enters the second act I thought ""Hey, this is pretty good"" but my enjoyment never exceeded those feelings throughout the rest of the film. Individual moments had the heart of Anderson's previous films (Rushmore and The Royal Tennenbaums, not so much Bottle Rocket) but, unfortunately, the majority of the film was so intent on being off-beat and overly quirky that moments that should have resonated almost felt out of place and, as a result, didn't deliver the emotional impact they deserved. In Royal Tennebaums and especially Rushmore, I felt the heart of the film beating throughout. So when the subtle touches in those films occurred, I felt an emotional charge, a literal adrenaline rush. I don't know if that ""heart"" is what Owen Wilson provided to the previous screenplays, but something was definitely lacking here. Sure, I liked the evolving Father and Son relationship and Steve's resolution with the Jaguar Shark but I didn't feel for them. I was completely disconnected to the characters and their plights.And, perhaps the most surprising misstep, the music, while creative, did not elevate the mood and emotion as it has (to brilliant effect) in his previous films. Finally, the scope was too large for any real intimacy. Lots of characters but very few character arcs. Royal Tennenbaums demonstrated beautifully that you can create a wonderful story with an ensemble cast and still give each of them their just moments. Major characters in this film felt discarded and underused. Outside of his salute to Ned for his design of the new logo, Dafoe's character was very underused. I'm not saying give him a major subplot, but rather give him some small heartfelt moments that reveal layers of him. In the end he was too one-note.I didn't hate the movie. There were things to like but my expectations from Anderson have me only focusing on the negative right now.

I am completely confident that this opinion will hold true thru the end of the year... or at the very least, I have to hope so with all my heart.Now admittedly there were very few people in the cinema while I watched this dud but never have I watched a movie billed as a comedy and not heard one single laugh from the audience. It was painful. At some point a woman left the theater, (presumably to use the restroom since she later returned,) and I felt myself jealous of the time she had spent OUT of her seat.It was so bad that at times I even thought (hoped) that it had ended but it just kept dragging itself along. I have only one word for it. Pointless. OK, two. Pointless and humorless. Only saving grace for me was seeing Angelica Houston but there again, I'd probably watch her just read a newspaper.Did anyone else notice that even the cast didn't seem to have a good time?

Not to say only a superior subculture can enjoy it, you either get it or you don't.This movie has a certain vibe that is created from the color schemes, music, dry humor, locations, and acting that sucked me into the detailed world of Wes Anderson's creation. This film is not a traditional comedy. In fact, I barely laughed. However, I usually am always smiling in admiration for the great lines and comedic timing of the actors. The acting was great. The film makes you want to cry, laugh, dance, get in a fist fight, and go on an oceanic adventure all at the same time.The plot in general follows Steve, played by the Bill Murray. And there is so much to the story that I'm not even sure I have it all yet. He starts off rock bottom. His best friend died and he wants revenge, he's losing money, he's past his prime and becoming washed up, and his relationship with his wife is on the rocks. With nothing to lose he sets off on the trip. But not alone, Ned (probably his son) joins his team.

Wes Anderson deserves major credit for this new addition to his excellent films.The stop-motion animation, although underused, was extremely imaginative and is a lost art nowadays in movies that should be taken into consideration. The premise itself was great, but when you watch the film, you almost forget that the sole purpose of the film is to confront the jaguar shark, as you become connected with the characters emotionally.Overall, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Seu Jorge (whose Portuguese interpretation of ""Space Oddity"" nearly drew me to tears with laughter) Cate Blanchett, and Owen Wilson, I applaud them for making such a great film better, Wes Anderson as well.Excellent music, great acting, teary moments, and action-packed rescues make this a definite 9.5/10!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

It is impossible to pick a favorite moment because there were so many great things that lit up the screen. However, I will stress that it is not for everyone.

434,fiona-60,not appealing to the Brits!!,1,3 October 2005,"I am astounded that this film has achieved so many rave reviews when I and the two people I watched it with found it to be absolutely without doubt the worst film any of us had ever seen!! I am not a film buff but certainly a lover of films and generally enjoy a good tongue in cheek yarn with a good helping of dry humour. But I fear that herein lies the problem: I am British through and through, with a quintessential dry British sense of humour that reveres in comedy in the vein of Bill Bailey, Jasper Carrot, Jack Dee, and even our good old Mr. Bean.. If you ask me, Americans are great film and slick sitcom makers but their attempts at so called ""dry"" humour are extremely unlikely to tickle the average British viewer. It is not that we don't GET the attempted humour in this film, it is just that to most of us, it is NOT FUNNY!!!!!! And someone mentioned becoming emotionally involved with the characters?! They are about as emotionally alluring as a soggy piece of cardboard.The only part that made me chuckle (yes, I found one tiny nugget of joy) was the fabulously and deliberately cheesy helicopter crash into the sea. Oh yes, and the bit where Bill Murray does a little boogie in his blue lycra. Erm...but that was hardly worth wasting an entire evening for! In my opinion film makers of this genre need to take a serious ego check, extract themselves from their self obsessed rear ends and stop making totally obscure movies about the process of making movies about the process of making movies etc etc (and dare I throw the awful Being John Malkovich and the even worse Adaptation onto the same metaphorical pile?!)

Bill Murray played the part of Steve Zissou far too seriously and didn't put any fun into the film from that characters performance, same goes for the other characters who were also lacking in interest and humour. This ridiculous plot should of been much more fun but the absence of any witty jokes or comical lines made it a real boring experience.

436,jonathan-178,The Royal Tenenbaums Goes Out to Sea,9,16 December 2004,"This is my first time posting on IMDb, but since there haven't been a boatload (har har) of reviews for this, I figured I would give it a shot.12/16/04 One thing still has not changed about Wes Anderson: he's not afraid to do exactly what he wants when making a film, even if it means the majority of the mainstream movie audience will not even begin to understand what he is aiming for. I respect that. No, wait, I love that. In a time when screenplays are precisely engineered to be as generic and appealing to the masses as possible, the Wes Andersons, Charlie Kaufmans (of course I couldn't write the review without mentioning Kaufman), and Alexander Paynes of the world are a breath of fresh air. Most of the original talents in Hollywood seem to move closer to the mainstream as the years progress. Even Kaufman is guilty of that (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is bizarre, but it's no ""Being John Malkovich""). Anderson, however, appears to be doing the opposite. ""Bottle Rocket"" was fairly straightforward, and is frequently aired on Comedy Central. With ""Rushmore,"" things got a little stranger, and then ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" was completely misunderstood by most moviegoers, and even by some Wes Anderson fans. Tenenbaums is my favorite Anderson movie. Take Gene Hackman's character from ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" put him in the ocean (complete with stop action animated sea-life), make him look like Bill Murray, and you've got ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou."" Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) is a washed-up oceanographer whose recent films have not been received well by the film community. Joined by his crew, a group of college interns, journalist Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett), and Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), a man who he believes may be his son, Zissou sets out to hunt down a shark that killed his best friend. Of course, no one actually knows if the shark even exists. Other notable characters include Steve's wife Eleanor (Anjelica Houston), and his extremely successful nemesis Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum).This was the first film that Anderson did not co-write with Owen Wilson. Instead, he worked with Noah Baumbach (""Kicking and Screaming"", ""Mr. Jealousy"", ""Highball""). Between Rushmore, Tenenbaums, and The Life Aquatic, I felt Aquatic easily had the weakest story. Is Wilson the missing link? I have no idea, but it is certainly a possibility. The film meandered a lot, and at times seemed to be going nowhere, but it all came together in the end. The characters were not as interesting or engaging as previous Anderson films, but Aquatic did have the elements of adventure and fantasy, which Anderson has never toyed with before. After all, Team Zissou is on an expedition into the unknown, and it comes complete with pirates, surreal sea-life, and dolphins with cameras strapped to their heads. As I mentioned, it was very similar in some ways to Tenenbaums, with a father (or father figure) coming to terms with the mistakes of his past and attempting to rectify things with his family.There was one thing that really bugged me about this movie: the accents. Eventually I got used to them and it was fine, but Owen Wilson and Cate Blanchett both have very annoying accents. They both manage good performances though despite that, as does the rest of the cast. Willem Dafoe really stood out, as the over-sensitive Klaus, and he provides most of the film's best comic moments. This was, of course, a movie focused on Bill Murray, and he is excellent as always.What the story lacks Anderson is able to make up for with presentation. As always, the soundtrack plays a large role in the movie, and Anderson chose an interesting theme this time. Most of the tracks are David Bowie songs performed in Portuguese by crew member Pele (Seu Jorge). But it's the way Anderson brings Team Zissou's ship, the Belafonte, to life that really sold me on this movie. It's a strange ship, complete with a sauna and a Swedish masseuse, and Anderson uses a cutaway view of the boat to follow characters moving between rooms. At times it seems like perhaps we are watching one of Zissou's films, which I'm sure was Anderson's intention.Regardless of the final product, the fact that someone would even attempt a film like this automatically means I'm going to give it a pretty good score. I guess I shouldn't be proud of that, but I really would like to see more quirky and original movies like this one in theaters. Some really good films have quietly come and gone this year, and ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is certainly worthy of being among the best. It probably won't win any Oscars, and it certainly isn't for everyone, but it is worthy of Anderson's name, and I will continue to look forward to what's next from him. If you enjoy subtle humor, and can use your mind during a movie without needing your drama and emotion force-fed to you, give ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" a chance.9/10 A-",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

There is so much woven into it, I'm sure it's going to be worth seeing again and again. I think it was well written and edited too; everything all worked together. Despite some common themes, there was so much unexpected too, which doesn't happen much. I just loved the subtle, subtle life-like humor. I'm surprised the critical community didn't pick up on it more. I bet it did well in Europe. The actors balanced each other well. I liked the fact that I rarely was thinking ""This is a Bill Murray movie"" or ""I'm watching Owen Wilson."" No one was drawing attention to themselves; they were all totally telling a story. I think the disconnect from the characters that many of us feel in the beginning is deliberate. I think the director wants us to feel as dubious about the protagonist as he is feeling about himself. I'm not familiar with Wes Anderson's work, but now I want to be. Such a funny, thoughtful, funny movie.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
438,heyjudeproduct,Totally BAD movie!!,1,16 May 2005,"This movie had a lot of promise and i was looking forward to seeing it because i loved the dry humor of the royal Tannenbaum's. Unfortunately, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou sucked eggs! The Photography was good, but the special animated effects were sub par compared with todays technology (looks to be created by a student). The worst part of all was the storyline. We are introduced to A lot of different characters but the only one with some sort of goal is Bill Murray who seems to not really give a hoot one way or the other. And if he doesn't care about reaching his goal, why should the audience. Willim Defoe was superb like he is in every movie he's in. The movie dragged on and on and seemed to try to find a way out somehow in the end. I couldn't help saying to myself that this was the worst movie i had seen in a long time.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
439,Yonex96,See it. Do it. Seriously. Do it. Do it.,10,16 December 2004,"Though there is that moment in every Wes Anderson movie where they just drop in and get serious, this one has THE MOST touching moment of all. Of course, it's one of the final moments, so it's not to be talked about or spoiled, but I get chills just thinking about it. As affected as I was by the moment in Royal Tenenbaums where Chaz finally breaks to Royal and says he's had a tough year, Steve Zissou's break is straight to the heart. For as hard as you laugh during this unique creation, you feel it hit you just as hard. Love it. It's definitely the most obscure of the four, it's like some modern pun on a 1970's real life Sea Lab, but that only makes it more enjoyable. Also, keep in mind that Jeff Goldblum COULD be playing his own self, for how many of his lines are things you've thought of Jeff Goldblum in general...and Willem Dafoe portrays just about the most hilarious foreign character I've ever encountered.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
440,t_f86,Truly original,10,8 March 2005,"I should point out that this was the first Wes Aderson film i've seen, although i have caught up since, and I found this film to be a truly original experience (i strongly suggest if this film appeals you should see on the big screen rather than wait for DVD). This film has style. The retro clothing and music places, and the apparent state-of-the-art technology, places the film in some kind of strange time paradox of the early 70's combined with today. The cinematography is lush and exotic, the stop-motion marine life is exceptional and often breath-taking (particularly at the climax). The world that Wes Anderson looks artificial, but can also at times appear very natural, giving it a very surreal feel. The use of music in this film is, in my opinion genius, and i bought the soundtrack immediately. Just watch the film and you should see what i mean. However, this film isn't just style with no substance. Bill Murray, playing a similar role to that of 'Bob Harris' in Lost in Translaton, of an ageing film-maker/star, who's career is starting to deteriorate, while having a mid-life crisis etc. Murray is superb as always (but then again Bill Murray is simply my favourite comic actor, so i find it hard to criticise). The supporting cast is brilliant as well. Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum particularly are scene-stealer's here. There is so much to adore and admire about this film. Possibly the only reason i don't give it 10 stars is because, the relationships between characters isn't quite as detailed as Anderson's other films, but thats only because that is what you expect from most Wes Anderson films. Actually what the hell, i'm going to give it ten stars. I can see why not everyone likes this film. But for me personally the film hit me emotionally, was genuinely hysterical at some points, and i was sad when the film ended.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
441,rputman,Anderson's in a World All His Own,8,30 January 2005,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou was highly anticipated by many of Wes Anderson's fans, myself included. However, despite the similarities in dead-pan delivery and the presence of actors so common in Anderson's films (Murray, Huston, Wilson), this films stands quite well on its own for those who haven't seen any of Anderson's previous work.I'll admit, I had to see it a second time to notice many of the nuances that Anderson writes into the film, be-it scripted or art direction. The main difference I found between films like The Royal Tenenbaums or Rushmore and this one, was that The Life Aquatic relied more upon visual humor rather than spoken humor. The scene in which Jane is interviewing Steve and the Orca is swimming around in the tank behind them is quite is a good example, and its all visual. The stop-motion animated creatures, the guns, the giant OPERATION HENNESEY written on everything, Hennessy's sunken ship... all of these are mainly visual but are very funny.Though this film could take some time to feel out for Anderson's fans, I would definitely recommend it, rent it on video when it comes out and watch it a few times.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
442,peter-grant,I did not know what to expect but this was one of the best films of the year,10,23 November 2004,"I was lucky enough to see Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou at a screening in London and after the very dull and over hyped Lost in Translation I did not know what to expect. I was hugely surprised, Bill Murry is fantastic and deserves a best actor Oscar nomination again (this time was well deserved). The film is generally mad and centers around Murray's character who makes bizarre films on wildlife adventures. After his best friend was killed by a rare shark he sets up on one last mission with a crew who are as mad as he is, to make a film documenting his search for the shark, to eventually kill it. With a support cast who are also fantastic this really was one of the best films of the year and has everything you would want to get from a night out at the cinema. My highlight was Angelica Huston who has not been in any film for some time and was superb as Zissous wife. 10/10 and can't wait to see it again - make sure you do too if you fancy a mad film that makes you laugh out loud.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

444,mconwa2,This movie is unusual; so is my review,10,24 January 2005,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou has moved onto my list of favorite movies. It is hard to pin down why, but I loved this film. It is eccentric, weird, and beautiful. Thats pretty much what I have to say about it. I saw it without any prior knowledge as to what this movie was about (though I knew it involved a submarine at some point because of the movie poster). I think this made the experience much more enjoyable, not really knowing what to expect at all. If you go see this movie with any type of conventional expectations, I assure you they will not be met. I also would not recommend this movie to just anyone. I have heard negative reviews from many people, who simply said they ""didnt get it"". If you enjoyed the ""Royal Tenenbaums"" or ""Rushmore"" also by Wes Anderson, you should see this film. This movie will be loved by about 25% of the population, and if you are not in this 25% you are truly missing out.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

446,vmarsch,A sleeper that will find an audience of people just like me,8,10 January 2005,"First, I like all of Wes Anderson's movies, but felt that The Royal Tenenbaums was somewhat overrated. Secondly, I like Bill Murray, but felt that Lost In Translation was somewhat overrated.The Life Aquatic is my favorite Wes Anderson film, and my favorite Bill Murray performance since Groundhog Day.I was glad that I saw this movie on vacation, before I read any reviews of it. My wife and I loved every minute of it, though I did suspect at the time that this experience wouldn't be universal. I noticed we laughed a lot more than anyone else in the audience. I found myself thinking several times that this movie seemed to be precisely targeting *my* sensibilities.I have to say I was a bit shocked when I read the reviews. Particularly by the characterization that the film was ""smug"". Frankly, I don't understand how a movie can attributed that characteristic. I believe that the viewer must, himself, project it onto the filmmaker. (I don't know, maybe the reviewers have met Wes Anderson, and think he's smug. I can't say, but I can say that the movie, itself, just didn't convey it, and I wish reviewers would stick to reviewing the movie, not the director.) Will you like this movie? I don't know. If you like Wes Anderson's films, and you like Bill Murray, and you grew up during the 70's, and you liked Buckaroo Banzai, and you love comedy served up a series of subtle, dry ironies, this may be the movie for you. Otherwise, you may hate it to death.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

In addition to others' praise, with which I agree - I could never imagine anybody dare to make a Fellini movie! They really did it! Amazing! And it isn't plagiarism of any sort - it is authentic Fellini, also enriched with American mythology from Moby Dick to Star Trek. Unfortunately, not many people on this continent (N.America) know of Fellini - I mean, they know OF him, but have never seen any of his movies. Hopefully, the avalanche of success of The Life Aquatic will eventually lead to the investigation of Fellini's heritage.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
448,stevereno81126,Wes Anderson has another winner!,8,29 December 2004,"I just saw the movie, and it is definitely a brilliant movie. If you liked Wes' other movies, there is a 99% chance you will like this one. It is definitely the best movie that is in the box office right now. If you are debating to go see this movie, just go and see it. The acting is great, the story is bizarre yet intriguing, it is shot well. The story is set up well and there are no parts where it starts to lag. It isn't a movie like dodgeball, The Life Aquatic is smart comedy. It doesn't mean that if you like dodgeball, that you won't like this, The Life Aquatic, is just better. In all truth it isn't Wes' best movie, I liked Rushmore and Tenebaums more, yet this movie is still a 10. I will be buying this on DVD when it comes out.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
449,ethayes,Life Aquatic felt that it tried too hard to be funny.,5,25 January 2005,"I am a huge fan of Wes Anderson. The Royal Tenenbaums is one of the best movies that I know of. The Life Aquatic is an example of Wes Anderson's film making attached to a bad story with characters no one can relate to. In the Tenenbaums, the audience was well aware of what was going on with each main character, making the story interesting and alive. Aquatic let me down, in that, there was no building of characters. I saw it in a theater where the audience response was somewhat appalling. There were laughs here or there, scattered as if it were awkward to watch. There were only a few moments where there was an overall laughter. It felt like the filmmaker was being too deliberate in each scene. He tried too hard to be original or funny, and he expected us to think that it's never been done before. I loved the Portugese David Bowie songs, and how the ship was just one big cross section set . Some of the scenery was great, yet some of the computer effects were unnecessary. It does have some genuinely funny moments. However, the film yields no characters to fall in love with or cheer for. I ended up just hating Bill Murray's character. He's just a jerk, married to that cold b*@ch A. Houston? And we're supposed to feel sorry for him at the end? The movie is just a work of art, open to interpretation. For those of you out there who love it to death, maybe you should watch it again, and try not jumping and cheering every time something 'funny' happens. Instead, listen to what they are saying which usually goes nowhere. The real magic in Anderson's work should be how the characters interact and drive the plot. When Anderson has a good script going for him, then all of the little quirks and scenic devices are but icing on the cake. I think this is the worst Anderson film yet, and hopefully he doesn't let us down next time.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
450,mojomunkey,what ever happened to that guy Wes Anderson?,7,25 December 2004,"when i saw Rushmore 6 years ago it changed my life. i never saw a movie like that before. i never heard comedy so smart or saw scenes inside of scenes like that. then i waited, and out came the royal tenebaums. wow! i hated it. yes, i'll say it, hate. it's strong considering how much i loved Rushmore. a little of it was my own fault. i went in there expected ""Rushmore 2: electric boogaloo."" but instead got a really sad character piece wasting a lot of excellent talent (Wes Anderson, Ben stiller, gene hackman, etc.) now after six years and a very big let down in between, i was ready to fall in love all over again with Wes Anderson and is brilliance. ""The life aquatic: with Steve Zissou"" just the title alone was enough to make me already say ""i love it"". then i saw it. Another sad character piece but this time not such great talent was wasted. The comedy was not comedy, people in the theater were laughing at parts that there was literally not a single line spoken or movement in the scene, just laughing because they felt that they owed it to Steve. Steve was the best part, and Klaus. The scenes were special and unique. I will admit i was visually pleased and audibly (if thats a word) as well. I am always happy with the music. Its like Wes writes the movies and then puts in the songs, but maybe he should listen to the songs and then write the movie. It had a plot ( i think) and it did have a start and an end, but from what i could tell the whole thing was just the middle. Maybe that was the point, but at least even ""Royal"" had an story. I'm sorry Wes, but really what has happened? maybe if he wrote this with Owen it would have been better. but heres an idea, try writing one with Luke!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

452,luna_llena_feliz,Ack!,2,1 January 2005,"I thought this would be a dark, intelligent comedy. Unfortunately it was so dark I missed it completely! To be honest, I think the joke was on the viewers. Wes Anderson tries so hard to make us laugh but doesn't quite succeed. The best he can do is an occasional chuckle. The premise of the story sounds funny enough. A Jacques Cousteau-type of guy intent on finding and killing the shark that killed his partner. I was thinking of something along the lines of Jacques Cousteau turns into Dirty Harry. It's too bad the movie just turns out to be series of badly written scenes. I can just picture Wes Anderson sitting back laughing at an audience that can't decide if they are just so stupid they don't get the deep meaning behind the movie or worse yet those who see some abstruse message. It seems such a waste of great acting talent. If you think you see profound messages in mediocre comedy than this is the film for you. If you want to watch something well-written and funny, don't bother.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
453,jeffpayne833,Another notch in Anderson's belt,9,2 January 2005,"I saw this film on the first Thursday night after it opened and was shocked that I was one of only about 10 people in the theatre. To compound this, 4 of the patrons left 2/3 of the way through the film. I knew Anderson's work was largely under-appreciated by much of the movie-going public, but surely this must have been some kind of cruel joke? Despite the surreal atmosphere, The Life Aquatic delivered every bit of what I was hoping for. Bill Murray was brilliant in his portrayal of the Cousteau-want-to-be Zissou. As rich a character as Anderson has ever created, Zissou takes you from pain to laughter effortlessly. The subtle humour that Anderson has become so skilled at sneaking into his films is given the perfect vehicle in Zissou. The cast of characters deliver excellent performances; most notably Wilson and Defoe in my opinion. While they are a diverse and remarkably deep and well-drawn group, the rest of the characters are planets within Zissou's orbit and carry themselves as such.After watching The Life Aquatic, you really must bow to Anderson for his ability to develop characters that you truly enjoy as they move through ups and downs in their lives. The interaction between these characters is every bit as intriguing as in his earlier works, set to perhaps even more elaborate and creative environments. There are so many subtle nuances present in Anderson's films that they seem to pass by without acknowledgment, but add an extra dimension to each scene that may not exist in any other filmmaker's work.I pray that we see the day that this man receives the plaudits that his efforts demand. Bravo Wes. You've created a fantastic film to add to your already excellent portfolio. Thank you for them all.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
454,llwwranch,I loved it,7,11 January 2005,If you love Bill Murray and Wes Anderson (like I do) - you'll love this lighthearted drama. Yes it is quirky and yes it isn't always funny and yes there are times you 'won't get the joke' - but hey - get over it! The film features an outstanding cast - just to see Angelica Houston's expression is worth the price of a ticket alone. Is THE LIFE AQUATIC the Best Picture of the Year? No it's not. But it is one of the most uniquely enjoyable films I've seen in a long time. Owen Wilson is a total kick - and playing the role of the straight-faced aristocratic son who may (or may not) be Bill Murray's son - is not to be missed! Bill Murray is indeed on a role career wise and who knows - another Oscar just might be in his path!

The story and dialog are truly in Anderson's style, that is, dry and cutting. The focus is on acute absurdity rather than in your face, more abrasive comedy that is generally more popular. Phenomenal from the sound track, casting (Bill Murray is BRILLIANT), camera work, and any other detail you could imagine. I wouldn't change a thing about this movie. Beautiful. Artistic. Hilarious.

Bill Murray's character was hilarious, one of his best I believe, he's a self-centered wretched old man. Owen Wilson did a great job in this film as well, his character's sensitive, and thoughtful personality is very heartwarming. The relationship between Owen Wilson and Bill Murray is great. Their ""chemistry"" throughout the movie is what gets the most laughs, along with Willem Dafoe's character that is also very comical. I didn't like Cate Blanchett in this movie very much, i'm not sure why. Funny animation throughout the movie. This is my favorite Wes Anderson movie, the humor is great, and the casting was as well.

Please do not see this film. There is absolutely no plot, the jokes and comical wit is totally lost. Probably the only redeeming part of the movie is the music, which is the only thing that kept me sane! After this, some electro-shock therapy might help. Some of the actors did seem to try to salvage the film for example Owen Wilson, but it was useless. I tried to have faith that Bill Murray would turn around and become himself again, for I thought myself to be a fan. The only reason I stayed in the room was because I was there for a class. If you value anything good in this world do not go to see the movie, otherwise you will be utterly disappointed.

What I will say is that this ranks with Napolean Dynamite as one of those films that is extremely quirky and is driven by a simple plot piece. A good range of equally batty characters (played well by a fine ensemble cast) populate what is a very amusing movie. The use of CGI is fantastic, even if some of it looks extremely naff, I kind of figure that is the point. The film moves along well and is never boring. I would recommend this film to those that think a little left of centre.

459,acrchandler,A clumsy and lazy mess,4,7 March 2005,"I looked forward to The Life Aquatic as only a real fan of Wes Anderson's previous films could. I loved Royal Tenenbaums and thought the combination of many of the cast with a story pastiche of Jacques Cousteau was sure-fire.But... the film is a complete mess. The writing is weak, the narrative non-existent, the acting is awful (Owen Wilson in particular looks as though his mind is elsewhere throughout the film) and there are very few yuks indeed. As for the computer animation - it manages to be both pointless and intrusive.In its favour, the shots on the Italian coast are beautifully lit (but then home movies set on a late summer Meditteranean afternoon will look pretty good), even an average Bill Murray performance has its moments.How anyone (let alone the majority of voters) could give this film a '10' rating is a measure only of the herd mentality that leads people to acclaim anything put out by a fashionable name.Don't make the mistake I did, of taking someone who isn't a paid up member of the Wes Anderson fanclub.

At the beginning of the movie William Defoe's nephew gives Steve a crayon fish, that magically comes to life. Zissou sees the creatures of the ocean as cartoons with magical movements to them that stimulates his character and leading him to forgive the actions of the sea that have cost him so much.Overall i think this was the best movie i have seen and will see this year.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
461,franciscollobet,"""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou""",5,21 October 2016,"Hegel once said: ""The beauty of nature is only a reflection of the spirit, a beauty that is not perfect."" That is achieved by Wes Anderson, in one of the last scene of this film. It helps the film with its purpose. The purpose of this film is to make ignorant people believe that they are watching a great movie, and of course, they aren't. By the end of this film there is a beautiful scene, that can only be described as ""masterful and magical"". This was a clear example of Mr. Anderson finally achieving Hegel's view of art, unfortunately this only lasts for about a minute, because if it didn't, the movie would have been way better.In great films such as Fellini's ""Prova D'orchestra"" or François Truffaut's ""Le dernier metro"" great filmmaker were able to show us how to make a true glorification of art and life. In ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"", Wes Anderson shows us that he thinks he knows a lot about oceans, but he clearly doesn't know (or care) anything about neither life, nor art.The plot revolves at Steve (Bill Murray), an oceanographer. Steve believes that he has enough talent to become a director, and he's wrong (Just like Wes Anderson!). After the death of his friend, Steve will go, and hunt, the creature who killed him, while shooting a documentary about it. His crew will be joining Steve for his little adventure. As in every story, things start happening. Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) joins them. Ned may, or may not, be Steve's son. Steves wife, Eleanor Zissou (Angelica Huston) believes that Steve is taking advantage of Ned, and leaves him. And Steve's friend, Klaus (Willem Dafoe), becomes jealous of Ned. And of course, Ned needs a love interest, because, why not? A reporter called Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett) is a very important part of this movie (because she's Cate Blanchett, and you can't have a movie without Cate Blanchett).Murray and Wilson are uninspired, and so is director Wes Anderson. The film is always trying so hard to succeed, and because of this, it never does. Of course the movie has some funny parts, but they're not enough foe forgiving Anderson the rest of the film. ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is shallow, unoriginal, and almost completely not arstistical. Mr. Anderson is probably proud of this mess, with the excuse that it's a very strange film, and everything. But let me tell you Mr. Anderson, you have made a few good movies, but most of them are bad, and yes, most of them are strange (this one isn't), but they don't have the strange magic of Woody Allen, Luis Buñuel, David Cronenberg, John Carpenter, David Lynch, or even Tim Burton! Many people call Wes Anderson a genius, well most of them have never seen Carl Theodor Dreyer, Ingmar Bergman, Vittorio De Sica, and many other great and more important filmmakers in their entire lives!

His latest endeavor, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, has many tongue-in-cheek moments, and the eccentricity factor is still present. Unfortunately, I could not shake the feeling that this is a Wes Anderson film TRYING to be a Wes Anderson film.This is Anderson's first departure from Co-Writing with recurring actor Owen Wilson, I wonder if those two have a chemistry that just isn't there between Anderson and Co-Writer Noah Baumbach.Although the film will definitely entertain, overall it does not feel as complete as even Anderson's earliest work.Noteworthy is his use of Stop Motion Animation for all of the aquatic life!

Admittedly about halfway through I thought about turning off the DVD and reading a book, but I'm glad I decided to stick it out through the long middle of the movie and decided to embrace the film.I would not go around recommending this movie, not being sure if it would appeal to the tastes of other folks, but I can't UN-recommend it either.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
465,kstorn,I really wanted to like this one.,6,10 September 2005,"I really wanted to like this movie. The cast was great Goldblum, Blanchet, Huston, Murrow, Wilson, and Dafoe. I thought Dafoe's character was the funniest. I was disappointed that the adversarial relationship between Murray and Goldblum was not exploited more. That could have made the film much funnier. The effects were a bit distracting, and the whole movie feels like it was over-directed and under-scripted. I had friends warn me that the movie wasn't that good, but I rented it anyway. I think I like it more than they did, but I kept waiting for the movie to really take hold and it never really did. summary, a lot of potential here was not used.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
466,gerhardandgwen,Life's too technical!,6,22 January 2006,"A dry, almost British comedy about exploring the planet, one-self and even a pretty pregnant reporter. This slightly arty look at famous explorers and filmmakers takes you on a tour with Stevesie, who has to re-define himself and his role as a father after his probable son discovers him. I was waiting for that good twist in the tail, but sadly it never quite happened for me.It seems that the director was quite specific about what exactly he wanted, but had he allowed this fantastic cast a bit of freedom he might have had a really great film. There is still a lot of enjoyment to be found in the characters and i would have loved to be an extra on this set! The film gives you a walk down memory lane with a 60's feel and cuts from ""old"" documentaries- good work on behalf of the set designers.If you feel that we make life too technical and intellectualize our existence too much, you might like this dry film despite it's wet background.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

The small amount of animation is great and the acting is incredible. Bill Murray is Bill Murray need I say more. He is almost always incredible and this is one of his better roles. Goldblum, Huston and Dafoe supply great supporting performances as well.

Each of the actors in this turned in good if not stellar performances. However, there was nothing sympathetic and a lot which was not in the least sympathetic to attract and keep one's attention. If a fantasy, it was wholly unbelievable. If it was action, it was plastic, fake and worse. If romantic, it makes one want to be celibate.All of the actors in this have appeared in much better vehicles and have had the benefit of much better writing.

Very quirky, not a ""laugh a minute"" comedy (and it doesn't claim to be that). Nice music (quirky too), interesting effects. But you have to be in the mood for this one, IMO.Apparently I have to write more. Interesting to see Owen Wilson playing a different sort of part - I wonder if Jeff Goldblum will ever do that?

I saw this movie on the day it came out, Christmas Day. The whole time I'm sitting there thinking if it would ever speed up or have some insane plot twist. With such an all-star cast I expected something different than what I did with this movie. This movie is one of those you have to watch about 3 times to catch everything and get everything that is going on, or at least I did. Bill Murray does a great job with is super dry sense of humor all throughout the movie. Another person who is always seeming to make me laugh throughout the movie is Willem Dafoe who, in this movie, is in a very different type of role for him. The last movie i saw him in was Spider-Man or Boondock Saints. In those movies he's a pretty tough guy. It is different seeing him play the sensitive deck-mate. Even thought his movie may be slow at parts and not have any plot twists, the end is probably one of the best endings I have seen. Zissou brings out emotion to all that watch while he sees his made up ""leopard shark"" swim by his super overcrowded mini sub. It is definitely not your ""run em gun em"" type of movie but it has very artsy cinematography and a great soundtrack that is even good to listen to when you're not watching the movie. If you've seen it once you should check it out again to see if there is anything you missed and you might just want to watch it again and again.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Murray was on top form, he achieved a row of successful and brilliant films, here playing more a comedy. His cynical type is at its top. Pills, acids and you hear David bowie in Brazilian. The typical ""see-ish"" floating atmosphere combined with a colorful, almost comic book like, set makes really enter his world.

473,cmkister,A Special Movie,9,9 May 2006,"I saw this film the first day it came out in theaters in the USA on Christmas day 2004. I came home that night with a satisfied and warm feeling. The most accurate thing I can say is that, on the first watch, The Life Aquatic went down sweetly and warmed the bones.As I saw the film a second, third, and fourth times over the course of the next few months, my initial impressions of the movie remained very good and began to develop into an awareness of what made the film so pleasing to me. No matter if I saw the movie at a theater or on DVD, with family or friends, that first, easy, slow feeling returned familiar. I don't have any technical cinematic training, but what I sensed from the film was the undercurrent of life that buoyed all of its elements. The music, characters, story, settings, and visual beauty came together to give the film rich dimensions. The characters are all so human. They're funny, tragic, nostalgic, familiar, and yearning. They are real, and yet still have a touch of myth and fantasy that allows me to tap into my own imagination. It is this calm and softly surreal type of mood that makes me really take to the movie. This doesn't sum up The Life Aquatic all in all, but there is always this sense throughout which makes the film ease over like a warm dream which all the actors stepped into themselves to create something special.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

This looked like a film student did this. The computer graphics were absurd. I figured. Bill Murray, William Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum how bad can it be. The answer apparently was worse then I could have ever expected. The characters seemed to just be added in at random, and did not seem to have an chemistry. When will people learn that just because someone releases on good movie, it does not make all their after products instant hints. I refer you to Sixth Sense, followed by Signs and The Village if you need an example. I just hope that once the public gets to vote on this that the rating will be more reflective of what a terrible waste of time and money this film was.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
475,szirotnyak,That's not clever - that's dull!,2,14 August 2006,"This film is a very odd duck. It's ostensibly a comedy, yet any viewer with a developed sense of humor might at best smirk once or twice. It has an all-star cast of actors (the sort of ""stars"" that might have participated an episode of Fantasy Island 25 years ago), yet there isn't any acting going on - only recitation.I found it difficult to maintain mental focus for the first hour of the movie. I felt physically uncomfortable as I endured the unfunny, monotonous, call-and-response dialogue and as it became obvious that the characters were all going to be one-dimensional, (right down to the predictably-timed, forced and maudlin admission of vulnerability made by each). My attention drifted, and I found myself mentally critiquing the sets and the way the shots were blocked, but this only made the experience more tedious. I don't know if the film was deliberately intended to look cheap (artificially lighted, statically posed, etc.); perhaps these qualities, along with the poorly animated sea creatures (and poorly animated actors) were indicative of a level of cinematic sophistication I simply cannot comprehend. I guess my irony sonar has finally given up the ghost.Bill Murray is playing Bill Murray again. The ""dialogue"" consists of one actor (either to the extreme right or left of the shot, or, if it's Bill Murray, staring directly into the camera) reciting a line or two while another (at the extreme opposite side of the screen, preferably in profile) waits his or her turn. Repeat ad nauseum. Entirely stilted, unnatural, annoying, dull. It truly looked as though every scene in the film was a first take, as though the budget didn't allow for a second. Again, perhaps this is the new ""cool"" way to direct; maybe this makes the film ""arty,"" I don't know.For those of you who like comparisons, outside of a couple ridiculous ""suspense"" and ""action"" scenes that harked back to such highbrow gems like The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes and That Darn Cat, The Life Aquatic makes My Dinner With Andre seem wholly unpretentious - an incredible feat to have accomplished without resorting to any of the clichés of high cinematic art, to be sure. I understand it's not all that easy to make a film that is both dumb AND pretentious... which reminds me: I'd rather watch Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea any day. (In fact, a comparison of The Life Aquatic and VTTBOTS reveals the huge difference in entertainment value between preposterous, bombastic camp and pretentious, self-congratulatory, ""maybe it's actually quite profound"" camp. Give me a break.)Anyhow... each dull little scene ends with a pause followed by a profound, ""touching"" one-liner whereby some character or another displays ""vulnerability"" and we, the audience, supposedly get to grips with the true meaning of the word ""pathos"" - then it's off to another five or ten minutes of stilted, unfunny dialogue and situations.I paid much closer attention to the film during the last hour, but that was only because I was at that point more bewildered than bored, slightly angry at myself for still watching, and perversely hoping that the movie would continue to stink right up to the closing credits so I could at least laugh to myself about how bad it was.It did.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

I just don't think they got it""). SERIOUSLY. I've now watched this movie over 50 times, and I still am in awe of it's brilliance. Aside from maybe the greatest cast Wes has ever assembled, this movie is written so well, and flows so great from scene to scene, that I truly think this is his best movie yet. Bill Murray as Zissou is outstanding. Mark Motherbough's music compliments the film perfectly, as does the stop animation used to add that other worldly effect to underwater scenes and marine life. I can't say enough how much I love this film. I haven't been this blown away by a movie since The Big Lebowski. I think you either love Wes Andersen films or you just don't get it.

If I hadn't realized they share quite a different sense of humor than myself, I would have missed this hysterical comedy.Bill Murray is as funny as I have ever seen and truly shows he is a master of his craft. Willem Dafoe demonstrates his acting talent ranges far beyond his typical bad guy persona. Owen Wilson shows there is life in comedy beyond Wedding Crashers and other more blatant comedies.Only those who can find the humor out of Murray's dry humor or the fact that 80% of the soundtrack is a Zissou crew member playing David Bowie songs on guitar, singing in Portuguese.I gave this a 9 out of 10, this was the first Wes Anderson movie I have seen and was very impressed, I am hoping Royal Tenenbaum will be just as good P.S. steal that boat's keys and throw them in the water, wait they might have an extra set of keys, oh just blow it up",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
480,mr_micawber,recognition,10,24 September 2006,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has a wonderful cast and set of characters. Zissou's attitude towards life and his documentaries is hilarious. Subtle comedy means that it is still very enjoyable on a second and third viewing, and the more you put into watching the movie, the more you get out of it. What places this movie ahead of all others I have seen is that every scene is good. Most ""great"" movies contain at least 30mins of vacuity. The only things that detract from the film are imperfect editing and a couple of indulgent moments (including 1 particularly awful Kevin Smith style gag about a safe). The very few bad elements stick out because the movie is, on the whole, brilliant. The important question for the reader is whether or not it is their type of movie. If you think The Shawshank Redemption (the 2nd best movie ever according to this site) is good, then probably not. If you think The Royal Tenenbaums is classy but not particularly good, then I predict you will love this much more sophisticated movie.

So I watched it again, just in case it was merely a case of me having a bad day the first time I watched it, or perhaps the film all came together after I had quit watching it. I figured I must have missed something.So now, after watching it all the way through, my final conclusion is that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I kept waiting for something funny to occur but I could see every joke coming from a mile away. There was not one iota of originality. Sadly, the trailer that was shown on television before the film was released had all the funniest scenes from the movie in it, but even they weren't really weren't all that funny.Although I am a big Bill Murray fan, this is one of his projects I will forget and try to not hold it against him.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

My boyfriend was with me and sober at the time. About 20 minutes in I asked if the whole movie was in claymation. He said some parts were, but most of it was not. This confused me. I watched the whole movie without understanding anything and was fully convinced that scenes were in full claymation. What my boyfriend was talking about was the little animated fish. So he fell asleep and I started the movie over because I wasn't sure what to do and I didn't understand it anyway so I figured I'd try again. At the end of that I was still confused so I watched it one more time. By the third time I had come down and finally understood the beauty of this movie while also coming to the realization that absolutely none of it was claymation. Good times.

Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Cate Blanchett give great performances, probably in part due to Anderson's good rapport with actors.

485,artfuse,Drowns in its own Hype,1,10 January 2005,"The only redeeming qualities of this movie are the cinematography, the set design, and the animation. Literally every other thing about this film sucked. It's poorly written. It's poorly acted. And it has the crappiest pirates I've ever seen. The slight sense of surreality present in all of Anderson's other films is brought to the fore here, and it destroys everything.Characters that I think we're supposed to identify with or at least be interested in are boring, mean, one-dimensional or all of the above. Wilem Dafoe is the only actor whose performance I liked, and even that was only marginally. But it's not the actors' fault; it's purely Anderson's. Clearly, it is only Anderson's, because how else could a cast including the aforementioned Dafoe, Bill Murray, Angelica Houston, Jeff Goldblum, Michael Gambon, Bud Cort, and Noah Taylor be so boring otherwise? Jeff Goldblum and Bill Murray are supposed to be archnemeses - which sounds so cool, what a match up - but it's wasted. Bill Murray's character, the titular Steve Zissou, is supposed to be an oceanographer past his prime out on one last voyage, but he comes off as a total sad-sack who never had the clout to be a has-been; he's just a loser with an over-sized ego.The jokes aren't funny because there's no set-up, and so they just come off as confused and mean. The two action sequences are confusing, poorly played out, and devoid of excitement. The edits are odd, either too hasty or not long enough, and the plot - Steve Zissou's revenge on a jaguar shark that ate his best friend - is set up in the overly long and rambling first act, dropped for the entire middle act, and then comes back suddenly, emotionlessly, and after we've stopped caring about it, at the end of the third act. That's pretty frustrating, too - there's a terrific scene at the end of the film with Zissou's entire crew in a tiny submarine, and it should be a moving, sums-it-all-up climactic scene, but it's not, because it got no set-up in any way, shape, or form.I could keep going on about how much I hated this movie, but I won't. I'll just say that I sincerely advise you to NOT see this film, or to at least wait until it comes out on DVD and rent it, because it's not worth your time and money in the theater. Anderson's next project is going to be a stop-motion adaptation of Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox, which is my favorite Roald Dahl story. I can only hope that Anderson does it more justice than he did The Life Aquatic.Oh, and the music really sucks in this one, too.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

So stylized and surreal and leaving me questioning why they don't make all movies like this.The comedy of The Life Aquatic is, at times, so veiled or subtle that it is difficult to even realize there is a joke. Often there is no punch line; you just kind of have to feel it.The music of Bowie/Seu Jorge was crazy good. The out-of-the-blue action scene was a masterpiece of direction. The CGI was what other CGI wishes it could be.As quirky as the story was, and as odd-ball as the characters were, it all felt human to me.

487,tahir,Substance and meaning,8,26 December 2004,"The Steve Zissou you see at the beginning of this Wes Anderson film is certainly not the Steve Zissou who bids you farewell at the end. His character, played smoothly by Bill Murray, finds himself throughout the movie uncertain about who he is: ""Deep Search""-er, film maker, or father. And it is a pleasure to find out that the creators of this film did not make the choice a simple one, for us or for him. For me this ambiguous aspect of the film is what makes it well-made. The more surface characteristics, like the wonderful cinematography, are definitely there to make the film good to look at, but the substance and meaning of the film are not obscured and forgotten in polishing the surface.My problems with the movie are minor. The CG does nothing for me. Instead, the splice of the ship is a wonderful effect that becomes useful for telling the film. The transparency of the effect is not there when it comes to the CG ocean life. Certainly the fact that the CG ocean life are unnatural to my eyes is important to understanding what Zissou the ""Deep Search""-er desires.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
488,pavo11,Paternal figure in Life Aquatic...,9,9 December 2007,"Many of us always look towards our parent's for advice, money, or simply to feel loved. I think Life Aquatic is all about this, searching for the paternal figure that can help us in our times of insecurity. Certainly many characters in this movie are searching for this paternal figure. Zissou's lack of paternal figure encourages him not to become one, although the grieve showed by Zissous towards Esteban seems like the one you express when your dad is gone. Klaus as well as other members of the crew value Zissou as if he were a father to each of them, it was Zissou who took them out of their miserable jobs and introduced them to a new and more exciting life. In some ways Jane looks at Zissou as a father she always wished she had. Jane is as well looking for a father for her baby, a baby that represents hope for all the dreams she lost in the way. And of course Ned, who's the great character in this story. He is the son searching for his true identity, whose journey must begin by confronting and searching for advice from his father. In the end, the Life Aquatic is all about the father we wished we had, or maybe it's backwards, the sons/daughters we always wished we had. ""I need to find a baby for this father"" as Jane clearly states it. Wes Anderson's movie is all about the family values, and how we must love our family, even though at times it might seem difficult. And by family I am not referring specifically to our biological relatives. But to all of the people with which we work, swim, live and enjoy.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

I have a strict sense of humor, and I have a tendency towards dry humor.With this in mind, Life Aquatic ends up being an excellent movie. It captured my attention from the beginning and ended with me wanting more (some may say this means that plot lines weren't resolved, I think it just means that it was a really interesting movie). The dry humor is all you'll find. Its subtle pokes at you won't send you into fits of laughter, but it did keep me in a state of ""constant chuckle."" Not all will find this movie entertaining. I'd go as far as to say a majority wouldn't, but for that certain niche it serves wonderfully.Surrounding the movie is a seemingly perfect cast. I can't think of one actor that could play the roles better than they are done on screen. Many of the faces are instantly recognizable. I watch plenty of movies thinking ""I've seen better acting in a high school play."" When watching this movie I didn't see the actors, I saw the characters. I completely forgot about Bill Murray and saw Steve. Characters make or break a movie, and this one is filled with enthralling ones.Finally, as a movie Life Aquatic is very creative. Any attempt by me to describe this creativity would defeat the purpose of creativity itself. This creativity applies to its story, characters, and visuals.

494,zeisgeist,Too much to digest after one viewing.,8,30 December 2004,"I'm a huge fan of Wes Anderson's movies, so I was anxiously awaiting the debut of THE LIFE AQUATIC. Well, I finally saw it yesterday, and I have to say - this is one of those movies that you have to see at least twice to begin to understand. It's visually stunning and the performances are wonderful - and, as always, the soundtrack is a character in and of itself. But I feel like there are a million layers to this movie that I haven't even begun to peel away. Then again, it took me about six viewings of THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS to understand the significance of Eli Cash. Still, that's part of the beauty of a Wes Anderson film - you can watch it over and over and over and learn something new each and every time.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
495,liandro717,Thinly emotive,10,21 March 2008,"I don't have background knowledge enough to write down a critic piece that serious. However, I do state this: I find The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou to be a fabulous, fresh, intelligent movie. The funny side's there for everyone to see, almost everyone. But I think it's also a very touchy film, thinly and carefully emotive. On the submarine and on Steve Zissou's right arm we read the name ""Jaqueline"", crossed-out. When Ned asks ""what happened to Jaqueline?"", Steve goes: ""She didn't...really...love me"". Touches. One immediately thinks in all the suffer Steve'd had to go through to arrive to that lucid, simple and irrevocable conclusion. Clean as a whistle. Everyone should see this movie. And when they do, think of me -I mean this comment.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
496,igstr,The best in modern art,10,30 January 2006,"For me, the scene when Zissou encounter the ""Yellow Shark"", is the deepest transmission in modern art. Murray's deep sorrow, which suddenly appear on his face, reminded me of my the most painful (but also most beautiful and important) dream I ever had. In this dream I also felt great sorrow. When I woke up I thought about it and I found out the reason for this sorrow. It had a deep impact on me. But after few years I forgot it. And when I fourth time saw ""Cpt Zissou"", I realized, that Murray's sorrow and sorrow from my dream were the same sorrow for this same reason. And I recalled the meaning of my dream. And now I'm sure that this sorrow will be with me (I've got it on DVD (!)). And I'm grateful to all people who help create this movie for give me back this feeling. For me the way how Anderson and Murray (not only in this movie) combine subtle (and little psychedelic) but really funny sense of humor with profound sympathy for human beings - is the best what cinema give us during last decades.PS.

497,kristina-t-k,Life Aquatic - very fishy,3,16 July 2008,"VERY accurate portrait of a full-blown narcissist, but otherwise quite fragmented, bizarre and lacking in real deeper meaning. So many things seemed artificial, superficial, show-offy and unreal. Perhaps this was meant to mirror the empty narcissist? The relationships and feelings (and even deaths) seemed fake, even though the movie was crammed with different people, situations and relationships, that could have been explored in many interesting ways (but all of them remained onedimensional, although I'm convinced the excellent actors did their best with what they had.)But kudos to Bill Murray for excellently portraying the charm and ruthlessness of a true, fully self-absorbed narcissist!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
498,Chococatxx,Loved it. Wes Anderson did a fantastic job with this Film.,10,30 September 2008,"I love this film for so many reasons. It's funny, at points action packed, and also sad. I could watch this movie over and over, I honestly don't understand what people wouldn't like about it, It's a great film that portrays many emotions that are of a real life person. It has a bit of comedy, romance, action, and some dramatic sad parts. I love how they used clay-mation! That was really something. Looking at it from an artistic standpoint alone makes it an amazing movie!I would be honored if I could one day portray Steve Zissou, or any of the members, on stage. That would be quite the role to get into.In any case, I highly suggest watching this movie.

Alas, this is more like another Tennenbaums - meaning it is the same formula as in the earlier films, but the comedy just doesn't work. There are a few funny moments, but they are too few and too bar in-between. I realize Anderson has a very unique style that, when it works, can result in works of sheer comedic genius (Bottle Rocket and Rushmore). Unfortunately, it just doesn't work here - on any level. Except perhaps for the music - Acoustic old Bowie sung in Portueguese and Mark Mothersbaugh's clever scoring.

I think it will just be one of those kinds of films (but hey, I also loved ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" which this reminded me of). Pure crazy fantastical stuff and I was completely taken with it.It's a visually beautiful film with loads of odd little CG touches and subtle visual gags. The cutaway tour of the ship was a classic. Murray gives an amazing, energetic, yet deadpan performance and I also liked the richness of the smaller roles like ""Klaus."" The soundtrack was quirky and wonderful with unexpectedly hilarious Bowie covers and pounding, rocking tracks in the action scenes.I think the gorgeous locations, sets and props nearly steal the show--kind of reminded me of ""Brazil"" in that way and I think it is destined to become a cult film in the same way ""Brazil"" has. I can't wait to take some friends of mine and see what they think once it opens--this is one of those movies that's so different and off the wall that it will be interesting to see how it plays out. Although I realize it's getting mixed reviews, I'll stick my neck out and call it a masterpiece.Being old enough to have grown up with Jacques Cousteau, I felt Anderson really captured the look and feel he was after with the the ""movie within the movie"" sequences and the yellow typographical stuff was spot-on.If, like me, you're bored with the usual metroplex fare, this odd, unexpected movie is for you.

501,CmdrGuard,A pox on all that is modern film,1,28 December 2004,"This movie was terrible. Bill Murry should be immediately tarred and feathered for staring such filth.The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is a ridiculous story of a fraud named Steve Zissou with ridiculous characters and ridiculous turn of events. While some may consider the lunacy of the plot to be humorous, it was really just stale.Throughout the film, you're left wondering, nay, hoping for some humor or plot development but none substantial really forms. The characters are all superficial and their interactions seemed played and hackneyed.Questions arise like why the hell does Ned Plimpton decide to give up his career as a pilot to find his alleged father Steve Zissou. Plimpton invests all his money into Zissou's half-ass productions with little reason other than to try and bond with dear old dad. I suppose one might consider the whole concept humorous, but it was really just plain stupid.I suppose this movie would serve as a parody for aquatic documentaries, but only very weakly. More aptly this movie is the Blair Witch of comedies - a scam on all those who pay to see it.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
502,creoauram,"Quirky, Smug, Mildly Entertaining",4,15 February 2012,"Perhaps I am one of the unwashed masses, perhaps my palate isn't suited for the finer things in life. Those could be the reasons why I didn't enjoy The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. I realize this is boutique film making, and the movie is going for quirk over substance. But Royal Tennenbaums strove and achieved the same thing, whereas this movie fails to deliver a moment of enjoyment for me.The actors themselves do a fine job, Bill Murray is good as the severely flawed titular character. But the plot seems content to meander through a series of unlikely events and the ending fails to satisfy.Zissou is an analog of Jaques Cousteau, star of a once popular oceanic adventure show and the movie follows Zissou through the trials and tribulations of keeping his show afloat.Characters are introduced, say odd things, and are dismissed. The story itself takes a number of ""unexpected"" turns and ends with the typical ""we all lose but that's OK"" genre trope.The film wants so much to have an original voice that I feel it eschews entertainment for oddity, much like that goth chick in your sixth period English class used to.All in all, I do not recommend this movie to anyone save fans of this type of film making. Zissou the movie is as pretentious as the character.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
503,halcyon-aegis,Bill Murray Shines in Exceptional Aquatic Comedy,10,14 June 2010,"This is a strange wonder Wes Anderson has made. For many, this movie produced an effect near to drowning in a sea of whimsy without depth or emotion. Such concerns are valid, but, in my opinion, entirely mistaken. I gleaned real joy from the unpredictability and meticulousness of the film, which, while admittedly hyper-stylized and overproduced, is firmly anchored in real heart and emotion. It was also greater in thematic and cinematic scope than anything Anderson had tried before. It attempts to deal with the ambiguities of a declining middle age, a man (Bill Murray's oceanographer/documentarian Steve Zissou) so wrapped in his own artificial identity that he fails to notice the beauty which attracted him to his oceanography work in the first place.Unlike Anderson's two misses–the passable but shallow Bottle Rocket and the merely good Darjeeling Limited–this film is lifted by its central performance. Bill Murray subtly guides his character through this meandering movie and conveys so convincingly the melancholy and sense of loss his character experiences. The role is treacherous, but Murray navigates it like a pro, playing it droll and subdued. Murray has a certain affectionate, sad quality about him that has always endeared me to him in his lengthy career. Cate Blanchett (as a bitter and fragile newspaper reporter) and Jeff Goldblum also deliver on their characters' quirky comic potential, particularly the latter, who stands as a brilliant foil for Murray's character's adolescent hijinks with his sophisticated and suave performance as Steve Zissou's nemesis Alistair Hennessey.Anderson's visual style here is refined and particular, and endowed with a certain timeless quality. At moments, it can be surreal, at others almost realist, though the former dominates easily. Henry Selick's cute stop-motion sea creatures (even an enormous shark has a paper- maché look) were interesting to look at, even more so than the rest of the movie. Where some found the contrived, artificial look of the movie with disdain, I thought most of it worked, and tied in with the overall themes the film was exploring.I must concede that there are a few major flaws in this movie. Some (Owen Wilson annoyingly whispering his lines in a contrived and antiquated Southern drawl) were almost enough to make me lose interest at times while others (the horribly directed action scenes) seemed to fit with the movie but still grated on me for some reason. Certain scenes and moments were extraneous even when they were interesting, and it took a few viewings to catch all the jokes. For me, it grew funnier the more I watched it as I took in all the details and subtle setups that Anderson is (in)famous for.So the movie is broken in places. Yet, like a battered old handmade antique (or is that new antique?) it retains a charm all its own. I will always respect the decisions of true artists, which Anderson is, even when they veer dangerously into murky waters. This is one of my personal favourites, and you can always find me ready to don a red cap and Speedo and delve into the unknown with an open mind and willing eyes.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
504,spongo,Anderson Dives Deep but Needs to Come up for Air,7,21 December 2004,"Wes Anderson has created another perfectly enjoyable delirium of a movie with the Life Aquatic of Steve Zissou, but ultimately the laughs do not come from the belly and the characters work too hard to be characters. Murray as aquatic explorer and filmmaker Steve Zissou is as appealing as he can be, less manic than the Murray of old, yet able to evoke the same humorous responses with a few simple facial expressions. The support cast is quite capable, and often provide the laughs. Jeff Goldblum is an appropriately obnoxious foil for Murray, and could have been used to even greater comic effect. Owen Wilson, playing a character who may be Zissou's son, seems to enjoy playing it straight, but there doesn't appear to be much chemistry with Murray. Anderson should definitely be applauded for taking the plunge into uncharted waters by creating this silly movie. Ultimately, though, the silliness of the characters can not compensate for a very loose plot that meanders in still waters without really going anywhere. Overall, there just wasn't much there. Perfectly watchable, but not destined beyond the Netflix queue.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
505,tartnoveau,Homage to 70s adventure shows,8,26 March 2005,"If you're around a certain age - maybe your mid-30s to 40s - you remember watching a particular genre of shows on television with your parents. There was Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom, the Wonderful World of Disney, Animal Kingdom, and of course The Undersea World of Jaques Cousteau. They were in Living Color and they were the best thing on a Sunday evening in a world with only three television channels. The shows always featured exotic and interesting creatures, explorers researching unusual places, and action scenes of animal attacks. There was something about the programs that was a little off, though; you might have started to notice that the continuity was not all that great, the editing was rough sometimes - eventually we found out that a lot of the scenes were staged by the camera crew and edited to look spontaneous.Imagine one of those shows took a step back; imagine it showed not just the running antelopes and brilliant undersea life, but also the conflicts and dramas that were supposedly taking place in the lives of the explorers and film crew. The film work is still the same, though. Shots jump unexpectedly, making you wonder what was edited out. The scenery looks like a set. What was supposed to be authentic reaction to a situation seems rehearsed. This is The Life Aquatic - a movie that is an enlarged version of the Sunday evening adventures I grew up with. It knows it's a movie, and makes this quite clear to the viewer who remembers its references. The curtains at the beginning and end tell us that we're watching a show - not a purported enactment of things that really could have happened somewhere, but a piece put together at the whim of the director, who is a step further back than what we're used to. There are wonderful little fake creatures animated in throughout the film, all self-consciously artificial but still delightful. The captions between scenes are perfect - they tell us what's going on, in 1970s badly-spaced Helvetica, as if we needed help following along.One of the songs we hear twice, once in the original Bowie version and once in Portugese, is Life on Mars. The song is about the way we lose ourselves in movies, even bad ones, even though they're not real and often not that good. Movies that are full of clichés and complete unreality, where we know what will happen next - and yet we still watch.""Wonder if he'll ever know he's in the bestselling show?"" asks Bowie. Yes, they do know. The characters in TLA know that they are acting; they're doing it to give us a good show. They don't really get hurt, and they don't really die. You think that one does die, though, right? Well, watch the end credits carefully and you'll see him standing on the ship's lookout tower, in full uniform, smoking his pipe.""But the film is a saddening bore, 'cause I wrote it ten times or more. It's about to be writ again..."" says the song. Wes Anderson wrote it again, but in a new way; one that references all the things we took for granted in the days before special effects. It's a spot-on answer to today's reality shows. We had ""reality"" back in the day, but our reality was picked out in the cutting room, a few minutes of action from thousands of feet of boring nothing, manufactured reality, created for our entertainment. And has anything changed? We pretend it's real now, we pretend they can't see the cameras, but we all know in the back of our minds that they can, and that whatever happens is altered by the presence of the watchers, ourselves in our millions. On their side of the cameras, they know it too, and what they do is no more ""reality"" than is the cut-away set of Zissous' ship. At least Anderson's movie admits it, and glories in the silliness of it all.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
506,newby_paul,A Complete Hotch Potch with Steve Zissou,5,6 March 2005,"I saw the film at a special screening in London where afterwards Anderson avoided saying anything much in a typically sycophantic post film Q& A sesh. Angelica Houston gushed and cheered proudly from the back of the room in a manner more akin to a teenager at a friends first gig. Embarrassing...For me Anderson has literally thrown together some clever visual ideas, a zillion one liners delivered poorly by a confused cast (apart from the brilliant Dafoe performance), a flimsy adventure story line with a tenuous father and son sub plot line, no character development or drama, several big star names, an amusing use of Bowie songs sung in Portuguese and a very kitsch/cartoony/ thunderbirdsy and knowingly over irreverent approach to mise en scene and guess what we the audience are left with?...a confusing hotch potch of a film! I think the Cousteau like idea could have been a winner but the film and especially Anderson's over quirky and irreverent direction just drifted on the waves and into the rocks of mediocrity. Or maybe it was the script?Whatever, Bill Murray just looked bored and perplexed throughout. Owen Wilson just pouted and never offered the cool outlandish charisma he showed in The Tenenbaums, Cate Blanchett's talent was wasted on a pointless character.Zissou struggles to be an adventure movie as it has no drama (throwing in a pirate shoot out scene with an Iggy song slung over the top hardly made up for this) . It definitely is a comedy although a script full of gags delivers only a few laughs. As expected Zissou is mostly a visual comedy - the visual gags work best (the killer whale sketch showing again Anderson's talent for creating a visual comedic hysteria - by using the oldest TV comedy gag in the book...straight man talking in the foreground being upstaged by the buffoon in the background-but it works brilliantly yet again!I laughed but I expected a lot more...",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

It basically had no plot and was just all in all terrible.I love Bill Murray, Caddyshack and What About Bob are classics. But this one? Not funny, not interesting, and certainly not worth it.Wes Anderson did a wonderful job on the Royal Tenenbaums, but really messed up on this one.So, if you want to waste your time on seeing a movie with boring characters, zero humor and personality, and no plot, then The Life Aquatic is for you.

""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" is one of them. By haunting I mean, that upon leaving the theatre I feel changed in someway. I can't stop thinking about the characters and events. I feel a tremendous urge to go back and see it again because I don't want to miss anything. This is the feeling I'm having today having gone to the first Christmas day showing. Billy Murray is incredible! There have been reviews that compare Steve Zissou to Royal Tennenbaum. I personally didn't see it. Steve is just the right combination of salty sailor and mid-life-crisis-man. Owen Wilson as Ned Plimpton is just plain adorable,and Cate Blanchett couldn't be cuter. I have only recently been introduced to the world of Wes Anderson. While I've enjoyed his other films I don't find them laugh out loud funny. Life Aquatic on the other hand has moments that really got me giggling. I've been raving about it to everyone. I really want people to see it. However, I am afraid that they just won't get it. If you are a Wes Anderson fan run don't walk to see this film; you will love it! If you aren't a Wes Anderson fan go see it with a very open mind.

509,stratguy,One of the most brilliant movies of the year.,10,7 January 2005,"Despite seeming endless bashing of the movie, I have to say it is incredible. The humor and storyline are both brilliant. However, I can recognize how those who prefer the crude, stark farce type of humor or movies like ""Meet the Fockers"" or ""American Pie"" (which, don't get me wrong, do have their own place) wouldn't like the humor of The Life Aquatic. This is not a movie that you burst out laughing at every scene, but more of a movie that you just want to smile at and chuckle at the entire time. You don't need a sophisticated sense of humor, as some people claim, you just need to accept the movie for what it is. The movie is about a Oceanographer stumbling through life in the shadow of former success. The cinematography, music, subtitles, etc. all mirror this perfectly. The entire cast plays their parts beautifully. Bill Murray is Steve Zissou, not Bill Murray playing Zissou. Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe and Cate Blanchett all work perfectly off of Murray. Situations are awkward and clumsy, like real life, not like drawn out and overdone dramas that come out at least once a month. The Life Aquatic is beautifully imperfect, and should not be any other way. The last scenes completely top off the movie, but I won't spoil it for anyone as it is well worth seeing. I've seen the movie multiple times and probably will again, and recommend that everyone see it at least once.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

The only reason I even rented this was because Bill Murray was in it and honestly I want the 2 hours of my life back. I would rather watch a dog take a crap than watch this movie again. Trust me...Steer clear of this one. If you want to see Bill Murray be funny than watch Caddyshack. If you want to see Mathew Gray Grubler than watch R.V. or better yet Criminal Minds.

I've seen a lot of weird movies in my day, but this manages to outweird them.Having said that, I loved this movie. Of course, it's not for everybody. It has a very strange sense of humor about it. I think if you like and are familiar with Wes Anderson, you will enjoy this movie.It's a lot darker than Anderson's other movies. Although it doesn't really seem that way unless you really think about it. You kind of just accept the bizarre things as they happen. A lot of tragic and horrifying things happen to the members of Team Zissou and the rival boat belonging to Captain Hennesey (Jeff Goldblum). But the tragedy is masked by the utter preposterousness of the entire situation.The characters are very weird, but at the same time very realistic. They react to things the way real people do. Usually in a comedy when someone makes a joke at someone else's expense, the audience laughs about it but the person insulted doesn't seem to notice. The characters in this movie get their feelings hurt and cry. It's very funny when these things happen, and perhaps it is for this reason that this movie is so funny. In the midst of the very bizarre, there is a realism to the characters that we don't really expect.I really didn't know what to make of this movie on my first viewing--it's that weird, but the second time I saw it I was able to enjoy it more.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an engaged story with interesting environments, characters, moods, and music. This is a visual and audio treat that we would only be so lucky to be treated to more often. Although the plot progression can at times seem deceptively slow, the audience soon finds themselves identifying and caring about the diverse cast of characters (and animals).

Even if you were disappointed(expectations were very high for this film), we as moviegoers need to applaud the efforts of directors like Wes Anderson, Michel Gondry and Spike Jonze, that make going to the theaters fun again. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I urge you to do so.. and if you've only seen the movie once, I urge you to keep your shortsighted opinions to yourself.

Perhaps they changed the real film with a gag film in the projector during the screening of the film I went to. But I believe ""The Life Aquatic"" has to be one of the single worse films I have ever put myself through.It's bad on so many different levels. As a comedy, the film holds barely anything that could be found as ""funny"", and scenes with humor quickly died and faded away. From a drama/emotional level, the movie left me feeling flat, bored, and uninterested.As for the entire wildlife being animated, and looking fake, it just didn't work at all for me, and seemed cheap and just plan stupid. The only person in the cast that I found remotely interesting was Willem Dafoe.

Steve Zissou is a helpless shell of a man living in the shadow of his former glory as much by the end of the film as he is in the first scene.That's not to say that there were a lot of great laughs throughout the film, but the third act is just depressing.Even more depressing are some of the reviews here. One person complained about Owen Wilson's frequent appearances in Wes Anderson's movies. Anderson and Wilson keep working together because they were friends before they became famous. They co-wrote Anderson's first three movies together. If you browse IMDb enough, you'd have figured that out years ago. One reviewer felt that ""Aquatic"" was a rehash of all of Anderson's other screenplays, but as I said before, there is one crucial difference: the characters still have gaping holes in their souls by the end of this film, whereas there is profound healing at the end of ""Rushmore"" and ""Tenenbaums.""

First off, you have to appreciate Wes Anderson films and similar movies. This is his best by far. It has the humor, wit, and charm characteristic to his films, and then adds a certain magic. The sugar crabs, the electric jellyfish, Seu Jorge's guitar solo's. The way these seemingly random aspects go together is awesome. Bill Murray is great in his familiar role of dry old guy (don't fix it if it ain't broke). Owen Wilson is decent as the naive country boy. Another notable character is Kate Blanchet as the reporter. She does a great job as a driven/confused/earnest reporter. I love the photography and the camera angles. It's almost as if you were watching a cartoon/documentary.

The song when they go to the Ping Islands is a really good electronic song by Mark Mothersbough, and the second I heard it I knew I had to download it. So when I got back from the movie, I downloaded the whole soundtrack. Seau Jorge doing David Bowie songs is a plus too. Another thing I noticed about this movie is that me and my friends were the only ones to laugh during the entire movie. It was ridiculous how many people were in the theater compared to how much laughing came out of them, which was none.

Wes is amazing, his film techniques are so ""sturges-esque"" he uses the camera not only to tell a story but to draw the viewer in and to once again channel the film makers of the past (ie:Sturges, Fellini) he can't be matched. And as for him retreating his usual film style, you guys are Crazy. If that wasn't a Wes film i don't know what is. Now Bill Murray's performance is genuine gold. Some other performances that were also terrific were Cate Blanchet(sp?), Wilem Dafoe, and Owen Wilson. Not to mention the most refreshing performance by a certain Jeff Goldblume. Who expected him to play a perfect Prick? well if you are a Wes ANDERSON fan i strongly suggest you see this film because it's his take on all those old action adventure films of the past.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
520,mika-i,What a waste of time...,1,15 May 2005,"I never take the time to comment a movie after watching it. But this one really deserves a shout from me. First, I don't understand how this movie was rated so high by other IMDb reviewers.What on earth was that!?! I don't remember watching a movie as bad as this one. It was long, boring and completely empty of comical elements. Only once I was tempted to smile. But just because a particular scene reminded me of another film (One that was actually funny). To make things worst, the musical score is awful. Somehow, they found a way to make good songs sound bad.This film is supposed to be a comedy but even the cast looks bored to death. How could someone like Bill Murray go from ""Saturday Night Live"" to this poor film...?",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
521,gdhobgen,An empty effort,1,25 January 2005,"Nothing in the character of Steve was likable. Why would we care about his character? He was self-centered and shallow. It seemed to me that almost all involved took the opportunity to live high in an exotic place, phone in their lines, and suffer as the writers(s) made up a story as they went along. Cate Blanchett was the only one who knew what she was doing. The amateurish gunfights were terrible. And what was the point of the guitarist/singer? Willem Defoe was wasted, Jeff Goldblum was wasted.Was this a comedy? Where were the laughs? Was it a drama?

522,jdbazooka,Big Disappointment,2,10 December 2004,"I've loved all of Wes Anderson's films, so I was greatly disappointed to find that Zissou is a flat, messy, and often boring movie. Going for it is Anderson's meticulous cinematography and inspired casting, but the frames are rendered pointless by the flaccid plot and all the talent seems wasted in two-dimensional characters. Even Bill Murry, who I love and think has had a phenomenal run of dramatic roles, seems to be walking sluggishly through this part, as though he's still pouting over that Best Actor Oscar he didn't win last year. Worse still, some of Anderson's production trademarks (such as a clever soundtrack) come off somewhat forced and cloying here.I really wish it wasn't so. There are a lot of great elements in Zissou that could have made it a great movie--but Anderson is not able to bring them together. Perhaps it was all the filming at sea that made for an unwieldy production or maybe it was Owen Wilson's absence from the writing credits, but Zissou is definitely missing that genius glue that kept the hefty chapters of The Royal Tenenbaums stuck to the binding.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

My wife fell asleep, and I keep waiting. Only to have the movie end after 2 hours, with nothing to show for it. There were absolutely no redeeming qualities in this movie. Try it for your self, give it 30 minutes and if you haven't liked it yet, you won't--it doesn't get any better. I can hardly even post this comment, because I need to write ten lines, but there's really nothing else to say beside what a boring flop this movie was.

524,gunknifebattleyo,absolutely brilliant,10,11 December 2004,"this movie was everything i had hoped it would be in terms of wes anderson quirky humour/dialogue and imaginative, often fantastical stylization. the performances are all wonderful, perhaps with the exception of a somewhat lackluster noah wiley, who i expected i lot from after seeing his Australian films. bill murray as usual makes even the lines that aren't necessarily meant to be funny, funny, just with his affectations and expressions. owen Wilson's character didn't really have the opportunity to be as funny as you've seen him in other movies, as he doesn't play the rowdy freewheeler, but rather a really sweet and endearing role. regardless, this movie was absolutely hilarious. the audience, which admittedly was mostly a young and hip new york audience, was laughing throughout. more than that, nearly all the people i looked over at times had wide, involuntary smiles on their faces. this movie just makes you smile. i must also say that willem dafoe nearly stole the film with his performance. he was wonderful, and surprising, as i've never seen him be funny in a movie. jeff goldblum is also most perfect and hilarious for the classic role he often plays. my favorite thing about wes anderson movies is always the hyper-stylization and the aesthetic quirkiness and the incredible attention to detail. objects he places in rooms even just in passing shots often give a great laugh. he uses stylization to the max here. this movie is definitely the most fantasy-laden of wes anderson's movies, though i won't give away why. the review before this which gives it a huge thumbs down and says its only merit is the CGI really, really scares me. i understand it's a matter of taste regarding the sometimes subtle and self-aware humour, but this movie is just so well executed. more than anything, this movie is enchanting. the nature of the sort of parallel universe that it takes place in, where oceanographers can live lifestyles like this, makes you want to give up the real world and go wherever they are. as a final note, the soundtrack is once again awesome. though the music is used much differently than in anderson's prior films, and it is more of a score with theme songs, the creative way in which much of the music is used in the movie is brilliant and fitting. this is one of the funniest, warmest and most enchanting movies i've seen in a very long time.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
525,scottliker1,The Emperor has NO clothes...(AKA) Still waiting for the funny part,2,23 June 2005,"I am stunned by how bad this film was. Let me first state that I LOVE Bill Murray, and I have enjoyed every other Owen Wilson movie. But this? how disappointing! I was told by a friend of mine who saw it at the theatre, that it was a ""terrible movie."" Well, being that his idea of funny and mine are different (and the fact that my wife has the hot's for Owen Wilson) I figured I would rent the DVD. Well, I should have listened to my friend. I kept waiting for something funny to happen. It was so bad that my wife got up about 1 hour into the show and went to bed (rare). I stuck it out until the end, and must admit regret for losing sleep.**********Possible Spoiler***************** Was Ned's character Zissou's son or not? This movie goes back and forth having you believe he was and that he wasn't (the letter etc..) and then gives you no resolution of the matter. Apparently is doesn't matter, as Ned dies as a matter of course.I get subtle and dry comedy (and love movies that some people shake their heads at), but this movie left me shaking my head. The CGI was painfully fake ( Other commented that this is the director's signature and that it is funny?) The humor was lost on me. I thought that the reason for the crappy effects was that perhaps someone with a brain in Hollywood (I'm guessing their has to be at least one), saw some of the footage and decided to reduce their funding for CGI and cut their losses on this bomb.Maybe this is one big inside joke for Hollywood types (eg. the company stooge etc..) I for one found it unimaginative with the exception of the cutaway ship scenes (which at first were hard to put into context). If you like to sit around the coffee house and debate the merit of art house films with your friends from MENSA, then this film will give you hours of entertainment. If however, you would prefer to be entertained (while using your brain) you can join my club (people with a high enough IQ to know when the Emperor has no clothes).",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
526,gill-140,Take it easy and just enjoy the movie,10,26 January 2005,"Just as he did with Bottlerocket, Rushmore, and The Royal Tannenbaums, Wes Anderson sets the bar so high that he can't possibly reach it. But that's okay because he is setting himself up NOT for a failure, but for a standard that mocks most movies.Basically, I just want to say that you need to take his movies with a grain of salt. Holistically, this movie is hilarious. You won't be laughing the entire time (though I was), but I don't think you're supposed to.If you like martini-dry humor (e.g. Bill Murray), you will love this movie. If you are looking for punchlines that are set up by predictable jokes, you won't...",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
527,hugh-71,Anderson's 2nd Classic,10,29 December 2004,"My first Wes Anderson film was Rushmore. I saw it when it was first released on video, but I was a little too young at the time to appreciate Anderson's dry sense of humor. When I gave the film another shot earlier this year, my jaw dropped. I fell in love with his directing style, and now consider it to be one of my favorite movies. I mean, I even bought the pricey special edition of it. I don't do that unless I really like a movie.I enjoyed Bottle Rocket and The Royal Tenenbaums, but to a slightly lesser degree. I had high hopes for Anderson's latest, The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. It is his 3rd film with Bill Murray, and his 1st with new script partner Noah Baumbach (Kicking & Screaming). Murray is on a hot streak, so I figured I had nothing to worry about. Then, the press came out.I am stunned by the press reaction to this film. Most critics have panned it, and even some of Wes Anderson's fanbase has expressed some disappointment. You'd think that such an imaginative director like Wes would be shown some respect, but I guess not. So, as you can guess, I was a little nervous before seeing this. Luckily, I am here to assure those who have yet to see this film, that you have nothing to worry about.Murray gives another great performance. He continues to expand his acting range, and is full of surprises. His character, Steve Zissou, an aging oceanographer, is grieving over the loss of his best friend Esteban (Seymour Cassel), who was eaten by a Jaguar Shark on an exploration. Zissou sets out for revenge on the rare shark with his crew, Team Zissou.Steve has another problem. Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), a child one of his old flames had, shows up to meet dad. Zissou knew of Ned, but never sought him out. The two develop a bond, and although it isn't officially proved that he is Steve's son, Ned becomes part of the crew. Wilson gives what might be his most honest performance to date. Willem Dafoe is hilarious as Klaus, another member of the crew, who becomes jealous of Ned's relationship with Steve. Dafoe has some truly great scenes.Anjelica Huston, another veteran of Anderson's films, plays Zissou's somewhat estranged wife, Eleanor. Huston is such a great actress, and she pretty much has the bitter wife role down pat. Cate Blanchett comes aboard as Jane Winslett-Richardson, a reporter doing a piece on Steve. Let's just say, I fell in love with her in this movie, and you will too.Filmed throughout Italy, the scenery is beautiful. The fact that Wes built half of a ship (The Belafonte) to house Team Zissou gives you an idea of how epic this flick really is. Some have criticized him for how detailed his direction is, but that is why I love his work so much. The script that he has crafted with Baumbach is full of twists, one-liners, and all sorts of emotion. The music isn't a letdown either. Honestly, does it get any cooler than watching Bill Murray shoot pirates in a speedo while ""Search & Destroy"" by The Stooges is playing in the background? I think not.Also worth mentioning are the excellent stop-motion animation scenes that feature the various sea creatures that Team Zissou encounter. They are luminous. This isn't a movie that will be widely embraced at first, but I think it is going to develop a huge cult audience down the road. I feel fully confident in saying that The Life Aquatic smokes Bottle Rocket and The Royal Tenenbaums. It is too early to compare it to Rushmore, but it is safe to say that Anderson has produced his 2nd classic.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
528,dgcarson-7,Enjoyable,8,2 July 2007,"Firstly, I'll start this off by saying that I was less than thrilled to see this movie. I'd heard some bad reviews about the story and acting, but good reviews about the directing and art direction. I watched this with all of those in mind.Big mistake. I was more than pleasantly surprised for the most part. The camera work is superb. The mise-en-scene (setting with art, costumes, sets, camera, etc.) is sublime. Those two things alone make the movie all worth while.However, while I did enjoy the film, I was fairly disappointed by some of it. Firstly, the writing seemed a little off. Some of the humor came out a little forced, or it didn't come out at all. That's not to say that there weren't moments that made me laugh out loud, just not as many as I'd have liked, or not as many as I think the writers wanted. Also, some of the acting wasn't all that great. Owen Wilson's character gets kind of annoying after about ten minutes, but Bill Murray's really funny performance keeps you watching.Having said that, I'd like to point out that even the things I outlined above as ""disappointments"" don't even make me dislike this movie. The only thing that disappointed me noticeably was the ending. Without giving any specifics away, I for one felt sort of cheated by the end. I'll let you decide that for yourself, but I for one didn't care for it.With all of those things being said, I did enjoy ""The Life Aquatic,"" though not as much as I'd have liked to have. I had really high hopes, I guess.If you've never seen Wes Anderson films, I wouldn't suggest this to be the first you see. It might turn you away from him. Start with ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" If you enjoy that one, then you might want to give this one a try.8/10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
529,JWinterTR,cathartic and surprising,8,5 January 2005,"Anderson definitely dropped the ball with a majority of critics. But some critics, a lot of casual viewers, and of course the dependable die-hards, see something in this movie? What exactly? I want to throw in my two cents in favor of Anderson's latest. Most people talk about Anderson's fondness and gift for visual ingenuity or fondness and an apt use of 70s Brit Invasion at its finest. I want to recommend this movie because of its delicate orchestration of themes and tensions.Let me start with a particularly mean-spirited quote from a rather shallow review to illustrate what has been bothering me about the critic's response to this movie: ""Whatever the reason, The Life Aquatic is Anderson's least interesting film, and should serve as a demonstration of the vapidity of his so-called brilliance: cynical, worthless, arrogant showboating that prizes false cleverness over story and content, and mocks the audience along with the characters. With the spotlight shining on him brighter than ever, Anderson proves to be nothing more than a desperate pretender in auteur's clothing."" -Josh Bell, from, eh, Las Vegas Weekly Call me crazy but I came away with a totally different impression of The Life Aquatic. I found it Anderson's most thought-provoking piece yet. The Jaguar Shark, for example, (humor me with this invited, if pretentious, Moby Dick reference) is as implicitly symbolic as the white whale is explicitly. There's plenty of interesting hints scattered throughout the movie of what exactly the Jaguar Shark represents: a fanciful, absurd, and surreal imaginative reality of Melies-like proportions, a swimming embodiment of the sea as the mother of death as the mother of beauty, an adventurous encounter with death or an indifferent and alien external environment, an exploration of the unknown, the unknowable, a confrontation and coming to terms with the aggression of a hostile oedipal father, an introjection of an adolescent state filled with storybook simplicity and fairytale innocence. Steve's encounter with the shark is a cathartic vindication of Steve's fanciful reality, a redemptive, sublime attainment of success and dignity through failure or despite failure, I can't decide which.So I have to say negative critics be damned. I walked away from the Life Aquatic not only entertained and moved but stimulated as well.PS:And if you still don't think Anderson makes pictures that are interesting beyond his visual style or sense of deadpan comic timing and slapstick, here are two more specific instances of thought-provoking things I picked up one my second viewing.The carthartic and surprising use of Bowie's ""Life on Mars"" has lyrics that complement the picture perfectly. And not just on a literal level (e.g., ""She's hooked to the silver screen... sailors fighting in the dance hall"", or here's self-deprecating reference to the compulsively fashioned and artificial quality to the Anderson image, ""But the film is a saddening bore 'Cause I wrote it ten times or more"" ) but the song gets at the tongue-in-cheek playfulness/deep investment at the heart of Anderson's knowing boredom/fascination with the fantasy of movie genres and conventions. Bowie's climactic ""SAILOR'S FIGHTING IN THE DANCE HALL! OH MAN WONDER LOOK AT THOSE CAVEMAN GO! It's the FREAKIEST SHOW!"" is a bleating outburst both of exasperation with classic Hollywood cinema and a slightly perverse and guilty or unembarrassed love of that cinema.or Look into the fact that Steve Zissou's ""Not this one, Klaus"" is lifted from Traffaut's ""Jules et Jim.""",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Steve Zissou (head and founder of the Zissou Society) and his crew of ""strays"" and his possible son are met with all kinds of misfortune and personal strife. Although the similarities with TENENBAUMS are strong, there are many differences that are important to note to the person that didn't like TENENBAUMS. LIFE is much more based on the humor than TENENBAUMS was and has a story that appeals to a much wider audience than TENENBAUMS.

536,bdl218,A Notch Down for Wes,7,13 November 2004,"I saw this film last week at a screening. I'd been really excited to see it for two or three months, but the film fell a little bit short for me. That's not to say that this is an awful or bad film in any way. It's just a notch below Tenenbaums and Rushmore. Wes has included a little too many scenes that don't really hold a dramatic purpose or function and just seem to set stuff up. Remember the first shots in Tenenbaums that told about the family? There's a ton more of that style of exposition. The story isn't bad or clichéd though, it's the same unconventional Wes Anderson-Shakespearian styled comedy. The soundtrack to the film that is bound to either win or repel film viewers. It's mainly David Bowie songs done in Portugese. I didn't like it, mainly because I was expecting a wider array of music like in his previous films. Also, there's no Kumar. But once again, don't get the impression this film is bad. Life Aquatic is quirky, good spirited and sweet. Bill Murray finally gets to be an action hero. Wes sets up some really unusual relationships too. And let's not forget the sea life, or stop-motion, which is really fascinating because it has never really been used like this in a film before. Go see this film when it comes out but don't expect another landmark film, just expect a pretty good one.My bet though is that Wes Anderson is going to win a lot of fans with this, despite a few flaws in the film, because Life Aquatic is more commercial than previous work. I'm glad because he's the best young screenwriter directors out there.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

He has been in all of Wes Anderson's movies up to this point and I was really disappointed that he wasn't in The Life Aquatic. My guess is maybe because Spielberg casted him in The Terminal that there was a conflict in Kumar's schedule. In The Terminal he actually had a large supporting role, he was the maintenance man who liked to leave the floor wet and watch people slip on it. In Tennenbaums he was Pagota, Royal's right hand man. In Bottlerocket he was the crew for the heist. For me as a huge fan of all the Wes Anderson movies, he is a signature element for all the films, and I bet it's all Spielberg's fault that he wasn't in this film.

As a matter of fact, no one understood a word that Owen Wilson said, Jeff Goldblum made no sense, and I was reminded of why Genna Davis left him; quote, ""The reason that he is such a great actor is that he never had a thought of his own"", and he proved that fact at the screening.

Steve Zissou(Murray) is one of the most lovable, strange, and thoroughly interesting characters I have ever encountered.

There's no doubt about Bill Murray's genius, and I laughed out loud quite a few times, but I'm not so excited about this story. It didn't seem to go anywhere interesting, and things weren't connecting. I'm sort of feeling as though there was too much talent up on that screen and too much going on, and the vision suffered. Maybe I expect more of Wes because, to me, Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums were two of the greatest films ever made. I will probably see The Life Aquatic again, to make sure I didn't miss something. Maybe I'll like it a little more after a second take. I did think Cate Blanchett did a great job and was gorgeous.

It had essentially the same humor (you can tell, however, that Owen Wilson was not involved in the writing process), and it did have points that really got your emotions running, but there was just something different about this picture in comparison to Wes Anderson's other three films. I think he might have tried to go back and make this film like he did Bottle Rocket: A free-flowing, carefree ride with no real destination. If you are looking for another Royal Tenenbaums or Rushmore, you will be disappointed. Go into this movie as if you were watching Bottle Rocket again. Just go with it. As far as visuals, it has the same Anderson feel that you have come to love. He really makes the most of the fact that there is nothing much but ocean. In this sense, it really compares to the vast landscapes of Bottle Rocket. The clothing is once again beautiful and hilarious at the same time. The most enchanting visuals of all have to be the clay-animated sea life, however. The nostalgia brought forth from that is wonderful.The plot and character development is like Bottle Rocket. There really isn't any. But, that's almost a good thing, as that's really not the focus (in my opinion). The soundtrack,mainly by David Bowie (Fear not, Mark Mothersbaugh is present as well), is phenomenal, especially if you're a David bowie fan.So in conclusion, go into it like you would Bottle Rocket, and you'll love it.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
545,caleisure,Not my cup of tea,1,23 December 2004,"I'm an Owen Wilson Fan. I'm a Jeff Goldblum fan. I am certainly a fan of Angelica Huston, and I've always considered myself to be a fan of Bill Murray. But I hated this movie. I will give you ""art is in the eye of the beholder,"" but this beholder saw no art. Jokes were lame. Violence was gratuitous. Cinematography was mediocre, at best. The talents of many people were wasted in this movie. I'm no prude, but using f-words instead of ""a,"" ""an,"" and ""the"" really doesn't call for an Academy Award, as far as I am concerned.Was Bill Murray funny? I don't know. I didn't laugh. I sat there with a puzzled look on my face for a long, long time. Were there any redeeming moments? Sure, but they were fleeting, and most of them happened when Owen Wilson and Kate Winslet were on the screen. All-in-all, I wouldn't spend good money to see this film--and I didn't. Tickets were complimentary because my husband is a SCUBA instructor. However, this film had about as much to do with SCUBA as it did with humor.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
546,grouchymom2,What a disappointment,1,24 December 2004,"Although this movie has some great computer generated effects and nice colors the flattery ends there. Bill Murray would have done well to make a ""groundhog"" sequel and skip this embarrassment. Believe me the trailers were the best part of the movie and that is sad. I wasn't expecting ""gone with the wind"" but this was the penultimate waste of film. I understand that most BIll Murray movies are not great classic works of art but they were funny. This seemed like a combination of Jacques Cousteau meets James Bond and Bozoo the clown and All 3 were heavily sedated. And none were funny. Maybe the Grinch stole the humor out of this movie just for a special Christmas treat.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
547,erik1202,Wes be rocking it,10,26 December 2004,"Huge fan of Mr. Anderson's previous fare and this one was not a letdown. So very odd and so very clever. I have to admit that I will be returning to watch this again in the next few days. It is a deep movie that definitely takes some understanding, but it is absolutely an entertaining film, nonetheless. The humor is once again classic with Bill Murray turning in another stellar performance. All in all, it sort of reminds me of a play that Max Fischer would put on with lots of nonsensical plot lines coming together to make you laugh and cry. Always a production. I look forward to viewing it again and paying even greater attention to the detail that all Wes Anderson's movies provide. Saw it in a packed theater here in Oregon and nobody left. There weren't as many laughs as there could have been, but nobody walked out. Can't wait for what's next.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
548,higgy2001,The worst of all time??,1,26 December 2004,"I have seen some really bad movies in my life, and I am generally a ""good grader"", and perhaps I am being way to fair again if I give this movie a big fat ""F""!!!, but this one was the worst of all time!!!! I actually took the time to read all of the glowing reviews just to make sure I didn't miss something, I Did Not Miss Anything! The people that liked this movie are trying to defend either Bill Murray, Wes Anderson or both for no reason other than they had expectations going in, as did I, that this would be a grat movie given the cast and direction. It failed on all levels, plain and simple. Okay before you loyalists get all crazy, keep in mind that I really like Owen and Bill and some of the cast (Willem does a good job) and Wes is always worth a watch however, the collection does not work here. Get over it Wes fans, everybody puts out a loser every now and then. This ""artsy"" piece (aka ""not funny"") had a lot of ground to gain from the very beginning. The details, which are Wes' trademark, are hard to get to being weighed down by the lack of plot..the actual plot was a sub-sub-plot at best. I actually felt so strongly about how bad this movie is, I took the time to register on the IMDb website just to make this post. I consider myself a fairly sophisticated moviegoer, educated, and I have a great sense of humor. With that said, this movie ranks as one of the worst movies of all time.Final Note: Of all of the serious flaws this movie has, the biggest problem was in the marketing. It is being sold to the public as a Bill Murray comedy. It is clearly not a comedy. Bill Murray, with all of his great talent and powers, could not save this flick...it's okay though because God couldn't save this one.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
549,jason-bell,Wes Anderson's Chrismas Present,10,26 December 2004,"This is a Christmas Movie! It's clear that Wes Anderson understands the meaning of Jesus a lot better than Mel Gibson does. Owen Wilson ('King'sley) is Jesus. But check out Bill Murray at the end, with his Santa Claus hat on, walking with Klaus (as in, Santa Claus), giving a present, and saying ""Ho."" Christmas has been a theme with Anderson--the theme of sacrifice and redemption is shared with ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" (a slight deviation from ""Tannenbaum,"" of course). The best I can figure, WE are the leopard shark that Zissou is seeking. Murray is wrathful towards it at the beginning, but after the sacrifice of his Son, he becomes reconciled with it.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
550,geographer,A Masterpiece,9,26 December 2004,"This is a masterpiece. I haven't seen the rest of Wes Anderson's movies, but this one displays an unusually mature perspective for an American film. Death, love, and parenthood are observed without sentimentality or sensationalism. The overall effect would not be seen as strange by Petronius, Montaigne, Henry Miller, or scores of other masters of the picaresque and tragicomic in literature. Like a number of other recent movies (Team America, Troy) this gives me hope for the maturing of the American film audience -- assuming, of course, that they turn out to see this movie in numbers.The target audience is probably 50 somethings, but my 20 something son enjoyed it immensely as well. Everything is of a piece: the beautiful cinematography, the engaging music (David Bowie in Portuguese plus techno), the acting, and the mood. Don't go to this expecting slapstick comedy or orthodox drama. Do expect to be outrageously entertained by a director who does not look down on you.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
551,Halfbakedpotato,Facts about The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,8,26 December 2004,"1.) It's a Wes Anderson film, but it varies from his previous efforts. The style is the same, but his budget is bigger.2.) Bill Murray plays Steve Zissou, a famous oceanographer past his prime. He is bitter about his past being over, and Murray plays to that subtlety.3.) People who are not fans of Anderson's trademark emphasis on character over plot and finicky camera movements need not apply.4.) People who are fans of the above-mentioned with still not be able to come to agreement.5.) Anderson is isolating a lot of his audience by tackling the realism and fakeness of film as a main theme.5a.) In one key scene, Owen Wilson's character Ned, who might be Bill Murray's son, asks ""Steve, can I call you Dad in this scene?"" Murray says, ""No, I don't think your character is there yet.""5b.) In a later key scene, a helicopter crashes and blood smatters the camera, which dips periodically to the water level, where we see that the water is red.6.) The characters, like most Wes Anderson characters, are very subdued, and contain their emotions, barely registering facial expressions and never changing tone of voice.7.) I, for one, enjoyed it.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
552,SteveZissou,VISIONARY Film-making,10,27 December 2004,"A masterpiece. Complete in every regard. I was captivated from the first scene. This was the best movie I have seen in a long time.I can't wait to see it again. Seriously. There is a real depth to the humor. I think a second or third viewing is necessary to catch all that is there.The sets and costumes were incredible, the music was perfect, performances were spot-on. Wes Anderson's attention to detail in this film is mind boggling. Bill Murray is his usual brilliant self. Will DaFoe was incredible. Whoever cast this movie is a genius, although I assume Wes Anderson wrote with most of these performers in mind.Where can I apply to be a member of the Zissou Society?GO SEE THIS MOVIE TODAY!!!P.S.

553,karljeffery,"fantastic, but i cant explain why",10,27 December 2004,"I have watched so many films over the years - i always see the latest blockbusters, and i even try to catch the best of all the indie stuff too, but i have never been drawn to make a comment on a film before, but this film really made an impact - to start with i wasn't too impressed, probably because of the ad campaign which seemed to focus on the stars and the (what turned out to be very limited) cgi, but i can see now why such people as Angelica Houston and Bill Murray decided to star - this is a film that is about a STORY - not the normal linear story, but more of an interpretation of the process of documentary film- making in the 60's and 70's that i hope must of us were lucky enough to grow up with, combined with a style of film-making that doesn't seem to have any place in the public consciecness in the naughty-oughtys! after reading back what i have just written, its obvious i cant convey the reason why this film is worth watching, but give it a go, open your mind, and try to forget all the clichés that you would expect from a Hollywood film.......",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
554,grantt-2,Slow Starting,10,27 December 2004,"I thought Life Aquatic was very slow starting, but I was not surprised because often Anderson's films are slow. Throughout the movie, however, I felt it really picked up and a few classic scenes (ie the rescue mission) made the movie one of the most entertaining and hilarious features I've ever seen. Bill Murray of course does a wonderful job, and I think this may be Owen Wilson's best film for the simple fact that he isn't exactly the same as every other character he's ever played. Really, all the actors did a wonderful job. Not so sure I cared for the topless girl though. I think she was only in the movie to give it an 'R' rating, and then once she did what was necessary, they got rid of her. In that alone was I disappointed. I'd highly recommend this movie. If you even remotely liked Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, or The Royal Tennenbaums then you should love this flick.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
555,bfrisch-1,Its not to late to consider going to some movie you though might suck,1,28 December 2004,"After a lot of trailer watching online, my fiancé and I settled on ""Life Aquatic"" as our choice for a movie on the holiday weekend....We got our coats, gloves, boots and headed out into a mild snowstorm to make our way to the theater. We chose this movie over ""The Fockers, The Flight of the Phoenix, Closer"".....The basis for this decision you ask? Well, we hadn't heard much good about the Fockers, and neither of us had cared a lot for ""Meet the Parents"". Unsure what the true premise of the airplane crash in the dessert movie was all about, and the fact that we both normally liked Bill Murray, we'd give that one a go. Not to mention that the trailer looked funny. (Neither of us care for Owen Wilson I might add...) Well after braving traffic to the local mall, and waiting in line for our tickets, we decided to go inside and waste even more money on the overpriced popcorn and soda's. (Had we only known...we could have just gave the money to the little guy with the red pot and the bell outside and felt like we'd done something good for someones life...) So there we were, the previews,(easily the best part of the upcoming show, so if you decide to see this one, pay good attention at this point of the movie....), now the start of the movie.....Wait, this is looking really boring already.... A movie where we are watching people watch a movie? This looks sad right from start....... Okay, now they are asking post screening questions.... OMG, there is the one about killing the jaguar shark for revenge.....WOW, not nearly as funny as it was in the trailer.....I can see where this is headed....south and quick.Another 30 minutes and I'm telling myself and my fiancé, (whom I have to keep poking to make sure she's even breathing), that its got to get better and funnier at some point......We finally look at each other and decide to jump this sinking ship, (I notice as we excuse ourselves, that the people remaining in the theater all seem comatose...), and see if there is anything else playing in an attempt to redeem our loss of dead presidents.Low and behold, ""Flight of the Phoenix"" is in preview stage.....We've made our choice and head in. Even the previews are better, things are looking up......Two hours later, we find ourselves on the way out of the theater, poking fun at the morons heading into ""Life Aquatic"". We laugh the rest of the night, realizing that had we not decided to jump to a different show, we might both have needed to jump from the upper seats hopefully to our death by the end of the horrible Aquatic movie.So much for going to a movie based on the cast.........",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
556,livwicca,The Wretched Life Aquatic,1,28 December 2004,"I have to start by saying I don't know who Wes Anderson is (though I did endure the Royal Tenenbaums-- and wished I hadn't), so I can't say I am a ""fan"" like all the rest of these reviewers. I am just an average, avid movie-going ""Jane"" like so many of the rest of us. As such, I can honestly say----save your money! You know what the redeeming quality is of ""Life Aquatic""? That 40 minutes into it--The Flight of the Phoenix was starting in a theater nearby. I gave Life Aquatic 40 minutes, hoping beyond all hope that it was going to get better, but IT NEVER DID. Bill Murray deserves public scorn, better yet--- stoning, for signing on for such crap..... if there was humor to be had---it was thinly veiled with bad acting, worse cinematography, and marijuana references. I couldn't force a smile, yet alone a laugh! The cartoon-like fish and cut-to shots that made no sense did not redeem the lack of story line. The music was worse than wisdom teeth removal, which I would much prefer to sitting through even five more minutes of the Life Aquatic. Angelica Huston looked like an out-of-shape, under-glamorized nightmare! What happened to theater make-up...couldn't they doctor her up better than that? Don't expect a story line, good acting (in spite of it's name-brand, washed-up cast of has-beens), good music, or something that even makes sense...apparently to anyone not a Wes Anderson fan. I hope to never see such a tragic disaster as the Life Aquatic in my life.....the movies are too expensive for such a hyped piece of trash!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
557,stephan-strohmayer,Different... but nothing special.,5,28 December 2004,"Well. I wont say I liked it.. but it was certainly different. Several scenes (like the cut-boat-intro) were quite cute, but I don't think I would go blemish my reputation for good movie recommendations with this one, and I doubt i would see it again.Story line was certainly a bit flat and all over the place. A constant nag in the back of my head for the first 20 minutes of the film was 'Who the heck are all these people and what the hell is Zissou?Bill Murray is seriously type cast. I don't enjoy his films anymore. Not to mention.. I cant get my head around how much Owen Wilson looks like Paris Hilton :-)",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
558,solvertoo,What was the plot again?,1,28 December 2004,"Hmm, after seeing this movie because of it's all star cast, I couldn't help but question the worth of the plot. The over intellectualized jokes and excessive dry humor were very abrasive for the 118 minutes of torture that we endured in watching this film. I think that the biggest problem with this movie was that the dialogue and story were to blah for the length, and had no real interesting substance to really draw the audience in move us to want to discover what was awaiting. Instead we had total predictability of each scene. Jokes flew way over all of our heads, or fell far beneath our feet. These past few months have been a real disappointment to me for watching movies, as a very big chunk of them have fallen way below viewing standards. One must ask themselves who in the hell is approving these floppy stories and giving them the green lights.

559,soniceardeath,Disappointed.,3,28 December 2004,"Life Aquatic does offer a good and diverse cast and the imagery in which the story is told is very pleasing. The actors do a good job, but its the actualization of the story (or lack of) that makes this film a complete disappointment. The many downsides to this film are that the plot struggles with pacing problems, in that the slow parts are strangely interrupted with action that seems to come out of nowhere and vice versa. Therefore the story becomes sporadic and at times, sluggish. There are many quirks that develop within and between the characters that are never fully explained or carried out to any sort of conclusion. The story itself has many subplots that go on unexplained, ultimately losing the audience. In the end, nothing is gained or realized to the potential in which it could have been. And the usage of a Sigur Ros song towards the end of the film is extremely out of place. In conclusion, Life Aquatic is Wes Anderson being TOO Wes Anderson. His trademark humor is almost too obvious and blatant. This film had so much potential, but it was all squandered away in its pitfalls. Anderson should stick to writing with Owen Wilson, that really seemed to work. I am a big fan of Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, and Royal Tenenbaums, but The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou completely falls short of my expectations.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
560,kateger,See it if you really love the craft.,6,29 December 2004,"Having read rather disappointing reviews of The Life Aquatic of Steve Zissou, I knew not to expect a conventional comedy with a compelling plot, and I tried to suppress my inevitably high expectations of my favorite director. I did, however, look forward to Anderson's typical complex character development/motivation and a determined camera.I, too, was disappointed. The writing was erudite and sharp, and yet the characters who delivered it lacked depth. While Cate Blanchett's character Jane shared Miss Cross' and Margot's unintentionally alluring ""F- you"" demeanor (and encompassed it with her own ""F- you's"" in the film), the characters who lusted after her did so arbitrarily and stoically. Anjelica Huston as Eleanor Zissou was, sadly, underutilized. Often alluded to as the brains behind the Zissou missions, Huston's Eleanor was given at most two lines to confirm it. As for Bill Murray as Steve Zissou, there is no doubt that he is The actor of actors, and any film that sets out to use him to his full potential is under the scrutiny of international audiences. It was very frustrating to watch Murray in such a vacuous, unredeemed role; he is better than this.The cinematography and special effects are whimsically timeless and theatrical, true to Anderson's emerging ""style."" One of Anderson's technical strengths, which must come at the expense of his actors' patience, is his long, uncut shots, sometimes tracking/crane. With the exception of a sweeping tour of the Zissou ship, the Belafonte, the camera fragments scenes far more often than in his previous films, which drew negative attention to dialog and long pauses. It came off as convenient, not stylized.I was also surprised by the mainstream release of the film. Anderson could have had it ready for the fall film festival season but opted to put it up against cheap laughs and thrills like the Fockers and Alexander and the much-anticipated Aviator and Phantom. I'm studying film in college, but my parents and sister would have rather licked barnacles for two hours.You have to ask-- what is this film about? I think it's less about telling the story of Steve Zissou than it is about telling a story, with all the self-consciousness and idiosyncrasies we could attribute to a director. It is a film within a film, a premature 8 1/2. I couldn't help but wonder if the ship crew members holding a boom pole and checking the white balance doubled as actual crew! If you take it for that, and nothing more, then it works. There was this great moment when Jane tells Zissou she thinks the red hats are a little contrived, and the whole audience must be thinking, ""at least someone in the film 'gets' it.""",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

My only real comment is - I've never wanted to smoke pot again so much as I did during that movie.It would be a great and bizarre dreamy funny experience with a good load of THC in the system . Every time Murray/Zissou lit up I thought, you really should share that with your audience, Bill! I was mostly in awe of the fact that they made the movie, the why of it.

I won't reveal details, but suffice to say if you are familiar with his family issues, including the revelation of his affair with his former scriptwriter, you will understand. Wilson, Murray et al do good jobs of making their quirky characters come to life, without becoming cartoons. I suspect many audiences will not appreciate the nuances Wes Anderson has achieved, but for some of us, we enjoyed the movie for its attention to detail, and low-key performances. While not the hilarious slap stick implied by the trailer, if viewers have enough background on Cousteau, they will appreciate the work Anderson has done.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Bill Murray's character Zissou is an empty shell of a person who really doesn't care about anything, not even money or greed like Royal Tannenbaum. It is hard for me to see any resemblance to film maker Cousteau. Most of the characters are as one-sided as paper dolls. Owen Wilson's Ned is the only one who seems to have any blood pulsing through his veins. Basically, this movie is a vapid cartoon.Actual aquatic life is wonderful.

I appreciated the work that went into the visualization of creatures that had just enough of a fake quality to them, that you knew someone went to a lot of work making sure they would not look too real. As far as I am concerned, that's cool, and I enjoyed it. The Jaguar Shark was beautiful.I almost couldn't believe the hijacking scene, that was a huge mistake in the movie. It was just too stupid, but I've never heard Forgotten Boy by Iggy and the Stooges sound so good as on that sound system, it got me over how unnecessary that scene was.I like surreal, I like goofy, I like sloppy with style, I like The Life Aquatic.

Maybe it was Dafoe's craftily placed dialog peppered throughout the movie, or Angelica's non-interested in anything going on around her, (especially partaking in this movie),attitude, but somehow, I watched the whole thing. Unlike my son, I didn't think it was awful, I just walked out of the theater thinking that if there was some deeper meaning to this movie that I was suppose to get, I wish it wasn't buried so deep. Although the story was extremely lame, I seeing these actors in one film...some of my favorites.

The Life Aquatic is an absolutely terrible movie, not worth the price of admission or the price to rent. Not one other guest in the theater laughed -- at any point in the film. The characters all fall flat -- there are minutes upon minutes before any humor is attempted, and when it is, it always falls flat. Some terrible tragedies are portrayed as humorous, and even these scenes are not funny at all. It seems as if there is no point to this film -- nothing sustains it as it creeps along intolerably. I fought off falling asleep several times, disbelieving that a movie with this kind of cast could be this bad.

The more I think about this movie, however, the more I like it. Yes, several thrusts were only incompletely sketched (especially the mutiny, the Murray/Houston relationship), and the ""battle scenes"" were relatively unconvincing. Artistically and philosophically, however, Anderson returns to excellence after the indulgent morass that was Tenenbaums by uniting Rushmore's ironic treatment of performance, meta-film, and creative delusion with Bottle Rocket's sweet-natured love of the enchanting possibilities of adventure, even foolish adventure. The result is a sustained meditation on myth-making creativity, and the way that meaningful relationships demand a domesticizing honesty. This is best exemplified in the interaction between Zissou's appeal, which is based on an ability to craft mythologies and inspire, and his unsavory side - his inability to commit, to be truthful, and to address about people's emotional needs. Anderson frames the movie itself as such a paradox by hinting that the whole production is Zissou's, or by reminding us repeatedly that it is really Anderson's. One of the most beautiful film moments I have ever seen is when Anderson suggests Ned's mortally wounded condition by having a single red drop splash on the camera screen before we see anything that might indicate that Ned is anything but merely dazed by the crash. The drop makes us aware that the scene is not real, but that a powerful imagination underlies everything transpiring before us. This in turn suggests Zissou's whole documentary project, which is often fake, but maybe no less compelling to the fans whose lives he has enhanced through his spirit and imagination. When Zissou proves his shark is real, which he seems to have begun to doubt at other times, he effects the synthesis of imagination and reality, of ""showboat"" striving with deep affect for his lost friend. The obvious unreality of the shark outside of the frame of the movie, however, reminds us that, although the characters' imaginations have been satisfied, the viewer is still in the hands of art, so that the movie's central tension is resolved on one level, but maybe only removed to the next. What makes Dignan in Bottle Rocket and Max in Rushmore appealing is their ability to imagine and then to strive, even though their goals may be as fantastical as a movie. When Anderson turned to realistic, concrete goals that people realized in Tenenbaums, he turned out a failure of a movie. The lesson I took from this movie, whether Anderson intended it or not, is that love, ambition, and life itself require some illusion. Steve, Dignan, and Max know that life and meaning are actively created. They start by imagining, and adjust to reality as they proceed. The story of that adjustment is painful and humorous, and is a much better way to unveil ""real"" human emotions than to approach them directly as most movies do (where everyone knows the desired outcomes for each character right from the beginning). I gave it a 10 despite its flaws because I think this such a powerful act of imagination (can you tell by how many times I've used the word?) that it overcomes its loose plot and occasional false starts.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
572,homesliceturkey,just saw it tonight,8,2 January 2005,"I just saw this film tonight and, quite frankly, i wish I had seen The Aviator instead. Not that this film wasn't energetic, comedic, and entertaining but to me it lacked some sort of plot or basic theme and was merely a series of events strung together; something I'm sure neither I nor Hollywood is ready for.I do applaud the film for being a part of the new revolutionary movement of film, or independent film for that matter, in depicting life as the culmination of various possibly unrelated and circumstantial events into a single cohesive object. This film is a continuing proponent of this vision and I support it wholly as I believe film should describe life rather than give meaning to it (as many Hollywood films attempt to do).This film along with Garden State, ESOSM, and others (perhaps Sideways though I have not seen it yet) are paving the way for a new generation of film. This film may not have appealed to some because it seemed ""random"" and ""senseless"" at times, but was merely a depiction of the reality of life. I wholly accept this as an art form and applaud it but I believe I am not yet ready to accept this type of film-making because my mind, as others, is targeted at feeling some sort of resolution to life and life's problems but in life we truly have little or no resolution. I hope that I can learn to accept this form of film-making, but in the meantime...8/10",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Thank you Wes for giving us an instant ""academic"" classic! Those not appreciative of wry humor will not be in on the rapport between the characters. Action sequences are a nice escape into the fantastic. Murray plays them lighthearted without being goofy. Owen Wilson has always attracted me to a story, with this performance he has gained a fan. Understated, farce yet believable as Zissou's maybe son. Willem Dafoe is uncharacteristically sensitive and practically steals the movie. Angelica Houston and Murray play a absolute dead-on realistic couple-du-academia, which lends and even funnier spin on the dialog.

I can't fathom (no pun intended) thinking of such a plot . . . could it be Wes Anderson was smoking some of SteveZ's funny cigarettes? Music was awesome. And did anyone else get the chills when SteveZ finally sights the jaguar shark? I didn't even realize that Jeff Goldblum was supposed to be in the movie, let long an all-star cast as it it had. The entire audience sat through all of the credits at the end even though I had to leave. . . the movie may be more geared to younger people, but I think all enjoyed it.

Wes Anderson most likely will not be recognized for his genius by the mainstream. I suppose that is what i admire most about his work. His priorities are obvious. The art and creativity come before the desire for profit and popularity. Wes Anderson makes films that are unique and satirical. Of all the four movies of his that i have seen, this one was the movie that absolutely stood on it's own. His editing has improved, every scene linked to the next as if the story was being told moments after the events transpired. His casting has always been my favorite aspect of his work. He seems to have a loyal gang of players that are in almost every one of his movies and gives fans like myself a feeling of connection to the actors and more sentimentality toward there characters. And finally the dialogue in Life Aquatic was as smart and well delivered as i think it could be. The lines exchanged between Owen Wilson and Willem Dafoe were especially amusing.

Even an impressive list of stars does not save this movie. Bill Murray is the same one-dimensional character as always. This is a shame because I miss the Bill Murray of Grounghog Day, Scrooged, and Caddyshack. The computer graphics are bizarre to say the least. They appear to be randomly added in with no attempt whatsoever to blend with the movie. Picture a 7-year old being allowed to add stickers after the movie was completed.

This movie was simply trying too hard...many lines were forced and jokes were repeated to the point of being painful. The dry humor was off the mark more often than not, and everything was a bit predictable (in terms of the humor, not necessarily the plot). Delivering a joke straight-faced doesn't automatically make something funny, and Bill Murray isn't naturally funny, he's only a good vehicle through which to deliver good lines. The problem was, the writing in this movie simply isn't good enough to deliver the witty punches of Anderson's previous work. Instead, you are stuck with a dull, dragging picture that tries too hard to be clever, but winds up coming off as pretentious and smug, as if you can feel the director and writers laughing to themselves as they think, ""this line will be damn funny.""

It is nothing more than a series of unrelated scenes strung together, that left me wondering what was going on. Did we really need to see a cutaway of the Belafonte and the explanation? It just came out of nowhere and didn't really add much. Moreover, the mindless prattle littered throughout the film was more aggravating than entertaining, and often so weird that one couldn't help but shake his head. Who cares about a guy singing acoustic versions of David Bowie's songs? And while there were some funny moments and jokes that only those of ""higher"" intellect could decipher, there really wasn't anything clever or witty about them. There is nothing clever about this film; it could have been significantly better but Wes Anderson decided to be weird for the sake of weird. I liked his previous films a lot, but what separated them from this piece was honest character development. The characters in the Tennebaums were real people, even if one had to take a leap of faith to believe so; Everyone could empathize with Max in Rushmore and his cause no matter how over the top it was. I was angered having to sit through this movie and dish out 8.50. This movie fails in every-which way, though the soundtrack was pretty good.I can't see where anyone who truly and honestly enjoyed it is coming from.

579,aaron-258,Top Notch Movie,10,3 February 2005,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is easily one of the best films of 2004. Focusing on stellar oceanographer and renowned documentarian Steve Zissou and his corky yet profound team, The Life Aquatic leaves the audience literally speechless as the credits roll. There are few words that can describe a movie like this - one that generates great laughs at times while eliciting tears at others. ""A hell of a movie"" only begins to tell the story behind this masterpiece of a film.Parallels can easily be drawn, but yet in so many ways it outshines them all. Its humorous yet grabbing dialogue are almost Tarantino-esquire. Its exquisite and unique shots differentiate the movie from many others - turning what would otherwise be a boring scene into something that at times feels like a stunningly incredible cross between the animated scenery of The Nightmare Before Christmas (indeed, the animations were done by the same person in both movies) and a presentation of Jules Verne's 20000 Leagues Under the Sea.The filming was extraordinarily well done, with such a huge variety of styles and tones that it boggles the mind to try to comprehend who could be able to come up with such amazing ideas.In The Life Aquatic, the cast is wonderful, the concept is grand, and the presentation is astounding. This movie is a true winner and will surely become known as a classic. Despite at best meager reviews by those worthless critics, everyone needs to see this movie more than once. This is one movie that words alone simply cannot describe. Out of 10, this movie scores an easy 10.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
580,julmis,What went wrong?,1,28 August 2005,"I loved ""Royal Tenenbaums"" and happily sat through ""Bottle Rocket"", but I have probably never been this bored in a cinema since ""The Matrix Revolutions"", and that includes the many hours I have spend working in a multiplex. Where to start? Technically the film looks surprisingly amateurish for a director who has a few features behind him. The camera-work and editing often crosses the line from quirky to incoherent mess. However the main problem is the script, which looks like a rough first draft nobody bothered to rewrite. Long scenes pass the screen without leading to anything or serving any purpose whatsoever and there is no structure to be seen, even though the premise of a shark hunt is so simple and theoretically strong you could easily hang the film on it. Why not use a strong and simple B-movie monster hunt structure as the spine of this story? A motion picture should move, by definition, and this one lacked any kind of momentum, which would have supported the ""quirky"" elements while keeping the audience awake. What we have now would be an endlessly long sketch show if there were more laughs and attempts for comedy. The characters loiter around expressing nothing, even Bill Murray, the king of deadpan, manages to look bored as opposed to intriguingly laid-back. The key father-son relationship (I assume it is a key element although, like with anything it was so casually handled it was barely visible) between Murray and Wilson does not really go anywhere or attract any interest, and when the tragic climax finally happens, it does not feel like tragic or even climactic. (SPOILER ALERT) Perhaps the writers realised Wilson has nothing else to do in the script after this, so why not kill him off? Even though emotional coolness seems to be Anderson's trademark, I personally would have liked to have someone like Tobey Maguire with his eager puppy dog quality to balance Murray's minimalism. Speaking of Wilson, miscast though he was in this film, would this have been better if he had been sitting at the word processor or quirky antique typewriter with Anderson instead of hanging around on the deck with nothing to do?",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

A place where trial lawyers bring their children to dog fights and call accountants who happened to be black ""Coltrane"". However, the overriding emotion in the film is longing and loss and displacement...and so it was natural for Wes to add his stylized rememberances of a young Texan into the set of a film about a family of disconnected geniuses: it was part of the mood lighting for the general vibe of the piece. And even though it was wildly funny it's real brilliance was capturing the desolation of a bunch of 30 yr old kids and their parents trying desperately to connect to each other...much the same way Max and Herman tried to connect in Rushmore (again--the camp was justified because it added to the emotional states of the characters.Were it the case with ""Aquatic"". What a bore! The whole film is just one long SNL sketch lampooning the Calypso, Cousteau, et al...but that was it--there was no point of entry into the characters and the camp just started getting on my nerves--mainly because it was just so played and unfunny.What an unbelievable disappointment--Wes needs to do a one act play on Broadway or something and put his props away for awhile--he has abused his prop privileges and ruined a movie in the process.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

It seemed as if Anderson wrote the part of Steve Zissou just for Murray. The quick, dry humor, the strange awkward moments, and the stoic separation he always seems to have between himself and the other characters perfectly befits the now gray, though distinguished Murray. The film itself was beautiful. I don't know anything about French New Wave or stop animation, but I do know that the affect was captivating.

585,wmcdaniel-1,"Wes Anderson Yes, But Soul Spirited Away ...",5,11 January 2005,"I'm not sure if it was a lack of Owen Wilson in the writing process, the swollen budget thrown his way for this project, the pressure to produce a big hit or a single-minded focus by Wes in the things he holds dear (direction, sets & titles) but the Life Aquatic lacks the soul of his prior work and sputters, meanders and misses in ways Anderson's not before.Now, please don't get me wrong - versus other films out there, Wes Anderson's work is always worth seeing; however, versus his own high standards this one misses on many levels. From the silliness of the fictional animals (whose names weren't that creative at all), to the rehash of the ineffective father (handled so much more effectively in Tenenbaum's) to the Theater of the Absurd moments that, in their blatant outlandishness (Bill Murray's shootouts w/the ever-reloading pistol come to mind) remove any connection he wishes the audience to feel when real tragedy occurs (Ned dying for one), Aquatic consistently misses across the board. That is not the case with either of the prior three Anderson films which hit the intended mark with pathos-filled accuracy.There were good moments indeed. The emotional Zissou's tears in the final scenes, as he burns a doobie on the red carpet, was very touching in the classic Anderson way (though not as poignant as Chaz riding with Royal in the ambulance as he dies or Herman meeting Max's father and discovering his real occupation). Further, almost every scene with Dafoe was brilliant - from his earlier mohawk'ed work in the frozen north to his slap-off with Owen Wilson, he was a brilliant Anderson addition.While that's true of Daffoe though, it's not of Goldblum who stands out like the proverbial sore thumb (or bad actor like Andie MacDowell doing her best to ruin Four Weddings) ... from his first moment in the film to his classic Wes Anderson painting in costume to his final posturing on the side of the boat as the film ends, he doesn't fit. He looks like a Hollywood actor trying to get in on this crazy, hip Wes Anderson. In fact, he's the perfect symbol of the whole Life Aquatic experience - pieces that just don't fit together.You have the beautiful elements that make Wes Anderson one of the handful of directors I salivate for their next picture - Bill Murray at his best, costumes & uniforms, Angelica, Owen, quirkiness abounding; however, the film has things you don't expect either - like the misplaced Goldblum - a lack of real connection with suffering in the characters, indulgent visuals there just for themselves and not a greater purpose and a feeling of inspiration.It's worth seeing but far from Anderson's best.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

His characters, like those in The Royal Tennenbaums, have unique similarities to the actors he's cast. I think that perhaps because he and Owen Wilson have been friends since their Texas days, Wes can write lines that Owen can believably translate onto screen. If I were to put my money on any actor working today, my bet is on Owen Wilson. Sure, Orlando Bloom is good, and people seem to like Vince Vaughan, but Owen's got heart--something you don't see much of these days in Hollwood.For anyone who didn't like it, try again and pay attention to the deeper meaning.

The dialogue is witty and extremely funny whilst not falling into a slapstick trap. No one plays this type of character as well as Murray. No big bucks effects - in fact quite the opposite.

Owen Wilson is great as the 'is he, isn't he' son, and Cate Blanchett delivers yet another wonderful performance to her belt. The music is fantastic, it really makes the film. The Bowie is used to excellent comic effect and Sigur Ros to heighten the emotion exactly where its needed. The plot is outrageous, which adds to subtle humour, and has some genuinely funny gems in the script. This is not your usual run of the mill comedy, but its totally original and refreshing.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
600,drifterofdreams,what happened?,5,8 March 2005,"I went into the cinema with the premise that i was going to see a good movie as actors such as Bill Murray and Owen Wilson have the stature to carry a movie, and after seeing the movie my opinion still remains the same. However i wasn't captivated by the story or the characters at all, they just seemed shallow, bleak and held no power of interest to sustain a 2 hour film. On top of this was the storyline which although was uplifting at times such as the scene with the pirates and the stop motion animation, was as lifeless as the characters portrayed in the picture. From a cinematographers point of view, yes i suppose this is a brilliant masterpiece as it uses many imaginative ideas to tell a story. However from an average Joe's point of view (won't be everyones), who use movies to escape reality, they voted with their feet in the screening i was in - out the door half way through the film The Portuguese classical guitarist was fantastic and the translation of Bowie was genius!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
601,philblume,Excellent movie,9,9 March 2005,"I have just seen this movie and thought it was great, with excellent performances from a very good cast; understated, natural, just getting on with the job.The supernatural underwater scenery and the cut-away boat used for some of the on-board scenes were both pure genius. Best bit? Probably when Jeff Goldblum whacks the dog, I laughed till I cried. The acoustic Portugese rendering of David Bowie just added another layer of delightful weirdness to an already magical movie.If you have an ounce of imagination in your bones and don't need to be spoon-fed your thrills, go and see it.

Although it seemed boring to me but it was emotional, specially when they looking at the Jaguar Shark and the song Staralfur is playing a very emotional moment for me,(Spoiler!!!) (Also a very emotional moment is when the helicopter crashes and Ned and Steve are out there in the ocean and they both know that Ned is going to die soon but there just talking bout what with wrong with the helicopter) I haven't seen any other Wes Anderson flicks but I am sure I will check him out and see what other movies he has made. I hope to see movies like this in the future. I suggest those who haven't watched this movie to watch it. I also like what they did with the David Bowie songs Seu Jorge is very talented at what he does many of the reasons I am buying this movie and the soundtrack.

603,martincormier,Wes Anderson is bringing back creativity to American cinema,9,28 March 2005,"The Life Aquatic seems to be rubbing a lot of moviegoers the wrong way. People either love it or hate it, and that is always a good outcome in any field that is supposed to be creative. And that is what this movie is, very creative. It is not as serious as The Royal Tenenbaums or Rushmore, and does not contain such well shaped and intriguing characters. But it doesn't need to because it is an adventure film and a comedy. In a time when so many of the movies being made are sequels, prequels, remakes, franchised products or American versions of films that were already made in Asia or Europe, it is refreshing to see a movie that is so damned original. And for me, it was the funniest thing I have seen on the screen for some time.For the many who didn't like it, fine, that is to be expected and even welcomed. If you wasted your time and money seeing this movie, don't blame Wes Anderson, he never forced you to see this. Your mistake was in thinking this would be a film that a broad audience could appreciate. Anderson never intended that and anyone who knows his work should know that. If you couldn't enjoy this, that is your loss. It would be unfair and possibly untrue for me to suggest that if you didn't like this movie you are ignorant. But those of you who are too stuck in your ways and too closed-minded to have fun with this highly enjoyable movie, then you deserve to miss out on one of the fine points of modern American cinema.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
604,basevers,Only looks as good as The Royal Tenenbaums,7,5 April 2005,"If you enjoyed The Royal Tenenbaums, you will not necessarily enjoy The Life Aquatic equally. Wes Anderson's great eye for detail once again ensures a visually entertaining movie with beautiful colors all around, but the storyline is somewhat disappointing. The story did not grab me like the Tenenbaums; it was harder to empathize with the antagonists. Bill Murray is great, Anjelica's role is too limited to really make a lasting impression. The ""running gag"" of Bowie songs sung in Brazilian Portuguese is far fetched, although it does not annoy. The script is a collection of loose ends, so the movie is carried by visual effects, which -again- are impressive.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
605,adrianyardley,Misleading IMDb rating,2,6 April 2005,"Totally misleading 7.3 rating from IMDb - and why is this so? Well Bill Murray can be great (like in ""Groundhog Day"") but his demeanour communicates boredom, here for good reason. Can he have enjoyed making this film - look at the downward curl of his mouth - this time it's for real.So what went wrong? Almost no story. Banal script. Distasteful slur on Jacques Cousteau, noble pioneer of underwater photography and inventor of SCUBA. Irritating repetition of David Bowie songs inappropriate to the story (!) line.Contrast this pap with ever increasing quality of work from an actor like Jack Nicholson - Bill's stuff is declining: Lost in Translation was a passable performance if not inspiring, one could feel the torpor. And Tenenbaums was cliché overacted drivel.I was on the point of walking for much of the film, wondering if a 'good bit' would come along. But nooooooo.By contrast that evening I had seen ""Meet the Fockers"" which despite what I'd heard about repetition of the same jokes as ""Meet the Parents"", I found radiated a 'fun' atmosphere. The actors genuinely seemed to have a had a good time - and so did I.So forget it Bill - you're just a tired sell-out!",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Steve Zissou chasing a Jaguar Shark for the whole film to avenge the death of his best friend and partner, but in the end he finds some things are more important then the shark.The soundtrack though- wow! Over half of it is David Bowie covers, but not in English. Interesting to have a character within the movie (Pelé) performing the soundtrack, even after several less then pleasant problems arise.The underwater animals and many of the land animals are CGI, and very interesting. They almost seem surreal when paired with the rest of the film which seems excessively ""homemade"". It almost made you feel there were many movies going on at once. Bill Murray gave a typically good performance; aptly confusing, but pulling things together at crucial moments and reminesent of his performance in Lost In Translation.Overall it was a very good film, but one you need to go into with no expectations to really enjoy.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
608,mattbholland,My personal favorite,10,14 April 2009,"This is my all time favorite movie. The comedic intricacies are unmatched, combined with rich visuals and a compelling plot. I am not a fan of most Wes Anderson films, they tend to be a bit too subtle for my taste (DarJeeling Limited, Royal Tenenbaums...). However, Bill Murray hits it out of the park with his deadpan lines (I'm right on the edge. I don't know what comes next....I'm about to blow my stack). Understated performances abound which fits the film perfectly, which means the film may require a few viewings to appreciate it fully (it took me awhile to warm up to it). The soundtrack is amazing also, both the Seu Jorge (sp?) tracks and the Devo instrumentals. All in all, I feel this is Anderson's best work, and I know I am probably in the minority on this, but it's much better on many levels than his previous and subsequent films.Ann Marie?? Do the interns get Glocks? ""No, they all share one.""",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
609,sodhis,Wow.. amazing.,9,25 April 2005,"At first I was merely watching this flick because I was bored. I then took time to actually try to understand what was going on. The beginning of the movie made me wonder how it had received a rating of 7.3 - and though not wanting to see the rest, I still anticipated an explanation for this strange way of filming and instructing. I guess there is no explanation but to say: It's what makes the film.If you're 20 minutes in, and feel like shutting off, for gods sake, don't.

If you prefer physical comedy over clever, dry humor, you won't like this movie. If you prefer Jim Carrey to Bill Murray, you won't like this movie.

Unfortunately, The Life Aquatic is nothing more than 118 minutes of a Saturday Night Live skit. The movie would have rated a three out of ten but for the ending. The last ten minutes did manage to pull things together somewhat and prevented it from being a complete waste of time.The movie industry has seen twelve or thirteen weeks of declining attendance. This movie - and others like it - are the cause. The industry is obsessed with trying to be too ""artsy"". Shots of stage sets, minimal plot, rambling dialog, meandering storyline, and the all-important guy with a guitar singing for no apparent reason. Few few movies pull it off.

612,ultramanjones,The LIfe Acquatic: Reality in Fantasy Land,10,16 May 2005,"Well, I most certainly didn't expect that EVERYONE would love this movie, but it's really quite sad that I've seen some of the trashings that I have read here. Just because you watch movies all day doesn't make you an expert on what it is that makes a movie a good one. I used to work with a guy who had been to literally hundreds of rock concerts ever since he was something like 5 years old. He used to rave about how Van Halen with Sammy Hagar was better than the original Van Halen. Nuff said.Of course there are many parallels that could be drawn between Life Aquatic and certain literary master pieces. Not the least of which would be, obviously, Moby Dick. One great thing I saw in this movie was a sort of staccato representation of life. That is to say, for instance, when death happens in this movie, it is made BOTH obvious that it effects the characters, but then jumps to showing the sometimes seeming emotionlessness denial that appears as we move on through our lives, unsure of what just happened, and/or why. Birth, noticeably, and any responsibility for it, is treated similarly. The humor often points to how much we, as humans, glorify the past while overlooking the beauty of now, of how we amble on forward seeking after any passion left in us, wondering the whole time where passion went. The characters often speak right out loud what in real life would be either hard to say, would take a while before it could be said, or maybe even would be seemingly ridiculous to say, even though everyone already knows that you are thinking it.The ridiculously exotic creatures are the REAL creatures we awed at in our childhood, but as adults we see as just another mundane animal in a mundane world.I could go on and on about what all I saw in this film. I think it is obvious to anyone with the mind for it that it is filled with metaphors.I will say one more thing. I don't think that the absurdity of many of its parts speaks to the absurdity of life, so much as it points out how absurdly WE TREAT the life we actually have, while we look for something more... exotic, other worldly, maybe even aquatic.Rent it, enjoy it.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
613,robey1-1,Disappointing Murray vehicle,2,19 May 2005,"I am not a great fan of Bill Murray but this was just bad. It was so boring, I fell asleep. The overall acting was poor and the directing was non-existent. I feel very bad for Bill in this as he is a better actor than that Cate Blanchett was boring. She could have done so much more with this part. Owen Wilson was so bad he was almost laughing in every shot he was having such a hard time keeping a straight face while stealing your money for his part. There was probably only one really funny part was the rescue scene of the movie and even that was pretty poor. In all, it was a big waste of time.

614,enzweiler,"Quirky characters, great cast, few laughs, weak story, amateurish editing, slow paced",5,20 May 2005,"This is another one of those movies with previews that give the false impression that it is a laugh riot (think Steve Martin's Parenthood, which was also mis-marketed as a pure comedy when in fact it was more poignant) That's not to say there aren't some very funny moments in this movie, but not nearly enough to qualify it as a comedy. What this film is is a surreal look at the lives of some interesting, quirky, characters placed in a thinly-plotted story with a pacing that is on the slow side. The editing is amateurish at times, and the overall effect is something closer to a home movie than a Hollywood production. Having said that, I enjoyed the movie. Mostly because the cast contains several actors that are simply interesting to watch. I mean, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Angelica Huston, Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum and even Bud Cort -- these people would be interesting in a hemorrhoid cream commercial let alone a movie. Avoid this movie if you're looking for a laugh-a-minute comedy or high production values, but definitely see it if you enjoy quirky characters played by talented actors.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

616,buttonhook465,Social Meaning,10,13 June 2005,"I'll be vague as not to give anything away for any readers who have not yet seen the movie.I'm actually a conservative and I cannot believe this is my perception: I believe the story provides a framework to define gender roles in our society. Possibly this is an illustration of a shift in gender roles since the Jacques Cousteau era. In the balloon Steve says, ""I never really felt like that."" He is essentially admitting himself something other than the bold adventurer he is generally perceived to be.The male characters in the movie, with the possible exception of Ned who was raised by a single mom, are all extremely emotionally fragile. Hennesey's innermost insecurity is less clear, but, after all, he is ""part gay."" Where relationships are concerned, the males are almost entirely dependent upon the females. Steve's wife is the ""brains of the operation."" She has saved him more than once. The trip's initial funding comes from the inheritance of a woman. By all indications this is not a wise business endeavor on Ned's part. Steve's wife clarifies this when she says something like, ""you didn't take that poor boy's money did you?"" As for the father-son relationship, Steve wants the upside of fatherhood, but not the responsibility. ""I hate fathers and I never wanted to be one."" Why do you suppose he walks off with the nephew on his shoulders? The males present themselves as rugged individuals but this is the case only in physical confrontation; confrontation created by their own bungling (Anne-Marie warned him not to go there). Confrontation seems to be Steve's only real skill. Steve's life is falling apart yet he still pursues instant gratification in booze and reefer. He has affairs, he pursues women as young as fifteen, when things go wrong he pleads with the rich bitch. He has no sense of accountability at all (there's the conservative side of me showing). He presents himself as fragile when the rich bitch is blunt about the dead cat. He didn't even know what kind of cat it was. Do you think he ever really noticed the cat except for when its death provided him a brief opportunity to be a victim? Klause is a total baby (Dafoe is a great actor).I typed this quickly and poorly. I suspect the movie is far more about our culture than sea-faring life. I think the movie is great. Very artistic, funny and rich in meaning.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

But I disagree, this film is a wonderful comedy that can be related to a style of casual comedy like seinfeld or curb your enthusiasm. It is edited and filmed as if the movie was filmed by the Zissou camera man, which means it was filmed like a bad documentary but obviously on purpose. The film is filled with long drawn out scenes, which seems for me to actually add to the comedic effect. It also has great memorable quotes, making it easy to watch over and over again. This is the kind of movie that you may feel bored about while watching, but once you look back at the scenes you'll find your self giggling. It may not be the greatest film, but its up there on my list just because the movie only gets funnier and funnier with each watch. The film also has great actors, who are characters different form there usual.

Given his track record of very un-funny movies, it's shocking the writer/director can still raise the funds for a cup of coffee, let alone his next project. These review pages insist on at least 10 lines of comment for a review (go figure,) but how many ways can you say a movie stinks? Normally extremely funny and enjoyable Bill Murray and sometimes funny Owen Wilson are given such wooden dialogue and such goofy backstory's that their characters never achieve anything beyond taking up physical space in the frame.

Along with him for the ride is a man who may or not be his son (Owen Wilson), his estranged wife (Angelica Huston) and an ambitious reporter (Cate Blanchett).

Outstanding performance.The idea of creating such a kind of senseless parody on the poor Jacques Cousteau, that makes him look like.. really done.. is simply fantastic.

626,Godofskinnypunks,This Movie Is Brilliant,9,5 July 2005,"The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou is an absolutely brilliant film. I was blown away by this movie when I watched it. Bill Murray plays the bastard character that he perfected in Scrooged and Groundhog Day. Willem Dafoe hams it up with a German accent. Anjelica Houston is great as Murray's disaffected wife. Jeff Goldbloom takes a funny turn as Murray's appropriately smarmy rival. Kate Blanchett shines as a reporter sent to do a piece on Zissou. And Owen Wilson keeps everyone honest as the film's straight man, Zissou's estranged son. It is a hilarious comedy with a well blended touch of action/adventure and it is also very moving. It deftly mixes subtle with overt humor. Anderson's dialog is very intelligent (and highly quotable) and the film has lots of non-sequitur moments (ala Royal Tennenbaums) that keep you both thinking and laughing throughout. It is also very touching to watch the relationship between the Ned character (Wilson) and the Steve character (Murray) build. And the story's culmination, aboard the mini-sub is one of the most satisfying that you're ever likely to see.Honestly, I can't say enough good things about this movie and I was quite disheartened to see that there are quite a few people on this site that posted negatively about it using words like bland and boring, but then again I guess I can understand this film being over some peoples' heads. I guess those people are the reason that movies like Taxi and White Chicks are made.9 out of 10, highly recommended if you're a fan of Wes Anderson's other work or just like intelligent comedy that doesn't involve fart jokes or people getting hit in the groin.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

So despite the commercial success of the film, Anderson's craftsmanship (not an overstatement: this film took two years to complete), The Life Aquatic, according to some, redeployed the familiar: the formalization of witticisms and dry humor. So, it has yet to join the critical ranks of Rushmore and The Royal Tennenbaums, sadly.Noah Baumbach replaced Owen Wilson in the writing process, a director whose deadpan appeal might complement the tragi-comic tone of Anderson's other films? Yes and no. While this movie is distinctively Anderson--from the thematized daily log titles, to the intern named ""Neko""-- there does seem to be something missing. This movie just feels a little lighter than the others, as Bowie queues the outro and the crew synchs up with the credits.

What the?I really liked Rushmore, but only realised they were directed by the same guy later. Sure, some parts of the movie fell flat. Occasionally the ""offbeat quirkiness"" of the film seemed forced. Willem Dafoe was sometimes like Willem Dafoe trying to be a wacky kraut, but overall the performances were superb.

This is a movie that has no lack of star power.The Life Aquatic is an eclectic movie by design, that follows Oceanographer Steve Zissou (Murray) on his personal and professional revenge mission to hunt the fabled Jaguar Shark that took his friend during the filming of a documentary. Kingston Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) is a Kentucky Co-pilot that may be Zissou's son or might not be, who joins Zissou and his crew on the mission to kill the shark and make a documentary that will receive critical acclaim; something that is a 12 year memory for Team Zissou.As I watched the movie I couldn't pin it. I couldn't decide quite if what I was watching was rubbish or great. There were points when I almost felt like I was wasting my time and points where I was enjoying the incoherent ride this story basically is, quite a bit. This movie isn't a straight comedy, thats for sure. I didn't laugh out loud once, I smiled on more than one occasion but this isn't a movie that will have you reeling with laughter. That said, Murray plays his role very well and is very funny, if not laugh out loud so.I also have to compliment this movie with a great soundtrack and bringing me to the attention of Seu Jorges who is an incredible talent who literally goes through the entire movie performing David Bowie songs in Portuguese. This guy is quite, quite brilliant and his performance of Queen Bitch during the credits was just sheer quality. OK, I'm a huge Bowie fan but this guy is great.The Life Aquatic is just one of those movies. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was a brilliant movie because it wasn't, really. What it is despite the opening comments is ""refreshing"". And yes, it's entertaining. This is a film that I doubt many will be apathetic about. You're either going to go for it or despise it.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
631,peter_foley,This has now entered my top 5 favorite movies of all times after the first viewing,10,21 July 2005,Perfection. The timing of the jokes on and off screen would make you dizzy. The Tennebaums was slow and building to the finale. Whereas Zissou hits you like a rocket from the moment you see Murrays eyes after his friend was attacked.The subtlty of some of the jokes is the sign of genius.This is now in my top 5 favorite movies along with the outstanding Big Lebowski and Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. It maybe regarded as a comedy but the devoplement of the character and the arc they complete does leave you feeling that you know the players. Hats off to Mr Dafoe for his best role since Nosferatu .A true find .....,The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
632,robcochran6589,The Life Acquatic - Disaster at Sea,1,26 July 2005,"This movie was pure artistic masturbation. What a waste of an incredible cast. It's made for a very specific group of fans of which I am clearly not one of them. It's like pseudo-famous artist sticking a piece of chewing gum on the bottom of a sneaker, showing it in a gallery and expecting people to say it's brilliant when it's nothing but gum on a shoe. Then the artist comes out and talks about how the gum represents humanity and the shoe represents materialism and you're supposed to go ""Ohhhh... now I get it... how profound, how interesting"" when all you really want to do is go to the bathroom and leave. Meanwhile, the artist is smoking with satisfaction at having once again made a fortune off so much crap as gum on a shoe.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
633,sr145,Amateurish to the extreme,2,5 August 2005,"This movie is amateurish in design and execution.Poorly filmed and edited with no plot and not funny. The jokes were so low key that they barely registered. The actors were great though considering the rubbish they had to work with. Bill Murray was terrific.I rented the DVD and after 10 minutes watching it I had to stop, the last time I did that was with Mulholland Dr. The next day I gave it a second chance and watched the whole thing. I came to the same conclusion as previously, it stank.The film was a giant self indulgence by Wes Anderson. I am sure he found it hilarious and funny but he has to consider a wider audience. The film must have been a financial disaster. The fact he has only made four films in ten years is no accident, I cannot see him making four more in the next ten years. He is now on my directors to avoid list with David Lynch.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

My biggest problem - my husband won't ever go see another Bill Murray film after this. The promo photo on the DVD cover was the perfect depiction of the audience response. New definition of DEAD-PAN. It was DEAD and I have to PAN it.I've never had trouble sleeping, but... this film is perfect for those who do!! At least I've gotten some pleasure from reading the Love/Hate comments. But... Great!??? Certainly not in the eye of this beholder.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
635,oronnokprithibi,Different kind of film from sound perspective.,10,22 December 2018,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, is an amazing biography-like film. And director Wes Anderson made an excellent example of how to mix music with scenes in a whole different way. His experiment worked like a charm, and we got a different taste of music and sound from this film. More directors should try experimenting with sound beside visuals.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
636,hawkersnz,A poor movie and a waste to the time it took to make and our money to see it,1,17 September 2005,"Having sat through Lost in Translation and felt disappointed that it was a very average movie with a very average performance by Bill Murry, we watched Life Aquatic with interest to see if it was an improvement. Sadly it was a disappointment also and and of the group of people watching it, not one wanted to see it to the end.I could not even cast this as ""dry"" and felt that it was a waste of the studios time making the movie and a waste of our money watching it.It will be a long time before we would bother watching a Bill Murray movie again and suggest that he has a good look at the scripts he chooses to take on.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
637,cranston36,Negative Impact of Movie,1,26 September 2005,I had expected a comedy and an interesting movie. Instead I was subjected to a fragmented and technically awkward film that seemed to drag on for an inordinate amount of time.It is amazing that they got the money to do the movie. There must be a void of talent and ability swirling in Hollywood and New York that is sucking in everything good and reasonable and regurgitating films like 'The Life Aquatic'.If it were not for the fact that Bill Murray and Angelica Houston were in the movie I would have stopped watching it in the first 15 minutes. I waited in vain for a humorous or intelligent thought to come out of it.,The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
638,jiribel,meaning of this movie,10,21 April 2006,"Of course I cannot say the meaning of this movie but I want to offer you a view you can look at this movie again and I am sure most of you will be surprised by this perspective. Do you remember (especially you boys)when you were small? When you guys had your ""gang"" with leader (Steve), when you got a new boy (Ned) to your gang and some guy was very jealous on him? (Klaus) I am sure one of your rivals was decent boy from a rich family (Hennessey). Maybe you got very smart girl among you who could solve everything (Eleanor). You could fight with other gangs with guns that could shoot sparkles again and again and nobody got hurt. And when you jump over small pond (sorry huge swamp) there were plenty of leeches on you? Oh, I love that movie, now I know why I felt so sentimental when I watched that movie first time - it reminds me my childhood so so much. Our ""gang"" had secret plan - to get big boat somewhere, load it with food, guns and go to Cuba. We didn't have scientific dreams :-) I am sure that in this movie Wes Anderson tries to picture his adventurous dreams when he was small. Now I understand why there is an old man asking for signature of child's sci-fi books, why there is a letter from small boy, why Cate Blanchett is saying at the end of the movie: he will be twelve in eleven and half and Steve responds: that's my favorite age. That was my favorite age, too Steve... I take this movies as a wonderful tribute to childhood (mostly boyish I guess) where great adventure was all around us. Do not get me wrong: I did not discover this idea, I was told about it and for me it perfectly fits together and I love this movie even more!By the way: very similar movie tricks made Czech director Karel Zeman 40 years ago in B&W. Highly recommended",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
639,elchicotriste,Steve Zissou,10,20 October 2005,"Excellent surrealistic film. Wes Anderson is an example of director who looks for his own road by building a personal visual language. One of those directors with a individual sign, which becomes recognizable in every film he releases, and his cuts, his use of the soundtrack to give an atmosphere to every little scene, the approach of the subject and even the choice of the actors compose a unique way to shoot. Not many other professionals like him. Hilarious Bill Murray, an excellent comedian actor that I hope is already a Wes Anderson fetish. I can't wait to see future cooperations. Angelica Huston, Jeff Goldblum and Owen Wilson do an excellent job too, considering the difficulty to shine beside the extreme brightness of an incredible Bill Murray. A 10 for Steve Zissou's adventures! I wish to see in action soon again the incredible tandem:Anderson-Murray.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
640,vincefabrizio,"This one, Mr Rice",10,18 May 2017,"Life Aquatic is a beautifully composed film with a great story. The artistic value is very unique. Like all Wes Anderson movies, it has colors that really pop, very symmetrical shots, and amazing stop motion scenes. The movie was super entertaining and funny. For educational value, you wont learn anything about boats or sea junk, but you watch a guy give up his life to work on a ship and travel the sea. And i think the lesson there is that in life, sometimes you just have to give up all your stuff and travel the sea. To be happy you cant always play it safe. On the surface, the movie is about claiming revenge on the jaguar shark that ate Esteban. But the real story is about a dad connecting with his son and learning to care about others. Pretty awesome movie.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
641,mackenzieldubois,Another great and quirky movie from innovative Wes Anderson.,9,22 May 2017,"From the quirky yet innovative director, Wes Anderson, comes yet another interesting and original movie about a once famous documentary maker seeking revenge for the death of his best friend. Steve Zissou searches out the carnivorous sea creature, the Jaguar Shark, that took the life of his closest friend and colleague. On this treacherous journey of revenge, Zissou encounters pirates, a mutiny of his crew, love for a woman he cannot have, and even a young man who may or may not be his biological son. As team Zissou sets out on this noble quest for revenge, while documenting the whole thing on film, the characters learn that sometimes revenge is not always worth the trouble.Anderson is known for his very original and odd approach to filmmaking and The Life Aquatic is no exception to his quirky style. Set in the 1960's, Anderson uses art and styles from the era which allows the audience to see the differences of the modern times to those of the past. By using real life sets and sets built in studios, Anderson shows his unique sense of art and makes the film unmistakably a Wes Anderson film. This movie is able to entertain its audience in the way that only Anderson's films can do. This film keeps its audience interested by being different and odd. It is able to capture the audience's attention with its quirky style and its eccentric characters. The moral message that can be gained from this movie is that family is always the most important thing in life. It also teaches that gaining revenge is not always the solution to your problems. Steve Zissou's experiences teach that letting go of past grudges can set you free and allow you to get on with your life to be successful. Both the internal and external conflicts are clearly developed throughout the movie. Zissou struggles with his internal conflict that he had already peaked in his life and will never be as successful as he once was. The external conflict comes in the form of a carnivorous sea beast that killed his best friend. He struggles with the task of finding the beast to kill it and get his revenge. I would rate this movie with four and a half out of five stars. It depicts a lost man that finds peace with himself and his arch nemesis by embarking on a seemingly impossible quest of revenge. Wes Anderson, once again, has created a wonderful story of love, loss, and triumph using his inventive and original style.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
642,em90487,absolutely hilariously amazing,10,29 November 2005,"The Life Aquatic is one of the funniest movies I have seen in the last ten years. Granted, I am only nineteen years old, this movie had me laughing the entire way through. Anyone who doesn't like this movie took it in the wrong context. Everything in the movie is meant to be a joke. If you try to take any of the movie seriously, then you will probably hate it. even the littlest item in the background that people normally don't notice are strategically placed for humor. every part of the boat is comedic in some way, as well as the unique contrast of characters. Bill Murrary is brilliant, as is Owen Wilson when he steps into a character that he would not normally play. Jeff Goldblum and Willem Defoe provide outstanding support, as does every other actor in the film. The situational scenes and added ""fake"" effects make the movie extravagantly cheesy and hilarious. If you don't like this movie, you should probably lighten up and join Team Zissou.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
643,hoopking,I loved the Life Aquatic,9,2 December 2005,"I loved the Life Aquatic. Wes Anderson writes such brilliant films about life, such as the Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore. The movie may not have been hysterical as some viewers wished but it was still very much about the choices we have to consider in life. Career wise, family wise, and life wise. This was a film that I would view over and over with my friends and family and most like grow a larger appreciation for each time. I feel as though Wes Anderson is at the top of his game. This is at least my thoughts but I just loved the film and the film making, it was brilliant. I especially love the use of computer graphics to film many of the animals that can be found in the water and on most of the trip. If you have the time rent this movie and just watch it close, it is worth the trip.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
644,stephaniekochmedia,Jump Cuts,10,1 June 2018,"Something I've noticed in a couple WA movies is a somewhat unusual use of sudden jump cuts. One example is towards the beginning of The Life Aquatic, when Steve and Ned are at a restaurant and Steve goes to drink his wine, the camera jumps forward a few feet and skips forward a fraction of a second. Another example is in Rushmore when Max and Herman are on the elevator in the hospital, Herman sits a bouquet of flowers on the cart behind him. When he reaches to grab them the camera moves forward slightly and skips a fraction of a second. I'm just curious what the purpose of these cuts are. I'm sure there are more examples in his other movies, but these are the only two I've noticed.TLDR curious about the purpose of a couple of odd cuts in Rushmore and The Life Aquatic.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
645,circa86,there was no CG in this movie,9,12 February 2006,"i read someone's comment about using CG, this movie did not use it at all, it used all stop-motion animation, there is a section about this on the DVD, all the fish, the jaguar shark etc. were stop-motion animated puppets. it may only be on the special edition DVD but it is there, it really does look like cg however. the design of the creatures was also fantastic!that just means the animation team did a great jobfantastic movie by the waydoes anyone know what music is playing during the last jaguar shark scene?",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
646,micahtreves,Come together feel good!,9,13 October 2018,"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou by Wes Anderson is by far his most unconventional and seriously goofy film. Released in 2004, Anderson demonstrated a film that took the audience's attention in this outlandish yet curious story of Steve Zissou. Starring Bill Murray, you can expect some peculiar behavior; however, brought together with well fit and confined acting throughout the film. I would recommend this movie for anyone, not because it is some over achieving movie by any means but because of the bizarre plot and message taught from the film. Zissou is a washed-up Oceanographer who struggles to maintain a determined crew. Zissou leads his crew on the Belafonte (his trusty ship) and films marine life and captures wonderful and colorful marine life, which is displayed as CGI in the movie, but it has beauty of its own. The point of Zissou's new mission is to capture and kill the fierce but whimsical jaguar shark who ate his best friend Esteban in the last mission. This drive compelling Zissou is what the whole movie is about, to revenge a dear friend and make friends on the way.  Zissou is a bit of a trouble maker out on the open ocean, breaking into his nemesis's watch tower to steal supplies to track the dreaded ""Jaguar Shark"". Most would imagine this scene to be very intense; however, this is perhaps the calmest Zissou is in the entire movie. He takes your head for a whirl doing exactly what you expect him not to do, Zissou is perhaps a carpe diem maniac. The characters are all special in a way that only ""Steve Zissou"" would hire them as crew members; although many other roles are minor they still are apart.  I would describe this movie as flavorful and not for the action hounds, it's a come together feel good movie about lost man who just wants closure on his dead best friend. This film meshes unusual characters, an original story, goofy but in place acting and importance of family. If you enjoy a movie that takes you on a journey and you don't want to watch too hard then this movie is perfect for you! Great movie, great story and great message.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
647,marc-tomiuk,"Brilliant, impressive and delightful!",10,15 March 2006,"This is the first time I decided to write a review. At the time when Cousteau's documentaries aired regularly, I was still a child. Cousteau and the life he led captivated me and evoked in me a sense of adventure-seeking and fascination with the sea. Wes Anderson managed to not only recapture the Cousteau mystique with a twist but to also take me back to this wonderful time.The Life Aquatic is a brilliant and unique work of art with a wonderful cast. The various subplots are beautifully thought out. Those who cannot connect with this film were simply born at the wrong period. Those who cannot appreciate it are simply much too rigid to understand creative movie-making.I truly hope they make a sequel! Afterall, Cousteau is known to have faked some scenes. Esteban's death could have been part of a ploy. Alternatively, Esteban could have truly survived the attack and was later spit out by the shark near some island ... Let's go Wes! Give us another! You have a winning formula ...Best regards, Marc",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
648,mightymightycoop,"in my opinion, perfect.",10,25 March 2006,"The Life Aquatic is one of those movies that gets better with age. the first time I saw the movie I loved it, but what I really like was the random humor, and while everything seemed so strange, yet it all fit together, from the sets, to the cg animals, to murray's melancholy acting, to the amazing soundtrack. But the more you watch the movie, the more you get from it. The story beneath the aesthetics is very uplifting. Anderson just has a way of making fantastical character more real than most filmmakers can. I think anyone who gives this movie a chance, although it may be a bit different than the blockbusters that most people are used to, will be pleased.",The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
