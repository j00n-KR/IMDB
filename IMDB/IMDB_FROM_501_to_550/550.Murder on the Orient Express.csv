0,TheLittleSongbird,"Doesn't completely derail, but doesn't have enough steam",5,10 November 2017,"'Murder on the Orient Express' as a book is, speaking as a big Agatha Christie fan, one of her best with a compelling and twisty story, many characters that are also nicely developed and one of her most ingenious endings (along with 'And Then There Were None', 'Death on the Nile', 'The Murder of Roger Ackroyd' and 'Witness for the Prosecution').Of the four filmed adaptations of 'Murder on the Orient Express' the only outstanding one is the 1974 Sidney Lumet film, which is one of the best cinematic Agatha Christie adaptations to me. The others are the David Suchet version, which is often considered one of the worst of the series but from personal opinion while very flawed it's better than given credit for, and the 2001 Alfred Molina version which is a mess. This latest version has a good deal going for it but feels like an adaptation too far. Actually saw it a couple of days ago, but was not sure what my thoughts on it were.Let's start with 'Murder on the Orient Express's' good things. It is a very beautiful film visually, very elegantly shot, lots of stunning scenery, sumptuous costumes that are evocative of the period and a train that has the grandeur and claustrophobic confinement that is necessary. The make-up is also wonderfully elaborate. The story does have some intriguing moments and it is a very clever one in the first place. Poirot is an interesting as he should be. Kenneth Branagh does a very nice job with the visual style, the script is thought-provoking and Poirot's crime-solving is delightful. The relative faithfulness to the source material is commendable too.He also stars as Poirot and generally is surprisingly good, he is very commanding, suitably steely and captures his crime-solving skills beautifully. He could however have brought out more of Poirot's lighter and more eccentric side, like the obsessiveness, there isn't enough of that here. The cast is star studded and generally the acting is very good. Standouts include Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, a surprisingly well-cast and suitably conflicted Josh Gad and Daisy Ridley, Derek Jacobi and Willem Dafoe also make much of not very much.Conversely, there are other elements that don't work. The mystery itself is intriguing as a story but doesn't have enough tension or energy. With so many characters and so much focus on Poirot, the exploration of the supporting characters is limited, meaning many of the characters are really sketchy in development. Branagh excels in the visual side of the direction but it comes at the expense at providing enough depth to the mystery.The film has a slow and awkwardly staged beginning and the ingenious denouement feels under-cooked and contrived for an ending so justifiably famous and brilliant. Just to make it clear, the problem is not the denouement itself, it's the execution of it that's the problem. While the cast are on very good form mostly, an exception is Johnny Depp. Really didn't get the sense that Rachett was a nasty piece of work, like in the book and especially Toby Jones' interpretation in the Suchet adaptation when talking of the previous versions, and that the performance was too much of a pale caricature of Depp's lesser roles. Have really liked a lot of what Patrick Doyle has done, but this is not one of his better music scores. It's not awful, but it is blandly uninspired and its slightly syrupy feel doesn't fit. Oh, and Branagh's moustache is like a character of its own and am really not sure as to whether that is a compliment or not.In summary, some good things that stops it from completely derailing but the lack of steam makes it a bland endeavour, this wonderful story and Christie deserve better. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Murder on the Orient Express
1,bkoganbing,Was justice served?,5,10 March 2018,"Kenneth Branagh stars and directed this massive production of Murder On The
Orient Express replete with a lot preliminary back stories. But for the most 
part once we get down to it it's the same old Agatha Christie tale.Having seen the 1973 film that starred Albert Finney as the world famous Belgian 
sleuth and the smaller BBC production that David Suchet did, this runs a distinct
third. You can design wondrful period sets to tell the story in, but this version
is overwhelmed by the opulence. It's still an intimate story told within the
confines of a railroad car.I still remember Albert Finney in the 1973 film giving the solution of the murder of Ratchett telling the other passengers he knows full well what happened. He sure didn't agonize as Branagh does here. A lot of familiar folks like Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pheiffer, Judy Dench etc.
fill out the roles of the passengers in the sleeping car who all have a connection of sorts. Johnny Depp is the American gangster victim and he's
quite serious in the part, no Captain Jack Sparrow scenery chewing.And throughout the entire film I was waiting for the other members of the
barbershop chorus to join Kenneth Branagh in a snappy chorus of Sweet
Adeline. Ken, that walrus mustache was too much.",Murder on the Orient Express
2,Leofwine_draca,Everything wrong with Hollywood,4,3 January 2021,"An uninteresting new version of the classic Agatha Christie murder mystery, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS screams everything that's wrong with modern Hollywood. It's been shot on a fake-looking green screen of snowbound vistas, and from the moment it randomly adds martial arts into the story early on I knew it wouldn't be much good. An impressive all-star cast is assembled only for the actors to be wasted in paper-thin roles, while Kenneth Branagh's Poirot gets all of the screen time and attention. He's surprisingly average in the role, easily exceeded by the earlier stars who played the character; Ustinov, for example, but in particular the definitive Suchet. The film adds humour and quirk to the tale but just begins dragging after a while, leading to a shrill and hysterical climax.",Murder on the Orient Express
3,SnoopyStyle,beautiful but lacking,6,13 February 2018,"After solving a case at the Wailing Wall, famed detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) takes a boat to Istanbul where he boards the Orient Express with various characters. While crossing the Alps, the train is stuck in the snow and a murder occurs. Poirot must find the culprit and its connection to a famous child kidnap-murder case.Branagh uses his skills to create beautiful stages on which his actors can perform. The only problem is that the characters are little more than facades. They are surfaces without interiors. While it's impressively beautiful, there isn't any blood pumping through this story. It begins with Branagh and his crazy mustache. It's an artifice in place of real character work. It also draws attention away from any real work. There is an artificiality with the whole world although it is a beautiful art world. I do wonder if this is the best way to update the adaptation of this classic.",Murder on the Orient Express
4,Hitchcoc,The Little Engine That Couldn't,6,11 November 2017,"I have to agree with several others who have commented on this film. It lacks any sort of spark. Each actor plays to the camera and there is little interaction among them. Johnny Depp is pretty good as the victim, but even he seems a caricature. It is a star studded cast and that may have been a mistake. Branagh's Poirot is so dull. And that awful mustache. It looks like he glued on the bristles from a hair brush. The plot is confusing and there is little mystery. When I saw the first film, I knew the ending, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are several strange events that take place in this one. Poirot is way to brusque and unpleasant. My picture of him is a kind of shyness. The ending scene, where things are explained and the murderer revealed, is incredibly dull. Too much hoopla and not enough good direction.",Murder on the Orient Express
5,Horst_In_Translation,An okay movie if you aren't looking for great depth or significance,6,2 December 2017,"""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a new American 110-minute film from this year (2017) that is directed by Oscar nominee Kenneth Branagh who also plays the main character Hercule Poirot and the entire thing is based on an Agatha Christie novel. This one has seen many versions already, but I personally am not biased here because I have seen neither and I also haven't read the book. The script is by Emmy nominee Michael Green and seeing how much I loved his work on the recent Logan, I must say I am a bit disappointed here. With this cast, a lot more was possible. We have Oscar winners Cruz and Dench, Golden Globe winners Depp and Pfeiffer, rising stars Ridley and Gad and a couple other familiar faces like Dafoe, a personal favorite. The ending suggests a sequel, so it seems Branagh may not yet be done, but is the success here really enough for another? We will see. I am not disappointed by Branagh, but I am also not too impressed by his turn as Poirot. Then again, he is just an observer for the most part as except before the murder, the film is far more about the other passengers than about him.I liked that, despite the beard, they were not going for a fun or comedy film (there are only very few somewhat funny moments), but for a dark gritty movie that involves more murder than the one happening on the train. Sadly, the investigation itself was hardly convincing. The ways in which finally every passenger has a dark secret and a motive were certainly unrealistic, even if the eventual solution at least explains it a bit. I am not too much of a fan of that one either that basically everybody did it. The (unloaded) gun scene towards the end was as underwhelming and out of place as his final decision to let them all go. But that's just personal preference I guess. The last 40 minutes or so were still very much on the disappointing side for me and also meant that this is definitely not among the best the year has to offer from the crime genre. The film's biggest pro is the visual side. The costumes and sets inside the train as well as the cinematography and surroundings outside were really just as good as it gets, so I would not be too surprised if the film gets in once or twice at the Oscars.Overall, it was an okay watch that had many weaknesses though that move the movie closer to forgettable terrain than very good terrain. A bit of a shame as this could/should have been much better. Then again, some flaws may already be inside the original literary work I guess like the (to me) unsatisfying ending. It was still good enough to be somewhat curious about a possible sequel in Egypt and I'd probably watch it if they really make it. However, I am certainly not too enthusiastic about it. Back to this one here: The one area where the film makes no impact or references at all is the time component, nothing about politics or society from the indeed interesting time when the film is set. As a whole, this is a decent whodunit film that may have you guessing for the most part who the killer is and if you pay close attention to the exact way in which Depp's character was killed and the number of stabbing wounds, then maybe you have the right idea early on already, even if you perhaps (like myself) will lose the idea pretty quickly thinking it's too absurd. Sadly, it is not. A cautious thumbs-up from me. Go see it, but keep your expectations down.",Murder on the Orient Express
6,Prismark10,A dashing Poirot,7,10 February 2018,"There was a very good star studded version of Murder in the Orient Express made in 1974 by Sidney Lumet starring Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot.I thought the later David Suchet television movie was disappointing.Kenneth Branagh stars and directs this new version wearing a massive moustache which surprisingly was not too distracting, even if it did make him look like a walrus.This is a stylish and muscular film with a star studded cast. Johnny Depp is the villain who becomes the victim on the train ride. Judi Dench, Michelle Pfieffer, Derek Jacobi, Willem Dafoe, Penelope Cruz are just some of the suspects.It is an enjoyable film even if you are familiar with the ending. Branagh gets to grips with the rather fussy detective who finds murder abhorrent. Even though Poirot is tired he cannot resist exercising those tiny grey cells once more.This Poirot does not overdo the humour and as the director he keeps the movie rattling along.",Murder on the Orient Express
7,claudio_carvalho,"Totally Disappointing, Despite the Great Cast and Art Direction",4,27 February 2018,"""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a totally disappointing film, despite the great cast and art direction. The classic Agatha Christie´s novel and his detective Hercule Poiro never works in a boring screenplay with non-likable characters. Fans of Agatha Christie will certainly hate this forgettable version. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Assassinato no Expresso do Oriente"" (""Murder on the Orient Express"")",Murder on the Orient Express
8,nogodnomasters,Romance never goes unpunished.,4,24 November 2017,"This is a remake of the iconic classic with Kenneth Branagh as Detective Hercule Poirot. Judi Dench leads an all-star cast of suspects as Johnny Depp bites the dust. As Poirot investigates the suspect becomes every person he questions as they are all somehow connected to the victim.What is missing was the back story on how they all came to be on the train at the same time pretending not to know each other. They changed the film from the book so there were a number of plot holes. It was a let down from the 1974 film and many of thew films which spoof Agatha Christie's works. I don't blame the actors who gave great performances. It is not ""Earthquake"" 1974 bad, but similar in that it was a waste of talent.A film to watch later as a rental or when it is in the deep discount bin.",Murder on the Orient Express
9,kosmasp,On track,7,21 November 2018,"I haven't seen the original 70s adaptation of the movie. I wanted to before watching this, but a friend wanted to watch it and I just did. I actually quite enjoyed it. It starts quite nice with a twist in the first case if you want to call it that. Generally speaking Kenneth does a great job directing and acting in his own movie.
The scope cinematically speaking is just amazing. You can't fault the movie when it comes to the cinematography. I think the acting is really good and the story is tension filled, so there goes that. I did not see the conclusion coming the way it did, but I guess it makes sense. And even then you get another nod at the end of this to something that might be in the Horizon. Sign me up for it, is what I would say. Entertaining and more than decent overall",Murder on the Orient Express
10,Sleepin_Dragon,"Visually stunning, fairly decent film.",7,18 November 2017,"I must admit as an Agatha Christie obsessed fan, my initial thoughts were of pure joy, it's been a while since Agatha Christie was on the big screen, appealing to new fans, and how magnificent that such a stellar cast was assembled. Then I thought, of all the titles, why go for such an obvious choice, which has been done several times.Firstly, the film is undeniably beautiful, the costumes, sets, filming etc, the film will undoubtedly win an Oscar for the visuals. You can see big money was put into the look of the film.My major irritation throughout, was his moustache, just absurdly over the top, when Depp and Pfeiffer should have been dominating scenes, all I could look at was that moustache. That apart Branagh was excellent, I never thought he'd carry it off, but he did.I am intrigued as to whether this is a one off film, or if there'll be the odd appearance on the big screen. Only time will tell.All in all, it was good, I wanted and hoped to absolutely love it, unfortunately I didn't, but no way is it as bad as some say, too much quality for that.7/10 (hoped for a perfect 10!)",Murder on the Orient Express
11,classicsoncall,"""I do not approve of murder, my friend.""",10,2 September 2018,"It's been a couple of years since I saw the Sidney Lumet directed version, so a definitive comparison between the two pictures is difficult to make. Both films have an exceptionally talented cast, so in that regard it's a toss-up. From what I can recall though, Albert Finney's portrayal of Hercule Poirot simply cracked me up with all the physical and facial contortions he went through to interpret the character. Kenneth Branagh comes across much more seriously, and his sarcastic barbs to characters that irritate him are done with dagger like precision. Like a lot of reviewers here, I thought the mustache business was a bit overdone, but the best was when we got a view of Poirot waking up wearing that mustache guard in place. Talk about vanity.If this is one's first viewing of any of the filmed versions of the story, what comes across as coincidence defying probability is the connection that all the riders on the Orient Express share with an old kidnapping case that resulted in the death of a young child. The circumstances become clearer as the story unfolds, and it's done in credible fashion, so one's patience is rewarded. The resolution to the murder mystery aboard the train is one of Agatha Christie's writing triumphs, and is handled well, even after one of the train's passengers takes credit for the killing of Ratchett/Casetti (Johnny Depp).I'm usually in tune with most reviewers in my estimation of a picture, but in this case, the relatively low score for this 'Murder' seems unjustified. True, director Kenneth Branagh probably gave himself more favorable screen time than necessary in the unfolding of the mystery, and some of the ancillary characters seem rushed. However the period detail and outstanding cinematography compensate for a lot, and Poirot's final verdict is rendered much more skillfully than Albert Finney was able to get away with. In this picture, it just felt right that no one would have to stand trial for murder, and if push came to shove, who would it have been anyway?",Murder on the Orient Express
12,jboothmillard,Murder on the Orient Express,7,23 November 2017,"This is one of the most recognised of all the novels by Agatha Christie, the 1974 Sidney Lumet / Albert Finney film is the most memorable of the adaptations, there has also been the TV movie with Alfred Molina, and TV's Poirot with David Suchet, this was the latest adaptation, directed by Sir Kenneth Branagh (Henry V, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Hamlet, Thor). Basically in the winter of 1934, famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot (Sir Kenneth Branagh) looks forward to taking a break from his work, after solving a a theft in Jerusalem, he is travelling to Istanbul, aboard the Orient Express. Other passengers travelling on the train are: talkative American socialite Caroline Hubbard (Michelle Pfeiffer); unpleasant American businessman Samuel Ratchett (Johnny Depp), his American secretary Hector MacQueen (Frozen's Josh Gad) and his English valet Edward Henry Masterman (Sir Derek Jacobi), elderly Russian Princess Natalia Dragomiroff (Dame Judi Dench) and her German maid Fräulein Hildegarde Schmidt (Olivia Colman); Hungarian diplomat Count Rudolph Andrenyi (Sergei Polunin) and his wife Helena (Lucy Boynton); former military sniper Dr. John Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom Jr.); governess Mary Debenham (Star Wars' Daisy Ridley); Spanish missionary Pilar Estravados (Penélope Cruz); Cuban businessman Biniamino Marquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo); and Austrian scholar Gerhard Hardman (Willem Dafoe). The morning after the train's departure, Ratchett tells Poriot he has received many death threats, he tries to secure the detective's services for a high sum, but Poirot knows of Ratchett's criminal reputation and refuses. That night the train is caught in an avalanche, the train is derailed and the passengers are stranded, besides this, Poirot is disturbed numerous times during the night by strange noises, and characters passing his cabin. The next morning, Ratchett is found stabbed to death in his cabin, next door to Poirot, the detective and his friend Bouc (Tom Bateman), director of the Orient Express, work together to solve the case. The body examination reveals Ratchett was stabbed 12 times, some wounds were slight, but at least three could have resulted in death, Poirot recalls the noises, it is indicated the murder was around 1:15am. The train is held up by the deep snow and the train on a high bridge, so the murderer is still among the passengers, and a number of clues could pinpoint to the suspect, including a broken pocket watch, a pipe-cleaner, a woman's handkerchief with the initial ""H"" and a fragment of a burned letter. Examining the letter, Poirot discovers that Ratchett was in fact Mafia gangster Cassetti, five years ago he carried out the kidnapping and killing of infant Daisy Armstrong, daughter of wealthy British Army Colonel Hamish Armstrong, overcome with grief, the pregnant Mrs. Armstrong went into labour early and died while giving birth to a stillborn baby, a French maidservant named Paulette committed suicide, and Colonel Armstrong consumed by these tragedies killed himself as well, and Casetti fled the country with the ransom, betraying his partner, leaving him to be executed. Poirot, Constantine and Bouc begin their interrogation of the passengers, with Poirot questioning them all one by one about the night of the murder, each passenger have a motive to kill Ratchett, so any could be the murderer. After concluding his investigation, Poirot gathers all the suspects outside in the train tunnel to present his solution, he has formulated two possible scenarios to explain the murder. The first is the simple solution, based on several clues suggesting that Cassetti's murder was the result of a mafia feud. Poirot then explains his second and much more complex solution, where every suspect has a link to the Armstrong case, and has sufficient motive for the murder. After explaining each of the suspects' reasons to kill, a flashback reveals that Ratchett was sedated, the pipe- cleaner and handkerchief (a Cyrillic ""N"" resembles a Roman ""H"") were planted, incidents which disturbed Poirot's sleep were contrived to confuse him, each of the passengers then stabbed Cassetti in turn, in an act of justice. When Poirot finishes his explanation, everyone is silent, the detective challenges the passengers to shoot him, placing a gun in front of all suspects, they all know he can expose their plot, as the one who orchestrated everything, Mrs. Hubbard grabs the gun, but instead tries to take her own life, but the gun is unloaded, Poirot wished to see how the suspects would react. During this time, the rescue crew have placed the train back on the tracks and cleared the snow, Poirot concludes that there is no justice to be found in the case, and Ratchett deserved his fate, he states that for the first time he will have to live with imbalance. In the end, Poirot tells Yugoslavian police it was a lone killer, allowing all suspects to leave, he leaves the train at the next station, there he is approached by a messenger, informed about a death on the Nile, he has been asked to investigate, Poriot accepts the case and taken by car. Branagh has the most brilliantly ridiculous huge moustache and is good as the insightful detective, the supporting cast of famous faces all do their parts well also, there are not too many big changes to murder setup and conclusion, obviously there are necessary tweaks to add more scale, with the odd pacy moment and action out of the train into the white wilderness, including the traditional ""gathering"" scene, it just about keeps you guessing, and its period detail and alternative style are fine, it is a wonderfully performed and interesting murder mystery. Very good!",Murder on the Orient Express
13,Tweekums,An enjoyable murder mystery with a famous twist,8,20 September 2018,"Following a prologue, where Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, exposes a thief in Jerusalem, our protagonist heads to Istanbul where he boards the Orient Express, bound for London. After dinner he is approached by a man who claims to be an antiques dealer who feels in danger after selling dodgy goods to the wrong people. Poirot declines the request for help. The following night the train is derailed by an avalanche; when the compartments are checked the man is found dead... with multiple stab wounds. Poirot is soon investigating; the problem isn't a shortage of clues but an excess... each pointing to a different suspect. Before the case is solved he will uncover truths about the dead man and how various people on board are connected to him.I was surprised to see just how unpopular this film appears to be as I really enjoyed it; perhaps that was because it was quite a while since I'd seen any other Poirot mystery so could accept Kenneth Branagh, and his ridiculous moustache, in the role. Despite knowing who did it before watching the story was fun to watch. The case provides plenty of clues to keep our protagonist, and the viewer, guessing. Even if you know how it ends seeing how that conclusion is reached is entertaining. The all-star cast does a fine job bringing their somewhat over-the-top characters to life. The opening scenes are somewhat superfluous for anybody familiar with Poirot but serves as a nice demonstration of how quick thinking he is for viewers new to the character. Overall I'd say this was an enjoyable film but acknowledge that may be a minority opinion.",Murder on the Orient Express
14,moonspinner55,"""A riot of clues dropped most conveniently...yet only one appears, however, to be perhaps genuine!""",3,14 November 2017,"In 1934, Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot, traveling by train from Istanbul to London, finds himself in the middle of a murder case after he discovers one of the passengers dead in his compartment, stabbed 12 times in his bed during the night. With the Orient Express stagnant on a bridge due to an avalanche, Poirot has a great deal of time to interrogate all the passengers on-board to determine motive and expose the killer. Second film-adaptation of Agatha Christie's mystery novel had big shoes to fill left behind by the classy 1974 all-star version, although neither picture is particularly suspenseful or exciting, which is probably the fault of the source material (this tale not being one of Christie's best murder stories). Kenneth Branagh both directed this version and stars as Poirot, and his acting has a bit of the sly lift that his pacing and his arranging of key scenes lack. Branagh's opening, with Poirot in Jerusalem defending three holy men on a charge of theft, falls victim to maladroit staging which typifies the rest: a busy camera (or an even busier editor) chasing after the action instead of relaying it. Scenes are squeezed for whatever Branagh is going for--levity one minute, high drama the next--while always presenting Poirot as the master detective, meticulous and unruffled and never doubting his instincts. The problem with this portrait is: we perceive all of Poirot's fussy characteristics within the first 20 minutes--the rest of time is spent admiring Branagh as he repeats himself. The supporting cast is poorly-handled by the director (including a too-sweet young lad in the prologue); the suspects are colorless both in their conception by screenwriter Michael Green and in the performances by a most underwhelming assemblage of players. There are some nice computer-enhanced shots of the train whistling its way through snowy mountain terrain, and we do get a vivid sense of movement from inside the Orient Express before it becomes snowbound on the tracks. However, the final summation is a fizzle, as is Johnny Depp's waxworks-like performance as a disgruntled American businessman, a thankless role formerly assigned to Richard Widmark. *1/2 from ****",Murder on the Orient Express

But still, I wanted to see it because of the impressive cast list they had managed to get together.This movie was nothing extraordinary, so I must admit that I was a little bit disappointed especially with the impressive cast they had gotten together for the movie. Sure there were some nice performances by most of the cast, but it felt like half of the cast weren't even utilized to their full potential much less given nowhere near enough time on the screen.The entire movie was just weighed down by mediocrity, and what felt like a half-hearted story.""Murder on the Orient Express"" was quite nice visually and they really had put a lot of attention to detail.But all in all, then the end result was a mediocre movie of something that most definitely had potential.

16,blanche-2,gorgeous-looking with stupid additions and one UNACCEPTABLE omission,6,1 December 2017,"Kenneth Branagh and and all-star cast ride the Orient Express in ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" a remake of the magnificent 1974 film. The stars, besides Branagh, are Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Judy Dench, Penelope Cruz, Daisy Ridley, and Leslie Odom, Jr.For those who don't know the story, it concerns the murder on the Orient Express, which is stalled out due to an avalanche. Poirot is asked to investigate and finds many clues and many anomalies.The care taken with the cinematography, the costumes, the performances, the interior settings of the train, all went out the window when the screenwriter failed to deliver. First off, we have Hercules Poirot, who looks ridiculous, solving an unrelated case, then talking to a picture of his beloved Katherine. Who the hell is she? Why was this added?Also, if you know the story, it's possibly more interesting than if you don't. One thing I will say, unlike others, is that the film didn't seem boring to me or my sisters. I imagine you'll find that complaint from younger people, but I could be wrong.I could have put up with anything, but when a script introduces a clue and Poirot doesn't pick up on - uh, we have a problem. The problem is sloppy writing. On the night that Ratchit was killed, a disturbance is heard, and the porter knocks on the door to see if he's all right. He answers in French. Here he says, ""It's nothing."" In the original film, he says, ""cauchemar"" (nightmare). Why tell us that and then have one of the characters say that Ratchit didn't speak a word of French, if Poirot wasn't going to realize a) he didn't answer; and b) someone else was in his room. But that clue is never brought up. No, these writers can't be bothered with a petty detail like that.Branagh is a youngish, attractive Poirot with an absurd mustache - although he is good, it's not enough, and he's not Poirot. It's always a pleasure to see people like Jacobi, Colman, Pfeiffer. It's a good cast, but the original cast was on a consistently higher level with Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Vanessa Redgrave, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery - I could go on but you get the point. With its extraneous story details and lack of wit, I'm giving this a 6. Hollywood, come up with something original.",Murder on the Orient Express
17,Quinoa1984,(Reading Dickens: LOL),7,12 November 2017,"(This is less a traditional review than some scattered thoughts):First thought/complaint: How in god's name are they out there in what is supposed to be cold and sub-zero enough to give everyone ""exposure"" for so long in just regular jackets and coats? Come on, Kenny my man, do better than that. Second thought: while the best Agatha Christie movie of this decade still is and will likely remain The Hateful Eight, this is engaging, dramatic and full of robust performances (Johnny Depp hasn't been this good/sleazy in a decade, even as he has a relatively small role, luckily it's not the size but the keyness of it). It actually helped that I hadn't seen another version of this story - yes, shame on me for not seeing the Lumet one, I'll get on it soon - and the ending was sadder than I expected, which is good. Branaugh keeps his audience on his toes and there isn't a false note in the performances.Third thought: This is not directorially up to par with Henry V and Hamlet, but I'm glad to see Branaugh still has it in in him to make a film full of vitality and visual ideas that are a little wild and a little of the usual (black and white flashbacks, really?) But where it counts, the movie is fully involving and the story shines however you cut it - in that way I'd rank this alongside something like the recent Great Gatsby adaptation: as long as you really get the goods right, and don't go TOO crazy stylistically, what works will shine through (also I mean, Pfeiffer, Dafoe, Cruz, even Josh goddamn Gad are stand-outs, and Ridley's fine too though now she just like has to do a movie where she and Kiera Knightley are sisters, right, like that has to happen now contractually).Oh, and the CGi... eh.... But my positives outweigh the negatives here. Mostly. It's a wonderful whodunit story that kept me on my toes and had a procedural tone that kept me wholly invested. Not to mention, naturally, that giant mustache that is like a mustache that grew a mustache - or, more to the point, the Human Stachipede.",Murder on the Orient Express
18,Coventry,Agatha Christie certainly doesn't need to be ashamed,7,22 December 2017,"Yours truly is a massive admirer of Mrs. Agatha Christie! If her hand-written grocery lists ever become published, I will surely read them and watch the film adaptations! Many people in my surrounding asked me if I was ecstatic when the news got spread about the upcoming and hi-budgeted new version of ""Murder on the Orient Express"". Well, yes and no. Contrary to general belief, there certainly isn't a shortage of Agatha Christie adaptations. The ""Queen of Crime"" died more than 40 years ago, but just recently I purchased the newly released mini-series ""And then there were none"" and ""Witness for the Prosecution"", which are both produced by the BBC and star an impressive list of famous players. Indeed, there hasn't been a cinematic adaptation in quite a while, but personally I didn't see the need for one. Fans of Christie's work can easily enough find the aforementioned mini-series, or a variety of other TV-series, on DVD, but are her writings still appealing enough to be shown on the big screen? After all, Christie delivered old-fashioned whodunits and convoluted detective stories that invite the audience to guess along for clues and red herrings, but my impression is that people generally don't care for these anymore. Whodunit stories have evolved into CSI showcasing and modern detectives turned into superheroes who are able to solve a crime before it properly happened, like for example in the new ""Sherlock"" series with Benedict Cumberbatch. Of course I'm happy there is a new Christie adaptation, but honestly I was even more concerned that it would flop at the box office. Kenneth Brannagh even took an additional - but comprehensible - risk by choosing ""Murder on the Orient Express"" as his project. Partially thanks to the fantastic 1974 film version directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Albert Finny, this has arguably become Christie's most well-known tale and literally everyone who saw the film or read the book will have remembered the denouement. But once again it turns out that I was overly worried! Kenneth Brannagh's ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is by no means a masterpiece, but certainly an entertaining and very competently made mystery/thriller. I'm grateful that it remained a traditional adaptation that treats the source material with great respect. In other words, Hercule Poirot luckily didn't rejuvenate into a martial-arts action hero, while the cinematography and decors are kept stylish and sober rather than turning the whole thing into a hyperkinetic and winnable trendy ""The Matrix"" clone. And the story? Well, the story is still powerful enough to remain surprising and absorbing. Just as the 1974 version, this film can rely on an impressive all-star cast including names like Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench and Dereck Jacobi. Some of these big names have really few screen time, but they will lure people to the theater nevertheless. Kenneth Brannagh himself depicts an admirable and likable Hercule Poirot, although perhaps the size of the iconic mustache is slightly exaggerated.",Murder on the Orient Express

It was a big ask for Kenneth Branagh to replace David Suchet as Poirot in our minds, but he puts a different spin on the character that is entertaining.I have not read the original source material, so can make not points about how accurate a retelling it is, but for nearly two hours of escapism I found this to be an entertaining film.",Murder on the Orient Express

Aboard is an all-star cast including Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) who is trying to relax. However an avalanche leaves the train stranded for a few days. In that time a passenger is brutally murdered. Poirot reluctantly agrees to solve the murder.Well-done remake of the 1970s original. It LOOKS great--wonderful production design and costumes. Also it's beautifully directed by Branagh--some shots of the Express moving through the snow took my breath away. Good acting by the cast too--especially Branagh (although his mustache is distracting) and Michelle Pfeiffer. Still it is slow at times. Also I knew the twist ending from the original so I always knew what was coming up. Still it WAS well-done and if you don't know the ending you might like it more than me.

How does it disappoint? Let me count the ways. For one thing it's a remake and I've yet to see a remake that equals let alone eclipses the original. For reasons best known to the producers they contrive to attach an opening segment set in Jerusalem that has absolutely no bearing on the main thrust of the plot, and perhaps worse they ignore every chance to feature the Orient Express as what it is, one of the most glamorous and iconic trains in the world, for all the footage it gets as, let's face it, a character in its own right, it might as well be the Hastings Flyer and/or the 9.17 to Leighton Buzzard. The outrageous plot - a motley group of passengers all with reason to despise the victim, contrive against astronomical odds to take the same train as the victim and then place a knife where it will do the most good - is so unbelievable it needs all the help it can get, help with this cast, distinguished as they may be, don't have it in them to give.

23,zardoz-13,"If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It!",6,13 December 2017,"Director Kenneth Branagh's cinematic adaptation Agatha Christie's classic whodunit ""Murder on the Orient Express"" qualifies as lush, atmospheric, but sadly pretentious. Clearly, Branagh and ""Blade Runner 2049"" scenarist Michael Green don't subscribe to the adage ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" This big-screen remake doesn't surpass director Sidney Lumet's superior version from 1974 that c0-starred Sean Connery, Michael York, Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Richard Widmark, and Anthony Perkins. Branagh doesn't muster a cast the caliber of the Lumet version, and he wears out his welcome with a running time that clocks in mysteriously under two hours. The Lumet version was far longer, but it rolls back a lightning speed. Branagh and Green have maintained the same time period, but they have changed up some of the murder suspects. The austere British colonel that Connery portrayed has been replaced with an African-American doctor who is having an amorous relationship with a Caucasian lady. Unlike the Christie novel, the film doesn't have the train come to a stop because of too much snow on the tracks, but because the train has derailed. Furthermore, Branagh and Green have tacked on a prologue that is entirely dispensable. Honorable mention must go to Jim Clay and his production designs as well as the set decorators. If you have read the Christie novel, you will not be surprised at anything that happens, except for Hercule Poirot's OCD that enables him to ferret out the criminals. If you haven't see the Lumet version and you haven't read the novel, you may find the film rewarding. Nevertheless, Lumet's version tops Branagh's rendition.",Murder on the Orient Express
24,grantss,Dull and unnecessary - watch the 1974 version instead,4,11 September 2018,"Famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is travelling on the Orient Express when a murder is committed. The victim was a particularly obnoxious man with a criminal past. As clues are revealed it is apparent that many of the other passengers on the train had a motive to kill him, making Poirot's task of identifying the murderer much more difficult.Dull and unnecessary. The 1974 version of Murder On the Orient Express, directed by Sidney Lumet, was superb. A great mixture of intrigue, atmosphere and 1930s quaintness combined with great performances from an all-star cast (Albert Finney, Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, Jacqueline Bisset, Martin Balsam, John Gielgud, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark and Michael York). Finney was perfect as Poirot.In this version, director Kenneth Branagh somehow manages to make an Agatha Christie mystery dull. It just feels like a straightforward, paint-by-numbers adaptation of the book. Intrigue is minimal, and is often replaced by action (presumably to appeal to modern audiences). Maybe it is because I already knew the solution to the mystery, but the whole thing felt so flat.Once again we have an all-star cast - Branagh, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, Willem Dafoe - yet this time the performances feel subdued and uninspired. Branagh, for all his acting talent, is clearly not in the same league as the legendary Poirot performers - Albert Finney, Peter Ustinov and David Suchet. Even his Belgian accent seems fake! (And don't get me started on the facial hair!). Some of the oddities he imbues Poirot with are quite unnecessary and feel like quirkiness for quirkiness sake.Unnecessary, just like this movie.

You just have to ask yourself, which two Real Life people from the 1900s are mentioned here? Johnny Depp tells Kenneth Branagh that the only OTHER famous person he's met was when ""I once rode a bus with Ty Cobb in Detroit."" The remaining Real Life references are to Josef Stalin, one of current Red Commie KGB Boss Vlad ""The Mad Russian"" Putin's ancestors as Russkie Strongmen. Therefore, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS's REAL focus is entirely on Putin's White House Sock-Puppet-in-Chief, Don Juan Rump, since it singles out Rump's current criminal lawyer--Ty Cobb (who happens to be some sort of descendant of the Honest Ty Cobb)--and Rump's boss, Stalin heir Putin. Therefore, the cast and crew of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS are telling us that our beleaguered Homeland, America, IS the Orient Express, Scar-faced Gangster Johnny Depp is playing Rump, and it's up to each and every one of us to come prepared to the table for our long overdue ""Night of the Long Knives!""",Murder on the Orient Express

Another theatrical knight and a Dame join some high profile Americans, Rey from the new Star Wars and the idiot snowman from Frozen. All of them have fun especially offscreen - chatshows make it clear the rapport between them.I suspect they have more fun than the audience. After a while I started to lose interest in the wealth of detail about the interest in, and connections to, a crime which was not the one being investigated. I was force fed a vast amount of information, not all of it relevant (or ""red herrings"" as such stuff is known in the Whodunnit game), and I suspect this sort of information dump works better on the printed page, when you are able to go back and re-check who said what to and about whom.This is not altogether successful, although it is not without merit (star power, and the opening sequence in Jerusalem, to name two).",Murder on the Orient Express

The 2010 episode of the David Suchet series suffers by comparison, and so does this latest remake. As a director, Kenneth Brannagh has some visual ideas (a shot near the end deliberately recalls The Last Supper) and orchestrates some impressively fluid camera movements, but he botches the most iconic sequence of the original (the ritualistic re-construction of the crime), and he adds unnecessary ""modernisms"" (Poirot in physical action). As Poirot, he is rather unconvincing, but you get used to him; none of the other cast members stand out the way, for example, John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller stood out in the original (Daisy Ridley comes closest). The film has sweeping production values, but is short on atmosphere and detective work.

29,ferguson-6,can't blame the butler,7,9 November 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. Who doesn't love a good whodunit? Don't we all find a bit of guilty pleasure in being the mastermind who solves a fictitious murder case? Has anyone ever been better at crafting an intricate murder mystery than Agatha Christie? Why all the questions? Well, that's nothing compared to what ""probably the world's greatest detective"", Hercule Poirot, must answer amidst the foul play aboard the sleek, luxurious, and snowbound Orient Express.This latest film version has Michael Green (BLADE RUNNER 2049, LOGAN) with the adapted screenplay and Kenneth Branagh directing and starring as the fabulously mustachioed Poirot (with his own take on the iconic super-sleuth). Like the near-perfect 1974 version, this latest adaptation succeeds in capturing the theatricality, while avoiding any stodgy staginess. Director Branagh shot on film and it pays off in both the stunning snow-covered mountains and landscapes, as well as the tight, precisely-blocked interior shots around the exceptional set designs.Fans of the novel will notice some shifting of character names, professions and backgrounds, although the vast majority of the story remains intact  including the early murder that occurs not long after the film ingeniously introduces us to each of the characters. The cast is strong and deep, and in addition to Mr. Branagh, features: Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Dame Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom Jr, Josh Gad, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Lucy Boynton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Olivia Coleman, Sergei Polunin, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo. All are suspects – well, except the victim.If you haven't read the novel or seen a previous version, know that the fun is in ride. Follow along as Poirot dispenses zingers throughout, while maintaining a most precise commitment to balance in all things. He is an exacting and fastidious man, and as entertaining as he is skilled in crime solving. Note that the photograph he keeps of his one true love Katherine, is actually a photo of young Emma Thompson (Branagh's real life wife). Enjoy keeping track of the clues and hints, while also tracking the widely diverse personalities, excuses and alibis. Most of the many characters only have a couple of key scenes, and it's quite fun to see what these talented performers make of their moments. Daisy Ridley, Lucy Boynton and Derek Jacobi make the most of their time, while Penelope Cruz overplays hers. Other than Branagh, the star who shines the brightest is Michelle Pfeiffer (fresh off a killer performance in MOTHER!). She continues to remind us just how talented she is, and no, your ears aren't playing tricks  that's Ms. Pfeiffer singing ""Never Forget"" (lyrics by Branagh) as the closing credits roll.Ms. Christie's outstanding novel was first published in 1934, and is somewhat based on the Lindbergh baby kidnapping and her own train- riding adventure. It's a wonderful and perplexing read  one that will have you changing your mind multiple times on who you believe to be guilty of murder. There have been numerous movie versions over the years, and none have matched the excellence of director Sidney Lumet's 1974 film with an incredible all-star cast alongside Albert Finney's Poirot. Though this most recent movie doesn't reach the timelessness of that one, no movie can capture the detail and maze- like structure of the novel.

The plot (which must be guarded well for future viewers) is as follows: Having just solved a mysterious theft in Jerusalem, the famed Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh), is in need of balancing things in his life with a small vacation, in 1934 Istanbul. Instead, the vigilant detective will soon find himself aboard the luxurious Orient Express on a trip to Calais, sharing a carriage with an eclectic assortment of first-class travellers (Penelope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe et al) and an invisible murderer who walks unnoticed among them. When a sudden massive avalanche blocks the tracks, trapping the passengers in the locomotive, the gruesome murder of a commuter in his cabin will force Poirot to solve a conundrum where everyone is a suspect.

Kenneth Branagh crushed it as Hercule Poirot and the supporting characters complemented the main character, Hercule, with there limited character arches. What did not work: As much as the makers tried to do a modern upgrade of Murder on the Orient Express the story is still old. The murder mystery genera from the 70's and 80's aka Columba, Mattlock, Murder She Wrote etc follow the Agatha Christie model, which is tired, and old.

The 1974 version of Murder On The Orient Express was better, there is no doubt about that, and it's not because we already knew the outcome now. This version looked all too dramatic to me, and even with big names as Johnny Depp, Penélope Cruz, or Michelle Pfeiffer, you don't get a better movie. Why they chose a British actor (Kenneth Branagh) to play the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is also something I can't understand and that I can't approve. There are enough good French or Belgian actors that can speak English that would do better with this role. Kenneth Branagh's French imitation accent is just not believable, certainly not for a Belgian like me. Agatha Christie's stories are just better as a book than as a movie, that's just a fact.

34,SimonJack,"A different Orient Express, far inferior",3,14 June 2018,"One wondered if and when someone might take ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" and turn it into a modern, fast-action thriller. Well, this 2017 rendition by 20th Century Fox does just that. Only it still takes place in the 1930s. Except for the supposed setting, it's updated to modern production methods as a vehicle to sate the adrenalin rush needs of a chunk of modern society. While the plot resembles Agatha Christie's original, it has a huge cast with many more characters. Among them are a priest, a rabbi and an imam. The Orient Express no longer appears as the exclusive train service it was. The dining car looks like the inside of a fast food restaurant - stark, plain and modern. A funny scene has most of the suspects seated, just one or two to a table, in the dining car. Kenneth Branagh directed this film and starred as Hercule Poirot. Fox and company shot for a big-name cast but couldn't even come close to the 1974 film with the main characters. The only big names of the principals are Johnny Depp as Ratchett, Michelle Pfeiffer as Caroline Hubbard and Judi Dench as an aged princess. Some other well-known stars had new roles created for this film but with no tie to the original. They include Penelope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, and Willem Dafoe.Branagh's Poirot appears more to be a dashing 21st century detective with a clownish mustache. The mustache is so outlandish and broad one could hang a hat on either end. Agatha Christie gave Poirot a large mustache, but the one in this film looks more like the horns of a longhorn steer. True to the modern need for speed and action, this one has gun shooting, an avalanche and a derailment, outdoor action around the train, and CGI that all but flashes the message, ""this isn't real.""One can't fault actors for wanting to play in a new rendition of a great film and story. But when the story takes on a different life and the setting departs so much from the feel and sense of original, everyone misses out. The feel of the cast is 21st century, not that of people living in the 1930s. The opportunity to compare performances with those before is lost. The design for this film seems obvious - to garner the viewing and cash of an audience driven by an insatiable desire for action. With the 2010 ITV production that starred David Suchet, and the original 1974 classic films so well done for Christie's novel, it would have been foolish for anyone to try to match or outdo them. But, something different and quirky just might appeal to a different audience. Apparently, this film did that - for some, but not nearly enough to have it rate alongside - or even near the two great productions of ""Murder on the Orient Express.""",Murder on the Orient Express
35,siderite,"A fundamentally passive experience, unlike a whodunit should be",6,18 February 2018,"Of course, there is the matter of the source material, which couldn't have been changed significantly. However, I am here to argue that this movie was a failure for meeting none of the expectations it created.First, as a murder mystery, it should have allowed for enough evidence for a viewer to solve the case. Instead, every time Poirot made a leap, he was using information we didn't have, that he was aware of apriori of the events in the film.Second, there is the issue of the great cast. You expect something like this to not be much in the way of story, but that it would shine on the strength of the actors:Kenneth Branagh, Johhny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Penélope Cruz and so many others. Instead, we get a bit of each, a bit theatrical, a bit over the top in some cases, even a few moments that really felt fake (although in hindsight, if the actor is playing someone who is lying, maybe they did well?), but nothing shiny. No depth of character, no emotional buildup, nothing. The absolutely best scene comes from Willem Dafoe, at the end, completely ruined by the blunt interpretation of Pfeiffer a few moments later. Branagh's obviously fake mustache had more screen time than any of the stars in that great cast.And third, there was the story. A violent act that causes much pain is explained mostly through Poirot's description and fractured images that are supposed to make the viewer understand. Yet there is no transition from there to the present. We don't care about the event, the characters and we are completely unaware of how everything fits and how people got to this point. As a result, other than Poirot's intense stare and the nice stage sets, there is no story. I had more fun watching the introduction of the detective than in all of his solving of the train case.Bottom line: For what it attempted, it failed at every step. For what it promised, it failed to deliver. With pain in my heart I can say that this was substandard.",Murder on the Orient Express
36,JamesHitchcock,Branagh Does It Again,9,10 November 2017,"The famous detective Hercule Poirot boards the Orient Express in Constantinople on a journey back to London. It is an iron rule of the detective genre that wherever a famous detective goes murder will follow in his or her footsteps, and so it proves here. While the train is passing through Yugoslavia one of the passengers, Edward Ratchett, is found stabbed to death. At first sight there seems to be an obvious solution to the crime. Ratchett was a dodgy antiques dealer, and had recently cheated some Italian gangsters by selling them bogus goods. As Poirot investigates, however, he begins to have his doubts as to whether this was the true motive for the murder. Several of the passengers, although they are of various different nationalities and belong to different social classes, seem to have links to the notorious Armstrong murder case. (A fictionalised version of the real-life Lindbergh baby case). Moreover, Ratchett himself may also have had something to do with that case.It is, or seems to be, an iron rule of all cinematic genres that wherever Kenneth Branagh goes success will follow in his footsteps. (OK, forget the dreadful ""Wild, Wild West""). He began his career with an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Henry V"" which can stand comparison with Olivier's and has since developed into Britain's greatest actor/director of recent years. In the nineties he directed and starred in what I regard as the best-ever adaptation of a Shakespeare comedy, ""Much Ado about Nothing"" and the best-ever adaptation of a Shakespeare tragedy, ""Hamlet"". His talents are not confined to Shakespeare. As director he was responsible for films as good as ""Peter's Friends"", ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" and ""Cinderella"". He has also acted in a number of other excellent films, including ""Othello"", ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"", ""Valkyrie"" and the recent ""Dunkirk"".And now Branagh has done it again. He has turned his attention to Agatha Christie and, characteristically, the result is probably the best-ever Christie adaptation, better than any of the entries in the great Christie cycle of the seventies and eighties. As so often before, Branagh is both the film's director and its star. His Poirot is a re-invention of the character, rather different from the dapper little man played by David Suchet in the television series. That luxuriant moustache would perhaps be more appropriate to the late Victorian or Edwardian periods than to the 1930s- gentlemen in the inter-war years were generally either clean shaven or sported a small, neatly trimmed moustache- but Branagh may have adopted it as a way of distinguishing his character from Suchet's.Poirot is normally thought of as a supremely rational individual who can solve any crime by the exercise of his ""little grey cells"" alone. (The phrase ""little grey cells"" has become as closely associated with Poirot as ""Elementary, my dear Watson"" with Sherlock Holmes). In Branagh's characterisation, however, he emerges as something more than a mere human calculating machine. He is not merely rational but also humane and compassionate, a man whose abilities as a detective owe as much to an empathetic understanding of human nature as they do to pure reason and who realises that, as La Rochefoucauld said, the heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing. The story's famous twist ending probably does not surprise him as much as it surprises us. He is also wise enough to realise that justice, in the true sense, does not always require punishment.The supporting cast includes some big names including the likes of Penélope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi and Michelle Pfeiffer. All play their roles well, but because, Branagh himself apart, this is very much an ensemble effort, it would be difficult to single any of them out for special praise.The action takes place in winter and the main drama- the crime and Poirot's investigation- takes place after the tracks have been blocked by an avalanche in the mountains. The train is halted atop a lofty trestle bridge, a wonderful piece of engineering yet at the same time looking flimsy and insecure. This setting enables Branagh to give his film a wonderful visual look, with the stark monochrome mountain scenery contrasting with the opulent luxury on board the train, but (in my view at least) it is also loaded with metaphorical meaning. The idea of a train (or ship, or coach, or bus) as a microcosm of human society is hardly an original one, but here Branagh seems to give it extra meaning. Our civilisation, with all its opulent luxury is supported by structures which are wonderfully engineered yet at the same time flimsy and insecure, even though they are all that stand between us and a plunge into the abyss.I said earlier that this is probably the best-ever Christie adaptation. I'd go further. It's probably the best-ever cinematic whodunit. Branagh may, however, have a chance to surpass himself in this respect. At the end of the film we hear that Poirot has been called away to a case in Egypt. Does this mean that Branagh is planning his own version of ""Death on the Nile""? 9/10",Murder on the Orient Express

For starters, the murder mystery is almost exactly the same as its antecedent, whether it is due to the hallowed reverence to its source material or screenwriter Michael Green's incapability to ginger up the whodunit scenario, clearly and dishearteningly, slavish safety is the keynote to adhere when it comes to remakes, why bother if there is no substantial upgrade in the making? A transposition to 21st century would be a nice idea for instance. Perhaps, just to gather a star-studded cast can justify its own existence, with Branagh's gonzo- moustachioed Poirot hogging the spotlight, who is even granted a tepid prologue comes about in the Wailing Wall to introduce his fastidious quirks, and Branagh infuses an edgier temperament into Poirot's no-grey-zone presence of mind, but the over-familiarity of Sherlock Holmes is a dangerous sign of losing the detective's own distinction (since the Nile-cruising sequel has already been green-lit), also his underdeveloped omniscience begins to tell when magically, he gets the hang of everyone's carefully concealed identities, bearing in mind it is a time before Google, everyone! Approximately 10 minutes is fairly doled out to each of the rest core members of the cast, where most of the sequences are commonplace shot-reverse-shots and red-herrings are dished up, save some innovative camera arrangements either looking from the ceiling or outside the train. But despite the embarrassment of starry richness, only Michelle Pfeiffer's widow Caroline Hubbard (channeling some more soft-headed levity against Lauren Bacall's stern predecessor), manages to steal some thunder in the reveal, plus lending her exquisite voice in the song ""NEVER FORGET"" over the end credits.The biggest artistic license is needless to say, the gorgeous THE LAST SUPPER tableaux vivants when Poirot pompously solves the puzzle, we must hand it to Branagh for the flourish, only pitifully it is also at the expense of the film's own plausibility, because the whole act conspicuously reminds us, as if there were no other passengers on the supposedly fully-booked Orient Express other than those circumspectly postured suspects, or rather, alluding to a more dismayingly insidious note, that the class stratification has completely forbidden those in the less fancy coaches to even disembark the train whereas those privileged few are allowed to step out of harm's way in face of their final judgement, this really stings.",Murder on the Orient Express
39,OllieSuave-007,A rather good detective movie.,9,11 December 2017,"This is a rather good detective movie based on Agatha Christie's popular crime novel. It features an all-star cast aboard the Orient Express, in which the train's derailing was complicated by a murder. This leaves the only detective on board, Hercule Poirot, to solve the crime.The film starts off pretty slow, and it was rather too theatrical in the beginning scenes in my opinion. However, the movie picks up steam when we are introduced to the passengers on board the Orient Express and the suspense builds after the murder takes place. While there is little or no action at all in the movie, much of the excitement and intrigue lie in each of the character's testimony and whereabouts during the crime, and Poirot's investigative methods.Solid acting by everybody, and plenty of unpredictability on the whodunit question.

40,Hellmant,Nothing that will stay with me for very long.,7,1 December 2017,"'MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A new cinematic version of Agatha Christie's classic 1934 murder mystery novel, which has been adapted into films three times before. Kenneth Branagh directed, produced and stars in the movie; as the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Poirot is in charge of investigating a murder on the famous Orient Express. It was written by Michael Green, who's recent writing credits include co-scripting 'BLADE RUNNER 2049', 'LOGAN' and 'ALIEN COVENANT'. The film also features an all-star supporting cast including Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Josh Gad and Johnny Depp. Ridley Scott also served as a producer on the flick, and it was shot on 65mm film. The movie has received mostly positive reviews from critics (although none are really raving about it), and it's also done modestly well at the Box Office too. I found it to be well made, and mostly (at least mildly) entertaining, but I'm definitely not raving about it either. The story begins in 1930s Jerusalem, where the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot (Branagh) is solving a case. He's then expecting to go on a highly anticipated vacation. Before he can go on it though, he's given a telegram asking for his assistance on another case. His friend Buoc (Tom Bateman), who now directs the famous 'Orient Express', offers him a three day ride to his destination. Poirot meets a variety of different characters on his trip, including an American criminal named Samuel Ratchett (Depp). Ratchett asks the detective for his help, in acting as his personal bodyguard, but Poirot declines (stating that he doesn't aide criminals, he only catches them). Later Ratchett is killed, and the train is derailed by an avalanche. While the passengers are all stranded there, Poirot conducts an investigation to find out who killed Ratchett, and of course it has to be someone who's still on the train. The movie is beautiful to look at; it looks like a classic big screen epic at almost all times. Branagh is of course a very talented filmmaker, and actor too, and he doesn't disappoint here. Most of the rest of the celebrities have little to do though; with the exception of Pfeiffer, who's always good in almost everything she does (it seems like). The story is a classic mystery as well, but (as I already said) it's been done multiple times before, and there's nothing really new here. I did have a mostly good time watching it though, but it's also nothing that will stay with me for very long.Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us",Murder on the Orient Express
41,cherold,"Pretty good, really",7,24 March 2018,"Murder on the Orient Express is Kenneth Branaugh's comfortable but generally somewhat uninspired take on the traditional star-studded, handsomely-mounted Christie adaptation.Some things are very good. I really like Branaugh's version of Poirot. While not quite as perfect as David Suchet, Branaugh is appealing and thoughtful, and it's wonderful that there is finally a Poirot with the sort of over-the-top mustache one always imagined from the book's descriptions. I prefer him to Albert Finney, who was never my concept of the character.I also really liked the final reveal, which got a fair amount of drama out of the traditional detective-explains-it-all scene.The cast was quite good, particulary Johnny Depp as something other than a cartoon character.Some things put me off a bit. Giving Poirot some OCD seems both unnecessary and a rip-off of the TV series Monk. And putting Poirot in a couple of action scenes was just odd. These sorts of attempts to add flash to Christie rarely work out; the woman knew how to construct a story.Overall, the movie was enjoyable but never quite riveting. I knew the solution, so for me it was about watching the way it was all done, and it felt generally a little muted. I was interested, but rarely fully engaged.At the end of the movie there's a reference to the book that was used as a sequel to the last MOE. Are they going to try that one again? It didn't work out very well last time, and Christie has a lot of books to choose from, but I guess I'm okay with that.I recall enjoying the 70s MOE more, although I don't know what I would think of it now. As recent Christie adaptations go, it's not as good as the minseries of And Then There Were Done but it's much better than the dreary Crooked House. I do hope they do a sequel, but I also hope they get a little more life into any future productions.",Murder on the Orient Express

43,paul2001sw-1,An unnecessary murder,6,6 October 2020,"'Murder on the Orient Express' is perhaps Agatha Christie's best-loved story, a perfectly-conceived locked-room mystery, with a typically preposterous resolution. Kenneth Branagh, who also directs, is the latest in a long line of actors to take on the role of detective Hercule Poirot, and never has Poirot been more magnificently moustached. Poirot is, of course, more a collection of personal mannerisms than a truly rounded character, but Branagh does a reasonable job of bringing him to at least half-a-life (although I still prefer the more forceful interpretation of Ustinov). However, the film lacks a certain tension: a potential murderer is believed to be one of 12 people trapped on a snowbound train, but a consonant sense of claustrophobic menace is lacking. One problem with a locked-room mystery, of course, is precisely that the plot, following the murder, has literally nowhere to go. The result is a moderately diverting film but one that adds little to the previous interpretations of the story.",Murder on the Orient Express
44,Pjtaylor-96-138044,It's pretty entertaining during its second act but the odd opening and contrived finale let it down.,6,5 November 2017,"The second act stuff on the train is actually rather well done for the most part, with the dialogue-driven detective legwork of 'Murder On The Orient Express (2017)' being fairly interesting, if a little convenient. Unfortunately, the surrounding material is relatively contrived and oddly clichéd, with Poirot occasionally coming across more like Guy Ritchie's version of Sherlock Holmes - complete with almost clairvoyant levels of 'deduction', especially in his few extremely out-of-place action sequences - than a portly and particular Belgian. The ending is especially disappointing, though this is perhaps a fault with the source story more than the flick itself. It leaves things seeming rather empty after its ham-fisted attempt at both haphazardly starting and completing an arc for its perfectionist protagonist. Still, it doesn't quite sour the film's finer moments - which shine through the muddy mess that this finale transforms the narrative into - and doesn't quite ruin what is mostly an intriguing and entertaining journey. 6/10.",Murder on the Orient Express

But it's symptomatic that in the original the train departed during the credits while here over twenty minutes have go by before it finally pulls out of the station.Kenneth Branagh's direction is ironically both fussy and slow as the steadicam vertiginously sweeps about following the all-star cast about the train of the title. Most of them actually get little to do (although Michelle Pfeiffer is nearly ten years older than Lauren Bacall was in the earlier version, but still a fox). Branagh doesn't disappear into the part of Poirot the way Albert Finney did, despite a moustache that always seems to be trying to upstage him.",Murder on the Orient Express
46,dromasca,Poirot is Back,8,10 January 2018,"It's not easy to adapt Agatha Christie to screen in 2017, and it is even more difficult to take upon 'Murder on the Orient Express' which already had a fabulous and stars-blessed version made in 1974 by Sidney Lumet. The queen of the detective novel created superb mysteries, but there are challenges in bringing them to screen, as her characters are quite theatrical, always hide and seem to be something else that they really are, and the confined enclosure where most of her stories take place does not fit the requirements of dynamics in modern action cinema. It's a challenge to turn the bright mental exercises in her novels into screen action, especially as most of the viewers would know the ending. A challenge that can be compared with bringing to the cinema screens the text and characters of Shakespeare. So, maybe it takes a director and an actor that already brought to screen the plays of Shakespeare to assume the challenge and the risks. The name of this director is, of course, Kenneth Branagh.The approach chosen by the director for this version of Murder on the Orient Express does not try to 'actualize' the intrigue into the present time, but does the contrary - it is very specific about the exact year of the plot, 1934, exactly the year when Agatha Christie's book was published. While keeping the structure of the intrigue and the format of the 'train story' it invests much of the writing and acting efforts into developing the characters. First of all it's Hercule Poirot's life itself which is enhanced with the memory of a lost love, although more details may have been left for the following episodes. Branagh himself assumes the role of Poirot, with Penélope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe and a wonderful supporting cast providing color and personality to each one of the characters, whatever time they catch on the screen.I enjoyed the experience of watching this version of the classical murder story, even if the solution of the mystery was known to me from the beginning. I believe that Kenneth Branagh succeeded to find the right balance between the old good way of making films with a good story combined with nuanced acting, and the modern visual techniques that place the action in a spectacular landscape adding an aura of fairy tale. The ending alludes to the next episode in what may become a series, and I am looking forward to it.",Murder on the Orient Express
47,ThomasDrufke,Fun But Flawed,6,12 November 2017,"Who doesn't love a good mystery? Murder on the Orient Express is one of the most famous mystery novels of all time, written by Agatha Christie, and now has two big screen adaptations. The first, made in 1974, was critically acclaimed and featured some of the greatest actors at that time. The second, released this weekend, features another fantastic ensemble cast, and manages to be a serviceable crime-mystery-thriller, if not as exciting or shocking as some would hope.Kenneth Branagh directs and stars as Hercule Poirot, the ""greatest detective in the world"". While the rest of the film consists the likes of Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Josh Gad, Derek Jacobi, Leslie Odom Jr, Lucy Boynton, and Daisy Ridley. Safe to say, it's one of the best ensembles any film has ever compiled, and truthfully, they actually do a great job of giving each actor a scene here or there to show their talent. At the very least, I found it nice to have such a famous cast because it's nowhere near as obvious who is at fault when it could be any one of these award winning actors and you would believe it.I think where the film struggles is its script. The problem is with the way the film is constructed. It's very difficult to put together a good mystery, I can acknowledge that. But having the background of the characters pretty much laid out in front of you within the first half of the movie, raises an eyebrow before an eyebrow is supposed to be raised. Of course, I can't get into the major specifics without spoiling the surprises, because there are definitely some surprises. I just found the way the film was written to be interesting and not the way I would have gone about things. I guess my point is, less is more when it comes to revealing things.Branagh brings the most out of the script that he can, even considering the enormously difficult task of balancing serious subject matter with quippy humor. That part of the film is impressive, as is the cinematography and production design. There are mind blowing long shots taking you through the train that bring you right into the Orient Express as if you're just another passenger. Surely, the production design will get a strong Oscar consideration, even if the overall film is a bit of a letdown in terms of award hopefuls.Murder on the Orient Express is far from a perfect film, and can be a bit of a mess in some sequences, but it's an enjoyable film that presents a worthy mystery of telling.

50,lesleyharris30,"Solid Performances, Light on Thrills,",6,9 January 2018,"Murder on the Orient Express is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a terrific cast. The set pieces are absolutely devine, and the film manages to pull off what did not seem like a simple task, having the majority of it take place on a train. Kenneth Branagh does a very impressive job directing this, and also shines as Hecule Poirot, his mannerisms and movements are completely unlike himself and he is truly immersed in to this character. Branagh is also joined by a terrific supporting cast that includes Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench and Willem Dafoe, among many other big names.I did find that the film was light on thrills and did not deliver the potential this story had as well as it could have. It gets so carried away on landscape and cinematography that it forgets to engage and immerse us in to this story that should have had me at the edge of my seat waiting to find out the killer, instead of waiting for them to just get to the punchline. As well as that, they did not take enough advantage of their fantastic cast. The likes of Judi Dench and Johnny Depp are wasted in this movie, playing characters that are given no scope, and they get nothing to do. I understand that Branagh wanted a star studded cast, but a lot of these characters simply are not given enough to do, leaving Oscar calibre performers in the gutter. Has its moments, but not enough of them. Murder on the Orient Express certainly thinks it is a lot more exciting than it is, worth a look if you are a fan of the novel, but if you are looking to be thrilled, you have many, far better options.

Its true. Using his ""little gray cells"" he has solved some unsolvable crimes. At the start of the film, in Israel, Poirot discovers who stole a rare, bejeweled artifact and it wasn't a rabbi, priest, or iman, as suspected. Now, Mr. Hercule just wants to get back to London. His mode of transportation is the famous Orient Express, from Istanbul to Paris. On board, he meets kind folks like Mary (Daisy Ridley), a governess, Dr Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom, Jr.), the grand Mrs. Hubbard (Michelle Pfeiffer), a Princess (Judi Dench), among others, and a man described as most unpleasant, Mr. Ratchet (Johnny Depp). In fact, when Ratchet finds out Mr. Poirot is on the train, he asks him for a huge favor. Ratchet, a self-described art dealer, insists someone is trying to ""off"" him and wants Hercule to protect him. Poirot says no, for he has his doubts about who Ratchet truly is. As the train passes through mountains, an avalanche stops the train in the early morning and it is soon discovered Ratchet was murdered in the night, even though he slept with a gun. It appears his late night coffee was drugged. One of the first things brought to life, too, was that the dead man's name wasn't Ratchet, but Cassetti, and as such, was the kidnapper/murderer of a young girl, Daisy Armstrong, some years before. One by one, Poirot interviews the rest of the passengers, trying to find a killer. Could it be his secretary, McQueen (Josh Gad), who was stealing money from his boss? Or perhaps it was the Austrian professor (Willem Dafoe) who seethes with hatred for others? The culprit, whom Poirot DOES uncover, is almost beyond belief! Who done it? Thie classic tale is a feast for the eyes and ears. The scenery is breathtaking and the script witty, amid the horror. Then, too, the cast is superb, each doing fine work, especially Branagh as Poirot. Needless to say, the costumes are likewise wonderful as they recreates the garb of the thirties.

in and maybe entertain its new viewers or mostly the ones who can't stand ""old films"". To talk about this ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is kind of more of 
the same specially to those who watched Sidney Lumet's brilliant psychological study starring Albert Finney as famous detective Hercule Poirot. Most folks 
had seen that movie, gave it a shot to this one and thought ""well, there's something missing here"" or ""it's not good enough"". Lead actor and director 
Kenneth Branagh had one thing in his favor while making it: speed. The story flows more like an adventure flick in some parts, with some great exterior shots 
at times ruined by weak special effects while Lumet's film was more like a play where you could catch every nuance of each actor and each character the more 
the classic story progressed - and to resume for those who haven't seen it, Poirot investigates the murder of a mysterious man on board of the Orient Express 
while the train is stuck in the snow, interrogating all of the passengers, important figures or people of little relevance. 
 
I'm not a detractor of Branagh's film, in fact, I had my share of good time with it and find it very stylish, impecable costumes and art-direction, and 
in times where plot twists are common place for the same type of project, to bring back a little bit of class and long dialogues is something that it's worth 
seeing. The cast doesn't disappoint despite not having one prominent performance in it - and that's why the 1974 film was the better one. Branagh is a fine Poirot 
but far too eccentric (and I'm comparing it with the books written by Agatha Christie, who presents him as a man of rituals and manners but Branagh makes him look 
like a Phineas Fogg, evidenced in his opening scene with the eggs); Johnny Depp, Penélope Cruz, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, Derek Jacobi, 
Josh Gad (finally breaking from his usual annoyance) are all good but no stand-outs here - maybe Dafoe grabbed my attention the most. 
 
However, I've found it an exhausting experience not just because I already knew what was going to happen but mostly the rush in presenting some things 
and slowing down anothers - the ending felt like a disappointment if compared back (sorry for the repetition) with the other film - of which I wasn't much of a fan 
during my first viewm neither the book (that chase sequence between Poirot and MacQueen was dumb). Lumet's ""canon"" version never loses momentum despite the play aspects of it, you're intrigued through it all while Branagh reserves some 
thrills here and there and then it becomes a snooze fest halfway through. It's like much ado about almost nothing (no pun intended with Kenneth's previous film), I 
haven't felt it was a necessary film or one based of Agatha's novel that was needed to be remade - she has several great mystery books that weren't made into a film 
or just became TV projects, I'd like to see a version of ""After the Funeral"". Good news is that the movie's apparent success excited Branagh enough to the point of already announce that ""Death on the Nile"" will come and perhaps new audiences will be interested in following the footsteps of the incredible Hercule Poirot. Challenge is: that one was already made in 1978, also an Oscar winning film and with a stellar cast; difference: as of now, I still haven't seen it. We'll see.

In this movie, we watch Hercule Poirot trying to get some free time after all the cases that he has solved but eventually he is recruited to solve one more. While he is traveling with Orient Express, the train accidentally gets stopped because of a small avalanche. This is the start of his investigation because Hercule Poirot knew from the start that a murder was planned and he wants to find out who is that person on this train who was able of committing such a crime. I liked this movie because it had a very good plot and the storyline was simply breathtaking. The interpretation of Kenneth Branagh who played as Hercule Poirot was very good and I also liked the interpretations of Daisy Ridley who played as Miss Mary Debenham, Leslie Odom Jr. who played as Dr. Arbuthnot and Judi Dench who played as Princess Dragomiroff. I have to admit that the direction which was made by Kenneth Branagh was very interesting and gave the audience a different perspective of seeing some scenes in the movie and of course made them change their view of understanding who committed this crime.Finally, I believe that ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a great movie to watch because it has a very interesting plot with many plot twists that will keep you alert and you won't get bored at all. I have to say that if you are a fan of mystery movies then this is your movie but even if you are not, give it a try and I am sure you won't regret it.

Trying to solve the murder mystery with several suspects that may or may not have a motive. However, the film is less fun than playing. Murder on the Orient Express draws some great performances. Especially, the best detective in the world Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh). Who is great at solving mystery crimes from the tiniest details that every one would miss. He happens to be on the same express train with several other people that played by an ensemble of talented actors like Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, Derek Jacobi, Leslie Odom Jr., Michelle Pfeiffer, and Daisy Ridley. When there is a murderer at large, Poirot will have to follow every single clues and theories to who is the suspect. And how every one in train compartment has a connection of some kind? The direction, tone, and set are fun and visually impressive to look at. With the train being stuck on the snowy mountains and blocked by an avalanche. The performances were also great. Kenneth Branagh did great as the character and tried making it a lot of fun to see him on screen with his compulsiveness and awkward personality. Sure, they can continue with multiple films with the character in different mystery stories. The few problems I have the film is. It can be very slow in the middle of the second act. So slow, it can be boring at times and you can easily lose interest on were the story is going next. It has its uneven pacing that could have had better editing and maybe trim down a few overlong scenes. Also, the climax with the mystery and twist revealing itself and playing back a few scenes to recap on how everything was done didn't feel like much of a surprise. It just did not have the exciting build up to even care for what was going on. Overall, Murder on the Orient Express is a fair mystery drama film. A great cast ensemble. A spot on direction and tone for its mystery feel. It was a little longer than it should have been and the slow pacing did not help build the excitement at all.I rate the film 3 out of 5 stars.",Murder on the Orient Express
58,zkonedog,Tries To Solve Murder Mystery Blandness But Fails In The Attempt,4,11 November 2017,"Coming into ""Murder On The Orient Express"", the main thing I was worried about was that the film would focus so much on the ""whodunnit"" that it would fail to consider ""why do we care"". That is a typical problem I find with hard-boiled mystery capers. Funny enough, ""Murder"" tries to improve in this very area, but ends up completely striking out in a rather muddled mess of names, faces, and half-baked plots.For a basic plot summary, this film sees famous detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) on a train heading towards his next case. He's hoping to catch some much-needed r-and-r, but when Edward Ratchett (Johnny Depp) is murdered en route, his deductive reasoning and sleuthing is tested as never before. One by one, he questions all the other train passengers, played by an eclectic ""who's who"" of Hollywood including Daisey Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Josh Gad, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, & Willem Dafoe (among others).The reason I'll give ""Murder"" even four stars is because, in all honesty, it does try to subvert its genre a bit by adding in a human element. This is where the spoilers come in, but all the passengers are found to have a connection to the murdered Ratchett. In the end, Poirot must make a moral choice that previously he's never had to make: does he let a crime go because it was ""deserved"", or is it his solemn duty to prosecute to the full extent of the law.This is actually an interesting twist on the ""whodunnit"" mystery, and could have been used to great effect. The problem? The ""connection"" that all the passengers share just isn't compelling enough to make an audience really care about them. Part of the issue is that instead of really setting up that angle in the early goings, we get 20 minutes of Poirot kind of just clowning around...totally pointless and a waste of time that could have really been used to flesh out the history of the crime that is later examined in detail.As it is, however, the emotional reason we are supposed to care about these passengers is only given through snippets of dialogue, very short flashbacks, and so many names (in such a short period) that I was often confused by who was who. Not conducive at all, obviously, to what director Branagh was trying to accomplish.Overall, then, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" tried to be something bigger than it is billed, and while I appreciate that effort, it just doesn't work. Unless you have a soft spot for this literary tale or character (Poirot), or are an enormous fan of whodunnit murder mysteries, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed when the credits roll.",Murder on the Orient Express
59,leonblackwood,Expected Better!,3,19 March 2018,"Review:
I'm really in two minds about this movie, because it certainly looked great and the period was portrayed well but the storyline started to get on my nerves after a while. The whole ""whodunnit"" aspect seemed to go on forever, and all of the suspects had there own reasons to kill Edward Ratchett (Johnny Depp) because of his dodgy past, so Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) seemed to be going round in circles for most of the movie. You didn't really get to see Poirot's genius, because it was mostly based on interviews with the various suspects, so you didn't get to see him put together various clues like we usually do. On the plus side, the cast was great, and you get to see another side to Johnny Depp, who wasn't in the movie for that long but he did make a big impact. As for the plot, it wasn't anything different to the usual movies that have been adapted from this popular story, so I wasn't left feeling that it was anything amazing. I was also pretty disappointed with the whole outcome of the plot, mainly because it didn't take much detective work to find out that they were all lying, so from that point of view, it seemed like a total waste of time. Another main problem with the film, is that it was a bit too coincidental that every suspect that was in the posh part of the train, had a connection to the suspect, which didn't take a rocket scientist to work out, so that also made the outcome pretty poor. Anyway, I wasn't that impressed with this film, and I also wasn't that impressed with Branagh playing Poirot, so it has to get the thumbs down from me. Not that great!Round-Up:
Although this movie made a decent profit at the box office, which was mostly based on the cast, I personally think that Kenneth Branagh wasn't the best choice to director and star in the lead. His version of Frankenstein was terrible, and I wasn't that impressed with Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit but he did kick off the Thor franchise pretty well and Cinderella was also watchable. He also directed Henry V in 1989, Dead Again, Peter's Friends, the great Much Ado About Nothing, In The Bleak Midwinter, Hamlet, Love's Labour's Lost, As You Like It, The Magic Flute and Sleuth starring Michael Caine and Jude Law. He is rumoured to direct Death on the Nile, which is another Agatha Christie classic, but I personally hope that he doesn't take the lead again, because he lacked wit and the stunning detective work that David Suchet brought to the role. With all of that aside, you do stick with the movie because you want to see who caused the crime but once you know the outcome, I cant see many people watching it again.Budget: $55million

60,TheMovieDiorama,Murder on the Orient Express is just as intriguing and developed as it's source material.,8,26 February 2018,"Agatha Christie, Poirot, murder mystery. Suffice to say this story quite possibly pioneered the ""Who Dunnit!?"" sub-genre. With many popular mysteries utilising the same methodologies that Christie famously used in her book. Kenneth Branagh braves an attempt at adapting this beloved story...and thankfully he did. We all know the story. A group of passengers onboard the Orient Express are in the midst of a murder, and it's up to our heavily moustached detective to crack the case. Now, I'm a massive fan of Kenneth Branagh. He is a class act, both in his thespian acting style and his modern directing techniques. Fortunately, his talents are put to good use here. I thoroughly enjoyed this. I kept my expectations timid but secretly I had faith in Sir Branagh. His iteration of Hercule Poirot is inspired. The usage of quick wit, old-fashioned humour and that Shakespearean touch, he is able to create a character that lights up every scene. Then there's the moustache. It needs its own casting credit. It's magnificent. I just wanted him to interrogate a passenger and exclaim ""I moustache you a question, but I'll shave it for later"". His directing style, yet again, is understated and a beauty to behold. A super nice long exterior take as Poirot walks along each carriage of the train. Bird's Eye view of the crime scene as Poirot investigates. Majestic landscape shots as the train passes by. I adored it. Then there's the cast. Wow. Many A-Listers and many thespians to assist in Branagh's portrayal. The whole story has this old-school charm to it that made it utterly watchable. Yes there are a few pacing issues and the culprit's reveal might be slightly underwhelming and totally convenient, but to pluck up the courage and adapt this heavily beloved story is an achievement. This could've been terrible. Branagh modifies the story to make it feel fresh and it works on every level. Who needs superhero blockbusters when you can have a murder mystery with developed and memorable characters.",Murder on the Orient Express
61,Tweetienator,"Not Black, not White, but Grey",4,25 January 2018,"I am a great fan of most of the movie adaptions of Agatha Christie's stories, e.g. Murder on the Orient Express (1974), Death on the Nile (1978) or Evil Under the Sun (1982) and all the other stories around Miss Marple, and I even read some of the books.First of all - Peter Ustinov and Albert Finney beat Kenneth Branagh in the role of Hercule Poirot. Kenneth Branagh is not doing a bad job, but the other two just play imo the role of the Belgian mastermind more convincing and with more charisma and with a finer, more delicate humor. 
2nd: even as the cast of the remake is filled with nowadays famous actors they cannot compete with actors like Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery or Anthony Perkins (just to name a few of cast from the 1974 adaption of Murder on the Orient Express).As the story is known the only outstanding ""merits"" of this remake are the implements of the issue of racism (for some historical reasons imo poorly implemented and presented). An easy way nowadays to get some applause and attention. As the story doesn't gives you the chance to hide behind Fx and action-scenes the attention of the audience is focused mostly on the actors/acting. Well, they all do are decent job, but imo nothing outstanding.Conclusion: Kenneth Branagh's remake is no pain in the a** but no ""must-see"". If I would have to choose for an evening movie to watch between Sidney Lumet's or Kenneth's movie, I would re-watch the classic from 1974. Recommendable for fans of the involved actors like Depp, Ridley, Cruz, Dafoe etc. and Kenneth himself of course. To the younger audience who may not know the version from 1974 - give the old one a chance at your home cinema.",Murder on the Orient Express
62,pmtelefon,Branagh gets it right (finally),8,21 July 2021,"""Murder on the Orient Express"" is not a perfect movie but it is a satisfying watch. Director/star Kenneth Branagh has never been my favorite but he delivers the goods both in front and behind the camera. Branagh delivers an excellent performance in this movie. He has charm to spare. He also gets very good performances from all his cast. There are flaws in the movie but the cast is so good and the last forty minutes is so strong that bumps along the way are easily forgiven. Honorable mention: Leslie Odom Jr.",Murder on the Orient Express
63,matthewssilverhammer,"In a Shocking Twist, I Loved It",8,17 November 2017,"I went into Murder on the Orient Express pretty cynically. Another Hollywood remake. Another Kenneth Branagh costume drama. Another packed cast getting mediocre reviews. I thought, at best, it would be an empty, simple and silly little way to kill an afternoon. I was basically rightbut through the high-pitched performances, twisting mystery and loving direction, this captivating yarn slowly but surely overwhelmed my doubts and won me over. Master and enigmatic Detective Hercule Poirot is sucked into a job while on vacation, wherein a man on his train has been murdered, and one of the other passengers is the murderer. The cast is chockfull of talent, which lends to the action-packed fun; not ""action-packed"" like a Marvel flick, but more in the puzzlement, patter and performances. It's wonderfully old-fashioned in that and so many other ways: the regal look; the wry, almost poetic dialogue (""There was right, there was wrong, and now there is you""); the Shakespearean melodrama. The only thing I wish is Branagh and the studio would've shot it all, not just the flashbacks, in black-and-white, to really give it that classic, larger-than-life hutzpah. Now before you think I'm blind to its faults, let me reassure you. The cinematography, while often beautiful, is just as often obnoxious. The CGI train and scenery shots are jarringly cartoonish. The final explanation to the whodunit is more than a bit convoluted. However, the power and fun Branagh imbues in his films and actors make this a train trip I would love to take myself again and againthough only in movie form. The murder might not be as fun in real life.",Murder on the Orient Express
64,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The bones of Christie's mystery are at least good enough to carry this update for the uninitiated,7,26 February 2018,"It doesn't take a detective to deduce that this remake/reimagining of Agatha Christie's esteemed novel ""Murder on the Orient Express"" was about 20th Century Fox trying to overloading a movie poster with big names in hopes of big box office returns. Yet in the hands of Kenneth Branagh, who directs and also stars, the film avoids a complete slide into gussied up, hollow period mystery.Branagh plays literature's second greatest detective, Hercule Poirot, whom screenwriter Michael Green (who had a huge 2017 with ""Logan"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"") wisely treats as the centerpiece of the story. Poirot could simply have fulfilled his functional purpose as the audience's eccentric mystery-solving surrogate, but the film commits to him as a central character, whose journey in some ways supersedes the crime itself.Hoping for some respite aboard the Orient Express en route from Istanbul to France, Poirot reluctantly becomes chief investigator on a case when a passenger is murdered on the train. He then interrogates the passengers, which include the likes of Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz, Josh Gad, Oliva Colman, Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom Jr. and more, slowly revealing secrets and deceptions until he cracks the case. Having neither read Christie's novel nor seen previous film adaptations, I can't comment on how this update compares, but its tried and true bones provide sufficient entertainment. The film relies a little heavily on interrogation scene dialogue and the glee of Poirot spouting off some genius bit of detective work from evidence we hadn't considered, but the twists that clearly made ""Orient Express"" a classic find a way to work their magic regardless of any changes or tweaks in this version.That said, Branagh's tone is one of fantasy and heart more than a gritty, claustrophobic thriller. He's more interested in the thematic elements that complicate and layer the truths that Poirot uncovers than crafting a gripping, heart-pounding genre film. Curiosity is the entertainment factor he wields rather than suspense. It's meant to provoke our intellect and our sense of wonder above anything else. Green's script misfires mostly in regard to the mystery within the mystery, or the backstory that Poirot uncovers which proves to be integral to his solving the case. It doesn't quite make the necessary emotional ties. Yet Green's commitment to playing out Poirot's personal story arc and coloring in who he is with some small details makes up for it. He's a character I certainly wouldn't mind seeing on the screen again.The actors playing the passengers don't get nearly the same legs to stand on, so most of the flashy names on the marquee are just that, flash. Only ""Star Wars"" star Daisy Ridley manages to show off some chops in her brief scenes and in a way Gad gets to show he can do more than comedy. All in all, despite each getting one-on-one time with Branagh, there's not much in the way of meaty, dramatic content.Given my inexperience with this classic mystery story, it's impossible to say whether this version has enough to hold on to for those with greater degrees of familiarity. My instincts say it might be a close call - knowing the truth will surely place more strain on Branagh's interpretation of Pourot. So climb aboard at your own peril if you hold a deep reverence for Christie's novel or Sidney Lumet's 1974 version. Objectively, it's an engaging film suitable for mainstream tastes. ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Murder on the Orient Express

Great actors take part in this story, but the director somehow fails in making those characters come alive",4,17 February 2019,"Great story. Great actors. What could go wrong? I read the average rating on Imdb and I had difficulty believing that a great story with such a great cast (Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeifer, Judi Dench) could make for a boring movie, but that's what it unfortunately turned out to be: average and boring.13 passengers on a train. One passenger gets murdered. Who is the mastermind behind this attack? I blame director/actor Kenneth Brannagh for the bland portrayal of this potentially terrific story. Somehow the characters dont really come alive. Somehow the suspense is lacking. It all looks very pretty, with beautiful photography, but the movie lacks in punch.I considered if it perhaps could be suspenseful enough for children and families to be watched, but the story is too complicated (and boring) to keep the attention of the youth.I checked out the original 1974 movie again as well, although those 1974 characters are quite sparkling the speed of that 1974 story is one of a turtle as well. That 1974 version has become rather dated in many ways. I have never given this advice before on Imdb, but you could maybe better just read the Agatha Christie book, instead of watching this boring, complicated movie.",Murder on the Orient Express

With outstanding cinematography done by the same man who did Cinderella,and a great score done by Patrick Doyle(again did Cinderella with Kenneth Branagh who also directed Cinderella).

I had of course heard of it, however I had never read it, nor seen any of the previous film adaptions of it. I am very partial to a murder-mystery however, and so I was very excited for it. Adding to that excitement were a tremendous cast (including my main man Johnny Depp himself) and a trailer that blew me away. Now all the film had to do was live up to the hype I had created for it. Did it manage to? You bet it did.The thing that took me off-guard was that Johnny Depp was not only not the star of the film, he was actually playing one of the least interesting characters in the whole film. What also took me by surprise was how much I enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's interpretation of the character of 'Hercule Poirot'. He was captivating to watch. He left me undoubtedly wanting more. I would happily welcome a follow-up film (which may or may not have been hinted at in the film).There's a lot of fun to be had in 'Murder on the Orient Express'. While it is a dialogue heavy film, it is exquisite dialogue. The amount of memorable quotes in this movie are far too plentiful to count. The twist at the end (which I'm assuming is the same as the source material?) was probably my least favourite part of the film, however it did make sense and I get it.

The cast of A-listers are sumptuously dressed and bejewelled, and the luxurious train interiors nicely recreated, but the characters always seemed more like characters than like people, giving the film an artificial, stagy feeling. Having not read the Poirot books, I'm not familiar with the character, but Kenneth Branagh seemed OK as the somewhat obsessive-compulsive Belgian sleuth. Judy Dench, Derek Jacobi and Johnny Depp were as good as always, but I found Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Caroline Hubbard unconvincing. The plot is interesting, if implausible, and the look of the film is fine, although the CGI images of the train moving through the Carpathian(?)

This is a remake of the 1974 movie that is based on an Agatha Christie novel she wrote in 1934. She wrote quite a few books about an observant detective named Hercule Poirot, a Belgium version of Sherlock Holmes-she also wrote about a character named Miss Marple or something like that but I did not read them. I remember reading and being a fan of her books on Hercule Poirot when I was growing up. This movie is directed by Kenneth Branagh-Cinderella_2015, Jack Ryan:Shadow Recruit, Thor-who also stars as the famous detective. Kenneth is taking a trip on the Orient Express train traveling from Istanbul to Paris with 13 other passengers-all quite recognizable actors. Johnny, Michelle and Daisy are some of the passengers, all of which have secrets that come to light when one of the 13 turns up dead. Boy, it's lucky that they have the world's greatest detective on board to help solve the case. One of the passengers was involved in a baby kidnapping that took place 5 years earlier. This movie is not an action packed shoot em up but more of a thinking man's workout for your brain, although there is a little physical fisticuffs and some gun play. Oh yeah, I must mention Kenneth's mustache; It is rather big and very well groomed-he sleeps with a mask over it to protect it. At the end of the movie, there is a set up for the next one, Death on the Nile-that is, if this one makes money.

Given its cast and author's (Agatha Christie) pedigree it lags well behind the locomotive powering it as director/ lead Ken Branagh gets sloppy with wasteful incidentals and issues unrelated to the mystery at hand.Hercule Poirot agrees to hitching a ride on The Orient Express from Istanbul to Paris. When a shady character (Johnny Depp) is brutally offed, Poirot is enlisted to solve the crime with a captive audience of suspects in a snowbound train waiting for AAA to rescue them. While I find the story to be one of Christie's more unsatisfying offerings it does offer up a dozen fun characters and suspects that can allow major stars a chance to ham it up. The cast is A list (Judy Dench, Derek, Jacobi, Michelle Pfieffer, Penelope Cruz, William Dafoe) but the performances mostly D as they are barely able to muster guilty expressions. There are some fine montages of the locomotive flexing its powerful muscles but moments where it looks like an American Flyer set up in a department store window as it moves through the snow covered terrain. It is impossible for me not to mention the 74 classic if only to highly recommend it as well as the managing of the cast in comparison's to Branagh's half inspired handling of his. Director Sidney Lumet (12 Angry Men) excelled at balancing and involving his cast who nearly to a member give wonderful broad performances. Branagh on the other hand lowers his suspect count, all but ignoring some of the other passengers implicated. Branagh himself is little less than a mawkish ghost of the brilliant Albert Finney's Poirot who conducted on stage the energy and fun that is missing in this present day version, it is simply the little engine that couldn't.

The premise of the film sees a group of people being investigated on a train after a mysterious murder. Kenneth branagh plays famous detective hercule poirot and he is fantastic in this film. He nails the accent and it is so entertaining watching this charismatic performance from him. He also nailed the brilliance of the character and made his discoveries seem pretty genuine. There is a huge supporting cast in this film so I will just talk about the main ones, daisy ridley plays a governess in the film and she is really good. Sometimes she is a little wooden but she delivers a charming character with some interesting features about her. Johnny Depp plays an American gangster in the film and he does a good job, he isn't his usual cartoony self here and I liked him in this more serious role. Something similar could be said about josh gadd who is really developing into a great all round actor. Michelle pfiefer is in this film and she delivers a good charming performance that makes her an interesting character in the film. Willem Dafoe and judi Dench also do good jobs in there smaller roles. The story is interesting as you are following the breadcrumbs with branagh as he attempts to solve this mystery. However, this film is the definition of the journey being better then the finish line as I wasn't a big fan of the end reveal in the film. It just felt cheap and the easy way out that didn't really give me a sense of satisfaction. The script has some decent humour and drama in it, but it also has some over the top dialogue that took me out of the moment, also this film is guilty of exposition dialogue on a few different occasions. The style of the film is very lavish, which works and seeing the different interrogations made this film feel interesting if a bit repetitive.

He does this quite well - after a short, separate story to start to demonstrate his genius and mood he arrives on the train. Everything is more spectacular and looks more beautiful than the seventies version and Branagh provides a more extrovert, fitter Poirot who even gets a bit of action.

Therefore, my thoughts will remain solely confined to Branagh's offering....And oh dear what a disappointment I found this to be... The story begins promisingly and offers a gentle playfulness that I hoped would be a running theme throughout the film. However, once Poirot gets on-board the train Branagh seems to change tack and fills the film with many stuffy and bloated exchanges between the cast members which I suppose are there to advance the story, but these exchanges are frequently dull and uninteresting.What mystery there is here (which to someone like me who knew nothing of the story was a mystery) was unfolded in the most tedious and boring of manners... in fact when the big reveal arrived I was long past caring. Many of the cast looked lost and seemed to wonder what the hell they were doing in this film... Branagh stuffs the film with an impressive cast, but wastes a lot of them by giving them next to nothing to do.I think what makes this film worse is the fact that it feels a little over-stuffed and self-important - it felt to me like Branagh was more in love with the production of the film than the story and I never once felt engaged in what should have been a fairly involving murder-mystery.Don't be fooled by the impressive cast or the allure of what you may assume to be a good murder-mystery film.

On the negative side, the investigation on the train is a little bit rushed. The movie exposes plenty of theories for a potential murderer but doesn't go into detail. It's at times difficult to follow the numerous characters and their motives to commit a murder in the second third of the movie until the final third wraps it up coherently. Another negative element is that the introduction to the film is a little bit long and also unnecessary as it doesn't really add anything to the character development.Those who have never read Murder on the Orient Express or watched one of the numerous movie adaptations will obviously be surprised by the clever story. On the other side, if you are already familiar with the story, there aren't many new elements to discover that would justify to watch this film.Overall, Murder on the Orient Express is an entertaining, profound yet stylish adaptation of one of the greatest crime novels ever written. It's important to continue to honour this novel that has changed the world of literature. On the other side, this version is neither as detailed as the novel nor as charming as Sidney Lumet's version of the seventies. Fans of the novel and those who aren't familiar with the plot should watch this movie but everyone else can skip this version.",Murder on the Orient Express
82,davispittman,Pretty good remake of an Agatha Christie classic,7,13 November 2017,"This is an updated version of the 1970s film version of the Agatha Christie novel. Most people recognize the name Agatha Christie, famous novelist. Christie wrote mystery novels, very good at that. Her body of work consists of things like murder on the orient express, and then there were none (also made into a film), the ABC murders.... plus more. I saw the 1970s film when I was probably too young to see it, but remember it being intriguing and having a very unexpected ending. I will say that for this remake, both of those things still hold true. There are intriguing parts of this movie, and it has an unexpected ending that I really liked and I thought was cleverly done. OK so let's talk about the plot and how it was executed. The plot isn't all too original at first glance. There are a number of passengers on a train, none that having any relation to one another, among them is one of the most famous detectives in existence... and one night the train suddenly stops. They check one of the passengers rooms and discover he's been murdered, stabbed. Immediately, this detective goes to work at trying to discover just who might've had an alibi, but what he discovers really thickens the plot. I won't say what he discovers, just that it makes the film much more interesting and really makes your ears perk up. The acting was well done mostly. I loved Michelle Pfeiffer in her role, Penelope Cruz was good in hers, Johnny Depp fit his well, Judi Dench was impressive as always, and Kenneth Branagh was just perfect for the starring role as Hercule Poirot. The dialogue was good for the most part, there were a few parts where things got a bit dull, and my attention did wander a couple times. That is really the only reason the rating isn't higher than it is. All in all though, it is a pretty good film that will entertain most people who are fans of this kind of movie. 7/10 for Murder on the Orient Express.",Murder on the Orient Express

86,peterp-450-298716,A film adaptation of a classic that won't become a classic,6,5 March 2018,"""My name is Hercule Poirot and I am probably the greatest detective in the world.""Voila. We Belgians can also be proud of the Hercule Poirot phenomenon in addition to our world-famous beers and chocolate. Probably the best detective in the world. And yes, he comes from this tiny country in Europe. The fact he's actually a fictional person created by Agatha Christie, we forget for a moment. This vain, anything but modest, equiped with an enormous moustache, ingenious Belgian detective has already been played by a whole series of actors. But for me it's David Suchet who lived up the most to the image of Poirot.What should you do when making a film of a world-famous book by Agatha Christie and you know in advance that a large part of the audience knows the story and the ending already? Well, the best thing you do is to gather a star cast and using the necessary digital magic tricks to ensure a wow effect. Whether this is sufficient for most moviegoers is a question for me to know and for you to find out. However, I wasn't that impressed. Ok, the first bird's eye views of a Orient Express cutting through the landscape and those swirling camera movements in the snow, look breathtaking. But that's obviously not interesting enough.So, after the introduction of Poirot (Kenneth Branagh), who got an overwhelming mustache, one can calmly reel off the list of familiar faces. And those are certainly not the least. Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Michele Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Derek Jacobi, Olivia Colman and Leslie Odom Jr. are introduced one by one. And then we just have to wait for the train to set of and someone is killed, after which Poirot can start sniffing around for the killer. Fortunately for him, a fresh avalanche causes a delay in such a way that he can unravel the exciting mystery before the authorities arrive.Exciting? Well, not for me at least. I've never been a big fan of classic detective stories like those of Sherlock Holmes and consorts. I always thought it's a bit stiff and not really entertaining. Or it must be such a beautiful film as ""Mr. Holmes ""where the retired detective tries to solve a final case at a leisurely pace, before his memory completely abandons him. In ""Murder on the Orient Express"" there is no sluggish pace, because all suspects on the train must be analyzed by Poirot and provided with a solid motive. And all in just under two hours. That is a lot to show in such a short time frame. The intro, the introductions, the murder, the investigation and then the announcement of the perpetrator. And all this interspersed with stylized images of both the interior and the exterior. It sometimes felt rather hasty.Perhaps you've lived under a rock and never heard of Agatha Christie and this world-famous story. In that case you should definitely give this movie a chance. Is it worthwhile for the others to take the trip to the cinema? Well, if you want to admire the general splendour of the Orient Express, then you definitely should do this. And furthermore, the grotesque, oversized mustache of Branagh will certainly leave an impression. For me they can come up with an extra category for the Oscar award ceremony. That of ""Oversized decor pieces""!",Murder on the Orient Express
87,Enchorde,"Classic story, superb cinematography",9,2 December 2017,"Another remake of the classic story, so the story is not really a surprise (even though I don't count myself as one of the hardcore fans of Christie). But the story is a classic for a reason, it is compelling and engaging, making the movie entertaining all the way.That being said, the best part of the movie is the cinematography and cast/characters. First of, the cinematography is top notch. The landscapes, the views and places we are shown made my want to go on a train ride, hopefully in a landscape as dramatic as in the movie. I loved that part through and through.And I really liked the characters. As I said above, I'm not one of the hardcore fans, but I think Branagh made a superb Poirot. A little different approach than others have portrayed him (especially compared to the TV-series) but very sympathetic and likable. A genius detective with a peculiar personality, but not without warmth and humor.To go into detail about rest of the cast and characters would lead to a long, long text as the cast is numerous and full of stars.

89,adamjohns-42575,Oy! Brannagh! Leave it alone!,4,19 October 2020,"I was really quite disappointed by this film. Generally you can't go wrong with an Agatha Christie story, but this version seemed to show up all the silly parts of it, including and especially the ending. It's a shame, because I'm usually a big fan of Mrs Christie, but while the story was doing a great job, building up to a fantastic climax, it all seemed to be a bit daft and unlikely when the little grey cells finally worked out what had been going on. Having said that I actually felt that there was a bit too much time spent on Poirot and not enough on the other characters to establish motive or let you guess who it might be? Why have all those stars, if you don't give them screen time?The film as a whole seems a bit twee and old fashioned, overly polished and a bit hammy, something you might expect of a mid 70's American adaptation. Some of the cast were played to quite an extreme. The best performances came from Dame Judi, Sir Derek and Mr Depp, but I was saddened to see Daisy Ridley playing Rey from Star Wars (A part she did very well), what a waste of her talents. And you might as well have hired my Mum to play Olivia Coleman's role, for all that she was allowed to contribute.I didn't really think it was necessary that the story be made again and I stand by that, because, apart from appealing to the Johnny Depp generation (Which actually I suppose I am), it has added nothing to the story or the other versions that have gone before. In fact I thought that Kenneth was trying to replicate ITV's Poirot, with the exception of his ridiculous moustache. I'd much rather watch the slightly more serious David Suchet or one of the titles filmed with Peter Ustinov.

94,jadepietro,The Mustache Did It,6,15 November 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5 stars) GRADE: C+ THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: This film gets derailed in its confused storytelling, a less than stellar cast, and some misdirection...facial and otherwise.SYNOPSIS: Agatha Christie's classic murder mystery is remade for today's modern audience.JIM'S REVIEW: I think it was...Kenneth Branagh...on the train...with his mustache...that killed the movie. The who, what. where, and how may be answered in this unnecessary remake of Murder on the Orient Express, but the ""why"" still nags at this moviegoer. Why dig up this buried gem when one could easily view the far superior 1974 murder mystery classic by Sidney Lumet and his all-star cast of screen legends (Finney, Bergman, Bacall, Connery, Redgrave, and such)? Can this new treatment with state-of-the-art CGI, a more expensive budget, and a cast of today's recognizable actors improve upon this tale of murder and deceit? ￼The answer is a resounding ""no"" in comparison. The specter of Mr. Lumet's masterful film haunts this earnest but standard remake. It's foolhardy filmmaking that does little to improve its literary source. Whereas the 1974 version streamlined a convoluted plot, focused on some fine directorial touches, brought an air of elegance in its elegant Art Deco decor, delivered some interesting well-written characters, and added a first class tier of legendary actors to its roster, this new, but far from improved, update muddles its complicated story, provides stagy direction, has an dark sedated period look, introduces some characters in need of more clarity and motive, and brings a second class group of celebrities to this remake (combined with a few star-worthy replacements). Overall, this 2017 tale has lost all of its sense of glamour, wit, and fun.It seems that rebooting and re-imagining has taken the place of creativity these days. So with that said, my remainder of my review on this latest attempt to fill the pockets of the producers and filmmakers will try to concentrate on only this movie...a hard task, indeed.￼For those newbies unaware of the plot: Aboard a high-class speeding train, is super sleuth, Hercule Poirot. It is there that our fussy Belgian hero meets a shady criminal who fears that he will be killed before disembarking and asks our fastidious detective to prevent his demise. Alas, the deadly deed does take place (no real spoiler here) and the list of passengers become his targeted suspects as he unravels the mystery. Clues are scattered through the narrative as, one by one, each traveler converses with Monsieur Poirot. Rest assure, the culprit (or culprits) will be found by the film's end.The casting is paramount to make this mousetrap work. Mr. Branagh serves as director and lead actor and his dual contributions are a tad uneven. As a director, he layers the narrative with some skill but never involves his audience, choosing to look more at the panoramic scenery than concentrate on the characters. The screenplay by Michael Green doesn't help matters either. The film begins with a totally unrelated crime that establishes Poirot's quirky behavioral traits but adds little to the plot, except confusion.￼However, Branagh the Actor captures the detective's dialect and his mannerisms well, but he is essentially miscast by his own physicality...and his odd choice of including that ridiculous fur- piece posing as a mustache to the Poirot character. Yes, it is a trademark of the sleuth, but, seen here, it is an absurd facial prop that interferes with the character and the story. He takes the term ""stiff upper lip"" far too literally. Always upstaged by the damn mustache, the actor fights for equal screen time and loses the battle. Plus the fact that the actor himself is rather tall and handsome upends Agatha Christie's unlikable but beloved toady character.￼Some ""stars"" match their predecessors with style (Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer), others acquit themselves rather nicely (Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom, Jr. ), a few are underused and underwritten (Willem Dafoe, Olivia Coleman, Derek Jacobi, Johnny Depp) but some haven't a clue on how to create a memorable character (Josh Gad, Penelope Cruz). In their defense, the writing may be suspect too.￼Jim Clay's fine production design shows off the opulence without the elegance. Cinematography is first-rate and the period costumes are true to the period but hardly show- stopping. However, the CGI avalanche scene is so fake and jarringly bad that is literally stops the film cold. No, this cinematic game of Clue remains a mystery. With all its fancy trappings, Murder on the Orient Express may look the part. But under closer examination, some less than stellar casting bits, a few excessively theatrical moments, and a meandering script make this whodunit more of a ""why-do-it"".￼NOTE: Those unfamiliar with Dame Agatha's book or the previous aforementioned Lumet film may enjoy this movie more than those already acquainted with the story and its twisty ending. I was mildly disappointed with the end result.",Murder on the Orient Express
95,rgkarim,All Aboard For Another Mediocre Adaptation,7,11 November 2017,"Mysteries, a genre that intrigues so many with complex tales, intertangled deception, and often drama to help build suspense before the big revelation. While many people try to combine mystery with other genres, there are those who choose to focus on mystery alone. One of these artists is Agatha Christie, a forefront writer who continues to tease our brains with crimes that dive into deeper levels. And with great literature, comes great grounds for Hollywood to make movies from it. This particular tale has gotten a remake this weekend, one with a star-studded cast to try to bring people into the movies in this modern telling. What's in store? Please read on to find out as we review Murder On The Orient Express. LIKES: Setting: Start off with a simple like, this film is a shining example of green screen visuals blending with real world shots. The snowy wilderness of the mountains is a dazzling spectacle of symbolism that mirrors the foreboding crime that hangs over the Orient Express. It's a breathtaking display of technology that keeps the darker spirit of the movie alive, and may leave you chilled at the menacing nature hanging in the air. But the highlight is the train and the recreation of those elegant cars and cabins the locomotive industry was famous for. This recreation takes you back in time and immerses you in the classical setting, while also designing a death trap to which our players partake in. The Mystery: For a movie that focuses on the classic question of who done it, Murder on The Orient Express did a nice job keeping the mystery going. The screen adaptation drops enough hints to throw one off the path, all while keeping you engaged in deciphering the identity of the culprit. As our detective interviews all the characters, you will start getting an idea of how complex the whole case is, further shrouding the scene in a veil that tries to keep you from the answer. It works, keeping suspense going and the film moving, which isn't easy in mysteries these days. Kenneth Branagh: Acting wise all the cast do their jobs very well, some better than others in terms of screen time, elegance, and of course capturing their accents down correctly. Yet of all the group it was Kenneth Branagh who I enjoyed watching the most. True, he is the main character and thus gets the most screen time, but his acting was very enjoyable to watch for nearly 2 hours. His French accent is not the best at times, but he gets the OCD detective role down pat, catching the nervous energy and single minded focus that comes with the disorder. His explanations of the crime are delivered in such a serious tone, confidence filling the voice as he presents his logic and convinces you of all the facts. Finally, his comedic delivery is also very well done, not too forced and well-integrated into the conversations, Branagh carries a lot of the movie on his sharply dressed shoulders. DISLIKES:Slow: We know mysteries have to go slow to build things up, but Orient's wheels really slog at times. Primarily when it comes to linking a few backstories together, the movie sort of derails into from the path at hand. Losing this momentum takes away from the suspense, and sort of gets a yawn if you don't pay close attention to the dialogue. And even when they resume chasing the mystery once more they drag things out in a grandiose display that does hold emotion, but steps far over the line for this reviewer. Unbalanced Characters: A star studded cast again calls for time management and using your resources well. Orient took a nice shot, but they failed to really give the characters equal time on the screen. I don't know how the book is written, but it was obvious the casting favored certain actors over others. Certain characters really get the shaft in this installment, brought out of the shadows for mere seconds and a few answers, before dropping off the screen. This happened with at least four characters for me, brief introductions that were certainly important, but almost confusing at some points. Certainly, Christie did better in displaying her suspects in the book, but they didn't do it as well as I think they could. Rushed development: It's a plus to have a mystery that moves, it is not so much a plus when your key development areas move like a blur. Murder on the Orient Express involves one having to listen to the dialogue extensively to piece things together, primarily in the alibis of the characters. For me, there were a lot of rapid dialogue exchanges that hastily were spilled out in an attempt to give our characters some background. This background information is incredibly important, so perhaps they should have shifted to a lower gear to clarify this information and establish that depth they were going for. Such a shame to have all these details smeared in a half-sloppy manner when there was such potential to be had. The VERDICT:Compared to the book and the older rendition of this movie, Murder on The Orient Express 2017 is not the shiniest noire in the box. Great visuals, a luring mystery, a phenomenal main character will carry the audience far in this film and provide the main source of entertainment in the film. The main problem is that the team didn't deliver on the potential that this story/cast had. It was unnecessarily slow at points, characters were lacking in a very character centric plot, and it was rushed in areas that was the sustenance. Therefore, the movie overall is mediocre, and better left for a free pass/RedBox in this reviewer's opinion. My scores are: Crime/Drama/Mystery: 7.0-7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0",Murder on the Orient Express
96,richard-1787,An often breathtakingly-beautiful movie,8,10 November 2017,"""An often breathtakingly-beautiful movie"" is not a common description of a murder mystery, but for me, while this movie had other remarkable features, it was first and foremost often breathtaking beautiful. I'm glad I opted to see it in a theater, with a huge HD screen at that, because it certainly added to the pleasure. Some of what we see is computer graphics, but I don't know when I've seen them used so well.The cinematography in general is wonderful and often very creative here. Close-ups of faces that make them look just astonishingly beautiful and at the same time full of character. Interesting camera angles. This movie is certainly a joy to watch.And then there is the acting. I thought Branaugh, a great actor, made Poirot too much of a caricature, but the rest of the actors do a great job with their roles. The camera often shoots their faces close-up, as in older movies, but it can, because these actors all know how to act with their faces.At times the script seemed too full of clues that we weren't allowed enough time to think about. Perhaps, now that I know the end - which certainly comes as a surprise! - the clues would make more sense on a second viewing.Still, a wonderful movie, and one that should definitely be seen in a theater. So much of it would be lost on a small screen.-----------------------------Since seeing the movie and writing the above, I read the book. The differences between it and the movie are telling. The end of the movie, the unraveling of the mystery, seemed too abrupt. It was as if the director had run out of time presenting the mystery, and so, rather than letting Poirot solve it a step at a time, he just dumped the solution on us when Poirot calls for a meeting of all the passengers outside the train.That in fact is evidently what happened. In the book, Poirot works things out one step at a time after he has interviewed all the passengers a first time. Some of his deductions are, at best, far- fetched, but others make sense and are based on clues that we have sometimes had dangling in front of us for some time. That working out, which takes 100 of the book's 260 pages, is basically discarded for the joint confession in front of the tunnel entrance. Looked at in retrospect, I can see now that the long episode at the beginning of the movie, not in the book, where Poirot solves a different crime in front of the walls of Jerusalem, and then all the business in Istanbul, should have been tossed out or pared way down. I can imagine it would have been painful to throw away so much footage, but keeping it left no time for Poirot to solve the case a step at a time after he had met all the passengers in the sleeping car.As I wrote above, before reading Christie's book, what we have looks great. I could understand, however, if Christie fans felt short- changed.",Murder on the Orient Express
97,Kingslaay,Decent adaptation and great cast,8,26 December 2017,"I am a huge fan of Agatha Christie's work and watched all of her adapted Poirot novels. In my opinion David Suchet is the definitive Hercule Poirot. Having said that the shock value and mystery element was removed. This did not prevent it from being a decent and enjoyable film. Poirot was portrayed really well and praise is deserved.The pros of this film are its star power, great CGI and filming locations. However one must not hold the story against the film as the story itself is complicated with a few holes in it. It was an accurate adaptation but the source material had its issues.

99,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"That hideously distracting moustache, was it meant to be comical?",5,14 November 2017,"Because it was hypnotically distracting. I kept staring at it, and its obviously visible glue-lined edges, trying to figure why he didn't just simply grow a real, time-appropriate looking one? Elegant retelling, has a slow, and silly, beginning, which makes Poirot seem just a finicky old man, who happens to solve problems by bumbling and pure luck alone. Far too much slapstick before we arrive in the train. In fact, the opening could be completely taken out, and the film begin when the train arrives ( fifteen minutes into​ the movie ) , and it would be all the more better. Depp does well in his role, for his fifteen minutes of screen time, the perfectly portrayed, perfectly sleazy character, who fears for his life, from any number of suspects. Judy Dench's presence kept reminding me of my all time favourite movie, Skyfall, and kept making me wish I was watching that again. Furthermore, she is basically just sitting in the background for most of her screen time, leaving no impression. The avalanche, trapping everyone on board, sealing them in tightly, looked impressive, and was well done, but defeated by the fact we see them walking around in frigid temperatures, and snow covered mountains, ruining any sense of claustrophobia there was built up, and furthermore, they walk in the snow in regular clothes, as though its just a cool morning, and nothing more. Also, after the avalanche, the majority of the train is stuck teetering and balancing on the wooden tracks, high above ground. I kept waiting for them to address that, and do something with that, but nothing. This is very well photographed, elegant looking, but occasionally show-off camera-work was distracting. Overall, this is a mostly good looking, mostly well acted and photographed, bit of mediocrity, with bits and pieces of something good scattered throughout, but it can't quite add up. It never really came alive, and the song playing during the closing credits is awful. It sounds like the end theme from Faces Of Death",Murder on the Orient Express
100,bkrauser-81-311064,Too Many Qualifiers to Recommend Strongly,7,10 November 2017,"Is it just me or have trailers now fallen into the habit of selling movies as something they're not. I started noticing this trend sometime around last winter's Passengers (2016). The film was sold as a sweeping sci-fi space adventure when, what it ended up being was a weepy drama with sci-fi trimmings and the mentality of a 90's romantic comedy. Book of Henry (2017), Suburbicon (2017) heck even the very excellent Mother! (2017) all sold themselves as one thing then blindsided audiences by being something entirely different.The trailer for Murder on the Orient Express and the accompanying movie definitely fall into this trap, though not in the way you'd expect. It is, a point of fact, a candidly old-fashioned whodunit with a showy lead performance by director/star Kenneth Branagh at its center; that much you know. Yet if you're not familiar with the Agatha Christie novel, the stunningly overrated 1974 film or the even more unbearable 2001 made-for-TV movie, you'll be somewhat surprised that the whodunit at the head of this story is very much beside the point. This isn't a murder mystery as the title suggests but rather a social investigation on whether pre-meditated murder can truly be justified.The film begins at the tail end of one of detective Hercule Poirot (Branagh) world famous criminal investigations. Tired and in need of rest, relaxation and Dickens, Poirot takes the advice of an old friend (Bateman), and hitches a ride on the Orient Express, a luxury coach that winds through the snow-covered Carpathian Mountains before chugging through some of Europe's most important cities. Finding a full train of interesting and potentially dangerous characters, Poirot's relaxation turns to suspicion when a known criminal with plenty of enemies, is discovered dead on board.During Poirot's careful deconstruction of events and motives we get a sense of Hercule's intelligence, poise under pressure and innate sense of justice. ""To me the difference between right and wrong is as clear as black and white,"" says a tired Poirot right before hopping the train. Little does he know that his brief holiday from crime will have him plumbing through the depths of human sorrow, guilt and anger, ultimately shifting his antiquated worldview.If you come into Orient Express with that in mind, you may end up having a pretty good time. Agatha Christie invented the popular Poirot for her many novels but the character is a creature of the stage. His mannerisms are big and his emotions are even bigger. Branagh knows this and imbues the super sleuth with a certain theatricality that works well in the cramped quarters of a gently rocking train. He has a stage and fills it with deeply felt emotional stakes. When the big third-act twist reveals itself, we actually feel for Poirot's internal struggle and hardly do we envy him when things start to fall apart.Of course getting there, and feeling for Poirot much less the rest of our characters involves entirely too many qualifiers for Murder on the Orient Express to warrant a strong recommendation. If you have seen the 1974 Sidney Lumet film, this newer, flashier version feels like an unnecessary remake. It's prettier and quicker paced but like a clear night in a big city, it just feels less impressive and has far fewer stars than you'd like. If you've read the novel then the film's fidelity to the source material may warrant some brownie points. But again, if that's what you're looking for than the 1974 version straight up does it better.If however, you're coming in fresh and you're jonesing for a good 'ol fashion mystery where you can play along at home thenI have some bad news for you. This movie (and let's face it, every other incarnation of the story), leaves the mystery to hang out just long enough for you to engage on an intellectual level then pulls the rug out from under you in the most unsatisfying of ways. I'm being coy because I don't want to ruin it for you but let's just say Orient Express has always felt like taking a final exam that you've been fretting over for weeks only to discover that everyone's getting an ""A"" regardless.So yeah, if you want to get the most out of this movie, you need to have either read the book or seen one of the films. You have to be at least familiar with Kenneth Branagh's directorial efforts and realize that the intellectual exercise in this case is not finding out who the killer is but spotting the differences and similarities between the many versions of the same story. The characters are as always interesting and as I said, this one is prettier, but the greatest version possible out of the source material, this film is not.",Murder on the Orient Express
101,Luigi Di Pilla,Promising start of Hercule Poirot,6,11 October 2020,I liked the journey with the Orient Express midst the mountains in full winter. In addition a mysterious murder case to solve on this train. The greatest detective Poirot played by Kenneth Branagh made a great job using the typical and believable French accent. All the other well known actors played their roles perfectly. It was entertaining with a surprising end.

102,denis888,Mediore Piece Of Nothing,1,1 March 2018,"Oh my God. How can it really be possible? A great cast, with such stars as Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp or Daisy Ridley among those, pretty good director and the lead character who is Kenneth Branagh, seemingly lossless plot, a classic Agatha Christie train murder story... and what we have is a horrible, grotesque, crooked, over-played, over-done, over-cooked, over-made up, over-made, over-performed, over-everything piece of truly fetid garbage. What is even more insulting, the movie is a tedious endless ebb boredom fest.
 Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two and a half stars, and stated that he felt it focused too much on Poirot to the detriment of the other characters, adding, ""Never let it be said the director misses an opportunity to place his star front and center, unfortunately relegating just about everyone else in the obligatory International All-Star Cast to a paper-thin character with one or at most two defining personality traits.
Truly so.
 Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club rated the film a C+ and complained that Branagh's ""erratic direction-more interested in cut glass and overhead shots than in suspicions and uncertainties-bungles both the perfect puzzle logic of the crime and its devious solution.""

Sadly, no character worked hard enough to gain our sympathy or empathy to excuse the conclusion.

Sets, trains-fabulous trains, costumes, performers, cinematography, music, what more could you ask? Well, maybe a more focused, and involving script with direction that knew what direction it wanted to take. Here's a good story that's maybe been reinvented one time too many. This glossy remake tries to be everything to everyone and that's been proven impossible many times over - it's a murder mystery, comedy, drama, romance, spectacle, that only just manages to be a little of them all. Kenneth Branagh, shows off as director and star (Hercule Poirot) and his big international cast probably had more fun than some audiences might - except those who don't expect a great deal from an over baked multimillion dollar production. The trailer too, looked impressive, but also sowed the seeds of apprehension about over promise. Maybe I expected too much but, it seems from an assortment of reviews, others also felt a little caught out - and to think, already, they are planning to remake more in this series. The end result is handsome looking foolishness - if that's all you want, then you may not mind. 
Heavy use of CGI offers several eye popping visual treats and it features a fairly good song over the end titles - sung, quite surprisingly well by Michelle Pfeiffer but, not a great deal else.",Murder on the Orient Express

106,Abdulxoxo,A big misfire,6,4 February 2021,"As director, Branagh cast himself as the main character and milked the opportunity as much as he could. This movie was all about him; and unfortunately that meant that all the other characters felt underdeveloped and the amazing cast underutilized. Perhaps if he was amazing in the role, it would have been forgivable for wasting the talent he had at his disposal; but he was not very good Poirot. His accent was comical, almost to the point of insulting; his arrogance was too much; and his moustache was just ridiculous. The opening act is completely irrelevant. We see Poirot in Jerusalem, where he's solving a case of a stolen relic. It set the tone for the movie by demonstrating Poirot as an all powerful God-like figure who knows all. It had nothing to do with the story whatsoever. As far as the main plot is concerned, it was unbelievably boring. This wasn't helped by the fact that the score was one of the dreariest in memory. but to be honest it didn't really matter because it didn't give me any clues to the ending anyway. Poirot would interview each of the passengers and we'd learn a little of their back story. Meanwhile they'd all be looking at each other suspiciously wondering who the killer was. I found the whole thing to be incredibly slow, and having taken against Branagh's version of Poirot. By the time we eventually get to the end and discover who the murderer was it was incredibly underwhelming. but as someone who didn't know beforehand who the killer was, I can't say I was too pleased when I found out. To be fair to the film, I guess that disappointment was the source material's fault. On a positive note the costume design was amazing as it fit with the period. I thought everyone was dressed very well. The movie also had a very nice set design, especially inside the train.",Murder on the Orient Express

As such it was a great performance by a great cast. Those who didnâ(TM)t like it perplex me. This is not a modern crime story with action or violence or explosions to distract us. Like Sherlock Homes, Poirot is detective who use his mind and observation skills rather than physical action and violence to solve his case. The filming is perfect, the pace slow and steady, the denouement handled with precision. If you go into this expecting a James Bond type movie ( which I really like precisely because it they are full of action and spectacle but not too much intellectual input !), you will be disappointed. But if you expect to have your mind intrigued and you like to solve crime, then you will not be disappointed. I suspect it will be more enjoyable if you have no idea as to the true plot line, so if you have read the story in the past, it would help if you do not re-read it and you have forgotten some of the details.",Murder on the Orient Express
108,Troy_Campbell,A pleasing time-waster.,6,11 November 2017,"Travelling the globe solving case after case, famous detective Hercule Poirot needs a break. A three-day trip from Istanbul to Paris aboard the luxurious Orient Express is the perfect chance to relax until one of the passengers is viciously murdered. Adapted from Agatha Christie's 1934 novel, the source of no less than four adaptations through visual mediums already, director Kenneth Branagh (also starring as Poirot) attempts to reinvigorate this classic tale for modern audiences. He partly succeeds. Retaining the 1930s setting but instilling contemporary filmmaking techniques—long unbroken shots, CGI trickery, an ever-roaming camera—Branagh replaces the midday-mystery feel usually attached to Agatha Christie yarns with a sharp and shiny prestige. There's absolutely no doubt that this version looks stunning, every dollar of its reported $55m budget seemingly splashed out on screen, however this can't disguise the fact there are narrative hurdles aplenty. Although a decent whodunit that throws up a plethora of twists and turns, the outcome isn't completely satisfying (or unpredictable), whilst the abundance of ostensibly important characters results in screen time spread too thin for any of them to leave a lasting impression. The famed sleuth is, rightfully so, the stand out here, Branagh portraying the Belgian Poirot as a dapper, well-mannered Sherlock Holmes-type genius just on the right side of eccentric. Dame Judi Dench is also a hoot as the snooty Princess Dragomiroff. A plucky update to a classic thriller, Murder on the Orient Express is a pleasing time-waster.",Murder on the Orient Express
109,areatw,An all style production that quickly runs out of steam,5,13 November 2017,"'Murder on the Orient Express' is the latest addition to the ever growing 'style over substance' club. A film that is beautiful to watch, with no shortage of stunning mountainous scenery, but beyond the surface, it lacks much of what is expected from a whodunnit mystery thriller. If anything, the visuals work to the film's disadvantage. Cutting away to a shot of snow capped mountains in between scenes doesn't exactly help to build and hold any sort of tension.The pacing is also too slow for my liking, with the murder and subsequent whodunnit mystery taking too long to arrive. Even as the mystery starts to unfold, there's a lingering feeling that the film is cruising along and never really gets up to speed. For production value, 'Murder on the Orient Express' is excellent, but visuals aren't enough for a film like this, especially when you consider the material they were working with.",Murder on the Orient Express

113,classicalsteve,Decent Updating of the Agatha Christie Masterpeace is Not Quite as Mysterious as the 1974 Version,7,27 November 2017,"It's difficult to improve upon the original ""Murder on the Orient Express"" film of 1974. Some aspects are slightly improved while others suffer. I give Branagh some credit for engaging in this project while simultaneously it seemed that a remake which is not as good as the original may have been ill-conceived. The original 1974 film is, by far, the best murder mystery ever shot. Sort of like remaking ""Star Wars IV: A Good Hope"". What's the point? Given there are many great Agatha Christie books which have not yet had large-screen treatment (the David Suchet series was meant for television), it seems Branagh could have chosen another one. And there are other large screen productions which could be greatly improved upon, such as the Peter Ustinov ""Death on the Nile"". A quick run down of the story. Hercule Poirot, vacationing in Istanbule, is called to take a case back in London. He is to board the Orient Express back to Western Europe. (The Orient Express is a luxury train which runs from Western Europe to the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. Today it can cost as much as $1000+ per day.) All expenses paid, he ""runs into"" several of the quirky characters which are also taking the train. He can't secure a first class compartment right away because the train is full and has to settle for a second class cabin with a roommate. The train gets on its way, and Samuel Ratchett (Johnny Depp), a rather grumpy antiques dealer, asks for Poirot to take his case. He's been receiving death threats and desires Poirot to help him for $15,000, which would be a king's ransom in 1934, or about $275,000 in today's money. The next night, the train is moving through the snow-clad alps of Central Europe. Some strange things are happening near Poirot's compartment, such as someone who rings for the assistant conductor, and someone leaves another compartment, apparently a woman wearing a flowing dressing gown with a dragon emblazoned on the back. The next day, Ratchett is found stabbed to death in his compartment. The son of the train owners, Bouc (Tom Bateman), pleads with Poirot to take the case to save the train from the disruption of a government investigation. At the same time, the train has hit an avalanche is unable to move forward. The Belgian sleuth reluctantly takes the case. Will he be able to solve the mystery before authorities arrive?I'll start with the good. Kenneth Branagh, given he will be inevitably compared to Albert Finney and David Suchet, arguably the two best Hercule Poirot's of all-time, makes for a memorable Belgian detective (not French). His performance as everyone's favorite European continental sleuth is definitely better than the choice of Peter Ustinov, who came off like a cross between Poirot, Nero and Mussorgsky in two Agatha Christie films in the 1970's. Branagh more or less pulls it off. His is not a Poirot which will win him any acting trophies (Finney was nominated for both an Academy Award and a BFTA Award for Best Actor for the same part in 1974), but it's definitely not the worst. The cinematography is also exceptional when paired with CGI makes for some spectacular scenes of the Austrian/Swiss alps. Depp is fairly good as Ratchett, and Wilem Dafoe makes a good Gerhard Hardman.The not so good. There was far more mystery in the original than in the present offering. The Daisy Armstrong case, loosely inspired by the Lindbergh Kidnapping case which was recent to the first edition of Christie's novel, was presented in the original with much more dynamic flair. Newsreel type footage shows the case at the beginning while in this offering, the case is revealed through what appear to be home movies. Some scenes were a bit melodramatic. I love Michelle Pfeiffer, but here her Mrs. Hubbard is not quite as interesting as her counterpart from the 1970's, Lauren Becall. Pfeiffer's Hubbard becomes over-the-top melodramatic towards the end while Becall's becomes the opposite when things are revealed. Again, a difficult act to follow. Judi Dench as the Russian Princess Dragomiroff didn't have much screen time. In the original, played by Wendy Hiller, Hiller almost steals the show, and keeps up strive for strive with Albert Finney. Even Sean Connery's famous scene in the 1974 film where he, as Colonel Arbuthnot says ""...are you suggesting that I'm fool enough to have entered Ratchett's cabin, murdered him, cleaned my 'peep', and dropped it into the ash tray on my way out?"" Sadly this line was absent from this new production. Unfortunately, I found the final solution less captivating than the original of 1974.Again, a decent one-watch, but it only made me long to see the original 1974 film. This film is good, make no mistake. But it didn't quite have the wit of the original. Strangely, this film was a bit humorless, save for an opening sequence (not in the book) where Poirot solves a crime in Instanbul. I found that sequence more compelling than a lot of other things in the rest of the film.",Murder on the Orient Express
114,thekarmicnomad,"Remember, this is an old girl",7,12 February 2018,"A lot of my friends found this film a bit simplistic and underwhelming.
I quite enjoyed it.The story is coming on for 90 years old now and if you were to shred it down to its atoms there really isn't a lot going on.But a lot of the stories of that time were about exotic locations that only the rich or adventurous could embark on. 
I thought the film captured this well.There are lots of cinematic shots of sunsets and snowy mountain passes that the train chugs its way along.
The camera often glides along the carriages capturing the occupants through foggy windows or inbetween luggage racks.The acting and characters I thought were all at least adequate for the yarn - considering they needed to be quite sterotypical.To enjoy this you have to put quite a lot of effort in yourself.

116,one9eighty,A decent family movie,6,28 February 2018,"I enjoyed this film - I wasn't sure that I was going to, based on the reviews I'd read - but I did enjoy it, in a mixed kind of way. This despite the fact that I remember the 1974 version, and the TV series version with David Suchet fondly. A lot of films nowadays tend to be big budget, all action, sweary-mary kind of films. It was refreshing to see a movie that was entertaining and suitable to watch with family members from teens to seniors. Hardcore fans of Agatha Christie may not be to happy with this adaptation/remake because of the way it's been Hollywoodified - maybe the finger can point to Kenneth Brannagh for this, as he directed and starred in the leading role (which can be seen as a vehicle for his success/reputation). Elements of the film had been modernised, primarily to meet expectations of it's potential audiences, rather than to drive the films on. It was fast paced, moody, sexy and clever at different times - but I don't think it actually needed to be or should have been. The cast was undeniably brilliant, and between them they probably have a massive trophy collection - but did it need to be? I suspect that if the cast was an attempt to do a star studded feature like the 1974 version then it meets that expectation. If the cast was chosen for acting prowess, then perhaps unknown stars could have faired equally well because the film isn't about personality and connecting with the characters, it's about their story. (Perhaps the use of superstars was a clever way of diverting the obvious revelations from the audience so they kept on guessing 'whodunnit' too.)If you haven't read the book or seen the other versions you might get more enjoyment out of this than anyone who knows the story. Either way though this was a decent family film which wasn't offensive and was made to fit for modern audiences. I'd watch whatever follow-up is planned (and hinted towards at the end). 6 out of 10.",Murder on the Orient Express

119,rockman182,Murder on the Orient Express (2017),6,11 November 2017,"I remember enjoying Sidney Lumet's original adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel. It felt long, but was thoroughly entertaining. The remake had me slightly intrigued. Mostly because it had a really good cast to boot. I'm not the biggest fan of Kenneth Branagh's directional efforts, though I quite liked the live action Cinderella remake. With this film, we have a rather dull and uninspiring effort that does little to warrant its creation. It looks nice but feels like a wasted effort.The film follows ""the greatest detective in the world"" Hercule Poirot as he is stranded on a train with other passengers. One night a murder occurs as one of the passengers is stabbed to death. It is up to Poirot to find out who committed the crime, while realizing the passengers on the train may not be as random and innocent as they seem. Branagh both directs and takes the lead role of Poirot in the film.That's kind of where the problem lies. Branagh as Poirot takes center stage, and its a little too centered. There is a real talented cast here, that is not much more than background characters with limited material. Judi Dench is in the film and is rarely involved with screen time. I think Branagh is good as Poirot but the film kind of plods along and doesn't garner enough interest or shock as it goes along. The film feels like it just states the plot without delivering it for the audience.The film remains quite faithful to the novel and is closely similar to Lumet's adaptation. I wanted more liberties taken to provide for a worthy and innovative adaptation but I can understand why it isn't that way. The film does not make use of its potential, and is an inferior adaptation of the novel. The visuals and picture is prim and proper but the film derails along the way which is unfortunate.6/10",Murder on the Orient Express
120,RforFilm,"Well acted and visually sound, Murder on the Orient Express is a nice mystery that should make Agatha Christie fans satisfied",7,13 November 2017,"I think it's been a while since we've seen a classic murder mystery film. What's interesting is that there's thousands of books, but not too many of them get adaptations let alone into film. Why? Their not easy to write and they manage to keep a lot of detail to plot and character in order to twist and turn the final answer of ""who did it"". I can only conclude that mystery seems to have a better life on television as in that medium, those elements can not only stretch further then a films runtime, but can probably better play around the viewers ideas on what's going on. Given all of that, today's movie is a remake of Murder on the Orient Express, based off of the acclaimed novel by Agatha Christie. While I know she has written a large amount of books, her mysteries has been adapted countless times. What made Murder on the Orient Express (and what a lot of mysteries had incorporated) good was how tight and claustrophobic the situation was. It also had the luck of having Hercule Poirit, a detective with crazy attention to detail, to solve the mystery. While he hasn't had the same attention as Sherlock Holmes, he's made his stance has his journeys have filled over thirty novels. Let's see if Murder on the Orient Express can improve from the previous adaptions. In 1934, Hercule Poirot (played by Kenneth Branagh) is about to embark on a much needed break after solving a recent mystery in Jerusalem. He is still under his oath that within most cases, there is only right or wrong. In needing to return to London, he's given a spot on the Orient Express, which seems to be fully booked. He's approached by an American businessman Samuel Ratchett (played by Johnny Depp) to work for him, but Poirot declines. The next morning, Ratchett is found to have been stabbed to death. An avalanche has also derailed the steam engine, stranding the rest of the passengers. Poirot decides to take the case to curb his boredom. It's on this train he interviews all the suspects; wet nurse Pilar (played by Penélope Cruz), scientist Gerhard (played by William Defoe), the princess Dragomiroff (played by Judi Dench) accountant Hector (played by Josh Gad), Doctor Arbuthnot (played by Leslie Odom Jr.), traveler Caroline (played by Michelle Pfeiffer), and Mary (played by Daisy Ridley).I better stop there as most mysteries are best when you know as little as possible. Kenneth Branagh is also in the director's chair for Murder on the Orient Express, and for what I expected, I was surprised. I haven't seen the original, nor have I read the book, but I can say I was intrigued, even if the story is a tad overstuffed. It's common for a lot of mysteries to have a lot of characters, but given what exactly is being solved, it may have benefited to cut two or three of the background characters in order to tighten everything. Though even with the over abundance of characters, all the main actors shine, especially Kenneth Branagh, whose very likable and a fun guy to follow. His accent and tone has the right balance of over-the-top and subtle makes him seem like someone who could be that eccentric and smart. If I had to pick my other favorites, I'd say that they were Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, and Michelle Pfeiffer, who do a lot with the material their characters are given. That's not to put a damper on everyone else. This is compelling enough that it goes a long with the long dialogue.Now for those expecting a lot of action will want to look elsewhere. Murder on the Orient Express is very dialogue heavy, as a lot of mysteries are. Where it can make up to curb boredom is the cinematography and editing. The movie is beautiful looking and contain the element of a grand scope feeling that most Kenneth Branagh movies have. Many of the flashbacks are shown which has a neat ""old Hollywood"" look to them that gives this movie a bigger sense on nostalgia. I'll give this seven Orient Express trains out of ten. I can't fully embrace this as great piece of art, but I'm glad I saw Murder on the Orient Express. The imagery looks nice enough that I'd recommend that you view it on the big screen. If your not looking for something that is a definite slow burn, this isn't for you. Take the train and see if this kills for you.",Murder on the Orient Express

As I haven't read the book, I kept guessing as to who the murderer could be, right till the last few minutes of the movie. The suspense has been brilliantly maintained, throughout. The reveal in the end, was slightly disappointing for me. The ensemble cast's performances, are the highlight of the film. Kenneth Branagh is spectacular as Hercule Poirot. Branagh nails Poirot's French accent, without overdoing it. Daisy Ridley is excellent as Miss Mary Debenham. Leslie Odom Jr. is great as Dr. Arbuthnot. Tom Bateman is superb as Bouc. Penelope Cruz is amazing as Pilar Estravados. Josh Gad is fantastic as Hector MacQueen. Johnny Depp is good as Edward Ratchett. Derek Jacobi is impressive as Edward Henry Masterman. Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding as Caroline Hubbard. Judi Dench could have been given a bigger role, as Princess Dragomiroff. Olivia Colman is effective as Hildegarde Schmidt. Willem Dafoe is flawless as Gerhard Hardman. The supporting cast is perfect. Murder on the Orient Express is worth a watch, for fans of the source material & fans of whodunit movies.",Murder on the Orient Express

126,joebloggscity,Dress up party for luvee friend actors.....,5,20 September 2018,"This on the surface of it should be an interesting adaption. Showings of old Agatha Christie movies is a staple diet of the Xmas tv schedules with old favourites like Peter Ustinov burned into the mind for all.
Story is as it says in the title, as our legendary sleuth tries to decipher an impossible murder of a despicable character.With a stellar cast, modern filming techniques and a decent budget, surely Kenneth Branagh can't go wrong? Yes & No.The problem is that it seems that this is all a jamboree for friends to get together and have a dress party, which in part is the truth. For most there was little effort needed to play their parts, although for some of the more notable names it was hardly a difficult task anyhow.Kenneth Branagh is actually the weakest part. Yes, he can act and has the credits to prove it. Yet here, he does so much wrong. His accent is jarring and quite comical, his moustache is a little overdone and again a comical distraction. His acting too is a bit overwrought, but maybe the script didn't help him out. Should have been tailored more for him and the screen.I was simply disappointed in this one. It's not actually all bad. The camera work is excellent, and thankfully they didn't pander to bloodlust murder fans with gory pictures, keeping it quite respectable. It's about the mystery that makes these stories.Anyhow, disappointing here, but hopefully has introduced some people newly to Agatha Christie or at least reignited an interest in her work. Good luck to Brannagh et al with the sequel, and hope they learnt from the criticisms that this one has widely generated.",Murder on the Orient Express
127,MihaiSorinToma,A missed opportunity,7,30 November 2017,"After solving yet another mystery, the famous detective, Hercule Poirot, travels with the Orient Express to a distant location for his next case. What he's about to encounter is a deep mystery which involves a murder with many connections and apparently, a culprit which is hard to find. Together with a friend who happens to be the owner of the train, he must investigate, interrogate all passengers and find the killer before the train reaches the next station, while being derailed due to harsh, winter conditions.It's a remake of an adaptation of a famous book with the same name by Agatha Christie which presents a very strange case of a murder which will prove to be much complex and hard to solve than ever expected. What it originally seems to be another episode of Poirot slowly turns to something more deep, every character seeming to be a possible killer with a motive of his own. It keeps the mystery until the end, generating suspense along the way until the unexpected finale (at least if this is the first adaptation you see).Overall it's a good watch, especially if you're fond of this genre, but you may find a couple of issues or dislikes like I did, which somehow managed to spoil the overall experience. The worst of all was Poirot's character, with his over-prolonged or double mustache, which simply wasn't on par with the strong, perfect man which the famous detective accustomed us. He often seemed rushed and unconvincing, although the insisted on his perfectionist side, which is rather disappointing when considering his fame. Another bad aspect would be the fact that not all other characters seem to be as well described as they could or should, even seeming out of the picture at times, with too few scenes that would make them important in the conclusion. It left a sense of superficiality which is hard to miss in such films and as a result, the final product seemed to lack in this aspects.It's a good movie with Poirot but unfortunately nothing spectacular, contrary to its impressing cast. It could have been a lot better if it had a much credible and imposing main character and more attention paid to the characters and even the plot.",Murder on the Orient Express
128,swilliky,Decent mystery from a great author played out by a skilled actor/director,6,27 November 2017,"Kenneth Branagh brings to life Agatha Christie's mystery novel and performs as the clever detective Hercule Poirot. The film begins with Hercule solving a mystery in Jerusalem with his amazing skills before he takes a ship to Istanbul on which he meets Miss Mary Debenham (Daisy Ridley) and Dr. Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom Jr.) who have a secret between them. He needs to return to London for a very important case and there is only one option, the Orient Express. Bouc (Tom Bateman) runs the train so he is able to arrange for Poirot to have a room. The detective is looking forward to a trip without any mysteries to solve so when Edward Ratchett (Johnny Depp) approaches him asking for help against a possible plot to kill him, Poirot refuses. However, when Poirot awakes, they find Ratchett has been stabbed multiple times in his bed. The Orient Express has been stalled by an avalanche so Bouc is desperate to solve the case before the police arrive. Poirot agrees to take the case and begins to interrogate each of the passengers aboard the train and search Ratchett's compartment for clues. The biggest clue is a partially burned note that reveals a connection to the kidnapping of Daisy Armstrong. The film lost me a bit with this leap as Poirot is very familiar with the kidnapping and Ratchett is, in fact, the kidnapper John Cassetti. There was more than one victim as Daisy's mother died from a premature birth and her husband killed himself. The maid was accused and killed herself in police custody as the prosecutor's career was ruined by the false arrest.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Murder on the Orient Express
129,bob-the-movie-man,You'll never guess who dunnit,7,6 November 2017,"There's a big problem with Kenneth Branagh's 2017 filming of the Hercule Poirot-based murder mystery. and that's the 1974 Sidney Lumet classic featuring Albert Finney in the starring role. For that film was so memorable – at least, the ""who"" of the ""whodunnit"" (no spoilers here) was so memorable – that any remake is likely to be tarnished by that knowledge. If you go into this film blissfully unaware of the plot, you are a lucky man/woman. For this is a classic Agatha Christie yarn.The irascible, borderline OCD, but undeniably great Belgian detective, Poirot, is dragged around the world by grateful police forces to help solve unsolvable crimes. After solving a case in Jerusalem, Poirot is called back to the UK with his mode of transport being the famous Orient Express. Trapped in the mountains by an avalanche, a murder is committed and with multiple suspects and a plethora of clues it is up to Poirot to solve the case.Branagh enjoys himself enormously as Poirot, sporting the most distractingly magnificent facial hair since Daniel Day-Lewis in ""The Gangs of New York"". The moustache must have had its own trailer and make-up team!Above all, the film is glorious to look at, featuring a rich and exotic colour palette that is reminiscent of the early colour films of the 40's. Cinematography was by Haris Zambarloukos (""Mamma Mia"" and who also collaborated with Branagh on ""Thor) with lots of innovative ""ceiling down"" shots and artful point-of-view takes that might be annoying to some but which I consider as deserving of Oscar/BAFTA nominations.The pictures are accompanied by a lush score by Patrick Doyle (who also scored Branagh's ""Thor""). Hats off also to the special effects crew, who made the alpine bridge scenes look decidedly more alpine than where they were actually filmed (on a specially made bridge in the Surrey Hills!).All these technical elements combine to make the film's early stages look and feel truly epic.And the cast what a cast! Dame Judi Dench (""Victoria and Abdul""); Olivia Coleman (""The Lobster""); Johnny Depp (""Black Mass""); Daisy Ridley (""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""); Penélope Cruz (""Zoolander 2""); Josh Gad (Olaf!); Derek Jacobi (""I, Claudius""); Willem Dafoe (""The Great Wall"") and Michelle Pfeiffer (""mother!""). A real case again of an ""oh, it's you"" film again at the cinema – when's the last time we saw that? It's also great to see young Lucy Boynton, so magnificent in last year's excellent ""Sing Street"", getting an A-list role as the twitchy and disturbed countess. With all these ingredients in the pot, it should be great, right? Unfortunately, in my view, no, not quite. The film's opening momentum is really not maintained by the screenplay by Michael Green (""Blade Runner 2049""; ""Logan""). At heart, it's a fairly static and ""stagey"" piece at best, set as it is on the rather claustrophobic train (just three carriages on the Orient Express really?). But the tale is made even more static by the train's derailment in the snow. Branagh and Green try to sex up the action where they can, but there are lengthy passages of fairly repetitive dialogue. One encounter in particular between Branagh and Depp seems to last interminably: you wonder if the problem was that the director wasn't always looking on to yell ""Cut""! All this leads to the ""revelation"" of the murderer as being a bit of an anticlimactic ""thank heavens for that"" rather than the gasping denouement it should have been. (Perhaps this would be different if you didn't know the twist).However, these reservations aside, it's an enjoyable night out at the flicks, although a bit of a disappointment from the level of expectation I had for it. I can't be too grumpy about it, given it's a return to good old-fashioned yarn-spinning at the cinema, with great visuals and an epic cast. And that has to be good news.For sure, Branagh does make for an amusing and engaging Poirot, even if his dialogue did need some 'tuning in' to. There was a suggestion at the end of the film that we might be seeing his return in ""Death on the Nile"" – the most lush and decorous of Peter Ustinov's outings – which I would certainly welcome. He will have to find another 10 A- list stars though to decorate the boat, which will be a challenge for casting!",Murder on the Orient Express
130,silvermistvio,Drama but watchable.,7,8 February 2018,"The concept and plot is good. I didn't guess the murderer. As usual, Agatha Christie fooled me every time. But there are a lot of things in the movie which I don't like. Firstly, I want to say that it's better than Crooked House. This film is a little bit of drama and a little boring. But at least it didn't make me feel sleepy.Second, the accent is killing the film. I know that some people like to have real national accents. But for viewers, the accent is quite difficult to catch, especially for me. I put a lot of effort on listening. So, I prefer British accent or American accent. Thirdly, it might just me. I don't see the built-in translations for French. Not everyone in the world knows French, you know. Thankfully, the one I watched had Chinese translations, so, I could understand what they were saying in French language.Finally, some scenes are not clearly, especially the camera angle changed when they shot the dead body. The viewer can't see the wound on the dead body clearly. That is the only fact that made me angry. Maybe the director didn't want viewers to be afraid, I guess. But my opinion is that if we could see the wound on the dead body, it'd be great.Finally, the train. That train seriously has one exit door?Okay, all in all, it's not that much perfect but watchable because of the plot.",Murder on the Orient Express
131,kjproulx,A Tedious Viewing Experience,4,10 November 2017,"When a movie revolves around a murder and makes you wonder who the killer is, it really needs to do a great job in getting you invested in the characters at hand. 2017's adaptation of the classic Agatha Christie novel may just be one of the most disappointing films I've seen all year because it fails to do the one thing that a murder mystery is meant to do, which is to keep you interested from beginning to end. There are many things to gawk at when watching this film, but the story itself definitely isn't one of them. This rendition of Murder on the Orient Express, even though I haven't read the original material or see the other adaptations, is quite the bore and here is why I just can't get myself to really recommend this movie to anyone.Without a doubt, this movie is wonderfully directed by Kenneth Branagh, but the screenplay for this film ranks pretty low on the scale in terms of Michael Green's previous works. Having written terrific films in Logan and Blade Runner 2049, his past works also include Alien: Covenant and Green Lantern, which were far less than stellar, so I could clearly see a mixture of good and bad throughout this particular screenplay. Focusing mostly on the character of Hercule Poirot, the rest of the passengers are left by the wayside, which is where I feel the film suffers the most.Getting to know Poirot, Murder on the Orient Express begins in giving the audience a bit of backstory into what is character is all about and once the train gets going, having his character slowly beginning to interact with each of the passengers, the movie seemed to be moving along at a brisk pace, but a certain event occurs, leaving a passenger dead, while also bringing the movie to a complete halt. Everything leading up to the eventual murder on the train was interesting to me, but for reasons that can't be explained here without spoiling, I truly found myself not caring who committed the crime and the movie ended up losing me quite early on.As far as twists and turns go, Murder on the Orient Express does its very best to trick the audience, but the outcome was very strange to me, making the rest of the movie sort of feel irrelevant. There are many characters to try and flesh out here, and I understand that's a very difficult task to accomplish in scripting a feature film, but when certain characters were given backstories, I felt as though I should begin to care about them more than the others, but in reality, the notion of not really caring about the outcome kept running through my mind. Nearly every aspect of this story was uninteresting to me, but I can't deny that it looks beautiful.From the sweeping landscapes to the way the camera angles helped move the story along, I found myself immersed in a film that I didn't really care about, which was a pretty frustrating experience. After the conclusion of each big scene, I was sucked back in my rapid-fire dialogue by Kenneth Branagh, only to be bored by overlong sequences of conversations, with only a handful of them being of any interest. This movie had so much potential of being great, but I can't even really call it a good movie.In the end, this rendition of Murder on the Orient Express tries to be classy and clever, and while the main character of Hercule Poirot is interesting and likable, the cinematography is beautiful, and many of the side characters curious enough to hold my interest, the story itself was sort of a dread to sit through. The conclusion felt odd and nothing felt like much of a revelation to me. I can't see this movie growing a large fanbase, and due to the lack of pacing and character development, I can't recommend that anyone rushes out to see this film. At best, I'd consider a home rental if you're curious, but I don't think you're missing out on much if you skip this. Personally, I disliked this film much more than the portions I enjoyed. Murder on the Orient Express is extremely disappointing.",Murder on the Orient Express
132,Hayden-86055,One of the good remakes,8,25 October 2020,"I've seen a lot of people critiquing this for being a poor remake, on the contrary I found it very gripping and well made.First thing's first Kenneth Branagh is a brilliant Hercule Perot and apart from being a bit mumbly in some scenes he was top class. Michelle Pfiffer, Johhny Depp, Daisy Ridley, Judi Dench, Leslie Odom, Josh Gad, Derek Jacobi and Willem Dafoe were all fantastic too - what a cast!The cinematography was top notch and had some great camera angles, I would have liked to see some more environment shots but can't have it all my own way. The actual train is just a wonder to look at also, the inside was done to perfection and the outside likewise.The plot was about as good as the novel, making a few little changes here or there, I feel like the film could have benefited with an extra 20 minutes or so of screen time to flesh out some of the characters like Wilem Dafoe and Judi Dench but it was a very good rendition of the novel I feel and had a modern twist to it without losing its charm.8/10: An excellent film, all I could hope for with a modern adaption",Murder on the Orient Express
133,tm-sheehan,Why did they bother?,5,8 November 2017,"Why did Kenneth Branagh want to make a third version of this classic Agatha Christie story knowing remakes of classic films rarely are successful?The previous two versions the film in 1974 with Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot and the 2010 television version with David Suchet are both superb.If you haven't seen either you probably may enjoy this as I don't criticise the acting or production . It's an interesting cast I enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer in the role of Caroline Hubbard so classily played in the original by Lauren Bacall and Branagh gives a credible performance as Poirot.What I missed was the elegance of the original the original score by Richard Rodney Bennett is one of my all time favourite film scores ,used so evocatively in the original film it gave the Orient Express an identity motif forever etched in film history.The music score in this attempt is bland and the song at the end credits so saccharine sweet and forgettable I've forgotten it already.If you make a remake film that's so well known you can't help comparing the original cast and in 1974 we had Albert Finney, Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall , Dame Wendy Huller , Richard Widmark, Sean Connery, John Gielgud , Rachel Roberts and Vanessa Redgrave to name a few , yet not one of the new cast including Dame Judy Dench eclipses any of the performances of the original film . The costumes and sets are very good in this version but again in 1974 even without blue screens and cgi effects the elegance and luxury of the original is not improved with this version. So to me the good performances and production of this movie were wasted on this expensive film and the tweaking of the story line was totally unnecessary and in one instance concerning the Caroline Hubbard role ridiculous.Without giving anything away or spoiling it for audiences who haven't seen the original, apart from recommending the 1974 version to this one I was horrified at the hint at the end of the movie that Kenneth Branagh may remake ""Death on the Nile""I sincerely hope not. What next will we a have Kenneth Branagh remake of Gone With The Wind starting himself as Rhett Butler and Anne Hathaway as Scarlett??.",Murder on the Orient Express

Staring a magnificent moustache, and co-staring / directed by Kenneth Branagh who plays the genius detective Hercule Poirot. Set in the limited space of a lavish, luxury train with some really long tracking shots that illustrates the confined atmosphere. At the beginning the passengers slowly assemble at the station, there's a period of character building similar to the film 'Titanic'. The train sets off, we see that Hercule just wants to take a holiday but there's a murder on the train and he's unable to switch off from being the master detective. Unfortunately the train is stuck by an avalanche and this gives Hercule the opportunity to piece together the evidence. Everyone's a suspect and it turns out have a connected motive. During Hercule's interviewing we learn that everyone' circumstances are connected as well. The avalanche is cleared and the train reaches its destination. Hercule is met by a military officer and is rushed away to Egypt, a reference to a very possible next film. With a truly amazing 'A' list cast, this is an instant, old style classic, shot in 65mm really enhances the cinematography, production and costume design.

Maybe it's people who recognise a gap in the market for a contemporary remake of a detective story written around a hundred years ago. Branagh is such a person, as is McCartney in terms of keeping the memory of a very lucky pop group alive.There are people who don't know whodunnit, who are the target market.Unfortunately, this movie is about Kenneth Branagh and his wonderful ability to do woeful impressions of other actors - he even gets Poirot's moustache wrong, here it looks like a slug that's slithered through the dog's bed.

139,Alexander_Blanchett,More moustache and less character development than the original,7,18 November 2017,"I did not mind the digital snow. What I minded was the lack of character development that reasoned in very shallow characters which concluted into a film that dragged more than it deserved. Don't get me wrong. I still liked it. But when you waste a cast of such tremendous actors like Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer and Willem Dafoe it is destined to end up in a disappointment. I also do not try to compare it to the nearly flawless original of 1974 but if I did and see where the other one succeeded and which this remake failed it comes to one big thing: The fantastic investigation and interrogation scenes, which were here rather shallow and unimpressive. But to sum up the good things: Cinematography was fantastic. The images we got were outstanding and unforgettable. It created a nice atmosphere. I did like the score, even if it was a bit inconstant at times. The Production Design and general look were extremely satisfying. Some of the acting was good too. Kenneth Branagh for instance did a great performance as Hercule Poirot and perfectly nailed that character. I would not mind to see him revisiting that roe in the future again. Michelle Pfeiffer was great and the only time when I say one of the cast was better than its original counterpart. Johnny Depp held himself very well. No complains about him. Penelope Cruz was fine, but she is no Ingrid Bergman. Judi Dench was wasted but I did enjoy her scenes. Daisy Ridley also showed some versatility and I always like Willem Dafoe doing Germans accents. So yeah no complaints about the cast itself, just about the material some of them were given. Sometimes I felt they were given the most emphasize on Branagh' schnauzer than on the characters, who actually are what makes the story interesting.",Murder on the Orient Express

The cast is quite good, however most of them aren't given enough to do. I loved the production design and unique filming styles used throughout. The climax was a bit disappointing given the solid build-up, with it sort of fizzling out near the end. I look forward to the sequel with Poirot though.",Murder on the Orient Express
141,CANpatbuck3664,Kenneth Branagh Delivers a Skillful and Slick Update That Still Has Enough Emotional Punch,8,12 November 2017,"As much as the Murder on the Orient Express book is appreciated as a classic, I came into this movie without knowing the story. I want to start by talking about Hercule Poirot as a character. This movie really portrays Poirot in a Sherlock Holmes ""esque"" light. There's a point where Hercule takes someone out with a cane that felt like he was channelling Robert Downey Jr. in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes. I don't mean this as a criticism though, the fact that Hercule is witty and funny along with being brilliant is much needed levity for this movie. Some people have complained that the movie is too comedic but without those opportunities to laugh, the beginning of this movie would be unbearably slow. Those moments are like the spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down. So, I liked Poirot and you needed a charismatic character at the centre because the other characters don't get developed much until the murder goes down. This movie looks like an ensemble, but it leans more heavily on Branagh as the main character than you would think.The plot of Murder on the Orient Express is iconic, but the way movie portrays it, there's almost little to none. We get the initial setup of everyone boarding the train and other than some preliminary chitchat between Poirot and the other travellers and a tense exchange between Ratchett (Johnny Depp's character) and Poirot, very little happens. Only after the murder happens and the interrogations begin do we get to know everyone and does the plot kick into gear. Just like any great detective thriller, we don't know what's going on and we must unravel the mystery just as Poirot does. When we get to see more about the victim's past and what how appalling his/her actions were does the emotion kick and the stakes are raised considerably.I want to go through the cast name by name and give them all credit but there's just too many names. Branagh is a little over-the-top as Poirot but I would argue that the movie needed that. Its a very theatrical performance (considering his background, it makes sense) but without him chewing the scenery, the movie would have dragged. Michelle Pfeiffer sold out in her role as Caroline, it was nice to see her again. Daisy Ridley shines as Mary Debenham, I hope she keeps picking up more work. Leslie Odom Jr. had a lot screen presence as Dr. Arbuthnot. I appreciated the fact that Johnny Depp pulled back a little as Ratchett but he still borders overacting. If there was anyone I didn't like; Judi Dench was so stiff she was annoying but that was also how the character was written. I normally like Josh Gad but with the screen time divided between so many actors and actresses, he was kneecapped by a lack of room to show his stuff.When you can't bank on the character development or the plot, you need top notch window dressing to help move things along. Luckily the Orient Express is up to the task. The visual effects, the costuming and the exotic atmosphere transport you to another world. I've seen it done more impressively but they really do a stellar job since the movie had a relatively modest budget ($55 million). We get to go to Istanbul, Jerusalem and travel in snowy vistas. We also get to see past events through an old-timey projector and the characters watch it like a movie. Branagh is wise to linger on this stuff and it adds to the escapism that the story can provide. When you go to a period piece movie, you want to be wowed and dropped off in this new world and I think Murder on the Orient Express accomplished that.I came out of this movie wanting to go read the book, so I don't want to be too critical. But the biggest downfall of this movie is that much like the train the characters are travelling on, the movie takes a while to start picking up steam. The opening with Poirot is fun but after that first 15 minutes, the movie slows to a crawl. It relies on Branagh and the beautiful vistas to carry it and while I remained interested, I think a lot of people will be mentally checking out. But the movie does get going and I think if you're willing to be patient, you'll get what you want in the reveal.Talking about that reveal though, I thought it was fantastic. I want to credit Agatha Christie for originally conceiving it but I also want to credit Branagh and the writers for doing a solid job of yanking the rug out from under you. Its an excellent wrap-up and I was emotionally impacted by it. It was unpredictable, fresh and through the efforts of the excellent cast and the shocking nature of the crimes, it raised the rating I was going to give the movie by at least a half a point.I was excited to see this movie and although it wasn't amazing, I wasn't disappointed by it either. This is an adult movie though; the trailer makes it look there's going to be more action and there isn't. If there weren't funny jokes sprinkled in, the movie would be too dry and other than the fans of the book, the rest of the audience would be bored to tears. I went in a group of 3, 2 of us liked it and the 3rd said it was boring and disappointing. If you like mysteries or period piece movies, this will be up your alley.

143,garethcrook,A good modern update.,6,27 December 2018,"I usually find Branagh annoying, but I have to confess I found this quite delightful (in places). It's not quite as clever as it thinks it is and the expectation of its cast weighs it down, but you'd be hard pressed to fail to deliver with content of this quality and it doesn't. Lots of nice playful camera work, tons of epic vistas and extravagant scenery, characters played flamboyantly over the top. I quite enjoyed it and was thankful for Depp's early departure, when did he last deliver a decent performance? It is missing something though and I suspect it's that it's merely a remake and the question has to be asked, why? I don't think this film answers that well enough, but I still think it's better than the reviews it received. A good modern update to a classic tale and a classic era of cinema.6/10",Murder on the Orient Express
144,statuskuo,Classical Filmmaking,8,13 November 2017,"The scope is massive without it being a stupid brain-deadening superhero movie (God, someone shoot Marvel and DC dead...video games come to life are not FILMS!!). This is real filmmakers making a real film, and by all critics who've bashed this film on this site have overlooked, it is as patient of a film you will see. And if we're to wish pure storytelling to exist in the future, this is a reason to hold it tightly to your chest. Instead of beating the drum to comic book heroes. In this case it is a simple detective tale with characters stuck together in order to solve crime. Director Kenneth Brannagh seems to have an affinity towards both the source material and the Sidney Lumet 1974 version (the train full of stars). So what if you knew the answer to the who-dun-it. You know how most Thor movies end (here's the hint, with your brain melted and fat from stupidity). This film is photographed as old Hollywood. Something desperately missing are, less cuts and more staging. This is the film that showcases it with a great deal of zeal. It's exciting to see camera angles from the heavens that peep in on a intimate conversation. THIS is filmmaking. Or that we see multiple characters introduced throughout the train as background characters. Or that there is a coziness to this like playing the board game ""Clue."" And to top it all off...there is a deeper idea with the detective's story that wasn't in the 1974 version. Can I defend this to the simpleminded film goers today who lambasted this film for everything making films is all about. Oh right, most of you have or will never make a film in your lives. That's why you watch movies and not films. See this movie and re-calibrate your compass to how they're suppose to be made.",Murder on the Orient Express
145,trinaboice,Beautifully made with a disappointing fizzle,8,11 November 2017,"Grade: BRating: PG-13, 1 hour 54 minutesIn a Nutshell: With an incredible A-list cast, this is a well-made, stylish ""Who-dunnit"" mystery directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also stars as the Belgium inspector Hercule Poirot. It's extremely picturesque and beautiful, yet slowly fizzles with a disappointing reveal of who the murderer is.Uplifting theme: ""We seek the truth from within, not without."" – Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) ""Sometimes the law of man is not enough."" – Pilar Estravados (Penelope Cruz) ""poison of deep grief"", healing, peace Revenge Right vs. wrong and everything in betweenThings I liked: The period pieces and costumes of the 1930's are beautiful. You don't often see movies that take their time telling the story. Both the time period and the style of movie-making seemed old- fashioned. It was shot in 65 mm and really immerses you in the various environments. The sets are incredible. The all-star cast includes the talented Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, Michelle Pfeiffer, Leslie Odom Jr., Daisy Ridley and Derek Jacobi. Kenneth Branagh was absolutely outstanding. You might wonder how old Judi Dench isShe was born in 1934, making her 82 years old. There was some humor, although the tone was a bit inconsistent, beginning with a very light feel and then remaining mostly dark for the rest of the film. There were some really great camera sequences. One scene was shot from above the characters as they talked. Another scene was shot from outside the train as it scanned the people walking down the hall through the windows. You really feel the movement of the train and feel like you're on one. There is a reference to a murder on the Nile, possibly a sneak peek into a sequel, but definitely a reference to another one of Agatha Christie's books called Agatha Christie's Poirot: Death on the Nile. Speaking of the author, Agatha Christie's Poirot: Murder on the Orient Express was her best-selling novel. The movie begins at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem with some gorgeous vistas and a funny sequence. One of these days, I'm going there. There are some beautiful vistas in Istanbul. One of these days, I'm going there too. Michelle Pfeiffer sings ""Never Forget"", which was co-written by director/actor Kenneth Branagh. Wow, he was really busy with this film. The photo of Katherine, Hercule Poirot's lost love, is actually Emma Thompson, Kenneth Branagh's real ex-wife.Things I didn't like: Some say it grinds to a halt, rather than get more intense. Yeah, it's true. The ending is anti-climatic. In the 1974 version of Murder on the Orient Express, the star- studded ensemble had equal moments of importance; whereas this version doesn't go into much depth with each character and kind of fizzles. A lot of movie critics are comparing it to the movie Clue which was able to develop characters much better. Daisy Ridley's character is way too young for her character, who should be much older. Sergei Polunin is a famous ballet dancer in real life, but we don't get to see him dance at all! Instead, we get to see him beat up some people. All of the actors were great, but felt underutilized. So much talent wasted. I heard a lady sitting near me say, ""That mustache has to go!"" Hercule Poirot's double- decker mustache is ridiculous, but his mustache mask is even worse. Ha ha When the 1974 movie of Murder on the Orient Express Agatha Christie was still alive and she commented on how much she didn't like Albert Finney's mustache on his Hercule Poirot's character.Interesting lines: ""Romance never goes unpunished."" – Hercule Poirot ""To a man with a hammer, everything is a nail."" – Mary Debenham (Daisy Ridley's character is actually quoting Mark Twain.) ""There is right. There is wrong. There is nothing in between."" – Hercule Poirot (He learns about grey areas.) ""Vice is where the devil finds his darlings."" – Pilar Estravados (Penelope Cruz) Funny lines: ""Did we die?"" – Hercule Poirot Tips for parents: Young children may get bored, as it's a ""talking"" movie that unfolds slowly. There are some subtitles when two people speak German. French is spoken, but there are no subtitles.MOVIE REVIEW MOM@trinaboice",Murder on the Orient Express
146,rubenm,"Agatha Christie, 21st century style",6,3 December 2017,"It sounds like a fun idea. Take a classic Agatha Christie-story which has last been made into a film more than forty years ago, put together an ensemble cast with a mix of Hollywood stars and British stage actors, and see what 21st century film making can add to that.As for that 21st century treatment: computer generated effects can certainly spice up even a traditional film like 'Murder on the Orient Express'. I was impressed by the images of the steam train moving through Istanbul as it must have looked in the 1930's. Or by the scenes in which an avalanche descends from high up in the mountains on the fast moving train in the valley below.Another modern element that director Kenneth Branagh touches upon very briefly, is the interesting question if our criminal law system is morally just. It's a pity that the screenplay doesn't give this subject more than a few remarks, because it could have added an extra dimension to this traditional film.Apart from this, the film is what you'd expect it to be. The cinematography is breathtaking: everything looks picture perfect, from early 20th century Jerusalem to the high mountains where the train gets stuck. The stars do what they are supposed to do, but in a film like this the emphasis is more on the story and the claustrophobic setting than on the acting performances. It is a pity that great actors like Judy Dench and Derek Jacobi don't get more screen time, but that is the consequence of an ensemble cast. It was nice, though, to see that Michelle Pfeiffer is still going strong. It had been a while since she was cast in a major big budget production.Of course, the screenplay demands a rather considerable suspension of disbelief. Some story elements seem to come out of the blue, and viewers have to keep very concentrated in order not to miss some detail that is essential for the crime solving process. But that's not unusual in a screen adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel.'Murder on the Orient Express' is nice entertainment, and it is good to see that Hollywood is still willing to invest considerable budgets in this kind of traditional film. But this is not a movie that will surprise the viewer.After having seen this film, there is only one mystery to be solved: will Branagh take on 'Death on the Nile' as a follow up project, as the last scene of 'Murder' suggests?",Murder on the Orient Express
147,davidgee,Better than 1974. Yes it is.,9,16 November 2017,"This is the greatest whodunit of all time, and the 1974 movie - directed by Sidney Lumet, script by Paul Dehn - did it full justice. Albert Finney's Hercule Poirot made Peter Ustinov's previous performances seem lightweight (and surely inspired David Suchet's approach in the TV adaptations). Could it be bettered?Yes, it could. This version, scripted by Michael Green and directed by Kenneth Branagh, is gorgeously lavish, with stunningly digitalised locations and a train with more glamour than the Chrysler building. And a fairly lavish cast, including Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp. Branagh himself plays Poirot; his usual half-Hitler moustache has grown to coat-hanger proportions but the accent is the one we're used to. The previous murder of little Daisy Armstrong remains the bedrock of the mystery, although this is dripped into the story in fragments. There's a new prologue, with Poirot solving a theft beside the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem (digitally inserted into a Malta backdrop), and the unravelling of the threads is more dramatically paced than it was in 1974.Some of the cast, now as then, are short-changed (Derek Jacobi and Olivia Colman don't get a lot to say). Michelle Pfeiffer has the meatiest part and is superb. Wendy Hiller had recently played Queen Mary in 1974 and invested the ancient Russian princess with all of Mary's Teutonic imperiousness. Judi Dench recycles her Queen Victoria to similar effect here.It sort of spoils it that most of us know how it's going to end – it would be a heresy against Agatha Christie to change the final scene (staged here with a slight nod to Da Vinci's Last Supper!) – but it only spoils it a tad. I envy those who see it without knowing whodunit. There's a teaser for DEATH ON THE NILE at the end. I can hardly wait.",Murder on the Orient Express
148,bgar-80932,Average,6,18 December 2018,This movie does a few things really well. The solving of the crimes is clever. Some of the visuals are beautiful and some of the camera work is really interesting. That said the main character who's the detective is dull. He's supposed to be dull I guess and his attention to detail is why he solves crimes but he lacks charisma. I still feel like you need charisma to lead a movie and I just didn't feel it in this. I did like the end but have no need to watch the sequel they're making.,Murder on the Orient Express
149,latinfineart,A truly horrific piece of film making,2,28 November 2017,"This absolute turkey of a film, was barely entertaining. I wanted to walk out several times, and only the presence of a few tolerant, long suffering, and bored friends kept me from doing so.The entire cast was wrong. Branagh was an insufferable detective. Dench was a dreadful princess. Cruz was entirely miscast, as some sort of anti fascist. Johnny Depp was barely there, though he did remind me a bit of a kind of impotent Dillinger. This film was truly awful.As is suggested by the title, one of the first class passengers is brutally murdered. Poirot, hoping for some rest and relaxation, is pressed into service. One of these supposedly respectable passengers is actually a murderer, etc. Thus begins a mystery that is at turns plodding, irrelevant and completely suspense-free. If you remember the famous third act twist it doesn't even really matter; by that point in the movie the narrative has become such a limp pretzel of halfhearted knots that the big revelation comes off as a whimper and not a bang. This is less a whodunit than a who-the-hell-cares.Branagh was more interested in the Shakespearean drama than dazzling visual effects.With ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" he has created a contraption that is wholly devoid of cleverness; a thriller without any actual thrills. He seems chiefly concerned with technically virtuoso camera movements that mean incredibly little both in terms of narrative or character, as well as how to showcase himself (as an actor) completely in any given scene. Seriously, Kenneth Branagh shoots Kenneth Branagh like Steven Soderbergh shot Julia Roberts in the first ""Ocean's Eleven"" – lovingly, with every moment suggesting this is what a movie star looks like.Sadly, for all of his pomp and forced eccentricity (his walrus-like mustache, his Belgian accent, his protruding belly), Branagh's over sized Poirot can't enliven the movie very much. The same goes for the cast of characters, some of whom have been excellent in other, far better movies this year (""The Florida Project,"" ""Victoria & Abdul,"" ""mother!""). Some, like Daisy Ridley, have the look on their faces like they signed up for something that ended up being altogether different. And no matter how great you are as an actor, it's hard to stay away from the story's inherent stagings, especially in the third act, when Branagh assembles his cast like the participants of the Last Supper. It doesn't feel like a dramatic centerpiece, it feels like a promotional photo shoot. And that's a problem for a movie that should, had it succeeded, built tiny, laser-focused vignettes of suspense out of exchanges of dialogue, camera movements that tracked up and down the train and casual interactions between passengers.Instead, Branagh presents something like an attractively wrapped present with nothing inside. Ostensibly, it's a well-made movie, with first class production and costume design and some very talented visual effects artists working on very unconvincing visual effects. Even composer Patrick Doyle, one of Branagh's key collaborators, delivers a score that is, like the rest of the movie, both overbearing and tension-free.Overlong and joyless, it's the cinematic equivalent of a giant, opulent express train trapped in the snow, heaving and off balance.",Murder on the Orient Express
150,Darth_Osmosis,All aboard!,8,17 May 2018,"Great cinematography, interesting story and a bunch of A-List actors means that this is a very interesting and intriguing story full of twists and turns(presumably more so, if you have not read the novel like me..) that is both pleasing to look at and trying to guess what really happened while it unravels amidst the snowy mountains!",Murder on the Orient Express

This beautifully constructed film filled with marvellous actors who are dressed in gorgeous timely costumes and set to work in spectacular train compartments and asked to use a perfect script will leave many cinema-goers anticipating more.If I were much younger, I would not hunger for the movies from the Directors Period in the 70s and 80s when they were allowed to make Great Movies rather than only the money-men.

152,Offworld_Colony,A strange duck of a movie.,5,17 February 2020,"Branagh drives a nearly flawless performance as actor but a less than interesting one as director. The script has some lovely poignant lines and a stellar cast is engaging, certainly when the murder occurs and the train stops. But I suspect the flaws of the film lie in the photography, which is neither engaging, thematic, or smart. I imagine a better director might have been able to create images either using technology to evoke a period feel, like Scorsese's Hugo, or use lighting and texture and shorting style, like Scorsese's The Aviator, to generate a classic overarching tone to the piece. But it does neither. The lighting is flat and placid and the set and costume design and colours are not settling or sumptuous. I wanted more theatre from Branaghbut his work here is a little average. There should be little clues in every scene as to the backstory of these characters and their connection or intention, little red herrings in the directing, the ways characters are introduced should say something. When a tracking shot or an overhead pan or a long take is used it should be for a purpose within the narrative and the mystery.
But the tired and damaged Poirot is a nice, humanising take, something I certainly didn't expect. And even though I knew the ending, it made for good viewing as it rumbled along.",Murder on the Orient Express
153,ethanbresnett,A great mystery and a really fun film!,7,11 January 2021,"Murder on the Orient Express is a really fun experience. It has everything you want from a crime mystery - a tremendous collection of characters, great location, thrills, humour, and a roaring third act.What impressed me most about this film was the staging of it. The set was sublime and felt so rich and detailed. The costumes, hair, make up etc were perfect (with the exception of Poirot's moustache... a bit too much maybe?!), and the score complimented the film to a tee. On top of all this there was some top notch cinematography. Nothing to fault from this perspective.Now the cast. It was a who's who of big established stars and up and coming names in Hollywood, and I loved them all. Despite the sometimes dodgy accents (I'm looking at you Judy), I just can't resist a talented ensemble cast like this. It took me a little while to get on board with Branagh's portrayal of Poirot, but after about 20 minutes I was all aboard! Great cast, each playing their character to perfection.Now comes the criticism, and this isn't really a reflection on the film, but more on the source material. What I often find with Agatha Christie stories is that I'm always impatient to get to the end. You know there is going to be a satisfying reveal, and also that they are pretty hard to guess as the rug is usually pulled from under you and there are numerous red herrings. As such, the middle act sometimes felt like we were going through the motions, and the pacing of the film can sometimes feel a tad slow.I'm being picky though, because I was blindsided by the final reveal and thought that they played it out to perfection, with maximum impact. An incredible scene!If you like Agatha Christie, mysteries, thrillers, crime etc, then you'll have a great time with Murder on the Orient Express.",Murder on the Orient Express
154,TaylorYee94,"Well planned out with details on camera walk, settings, and mise en scene",8,20 June 2020,"1. Camera walking is very original. For example, the way the camera was set up above the heads of Poirot, Bouc, and the doctor, observing the murder scene without actually showing it is effective to bring out more curiosity from audience and to amplify the violence behind it. One more, I love how the camera captures each suspect's face so it looks like Poirot observes and reads into each one's expression as he walks by.2. The director takes advantages of the fact the murder happened on the train. It's limited, secluded and close-to-each-other space. Audience can only see a part of what's happening because the camera zooms in, implying there are so many other things going on outside of this frame and keeping the suspense. The train, the table, the dining area, and many props are pleasure to look at.3. It is a joy to find hidden message behind mise en scene. At the ending, the train heads into sunset in contrast with the snowing station where Poirot got off. While the station is gray, sunset is warm orange; audience can expect brighter future for the passengers. When Poirot boarded the train, it was one long-take so audience can expect hectic chaos the detective runs into, and the director can tell the audience 'follow him with this journey of mystery'. Last but not least, THE MIRROR!!! It was brilliant idea to show two or more faces using mirrors.4. Deduction point on storytelling. I did not watch older version of the ""Murder on the Orient Express"", so I'm not sure how it managed to tell complex story more efficiently. However, newer version incorporated too much of a story, and it was a little bit everywhere",Murder on the Orient Express
155,LloydBayer,Agatha would be aghast,4,8 November 2017,"Although the story remains fairly true to the 1934 novel of the same name by Agatha Christie, this third screen adaptation (following adaptations in 1974 and 2001) is a bit of a mess. And that's putting it mildly. Worse, and as ironical as it sounds, the film loses steam even before the titular locomotive pulls out of the first act. An all- star cast lead by director Kenneth Branagh himself isn't enough, even with the latter portraying Belgian master detective Hercule Poirot who turns out to be more moustache than man. Which is sad, given that literary crime fiction has Poirot second only to Arthur Conan Doyle's super sleuth on 221B Baker Street. But in this film, Christie's most famous character is reduced to a mumbling idiot who would rather set both feet in horse poop just to make a half-baked point about order and balance. Shot on 65mm film, aerial vistas of a train trudging through the Alps sure looks pretty. The production design also boasts of lavish set pieces, plush backdrops, and costumes tailored to that era. But really, all we want is an old fashioned murder mystery. Perhaps an amazing display of deductive reasoning before arriving at a twist ending? Surely, that isn't too much to ask. Add the mouthwatering cast in a plot that thickens into one of the most ingenious yet baffling cases penned by Christie and we have a first class whodunit in this day and age of cinema. But as it turns out, this was indeed asking for too much. Like the bloodied victim, something dies very early in the film. And that's before the story starts juggling the remaining 12 suspects into the 12 agonizing labours of Hercules. Or was it Hercule? Either way, Agatha would be aghast.",Murder on the Orient Express
156,p-jonsson,Why?,4,19 April 2018,"I am a great fan of Agatha Christie in general and Hercule Poirot in particular. When yet another remake of Murder on the Orient express came out I was somewhat hesitant. After all, the one with David Suchet was perfect.I guess I was right to be hesitant. This is another one of those remakes where you just wonder...why? As a movie it is not too bad but as a Hercule Poirot movie, the classical Murder on the Orient Express no less, it is like buying a piece of prime filet of beef and discovering that the butcher gave you chicken drums when you open the package. Edible but not at all what you paid for.To me this movie was a blatant attempt to make an Americanized version of Hercule Poirot. It was poorly done by a clueless scriptwriter and director and it was deeply disrespectful to the original character.The movie starts of by introducing Hercule as the pedantic, somewhat weird, person that he is but the attempt is just dumb and silly. Apart from the scene more or less making Hercule look like a jerk, these people apparently know him, why would they serve two eggs of different sizes in the first place? Oh right, because the director thought the audience was too dumb to make that reflection.Then there are some things that Hercule simply do not do. Like walking on the roofs of train cars, climbing around and chasing criminals as if he was some action hero. He even gets shot and more or less just shrugs it off for Christ sake!And do not get me started on that grotesque moustache! As I said, an Americanized version of Hercule Poirot. Unfortunately bigger is not always better.I can go on for some time here so let's move on.Technically the movie is not that bad. The scenes, the decor, the acting in general etc. can even be said to be good. Unfortunately, for me, this was constantly overshadowed by the brutal slaughtering of my beloved Hercule Poirot character.Part of this is probably due to the movie trying to focus so much on Hercule that most of the other actors almost feel like ... props, even though they themselves are doing quite a good job of their roles. One reviewer wrote that ""The actors seem to have been invited, not to play characters, but to watch Kenneth Branagh act."" and there seems to be some truth in that.The movie ends with a hint of further moves. Personally, I hope there will not be a continuation of this train wreck (pun intended).",Murder on the Orient Express

158,Magow-Intermean,Magow-01,10,10 November 2017,"I went to see Murder on the Orient Express last night and this is my review. I am rating it 10/10 Cut to the train - at last. We hear that the train is full and that Poirot will have to share a cabin for at least one night. As we discover that there are just 12 passengers on the whole train I wondered what happened to all the other empty berths on the other carriages. Let's just pass over that one. I really enjoy a film that keeps you guessing and gives you a few unexpected twists. The orient certainly delivers that. All the acting was very much splendid. A group of excellent actors together with a fine plot and diffuse suspense has made it a good enjoyable movie. The production is indeed rich and elegant in its production design, and cinematography. The costumes however are fine, but lack a certain panache and glamour we have grown to admire in past Agatha Christie films, such as those designed by Tony Walton, and Anthony Powell. Kenneth Branagh is such a gifted filmmaker he created a great film The music score in this film is at a high level.",Murder on the Orient Express
159,Mike_Devine,Branagh delivers on remaking a classic,7,25 November 2018,"Another example of Hollywood trying to regenerate success through a remake, Kenneth Branagh directed and starred in 2017's 'Murder on the Orient Express.' Although it opened to little fanfare, the film boasts an all-star cast and has a lot to offer audiences who've been waiting for a whodunit thriller to come along.On the surface, 'Express' is a sophisticatedly simple mystery that follows the world's greatest detective, straight talking Hercule Poirot (Branagh), as he takes an international steam engine from Istanbul en route to London to investigate a murder. While onboard the train, a number of things happen as Poirot meets many interesting people who appear to be cut from different cloths. But it's something rather shocking that puts the brakes on the extravagant trip (as the title suggests).The best aspect of 'Express' is without a doubt the plot. There are enough twists and turns to keep your attention, and it's fair to say the reveal at the end is one that's hard to see coming. But the cast comes in a close second, as we get to see strong performances from everyone from Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp to Daisy Ridley and Leslie Odom Jr. But veteran actors really steal the show, including Dame Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer and the aforementioned Branagh - there's really nothing to complain about - or find fault in. And it would be remiss not to acknowledge the amazing cinematography. From sweeping views of cities and landscapes to the use of the close quarters on the Orient Express, the camera work is worth noting.Sure, 'Murder on the Orient Express' is a remake, and as such it must overcome the challenge of not being the original. But Branagh manages to deliver in a genre that doesn't get much attention anymore.",Murder on the Orient Express
160,eagandersongil,The already trivial story of murder,7,11 December 2017,"A film with caricature performances but that amuse, script that intrigues but it does not stop seeming a great script of series, in spite of being inspired in the great book of Agatha Christie, and a good direction. Agatha Christie's books full of mysteries, intrigues and twists are phenomenal, a pity that today would hardly work in a visual audio work, the fault of the thousands of series that do this, perhaps not always with the same perspicacity, years and 24 episodes per season, so the whole mood of the mystery of the movie nowadays is almost trivialized by the infinity of similar audiovisual works, even though it may not contain the same charm. The film pinpoints attempts to address social issues but does not focus on it, the focus is all centered even on the unfolding narrative of the murder in question, and that is a good thing. The film has a very good direction, almost all happening in a claustrophobic train with narrow walls and tiny rooms, the director arranges subterfuges to gain space in the train and to show its history completely, for example, the great cameras with vision panoramic view from above, or the sequential plans lining up characters, besides having a beautiful photograph, but a rhythm that makes the viewer feel too much the floor of the film. With a spectacular cast, it's hard to say anything negative about the film's performances, but even with a magic cast, we do not have any masterpiece in terms of acting, but Kenneth Branagh does well as Hercule Poirot. The film changes some details in book relations, many serve and crutch for character development, and some are very well developed and others not, the film deals with justice and reminds of glimpses up to spectacular ""twelve men and one sentence"" in the final speech , but it's just a fun and enjoyable movie.",Murder on the Orient Express
161,DeBBss,Had High Expectations...,6,16 February 2018,"Murder on the Orient Express had a great trailer, and it looked promising on paper, but with terrible execution and boring characters, Murder on the Orient Express is an average movie. I was expecting Murder on the Orient Express to be a hardcore murder mystery, and it falls short on that part too. I thought that the movie was going to be in the perspective of Hercule Poirot and it would share Hercule's thoughts throughout the movie, and in some parts it does do that, but at the same time it doesn't. I was so excited for this movie, because of the unique setting and the A-list actors, but this movie shows how a poor script can ruin a movie. I think the biggest flaw is the characters, the motives of the murder was just weak, in my opinion. The only character that does seem one bit interesting was Hercule Poirot.Story: 7/10The story is average at best. But the biggest issue was the execution, I think the execution is a very important part in a murder mystery, but this movie was just all over the place. The issue was that there was too much characters that the movie tried to make a subplot off of. Every passenger killed ratchett, and there was a lot of passengers in the movie. Every passenger had their own motive to kill ratchett, and all of their motives were connected into one thing. Each character had their own mini subplot, and honestly, there all weak. Murder on the Orient Express attempts to juggle all of these subplots briefly. If Murder on the Orient Express removes all of the weaker characters and focuses on the more important ones, than the movie could've had more time to explain the more important subplots. As I said before, I was expecting a hardcore murder mystery, and this movie really doesn't deliver it. I wanted to see Hercule find clue after clue throughout the movie, but he only really does that at the end. Overall, there's too much subplots that causes one dimensional characters that affects the story greatly.Characters: 5/10The characters are the biggest flaws. Due to the lack of recognition to the characters who committed the crime, the cause of the murder was weak. I wanted a strong motive behind the murder, but they did it because of something that Ratchett did in his past to another family. And I have to say, why kill Ratchett on a train, and why do it when there's the best detective in the world on it. They could've done it somewhere a little more logical. The twist at the end was pretty good and I wasn't expecting it, but I wasn't shocked, maybe it was the delivery of the confession that made it weak. The movie thinks it's clever by putting a twist so unique, but that's it's issue, as I said before, I wasn't shocked. The murder of Ratchett was done out of justice from the murderers. I thought the victim was the good guy and the murderer(s) were the bad guys, but it was the other way around, which was clever. I think evil motives are stronger than good motives in a murder mystery movie, and this movie slightly proves my point. Overall, all of the characters are one dimensional, except Hercule Poirot and the motives were on the weaker side.Action: 7/10The cinematography in Murder on the Orient Express was amazing, and I was surprised how cinematic it really was. I do have to give recognition to Kenneth Branagh for acting as a main character and directing as well. The movie is very slow, and it's almost hitting 2 hours long. The trailer made it look a bit more action packed, but there was only one chase scene. The visuals are very well done, using all sorts of styles, which makes the cinematography look even more better. I do have to mention that the movie could have been shorter. Some scenes just took too long, and it just makes the movie feel so much more boring. Overall, this movie proves that sometimes it doesn't matter how well a movie was filmed, basically it's style over substance.Murder on the Orient Express tries to do too many things all at once. It focuses on a murder, but with too many characters and subplots, Murder on the Orient Express goes all over the place. If Murder on the Orient Express focused on one primary goal, then this movie could have been better. Murder on the Orient Express was already nailing it's own coffin when they decided that all the passengers committed the crime. And yes, it's based off the book, but it wouldn't hurt to cut some parts in the movie that were irrelevant. I recommend Murder on the Orient Express to the fans who read the book or watched the original, but not for people who want to have a good time and enjoy a movie.",Murder on the Orient Express

All those famous names seem on paper: Wow but in the film they do not bring much (which is expected with their names).

165,Figgy66-915-598470,Good solid whodunnit,8,6 November 2017,"6 November 2017 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Murder on The Orient Express. I have never read any Agatha Christie book and I have never seen any Hercule Poirot films or programs, so I came into this film completely blind. I had no knowledge of who was killed, nor of who the killer was. This star-studded production although not edge of the seat viewing was a good solid murder mystery. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also took the starring role, and produced by among others, Ridley Scott (of Bladerunner fame) this whodunnit was extremely watchable. Good solid performances were given by everyone including the simply smashing Dame Judi Dench. I always suspect it's hard to give an edge to a new adaptation of something seen and loved before, and equally hard to make such a confined set large enough to bring it to life on the big screen. This was achieved rather well, we all hark back to those days of grand travel in beautiful rolling stock, with waiter service and a decadence long since lost on the modern rail system. That's why these films work, they give us chance to explore our imaginations and enhance our dreams. Watching a recent interview with Branagh on The Graham Norton show, he said they built a whole set for the derailed train, mountain, bridge, tunnel etc and the results were spectacular. I googled the film and looked at how many people were involved in the production and post production and all the different jobs, take a look sometime, it's fascinating and easy to see why film making is such a big industry. Only one criticism, what exactly was that growing on Branagh's face and why did it appear to change colour half way through the film........he seemed to go more grey overnight.",Murder on the Orient Express
166,kermitkid,Ensemble cast makes this brilliant,9,31 March 2020,"This has the potential to be nominated for some serious Oscars. Boasting a star-studded cast and an exciting plot, this promises to be one of the best films of 2017. It diverted some from the book at the beginning, but that was actually a better choice. In the book, I felt I was thrown in without any context, and had to figure out the settings and characters. The movie took its time getting there, in a good way, and it was all the better for it. It established the characters clearly and made it easy to suspect each one of them for different reasons. Although the acting was good, there were still a few moments that fell flat. Johnny Depp's ""New York"" accent in particular. It was so obviously fake. And there was one scene where two characters are having a conversation, but one's back is turned to the camera and blurry. I hate that. It distracts, and sometimes makes it hard to follow crucial bits of dialogue, especially when a character's accent is hard to understand. This movie did something I thought would never happen. It made me like Josh Gad. I've been ragging on him for years about how I find him loud and annoying, but here, that doesn't happen. Maybe it's because he's in a more serious role, as opposed to a comedic one. Maybe ""comedy"" is his weakness, hence why he feels the need to shout every line but when he's in a serious role such as this one, he's got some serious accting chops. I wasn't blown away by his performance, but I was at least impressed. I'll go into future roles of his with an open mind, because this proves he can be a good actor. There was also some witty dialogue and some of it very sharp and snarky. The book did not have this, and it's a welcome improvement. If you're looking for a movie to make you feel smart and sophisticated, go see this. It's mostly worth it.

167,MogwaiMovieReviews,Everything That Is Wrong With Hollywood In 2017,4,11 February 2018,"This particular murder of the Orient Express is almost the perfect snapshot of everything wrong with the bewildered and ailing dream factory of Hollywood in the 21st century: remaking things that don't need remaking, adding presently fashionable political causes - as well as lashings and lashings of CGI - and removing all the qualities which made the originals so beloved in the first place, such as a plausible and well told story, peopled with characters one feels a connection to and can remember 5 minutes after it's over. Like the Guy Ritchie travesty of Sherlock, Stock & Two Smoking Holmes, Kenneth Brannagh has crowbarred into this genteel whodunnit a glut of fistfights, love interests (for Poirot!), and Hobbit-looking computer-generated backdrops that end up making every outdoor scene look like a video game. Racial themes and dialogue addressing said racial themes are pulled out of the air and clumsily forced into the story where they never have felt the need to appear before in 80 years of dramatizations, and in ways that only hold up or detract from the original tale, taking up time that could have been used to elucidate various plot points (such as the explanation for the number of knife wounds in the murder) which would have strengthened the internal logic of the movie and the emotional weight.Brannagh, too, is unmemorable in everything but his mustache in his performance as Poirot, and is physically entirely wrong for the part. His Poirot doesn't actually get to bust out his wing chung moves, or pop a cap in anybody's derrière, but it's not far off. STOP ""REBOOTING"" THINGS THAT WERE PERFECTLY FINE THE FIRST TIME ROUND! The magic of cinema is in its immortalizing of fleeting moments of beauty and greatness for all time - Casablanca is right there on the shelf for you to experience any time you want to: it doesn't need turning into an Adam Sandler musical set in space.But if you're GOING to carry on regardless, then try be faithful to the narrative you are telling, concentrate first and foremost on a flawless story, and on getting unforgettable moments and performances out of your cast and crew up there on the screen for eternity. This film contains not even one, and all the problems I've listed above will look worse and worse and worse to every successive generation that watches this from here on, until it falls into deserved obscurity and is forgotten completely 30 years from now.It's a handsomely designed movie, doing its sweaty-faced best to make the sleeping car-bound mystery as big and cinematic as possible, and I applaud Kenneth Brannagh for trying, but I could tell even from the film poster this was going to be a travesty, and it was.",Murder on the Orient Express

Within minutes he gets to showcase his detective skills in an amusing way. Not much later, the movie turns out to be loaded with a stellar cast. After some forced introductions the movie starts to feel rushed. There is no build up, no development, just a quick introduction to a group of so called interesting people and it's done.The movie is beautiful, but a great cast can't hide the fact that the movie is rushed, superficial and hollow and doesn't do honor to the fine details that made the original story richer.",Murder on the Orient Express
170,kaptenvideo-89875,The great detective Poirot is back... and will make you yawn,4,3 February 2018,"I'd like to start with a long rant on how Johnny Depp hasn't been cool or relevant since the end of the 1990's and how his current popularity feels totally undeserved.But I'll save your time - this time at least - and just mention that his screen time in ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is very limited indeed. Don't watch it mainly for him.Yes, Depp plays the character who is central to the story, and the promotional materials concentrate very much on him, but this is something of a hoax. Just watch the trailer and you have gotten the best of him in this.The producers are just desperate to make the project look relevant, because the movie itself is not that good. In fact, it kind of sucks.I know, it looks like it's gonna be good. There's an impressive band of actors involved, and the costumes and set-design look delicious. But I will save you some time, 105 minutes in fact, and tell you right now that it's not worth the time.""Murder"" is big budget moviemaking at its laziest and most soul-less. I like how it all looks visually, and finale ain't actually half bad - especially compared to the rest - but there's nothing to write home about, as they say.But let's make a feeble attempt to begin at the beginning, shall we? The great detective Hercule Poirot is back, this time played by Kenneth Branagh who also directed the joint.The story takes places mostly on or around the titular train, and it's based on a famous novel by Agatha Christie, first published in 1934. I was suprised to learn from IMDb that, so far, it's only the sixth screen adaptation of the classic.I usually find movies based on classic literature, Shakespeare or otherwise, boring, but Branagh sure likes them a lot. His last work as a director was 2015's ""Cinderella"", and now this. How refreshing was to see him try his hand in modern mainstream fare such as directing the first ""Thor"" or the latest ""Jack Ryan""... but now it's back to the literature.""Murder"" is Branagh's attempt to introduce Christie and Poirot to blockbuster generation, and he has chosen to do it in the form of a christmas movie, or something in the vicinity of. Fairy tale for adults, if you like.The visual side is cute indeed, bearing resemblance to Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"" and Robert Zemeckis's ""The Polar Express"" and maybe the first ""Harry Potter"". Almost everything happens on the train, so the scope is not too epic. It's actually still more suitable for a (tele)play than a big-budget movie, if you ask me.Too bad the result concentrates on looking like something straight outta classic Coca-Cola christmas ad, rather than offering, say, witty dialogue or storytelling. Because once the yummy visuals wear off, you may notice how shallow and frankly boring the movie actually is.Yes, there's a rather impressive cast involved, including Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer and Willem Dafoe, among others, but the ony character with any cinematic heft or meat on bones is Poirot played by Branagh.He's got enough conviction to act himself through the shallow material, so his hero may have at least something resembling depth or three-dimensionality.All the others are there just to collect a paycheck, or to oogle their eyes at Depp, maybe. If you've seen the promo materials including the cast recollecting their favorite ""Depp moments"" on set, you'd probably agree with me.I don't hate, but also don't ""get"" the Poirot's moustache choice. What's the point of looking like having just escaped from a Dr. Seuss movie, especially ""The Lorax""?",Murder on the Orient Express
171,binapiraeus,A bold venture that became a stunning movie,10,2 December 2017,"Being a lifelong Agatha Christie fanatic, and of course having seen the magnificent 1974 version of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" literally dozens of times, I was very curious to see what Mr Branagh, who had actually been bold (not to say crazy) enough to attempt a remake of it, had made out of it. I tried to go into it with an open mind, yet sure that it simply CANNOT be as good as the original. Well, I was mistaken: at some points, it's even better, unbelievable as this may sound. Where he deems it adequate, Branagh makes some changes and additions, like the very first scene set in Jerusalem, where he also introduces himself with an enormous moustache (make no mistake: Dame Agatha had actually described Poirot many times as having a really big and extravagant moustache!), the fixed idea that his breakfast eggs should have exactly the same size, and a twinkle in his eye. Then we get to know the first suspects - familiar territory for those who have seen the 1974 movie or read the book, but with a new twist: Colonel Arbuthnot is now a black doctor, which adds a nice note to his romance with Mary Debenham. Then the Istanbul train station - one of those moments where the new version surpasses the old one. A genuine Turkish chaos, through which Poirot, his friend Bouc and the other travellers have to make their way to the train. We meet Mrs Hubbard - and very soon we stop comparing Michelle Pfeiffer to Lauren Bacall; she's different, but she's just as good. Ditto the other passengers; in some cases, Branagh sticks closer to the book than Lumet had done, and the casting in each case is brilliant. Then the train sets out on its journey - magnificent shots of it moving out of the station and into nowhere. As the plot unfolds, we see familiar elements mixed with breathtakingly beautiful outdoor scenes; while Lumet had decided to keep the whole thing confined to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the train compartments, Branagh enjoys making us see things from various internal and external angles. No matter which approach you prefer, they're both brilliant. The only thing critics might claim as a minus is that Branagh's Poirot is perhaps a little bit too heroic, even to the point of personally fighting off and pursuing attackers; scenes that were never in the book, but in this day and age a movie probably simply can't do without them anymore. Anyway, as for the portrayals of the famous Belgian detective: while David Suchet simply WAS Poirot, Branagh, just like Finney and Ustinov before him, creates his OWN Poirot - a new version, but a most lovable one. And Branagh does a great job both as actor and as director - after having watched this movie I'd go as far as to say that, actually, he's a genius. Unless you're totally biased and unwilling to accept new approaches to classic works of literature (like the many different Shakespeare productions that are being played all over the world), chances are you are going to be very much impressed by this uniquely bold and beautiful remake.",Murder on the Orient Express
172,bazookamouth-221-898097,Boring,5,23 September 2018,Kenneth Branagh did a decent job as Poirot despite his odd looking moustache. Just the supporting cast looked like odd pieces of a jigsaw that didn't fit in the movie. Just that its a boring movie and I found the conclusion confusing. Yes I realise Agatha Christie adaptations are slow but I nearly fell asleep three times. Losing Johnny Depp early in the movie didn't help as he was the most charismatic of the male characters. Penelope Cruz was looking a bit rough. Michelle Pfeiffer as elegant as always. Daisy Ridley reminds me of Keira Knightley and has the same plum. Willem Dafoe has a odd mouth and Derek Jacobi was on another planet completely. All in all a dull script and movie. Seemed liked three hours long.,Murder on the Orient Express
173,PipAndSqueak,A no tension crime snoozer,4,4 November 2017,"Branagh has re-imagined our favourite five foot four dark haired dandy detective as a faults finding Teutonic styled giant. We therefore set off on the wrong foot. Poirot's mental tussling with the truth of the story, as it is later explained in full, is therefore lost. Poirot is wedded to the truth, wedded to the expression of himself in his punctilious attention to his personal appearance...up turned moustache and dark hair and all. He must tell a lie or have himself done in if someone in the murdering cabal of train travellers is to see justice done. It's nice to see a full set of famous actors in all the character roles....it gives just a hint that we should take them seriously...as might the operators of the Orient Express and their wealthiest patrons. However, this is not enough to compensate for the already compromised story which thus has to limp on ....and on...and on..through a weather induced derailment and the exposure of the murdering mastermind. It's too easy to fall asleep because there is no tension to keep your interest.

Why? Because it is blank, it is slow, it is monotone, it is boring, it is simple and most of all, it is trying to much to be an exact copy of the book, which very often does not end up well, cause books can be boring unless you don't wake up your imagination and create your own scenario.

177,Aly200,A Decent Remake of a Classic Mystery,7,11 November 2017,"Before everyone gets annoyed about this film being an unnecessary remake, consider how long it has been since the acclaimed Sidney Lumet feature film. The modern master of Shakespearean films, Kenneth Branagh, decides to step behind the camera and also don the famous mustache (though more unconventional) of Agatha Christie's famous Belgian detective, Hercules Poirot, in this slightly updated take on the classic whodunit thriller.A brief overview of the plot: Detective Hercules Poirot boards the famous Orient Express for a much holiday from crime. However this is not meant to be as one of the passengers is brutally slain in the middle of the night and each of the other twelve passengers is a suspect as each harbors a dark secret and motive for murder.The script for the film is basically the same as its source material. This film does put a little more emphasis on following its detective around than on development of the primary players in the mystery which does detract from the story at times. However the core answer to the mystery is the same as in the conclusion of the novel where Poirot presents his theories on the crime and the solution becomes clear.As the famous literary detective, Branagh provides his own unique take on the character. He does capture Poirot's brilliant arrogance that help make his sleuthing skills renowned. Adopting a more believable French accent than his predecessor, Albert Finney, Branagh does mind his pronunciations though his natural British accent is slightly audible but doesn't take over and derail his faux French. The acclaimed actor-director does tend to focus a little too much on his character during intervals of the main mystery, but has the gravitas to lead the charge and bring the story full circle.Branagh and his casting directors do a decent job of filling the shoes of the 1974 film's illustrious cast of characters. Only two characters are changed from the original novel and prior film as the elegant Penelope Cruz plays the role of the missionary (Ingrid Bergman previously played the same role with a different name, but was German like the novel) as a Hispanic woman to match Cruz's own heritage (a not unwelcome change as it doesn't take away from the part she plays) and the talented Leslie Odom, Jr. plays the role of Colonel Arbuthnot, a doctor in this case instead of a straight-forward solider as Sean Connery in the original film, and provides some diversity as he is African-American. The likes of Dame Judi Dench (Princess Dragmonoff), Olivia Colman (Fraulein Schmidt), Daisy Ridley (Mary), Willem Dafoe (Cyrus Hardman), Josh Gad (Hector McQueen) and the gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer (Mrs. Hubbard) also grace the cast with their unique talents, but none quite get the development they really deserve but all work with what little is given to them and craft their characters into enigmas that cannot be trusted. And lastly is the 'poor' victim, Ratchet' played by an ever sleazy Johnny Depp; finally a diverse role for the actor during 2017 after ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"". The actor develops believable mannerisms that give cause to also distrust Depp as Ratchet, yet Depp doesn't turn into a cartoonish figure. He remains aloof and mysterious and with his demise, a figure who gave all but Poirot and his friend, Boc, reason to off him.Behind the camera, Kenneth Branagh displays his usual keen eye for crafting an atmosphere that puts the viewer in the story with the characters. With a fully built train model, complete with claustrophobic corridors, we are as trapped as the passengers of the Orient Express. The director's decision to also film on 65mm film (like fellow British filmmaker Christopher Nolan) lends to the 1930s setting of the film, giving an old-fashioned feel to the film's aura.Give this one a chance and you might enjoy even if you might know the story already.",Murder on the Orient Express

As someone who has never seen the classic film, I found the ending to be rather predictable and this was an issue that I had. However, I see this not because this is somewhat of a cliched ending but rather, the modern day filmgoer is a lot more aware and has seen so much more twists that this is somehow expected. Hence, perhaps what should have been considered is whether this is a good idea to readapt this film that may be al little out of its time nowadays. However, in spite of this issue the modern day rendition had brilliant set pieces and magnificent camera work followed by brilliant acting that makes this certainly an enjoyable viewing experience.

Branaugh is fantastic in the film and his direction is spot on. This is Branaugh showing what he once showed in the past.While this movie has an all-star cast - Branaugh carries the entire film.

Daisy Ridley is surprisingly decent in this. Its the best movie I have seen this year. I had some problems with it, like I said, the beginning was nothing especial but it just makes the great parts stand out even more (now that I think about it, the beginning may not even be as mediocre as I thought). Perhaps my bigger issue its the ending, not the execution of it, but the message and its way of thinking, I am kinda of mad at it, but I really love the way it was handled.

182,PetarNeo,Interested in this one? Well...,6,21 November 2017,"Incredible Hercule Poirot returns and it's Murder on the Orient Express that will have to take his presence once again. Going into this movie knowing how Poirot established himself as great detective you will probably find it very delightful and sweetened but as soon as serious action and plot kicks in you will realize that it's not what you thought it will be. You have seen how serious cast of the movie is and without blink of an eye you will want to see this, it's not to blame you but after coming to screening of it the excitement will come down as movie starts to come to it's end. Samuel Ratchett is murdered and Poirot tired and on vacation gets into his role and solves the crime one more time. It started pretty amazing and with potential but as story went it just kept losing it's so much needed tension and it will just lack that mystery that keeps movie like this going. Pieces of puzzle start to get into it's places as you find out more and you realize movie is trying to play tricks with you but if you have been careful you will not get distracted and will find movie pretty astonishing from directing point of view and there are some pretty beautiful scenes in movie. Plot is also great but somehow it just can't live up to it's true potential which will get you stuck to you seat and in wonder what will strike next. Directing of Kenneth Branagh was pretty amazing and also his contribution as main character Hercule Poirot as which he gave a truly good performance proving his talent over and over. Rest of cast featuring Penélope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, Derek Jacobi, Leslie Odom Jr., Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley and Tom Bateman gave probably as much as any of them had some of them even stole scenes more than others but they didn't have that power of intimidation that could help us being dragged into picture and scenes. Movie was stunning to watch, cast was very good at their job but they just could get their hands on attracting audience enough to care for all mystery. One more thing portraying journey and placing actions of movie between Vinkovci and Brod was pretty amazing seeing all scenes but showing it as mountains that even Alps could envy considering that part of Croatia is the flattest and mountain free was just absurd but all in all it was amazing scene. 2.5/4",Murder on the Orient Express
183,CabbageCustard,What? Again!?,7,25 February 2020,"The biggest mystery about this movie based on Agatha Christie's famous novel is why they bothered. It isn't as if this book hasn't been filmed umpteen times already. This movie features great sets, a marvelous soundtrack and many famous and talented actors but it brings nothing to the story that we haven't seen before. To be honest, we certainly wouldn't want anyone to change the story, but if we're going to see it done again we would like to see it done in a way that brings something fresh. Maybe that's no longer possible with such a familiar tale.Kenneth Branagh plays Hercule Poirot. He is a very brave man to do so. Most of us remember Poirot played by David Suchet. Suchet is, without a doubt, the definitive Poirot. He has Poirot's mannerisms and quirks down to a tee, his acting is impeccable and Suchet even looks like Poirot, just as Christie described him. I believe that every book Christie wrote featuring Poirot has been filmed starring Suchet, including Murder on the Orient Express. If you are a fan of Christie or mysteries generally, you should look these productions up. Kenneth Branagh looks nothing like Poirot, but then again neither did Peter Ustinov or Albert Finney or other actors who have played the role.If there is a problem with this movie it is Branagh's portrayal of Poirot. We know Poirot is a very eccentric even narcissistic man, but Branagh goes over the top in portraying these aspects of Poirot's personality. His is not always a subtle performance. In fact there are times it seems that Branagh is envisioning Poirot as sort of an early 20th century superhero. There is one scene where Branagh's Poirot is outdoors walking towards all the other cast members and we see him walking towards the camera with his voluminous coat swirling about him like Superman's cape. There are times too that the landscapes in this movie look decidedly like computer generated images. I suspect some of them are. They are certainly gorgeous but sometimes have a cartoonish quality to them. One other thing I became aware of as the film approached its conclusion is how many secrets Poirot was progressively exposing with absolutely no evidence or clues presented to support his deductions. He was always correct of course, but that's not the point. We would like to see the clues too so we could try and solve the mystery along with him from the comfort of our lounge chairs.I don't mean to sound like I am disparaging this movie. That is not my intention. There is nothing terribly wrong with it, but there is nothing special about it. This movie concludes with the suggestion that a sequel is planned - a remake of Death on the Nile. Honestly people, Mr Branagh et al, don't bother.",Murder on the Orient Express

Hand-held camera-work was exceptional 3) Casting - superb all star cast But then there's the points that weren't so good Some of script / delivery of lines was unintelligible Some of the CGI was brilliant but some was quite poor and at one point the train looked like a child's toy! Also it felt a bit like the Polar express at times and that's over twelve years old ! Overall the film just could have been so much better it had all the ingredients , setting , cast , story but it failed to deliver a top notch performance.

186,ccorral419,A monotonous viewing experience,5,6 December 2017,"Director/Actor Kenneth Branagh (Dir.: ""Cinderella"" - 2015, Actor: ""Dunkirk"" - 2017) and writer Michael Green (""Green Lantern"" - 2011) toss CGI special effects, a packed and at times confusing storyline, and all kinds of celebrities (Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Josh Gad, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench and a whole slue of others) at this famed Agatha Christie novel turned movie to unexpected boredom. The blame here lies in Branagh's hands, as he stars in and directs. Across the board, the top notch actors seem to be just going through the motions and/or involved in the production as a favor to their friend and theater company member Branagh. It doesn't help that Branagh's direction is overly staged at every turn, to the extend it appears the various scenes start and stop with little smooth transition. So many situation presented just don't make sense here, such as: How does a large train that is derailed get back on the tracks without any machinery? How can characters nonchalantly talk out in the freezing weather without jackets or walking on snow without any sound of the snow crunching below them? If the train isn't not running, how is it that heat, lights and cooking continues, and on and on, and on. One can quickly see how this film will develop from the beginning of the film, where the ""Wailing Wall"" suddenly becomes a site for one of Hercule Poirot's (Branagh's character) cheesy detective resolutions. The story behind Agatha Christie's novel is all there, it's just Branagh's creepy mustache and mumbling dialogue delivery, coupled with the overly staged scenes and lackluster cast, just make this film a monotonous viewing experience.",Murder on the Orient Express

188,hunter-friesen,A floundering beginning and middle make this film go from whodunit to who cares,5,15 November 2017,"An adaptation of Agatha Christie's famous novel, Murder on the Orient Express has finally been released after months of Kenneth Branagh promising it will be an exhilarating experience. This film should have been a great mystery thriller because of the all-star cast and amazing source material. However, all that star power and pizazz can't save a plot with poor pacing and a director that can't decide how to use his cast appropriately. The film opens in 1934 with famous detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) solving a missing jewel case in Jerusalem. While in the city, Poirot meets an old friend, Bouc (Tom Bateman), who happens to be the owner of the famous Orient Express. Poirot is persuaded to ride the Orient on his way back home to Belgium. Along on the train are thirteen other finely dressed passengers. There's the governess (Daisy Ridley), the lustful widow (Michelle Pfeiffer), the gangster (Johnny Depp), and a host of other riders. One of the passengers is murdered after the first night and the culprit is one of the passengers. Poirot must use his world-renowned detective skills to catch the killer before the train arrives at its destination. The biggest problem the film has is the beginning and middle phases. The pace is uneven as it shifts from starting out slow when introducing Branagh, then quickly speeds through the rest of the characters when they are boarding the train. Characters are given little backstory to make them stand out apart from each other. Johnny Depp and Josh Gad are the only actors who have a fully fledged character that is memorable to watch and care about. The rest just fill in space and patiently wait their turn to get a few lines here and there. It makes it really hard to care about which character is the murder when none of them are that special to begin with. This lowers the level of suspense and mystery which in turn makes the film drag until the final act, which is actually really well done.Branagh as the director is another problem the film has. He constantly makes the wrong decision when it comes to camera placement. The amount of overhead shots is staggeringly high and they really don't serve any purpose other than to confuse and annoy. We also have a tracking shot of Poirot boarding the train that could have easily been improved upon if Branagh had filmed it from another angle. The production aspects of the film are really well done as they make the famous train setting glamorous and pleasing to the eyes. The decorations inside and around the train are lavish and really give off the impression that this is a luxurious haven for the wealthy elite. The costumes for each passenger are also really well done. They are the defining traits of the characters and the main thing that we remember them by apart from their faces. The acting here is inconsistent and only a few of the actors stand out in their roles. This is because the film has to juggle over a dozen important characters and their story arcs in only two hours. What we end up getting is a lot of Poirot and Bouc, but little of everyone else. Poirot himself is a very annoying character that tries to walk the line between eccentric and dramatic. His mustache is even more annoying to see on screen and it too is given more time than it deserves. It looks as if Branagh put it on to say ""Hey look at me! I look funny and you should laugh!"" Johnny Depp gives a surprisingly good performance as the runaway gangster, Ratchett. He gives off a suave, but dangerous look that works perfectly for his character. He commands every scene he has while also playing well off everybody else. Josh Gad and Derek Jacobi also do a good job as Depp's assistants. Both Daisy Ridley and Leslie Odom Jr. struggle in their medium sized roles. They try too hard to be memorable and end up making things worse. The absolute worst performance comes from Sergei Polunin and Lucy Boynton as the Count and Countess. They are insufferable to watch as the barely speak fluently and act with the same skills as an overly serious high school theatre student that is trying too hard to impress the director. Veterans Judi Dench and Michelle Pfeiffer do a respectable job in their criminally undersized roles. Dench plays a princess that knows she is more important than everyone on the train. Pfeiffer plays a widow that is searching for another husband as she recovers from her second divorce. She gets some show-stopping scenes at the end of the film, but it's too little too late for her character. Murder on the Orient Express is a moderately watchable drama where the stakes never feel that high and the suspense never reaches its potential. The quality of the film is like a seesaw with each scene going from good to bad to good again. It's an inconsistent pattern that makes the film average with not many redeeming features to remember it by.",Murder on the Orient Express

190,Come-and-Review,A single mistake,7,9 December 2017,"I was quite saddened when I walked out of the cinema: it was very hard for me to accept that, while the film was nearly perfect in almost all technical aspects, a film that you could feel that those involved took their effort in making it as perfect as they could, it failed at one of the most important: its pacing.Let's immediately start with this issue the film had, which ultimately resulted in the rating I chose to gave it. The problem was that, particularly the whole murder solving part of the film, felt almost rushed, too quick. It all felt too obvious, almost too simple in deduction, as if anyone could have solved the case (and I, not having read the book or seen the previous film, did solve it a bit earlier than the revelation scene, due to the way clues where showed). My assumption is that producers allowed only a short lenght to the film, for commercial purposes, which lead to heavy cuts on that part of the film. I personally think that it would have been wiser to cut some of the scenes from the first third of the film: it takes about 10-15 minutes for the viewer to finally be aboard the Orient Express. Those 15 minutes, which did introduce Poirot and the other characters, could have been shortened or even cut altogether, in my opinion, even though they where fun, as they didn't focus on the main story. With a better pacing, the film could have decisively been saved.Another thing I didn't enjoy was the score: it felt too lightening, especially in the revelation scene, when it should have been much darker, and it being too lightening in that scene ruined most of the moral ambiguity that the finale required.Despite these two aspects, Murder had outstanding photography (I particularly liked the final shot), the settings (The choice of not displaying the revelation scene inside the dining hall, as, it is my understanding, Lumet's version did, but a much more scenographic setting), and notable is Branagh's impersonation and acting of Poirot, did with great cure, and which I particularly liked.Ultimately, I do consider worth my ticket, although not at the levels of satisfaction I hoped. I hope that, for the planned sequel, Branagh will reprise at least the role of Poirot.",Murder on the Orient Express
191,gcsman,A classic reworking of a classic mystery,8,19 November 2017,"This is clearly Kenneth Branagh's work above all: he's the star, the director, and the co-producer, and you can feel his influence from start to finish. And that's not a bad thing. If you're going to give this amount of control and influence to one artist, he's certainly among the better choices. Even if you happen to know the plot and the really quite clever key to the murder, you'll enjoy this movie thoroughly. On one level, it's just a lot of fun to see the all-star cast of supporting players mix and match with Hercule Poirot as they go along, just like it was in the 1974 film version of the story. It's a genuine classic.Branagh himself plays Poirot with an engagingly different slant than in previous takes on the Agatha Christie character (notably David Suchet, Peter Ustinov, and Albert Finney). While just as cerebral and quick-thinking, Poirot here is rather more emotional: he reacts to crime almost as if it's a personal insult and attacks it with almost the intensity of an avenging angel. The urge to solve this murder (or any murder, as we see right at the end when a messenger tells him that he's needed to solve a new case of violent death ""on the bloody Nile"" (!)) even overrides his desperate desire to take a long-needed vacation. He just can't resist.Big names or not, everyone else in the cast is excellent and I won't mention them by name because you will enjoy them all once you see it. The cinematography has a warm color palette that you can settle right into, with added long shots of mountain scenery that are beautiful in their own right. Period costuming, the setting inside the train, the ambiance of high society of the time -- everything is nicely put together.Totally enjoyable movie-going; no deep messages about human nature of the meaning of life, but just a classic story told in a classic way told through a first-rate production.",Murder on the Orient Express
192,PotassiumMan,Does Kenneth Branagh think he's Baz Luhrmann?,4,11 November 2017,"The most conspicuous aspect of this misfire is that right out of gate, it comes at you with full force, over-the-top, fake-looking performances. It's the kind of rare style that very few directors, let alone films can do to good effect. It was like ""Moulin Rouge"" only not done well. It poked me in the eye in that regard. And it made me wonder just what Branagh's intentions were with this version of Agatha Christie's novel. Was he trying to make it more light-hearted? More comical? More campy? In the end, he only succeeded for sure in making it more boring.A film that goes from absurd to dull will not earn much recognition for anything other the sheer acting talent that it wastes. Michelle Pfieffer and Willem Dafoe are both slumming it in this dreck. Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz are the only ones who don't embarrass themselves here but then their screen time is short. I've seen worse films in my life, but this one gets a big thumbs down and is not recommended.",Murder on the Orient Express
193,rutzelb,Good Production,9,7 March 2018,"Famed Belgian Detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) has just finished a case in Israel and decides he just needs a rest, but a telegram tells him he is wanted in London and he agrees to go. From France he takes the Orient Express when a murder takes place on the train and he is put to the task once again. No rest for Poirot.Since this is a remake many of us know who did the murder either from the 1934 novel by Agatha Christie or the 1974 movie. For those who have not seen the previous movie or read the book, will they figure it out? Hmmm.............This is a very good production showing intricate scenes within the train, colorful period clothes, breathtaking mountain scenery, CGI showing an old-time locomotive racing thru the mountains, and dazzling sunsets with heaven-like pastel colors. The acting all around is very good although Poirot steals most of the scenes with that outlandish and quite unnecessary mustache. One cannot help but focus on that mustache when Poirot is in the scene. Pity. At times, he talks so fast some dialogue can be missed. Bummer. Okay, who was killed? An antique dealer Samuel Ratchatt (Johnny Depp) whose real name is Cassetti, who got away with a kidnaping and murder of a child Daisy, the daughter of the well known Armstrong family. He was stabbed 12-times, some strong blows some shallow.Notables: Josh Gad as McQueen, as a secretary to Ratchatt; Michelle Pfeiffer as American socialite, Mrs Hubbard and also Linda Arden; Daisy Ridley as Mary Debenham the Governess to Daisy Armstrong; Judy Dench as Princess Dragomiroff; Derek Jacobi as Edward Masterman, Ratchatt's valet; Penelope Cruz as Pilar Estravados, a former nanny; Lucy Boynton as Countess Elena; Willem Dafoe as Gerhard Hardman a Pinkerton agent; Dergei Polunin as a Count Rudolph; Daisy Ridley as Governess Mary Debenham; Leslie Odom Jr as Dr. Arbuthnot; and Tom Bateman as Bouc, the Director of the Orient Express.Josh Gad did a great job and he should stick to drama and not comedy where he is never funny.
 
The music during the movie is very good. When the credits run you will listen to Michelle Pfeiffer singing ""Never Again."" Good job. Well, there is one clue that comes quite easily and Poirot eventually figures out who the murderer is. Will you?Poirot still cannot rest as once again a telegram comes to help solve a case in Cairo.

197,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,5,13 November 2017,"Having seen the 1974 one with Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot and the 2010 television version with David Suchet...this one just felt pointless and unnecessary. You all know the plot so there's no need to go into what the story is about. There was just something about this film that just didn't work. The pace of the film was way off...it leaves you bored and not making you feel like you want more or sending chills down your spine etc. You just can't wait for the movie to end. There's honestly no difference from this one compared to the original, no changes are made except for how the train stops. The CGI was very bad and it makes the 1974 one look like it had the best effects ever. Kenneth Branagh being the director felt wrong and out of place, not that we've seen other directed movies he's done but with this he just doesn't capture the imagination like he could have.We have all these great actors (one of them being Oscar Winner Judi Dench, and several other Oscar nominated actors) and they all seem wasted. As a movie where all the characters have to be well written and crafted and likable or interesting we don't seem to care about any of them. Not the actors fault it's just the director Kenneth Branagh failing to bring them to life. In the 1974 version they all got brought to life. The only actress that shines here is Star Wars's Daisy Ridley as Miss Mary Debenham. She brought so much energy to her role that it's obvious that Ridley is talented and is rising to be one of the greatest actresses! All in all it's not that bad, but it just wasn't really necessary to be made. Maybe see it at a cheap theater, or rent it when it comes out on DVD. Our opinion is to stick to the 1974 version. 2/5 stars. Jay and Nick- The Autistic Reviewers.",Murder on the Orient Express
198,quinnox-1,A Fantastic atmospheric classical style mystery - with great actors/actresses!,8,13 November 2017,"Wow, I didn't see this coming! I had seen previews and since I'm a British mystery book enthusiast, I very much was interested in the movie. But my expectations were not very high, because of all the disappointing drek that Hollywood has been churning out in recent history. Hollywood seems to have been having a really rough time in trying to make good movies lately.So I was very surprised at just how good this movie turned out to be. It's filmed in a very classical style, and reminds me of older movies, when they knew how to make good movies. Great atmosphere of a luxury train in the 1930s, and the train interior scenes are done in a way that doesn't feel cramped at all, like you might think. It all feels very natural. The ensemble cast is excellent. My favorite characters and performances in the movie were Kenneth Branagh as the esteemed detective Hercule Poirot, Willem Dafoe as Professor Gerhard Hardman, and especially Michelle Pfeiffer as Caroline Hubbard.I don't know what it is about Michelle Pfeiffer, but I have taken a real liking to her as she has become an older actress. I used to not like her at all when she was ""young and hot"", but now I think she is a really good actress and I'm excited to see her name in a film. Here, she is really superb playing a mature woman who still has a wild streak in her, and she almost steals the entire movie all by herself.But Kenneth Branagh also gives a sterling performance, and I was very impressed by his portrayal of the detective Poirot in the movie. He was pretty amazing in how authentic the character came across as, and had a hell of a presence in the movie, basically anchoring the whole movie around his performance.Willem Dafoe was solid, as usual, as a fine character actor. And he had a really good reveal type scene near the end of the film, I thought. That said, the acting from all the characters in the movie, both major and minor, was of a very high caliber overall.The film's mystery is based on the famous Agatha Christie novel, which I must confess I never read. So, the entire plot was a surprise to me, and I have to say it was a damn fine mystery! I now know why this book is one of Agatha Christie's most famous mystery novels, its quite fantastic! I didn't see the solution coming at all, and even though I have read numerous detective books and seen a ton of mystery TV shows, the climax even surprised me, which shows just how special this mystery really is -- definitely written by a master.My only real criticism is that the film is shot in 65mm, which gives the film kind of a fantasy, story-book like look to the whole film. A lot of the landscape shots especially looked fake and like CGI because of this. I prefer the more realistic look that you get from normal 35mm film. A minor complaint is the film feels a bit rushed to me, and maybe should have been half an hour longer. This is a very unusual complaint coming from me, because I don't like and often will criticize the too long running times of many movies these days. But this movie felt like it could have used another half hour to expand upon, and not feel so rushed.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys traditional style mysteries, it really is a must-see!",Murder on the Orient Express
199,hjalsayegh,A decent adaptation that gets better as the film goes.,6,11 November 2017,"I grew up with Christie's books and David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. The thing with ""who don it"" mysteries is that if you know the ending then your experience will differ from that who's seeing it for the first time. Is this a decent adaptation of the book? Yes, they followed the plot and a lot of attention was paid to the little details to make it look like an actual train from the 1920's. Up until the end the theater was full of murmurs ""who did it? who was it then?"" and even though I knew I was still interested in the movie till the end.One thing that lowers this movie's score is Hercule Poirot himself. As a fan I know the character is a bit eccentric however here he was a full blown OCD with non-sense scenes E.g. get the poor 6 year old to run half way across the city to get him eggs then insist on having them be equal in size and cooked for exactly 4 minutes then do it again because the eggs weren't just right... why? that just seemed cruel.E.g. 2. have him stand on the roof of the train in a snowstorm ... just to show the scene, there was no reason for that scene at all. The film gets better as you get past the ""character intro"" and onto the actual train however and Poirot is more himself then.

Even there are several filming of it, both to small screen and silver screen, the story is here what makes it classic. Middle sized budget filming new version has still been quite big success and most likely we will see more Agatha Christie filming near future. Perhaps next is Death on the Nile for what they hint at the end of the movie.A lot of famous actors and actresses, old fashioned drama and good screen write makes it enjoyable to watch in a middle of all digital effect rumble movies. Even the story has told many times and you know how it will end, it is still enjoyable to watch this kind of old fashioned drama. Only one thing doesn't feel quite right. Somehow Kenneth Branagh don't impress enough as Hercule Poirot. Maybe he is too young to be Poirot or maybe it is that he can't act enough of Poirot's accent. Despite of this little blemish, Murder on the Orient Express is very enjoyable movie. Scenery at Istanbul is beautiful. Dramatic mountain views makes some tickle feeling for crime story.

This one is enough. I have no idea what Branagh was thinking. The movie is poorly made, full of ridiculously phony CGI backgrounds, terrible acting - this cannot be understood - and an ever-present blanket of boredom. No tension, no intrigue and no depth to character. If you want to watch this instead of properly read the original story, there are no less than four or five choices ranging from superb to passable. This is one to pass, to forget and ultimately to avoid at all costs. David Suchet and Branagh were both Shakespearian trained and I always thought Branagh got a free pass in most of the Shakespeare productions he gained notoriety for. Suchet, in contrast, has always disappeared into his parts unlike Branagh who seems to only talk louder and only worked to amplified himself. This movie proves that point.

When he first appeared on screen, I thought that he would quickly become tedious and annoying. However, as time went on, I found myself really getting into his character. Branagh plays him with such ridiculous eccentricity that he actually became rather charming and relatable. Now, it's not an Oscar worthy performance by any stretch of the imagination, but I do think it does say something about his ability as an actor to take these idiosyncrasies that normally would have annoyed me and in turn make them charming, as well as fulfilling his other duties as the director. The film is also very well shot. I was surprised by how much I was getting into the cinematography. Branagh works with long-time collaborator Haris Zambarloukos in order to make perfect use of the cramped quarters of the train. Whether its panning shots outside of the train looking in, or overhead shots looking down on the actors, Zambarloukos makes very distinct and interesting choices that allow for Murder on the Orient Express to come to life in a rather unique way, one that I wasn't expecting from the looks of the trailers.",Murder on the Orient Express

I have watched the 1974 all-star Sidney Lumet directed version over a dozen times and still consider it the superior version, even better than the recent one on the made-for-PBS-TV one with David Suchet as Poirot. This version, sadly for me, diverts into some pretty cheesy melodrama, and events which do not appear in either former films and I am now going to re-read Agatha's novel to see if they indeed are in the book. I don't think so. My biggest complaint with this version is that it is anti-climactic in how the director treats the actual murder scene. He breezed thru it with only close up's of the ""stabbers"" whereas the older versions draw out the scene with a further identity of each of them from their individual comments whilst thrusting the blade and even how the each of them vary in how they DO thrust it. Sir John Guilgud in the first version almost dissects the body while poor Ingrid Bergman can hardly pierce it. Very great scene. Also, it is interesting to not that in the Suchet version, Poroit is a deeply religious Catholic and portrayed as such, which is a significant explanation over his torment in concluding the ""first version"" of the crime is the one he must choose to report. I encourage anyone who has not see either version before, to at least view the 1974 one to compare. Thank You.",Murder on the Orient Express

209,svhot,"Nice Classic-Style Mystery Solving, Good Acting, Effective Direction",8,6 November 2017,"""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a nice look at how mysteries were solved by detectives in an era which had limited technology, as compared to the ultra-modern world of today, which has GPS trackers, hackers, and so many technology-based tools to assist the current detectives.Please, do not rely on the unnecessary and negative reviews given by many critics for this movie, who are unfairly comparing the film to Agatha Christie's original novel / book story. It is very challenging and brave to make a movie based on a novel and an author so popular, that more than half of the people living on earth know the original story. Yet, actor-director Kenneth Branagh has dared to accomplish this challenging task. Mr Branagh has done an excellent job, both as a director and an actor.Mr K. Branagh has taken a different approach to convey the mystery by changing a few elements and characters ; this has given this movie (and the story) a fresh touch. Kenneth Branagh has played the great Belgian detective Poirot himself.His performance is brilliant, and he has given the character of Poirot a realistic touch. Johnny Depp shines again in the role of a suspicious crook. Penelope Cruz is quite seductive and plays her role very well. All the other actors have also given good performances.I would love to become a story-writer for movies because intriguing stories develop in my mind all the time (Yes, I am telling the truth, and I am not crazy !!)

Well I loved it simply because it was given more gravitas and more dramatic experience. While you have to get over the ""elephant in the room"" i.e the ""mustache"" this version of the film differs enough to maintain your interest. With a good supporting cast you find once you have seen something before you pay more attention to the detail.

213,tmpsvita,A fascinating transposition,7,5 January 2018,"Taken from the homonyms novel of the world-famous writer Agatha Christie, this ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is presented as an alternative film version to that of 1974.
What most attracts the viewer is surely the cast that makes use of many big names such as Johnny Depp, Daisy Ridley, Penélope Cruz, Josh Gad, Michelle Pfeiffer, Derek Jacobi, Judi Dench, Willem Defoe and Kenneth Branagh, who also directs the film.
Being a choral film, however, none of the roles allows us to offer memorable performances, given the limited amount of time available for each character, even if all manage to provide more than discrete performances, except for Branagh who, being the protagonist, naturally has more space and, also for this reason, he is distinguished from other interpreters and gives the public a perfect transposition of the famous inspector that is well interpreted and that, thanks to its characterization, mostly aesthetic (the bizarre and huge mustache), manages to be immediately recognized by viewers who have already read the famous book, because he is simply the same, or at least I could not ask for a better transposition for this character.
What instead differentiates this film particularly from the book from which it is taken, is the narrative structure: if the book is linear (the various interrogations are carried out one after the other) and precise, especially in the details, the film is much more dynamic, fast and less linear; this decreases the possibility for the spectator to be able to process the various clues but allows the film to be much more entertaining, light and if we also want fun and engaging; a type of narration that lends itself much more to the big screen than to the pages of a book and, for this reason, I consider a right choice that of Branagh to make everything more movement, thanks for the most part to a dynamic editing, a presentation of the characters more hurry but functional and a pressing and immersive soundtrack, entrusted to the two-time Oscar nominee, Patrick Doyle, who had previously worked with the aforementioned.
As for the direction is also very dynamic, Kenneth Branagh uses, in fact, often the use of dollys to be able to achieve many long and precise machine movements, moreover many of the shots are studied in detail and, if on a hand, this scrupulous search for the perfect film gives an excellent aesthetic appearance, on the other it hurts a bit the fluidity of the film: in some moments I have had more time to notice the various virtuosities of the director than to pay attention to the story, precisely because in some cases distracted me. Despite I liked them (the virtuosities) some have me just surprised and pleased, I would have preferred a little 'more naturalness, in some moments, by the director without having to always have to look for the perfect framing or the perfect camera movement.
For the rest I was very impressed by the cinematography that gives the film a modern look without betraying the historical period in which it takes place.
In general I found it a great transposition and a good entertainment film that can satisfy various types of public without disappointing any.
Now I just have to see the 1974 film and wait for the future sequel of this version.",Murder on the Orient Express

This figure can only be looked inside David Suchet, no other actor can be Hercule Poirot, nor this actor in this remake Murder on Orient Express. Kenneth Burough is tall enough to be Hercule Poirot and his mustache in this movie is too much. Well, this first appearance makes me judging other things, especially the plot. This movie is a remake, so does the murder and the ending. This is not surprising, because while I was searching the murder weapon along with all characters, I could not find it, so that I had assumed that the ending must be remake too. Well, the imaging of the train, snow, old cities, wardrobe are amazing. I can not bear it if this is coming from modern time, with good quality and angles. This movie is really having a great fashion designer and imaging Director, but for the plot director, I am quite disappointed, even though this movie has a big budget with such kind of actors, Johnny Deep, Penelope Cruz, etc, but the plot is not interesting, is boring, and is predictable.

They all look extremely bored and uncomfortable. And the ""acting"" spands from looking as bored as the audience to acting way too theatrical ilike they're in a bad play. I hate Kenneth Brannagh. I hate the way this movie is filmed, like its a play on a stage and not a movie. I hate how fake it looks, everytime theyre ""outside"" the train, clearly filmed in front of a bluescreen, no visible breath and lighting that dont match the background. This movie is incredibly boring and as about as much fun as watching paint dry. And the awful, constipated, old looking Johnny Depp, really needs to retire. The last time I saw him act well, was in Donnie Brasco, a 21 year old movie. I'm as sick of him as I am of Brad Pitt.

219,thisseatofmars,"Beautiful colours, beautiful costumes, gorgeous cinematography, and a helluva lot of funny accents.",6,13 December 2017,"This movie pulls you in for its colours and costumes. Everything is great to look at: the movie succeeds because of its world-building. For the whole 114 minutes I was drawn in: not so much by the intrigue and mystery, oddly, but its aesthetic. (Really, I think this is true of most movies and books: if we already know the plot, don't we re-read books like Lord of the Rings just to walk in Middle Earth once again?) So, A+ for aesthetic. I liked living in this world for 114 minutes, it's rich: one of the characters even comments on it, saying something like, ""Don't you just love it? All these people in cramped conditions, with the gentle rocking of the train.""Where the film falls is the acting. Despite all of his Shakespearean adaptations (his version of Hamlet being one of the best I've seen, what-what) Kenneth Branagh is not a great actor, and his Franco-Belgian accent makes his dialogue hard to comprehend sometimes. And Branagh threw in a bit of virtue-signalling, with all the commentary of race. (Take that, Trump!)But Branagh's not the only one with funny accents, oh no-no, there are funny accents to be found throughout. I don't know any of the cast, but no one's especially great except for William Defoe, Judi Dench, and Sir Derek Jacobi (gotta put that ""sir"" in there). Nevertheless, Defoe alternates between bad German and bad Brooklynite and Judi Dench and Derek Jacobi speak in voices as well. I don't know. I felt at times I was watching a kid's show.And, honestly, I find the plot wanting as well. Whoa, calm yourself: I know the movie's an adaptation and Agatha Christie is revered worldwide: but, spoilers: getting, what was it: 12 people to agree to kill someone is, and let's be honest now: contrived. Yes, yes, the passengers all had a good motive (they were stabbing Johnny Depp to death, teehee,) but really. It makes me think of that ancient Chinese myth about the monks who kill someone by each taking a bite of the person. They do this because if each monk takes a bite then no one can say who the murderer really is: but guys, that was a myth. Fantasy. No matter how heinous Depp's ""victim"" character was, it's incredulous to think that so many people would come together to aid in the person's killing: and then go on to lead normal lives. (Yes, Poirot frees them all. Shame. They *murdered* someone: a criminal who was bound to be ""whacked"" in due time anyway.)That said, ""Murder"" is a welcome change of pace from the drivel that is killing cinemas. It establishes its world very well, but I'm not sure if its one I'll return to see.",Murder on the Orient Express

221,andrewmerritt-31652,"Excellent cast, poor execution",5,8 December 2019,"Murder on the Orient Express is based off of the classic Agatha Christine novel and is directed, produced and stars Kenneth Branagh. The movie also stars Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Michelle Pfieffer, Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, and many more. So all these strangers on a train until one of them is murdered and its up to Kenneth Branagh to solve the mystery. I've never read Agatha Christie before, but I like a good mystery movie because I can use my brain to figure out who the killer is. The first half of the movie is good, well maybe not the beginning, which I felt was out of place, but when were introduced to everyone on the train and a murder goes down, that's when the real drama begins. And after that that's pretty much it actually. I found myself bored and uninterested in the mystery and what was going on that I lost focus. The movie is entertaining I'll give it credit, but the problem with this is that it's a star-studded cast, but only half of them get any screen time. They choose to focus on half of the characters and the rest they leave in the wind. We don't get any character development for Willem Dafoe or Judi Dench for example and its not until the end where the characters we forgotten have a backstory that feels rushed. And by then its not interesting anymore its an entertaining murder mystery with no real development at all. I was really disappointed overall.",Murder on the Orient Express
222,WooderIce64,Solid Adaptation,8,16 January 2019,"Agatha Christie is widely considered one of the best mystery writers of all time, and Murder on the Orient Express is widely considered one of her best works, so it's a perfect combination for a good movie. This is, of course, not the first time this novel was adapted for the big screen, and the original 1973 version is a classic. This version doesn't do much to add to the story, but it still succeeds. Here, the best parts are the acting, with an A-list cast, and the cinematography. The cast includes the likes of Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Willem Defoe, among many others. Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of Hercule Poirot was enjoyable to watch and loyal to his character in the book. And the moustache. That alone deserved the Oscar for ""Best Makeup and Hairstyling."" The costume design was fantastic, and all the characters, despite being familiar faces, look great in their period clothes. The set design was equally good, with the train itself looking classy and elegant. The whole look of the train and the people on board brings the viewers back to the 1910s, to an age of transcontinental train travel.The movie does have its faults, however. It is a two-hour movie, so it can't be as in-depth as the book, but it's stupid how fast Poirot figured out the connection between Ratchet and the Armstrong case. And, as stated earlier, it doesn't really do much to add to the story. I don't have a problem with that personally, but some may consider that a detracting element. And, of course, it's not exactly like the book. While it would be nice if the movie were completely true to the book, nothing particularly egregious happens in this version. Even still, this is a very solid movie, and a great adaptation, especially for the faithful portrayal of Poirot.One thing that must be said; Murder on the Orient Express is notable for its plot twist. If you haven't read the book and don't know what happens and how it ends, go read the book. The book is much better than any film adaptation, and the ending is all the better. In this version, the only changes to the ending are how it goes down. Poirot tells his findings outside the train. Either way, don't find out the ending by watching this version.",Murder on the Orient Express
223,grafxman,Excellent!,10,2 May 2018,"It is excellent however the very best one of all the productions is without doubt David Suchet's Poirot and I've seen all the versions. While Michele Pfeiffer gives the bravura performance here I'm afraid she's no match for Jessica Chastain in the Suchet's version. Johnny Depp does an adequate job as the bad guy however Toby Jones does a far, far better job in Suchet's version. Here's a brief quote from these pages about Toby Jones: ""one of greatest stage and screen actors both in his native Great Britain and internationally"". All in all the Suchet version of Murder on the Orient Express is substantially better in the acting department than this version. In the Suchet version the tension is held right up to the very end. You just don't how everything will pan out in the Suchet version until the last minute or two.

The Agatha Christie story, which is already a bit old-fashioned, is not getting any better by the hand of Kenneth Branagh. He doesn't manage to keep Michelle Pfeiffer from overacting, he doesn't get a bit of esprit out of a rather bored Judi Dench and finally he doesn't get a bit of any of the actors who all seem tired of fighting the dull dialogue. Only Penelope Cruz brings a modern way of acting to her character which, like all the others, is rather limited to a few sentences only.

227,eparazak,Meh.,5,23 November 2017,"Murder on the Orient Express is a film that is based on the book of the same name and a remake of the version made in the 70s directed by Sidney Lumet. The movie follows a very talented and skilled detective named Hercule Poirot who happens to take a trip on the Orient Express. The ride was all fine and good until the train gets stopped and the fact that someone was murdered on the trip. Now it is up to Poirot to uncover the mystery of the murder.Now I have not read the book nor have I watched the original movie. With that being said, I found this movie to be quite a mixed bag. As for the aspects that I think the movie did a good job on, I thought the cinematography, for one, was great. In terms of the movie's look, it was a very well shot movie that used great angles. I also found the acting to be pretty good. Barangh does a great job at his role as Poirot and so do many of the other actors in their roles such as such as Odom and Ridley.My big issue with the movie, however, has to do with the general story of the film. The overall story managed to feel too slow. To put this in perspective, I found the first act to be too long which to me felt like a sign of a slow movie. Don't get me wrong, we need calm moments in films, but the pacing just felt too slow during multiple occasions which just left me bored with the films.5/10",Murder on the Orient Express

Modern films do have some highlights but sadly none of them were in this film. Good drama is replaced with cheesy humour , a few of the jokes aren't terrible, but nonetheless the film is saturated with a humour that belies the the seriousness of the plot, detracting from the story. Characters which were originally intense and interesting now come off as melodramatic and buffoonish, not to mention there are obvious modern agendas forced into a story set decades before anyone would have believed in them",Murder on the Orient Express

I'm not saying Beethoven is bad music because an argument could be made that it is the best music ever composed. It's just that it isn't the music of today. Well, the version of Murder On the Orient Express is like that. It looks very good and the acting is tops, it's just a slow, unexciting movie. Today's audiences need to actually SEE the murder (if not the murderer) and watch the blood flow.
When the TV show Murder She Wrote went off the air it wasn't because it didn't have ample viewship. It was because those who tuned in were older and therefore not as susceptible to advertising.

230,VintageSoul56,You Just Cannot Beat the 1974 Version,3,12 November 2017,"The way this version was handled was heavy handed and dark. Not that murder shouldn't be just that, but the 1974 was handled with more of a lightness and the script just breezed along. This version just was so long, too wordy and had many unnecessary scenes, especially in the beginning of the movie (however, I did like the Middle Eastern music playing in the background of part of the beginning). I did like the camera work even though a lot of it was CG. I didn't care for the script delving into Poirot's past. I've always thought that he should remain a sort of enigma. Let's face it, you can't beat the star power of the 1974 version. I only knew six members of this cast. It's good that the younger cast is getting a chance to be in something like this for the experience, but all of them were mediocre. This also included the well known cast and I love Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, but they weren't given much to work with. The only stand out was Derek Jacobi with his (I think English Midlands accent). He was believable in his part.I think that Kenneth Branaugh is trying to make a comeback of sorts. He was the darling, the new Lawrence Olivier of the 1990's. I personally think that his time came and went. Please, Mr. Branaugh, don't make a re-make of ""Death on the Nile"". Leave that one to Peter Ustinov and you should have left this one to Albert Finney. If you do decide that you absolutely need to make or re-make any of the Poirot's, lose the major mustache and the heavy Belgian accent. I could barely understand what you were saying. Mr. Finney, Mr. Ustinov and Mr. Suchet did not need to lay their accents on thick. A person could actually understand what they were saying. In other words, please try your hand at something else for your film comeback. This wasn't it.I'm giving it a 3 because of the camera work. I did stay till the end of the credits because I thought that I recognized the voice singing the end song and I wanted to see if I was right. It was who I thought that it was.

The atmosphere even thickened some once he got on the train and you begin to see each of the characters interact with each other, but once the murder happens, that I when I feel the movies starts going down hill. They then throw in some racism ""they might find him guilty because of the color of his skin"" and feminism with one woman saying ""I know I am just a woman"" when she is giving the inspector some information. This is part of the reason that movies made in this day and age are 99% bad movies. They always have to ""empower"" women or point out racism against blacks. It's tiring and why I don't go to the movies anymore. I mean seriously, why would I want to pay to watch a movie that is going to tell me how racist my race once was and how women were considered lesser once? I will admit, this movie only touched on those two touchy subjects, which is why I gave this movie a 6 and not a 1, but it is ridiculous how 90% of the movies made now have racism and feminism in them. Moving on beyond that, I did enjoy the movie, but I knew who the killer was half way through the movie.

233,StregaAsuka,Too Much Ado about Nothing on the Orient Express,6,3 December 2017,"If you haven't read the original novel nor have watched the 1974 movie, you will like the movie. But if you are an Agatha Christie's fan or have done one of both before mentioned, there is a high chance that you won't like the movie (as that is my case).This movies highly differs form the original source material. Here we are presented with Poirot solving another case before embarking on the Orient Express. Then we are presented the characters in a very rushed way and finally the crime happens and the action begins. Yes, there is action. And the question we are all asking ourselves is: Since when Poirot and action are on the same page? Since now, apparently. Instead of following the path that the previous (and brilliant) installment did, which is: there is a murder, then we spend the whole movie solving it following Poirot inquisition; here there is too many adding that don't add anything to the story: chases, going out of the train, going back in, questioning this one, questioning the other one, and worst of all: and indecisive and lovesick Poirot. And I can only ask: why!? Why!!!?Then we have the whole cast. It is clear here that they wanted to do as in the old movie, bring a huge international known cast (more or less) and make a masterpiece. Sorry, but nope. Having many movie stars doesn't mean having a good movie, and here we have the perfect case. Personally, none of the cast members gives a good performance of their characters. which is normal, seeing as they changed tha characters and made them less interesting than in the novel.Finally, there is the story. The character introduction is a bit of a mess up, pointing out things about the characters that are irrelevant and adding more things than necessary. Moreover, the whole movie too much Americanized, it doesn't have the tension or the interest that an Agatha Christie work would have: too much action, too many unnecessary kind of cliffhangers and the way of solving the mystery too rushed and too dramatic. Again, unnecessary.The movie will be a unforgettable one with the time.

Kenneth Branagh does a good job playing the famous detective but if you are used to David Suchet's Poirot, better prepare yourselves to see something different here.The film itself is very well made, the photography is beautiful, as well as the costumes, all the acting stars do not disappoint and the story is nicely presented. When closing credits start rolling it says ""Based upon the novel by Agatha Christie"" and I think it is important to keep that in mind. It is simply a version of the story and the detective imagined by the director and the writer of this film so not every single detail from the novel is followed.

Back then, the stroy was plausible, and the characters were interesting and the plot males sense. In the 2017 version, I was expecting to see the same characters, but unfortunately some were simply replaced in prder to fill some affirmative action quota I imagine.The historical innacuracies are immense, for example the fact that you had black and white interracial couple on the train, and the black man was a ""respectable"" doctor who was some sort of soldier before. The strory doesn't fit, since in order to go to medical school (which was way more elitist back then), you needed years on prep school or private tutoring. Besides, there were black doctors in the US, bit they were part of an elite, and attended the Historical Black colleges and Universities. Talking about affirmative atcion in tye movie, in the end we see a very dark skinned black soldier posing as Yugoslavian, a nation so intolerant that they were killing their own neighbours because of a different accent (most recently in the 90s, especially Bosnia).Then, we had a Hungarian Prince married to a Jewess girl, when in nobility, we know that interreligious weddings are gery often forbidden (in the UK, there are rules against an Anglican marrying a Catholic for example). That didn't happened then, and even nowadays there ar no incidents of interfaith families in the high nobility (by the room he got, we see the prince was a hot shot).Then there are the German bashing moment that every Hollywood movie insist when in the year 1934, the country was still a democracy, and the references to ""the war"" are annoyingly every minute, when Agatha Christie's books deal mostly with the upper classes, who are not involved in conflicts.Again, the director includes some token characters: a mexican chauffer, a german assistant, and a Russian countess, who were almost absent from the plot, and could be better used. There are action scenes that are totally unnecessary.

238,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,"A decent, but forgettable Sunday afternoon flick",7,3 December 2017,"Murder on the Orient express is a forgettable Sunday afternoon flick. There is nothing special about it, there are no stellar and breathtaking performances, there are no nerve wrecking scenes or spectacular music. This is a movie I would recommend if nothing else is on the TV (and I do believe that was the intention).Two things must be distinguished from one another. The first is the directing and acting, and the other the story. The first is spectacular, the other is a cliché to the point of non belief.Branagh's direction is surgically precise and to almost every point flawless. His effort to make the movie look and feel like a novel was achieved as one can actually see where some chapters end and others begin. He has no unnecessary prolonging of scenes or dialogue, the execution is ""to the point,"" bright and concise. The viewer is never bored or tired as Branagh switches from scene to scene, depicting character after character, and the background changes simultaneously as the characters and scenes. There are also interesting camera angels and long one-shot scenes that make the movie visually very interesting. But there is much more to a movie than just technical and directorial precision.The actors had a really ungrateful job. Most of them had just a scene or two in which the were expected to execute their roles and lines to utmost perfection because no second chances were given. That does explain the all star cast consisting of Dench, Depp, Dafoe, Pfeiffer, Cruz, Jacobi, Gad etc. All of them did their jobs respectively but most of their performances lacked heart and or soul (with the exception of Gad who was really quite good at his role and Pfeiffer who had a little more to say than the rest of the cast). The most disappointing were Cruz (whose performance was way over the top) and Odom Jr. (who was not fit for the role at all). Most of the discussions were pointed at the performance of Branagh himself. His take on the legendary Poirot was, different than what we are used to. NO comparison will or should be made. All of the actors who portrayed Poirot had their views and ways they approached the character, and so did Branagh. As his directing, his acting is flawless, precise and his ability to switch emotions and portray different thoughts just with an eyebrow or gaze is amazing, not to say a bit disturbing. Even though he is not what we are used to as Poirot, he really did an amazing job and stands out among all the other brilliant actors with which he worked with on this movie.The story is, another problem. Considering that the novel was written about 80 years ago, the standard that we are used to in murder mystery thrillers today is far beyond what we are served here. It is unfair to criticize the screenplay when the source material hasn't aged well, and if one pays close attention to all of the clues, at a certain point somewhere at the middle/last third of the movie it is really not that difficult to put all the pieces together. The conclusion lacks a climax because the viewers are still under the impression of what we today consider cliché, that the grand reveal becomes anticlimactic. And therein lies the greatest problem. No emotions, no thrills, no WOW factor. Just a bland, expected conclusion that leaves one a bit disappointed. Again, that says more about the aged novel and not the screenplay.All in all, entertaining and suitable for more than one viewing, but unfortunately forgettable. I cannot shake the feeling that not much more than that was the general idea of the movie.",Murder on the Orient Express
239,2001ASOfan,A Classic Story Derailed,2,11 November 2017,"Fans of Agatha Christie be warned: I've loved her books since I was a kid, ravenously snatching them from the library shelves often, and I couldn't wait to see this director and cast have a shot at making Christmas 2017 joyous by reigniting the Orient Express and again plunging it into the gorgeous remote scenery of its locale, filled with interesting characters and a mysterious middle-of-the-night murder. The train itself and the scenery are about all there is to see in this remake, and the film is easily one of the biggest disappointments of the season (and year). There are times in this film where I could swear the cast is reading their lines off teleprompters--it's that lifeless. Filmmaking 101 says when you make a film version of a book you want to open up the imagination of viewers with visuals that illustrate the words rather than just having characters read the words rote and lifelessly on-screen in static exposition. Kenneth Branagh, as both director and star, lets us down completely, and all of these fine actors are completely wasted, as is Christie's glorious and vivid story.

243,freemanpatrick7,"Well, it's not the same old crap",7,11 November 2017,"Was this remake necessary? Define ""necessary"". I saw the Albert Finney/Sydney Lumet version when it was released in 1974. I was only 11 years old when it first came out so I don't remember much of how it affected me. But in the many years since then I have become a fan of Agatha Christie and have seen it again and again, as well as other adaptations. I've always thought that Finney's interpretation of Poirot was a bit over the top. Still it was never as bad as Peter Ustinov's. Fortunately I never saw Alfred Molina's version. And then came David Suchet, who, in my opinion, nails the role perfectly. Any remake is naturally going to be compared, favorably or unfavorably, to its predecessors. In my opinion Branagh's attempt fell below Suchet but above all others. Far above. Any time the director is the star you run the risk of over indulgences and this film suffers some of that. Few actors, if any, can resist the temptation to place the value of their own egos above that of the picture as a whole. Which is not to say that Branagh is a bad actor or a bad director. Nothing could be further from the truth. I just didn't feel like he performed either job brilliantly in this picture. It might be that I'm making the mistake of over comparison to the Suchet version. And taken on its own merits alone this picture is decent, if not great. The acting is superb. The photography is beautiful. I couldn't help being overwhelmed by the abundance of CGI but whattayagonnado? It's everywhere these days. The opening scene and the reveal scene at the end differ greatly from the source material. It doesn't hurt the story at all, it's just different. And I can't think of any reason to have done them this way except just to be different. But all in all it was an enjoyable film, exactly what I was hoping for, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is tired of the same old crap that Hollywood has been churning out over the past few years.",Murder on the Orient Express

Too much added political correctness which made a boring adaptation just that much more boring.,2,13 November 2017,"Im not sure if they were trying to make it modern, or what they were doing, but all they managed to do was put me to sleep. The re writing was just vile. It completely contradicts the reality of the 1930's. No one would have gone to a black doctor then, not even if he had been in the war, and had been sponsored by someone. It was all about current issues. The word ""race"" was said over 20 times until I lost count. I just got tired of them talking about segregation laws, and whatever else. Not that this isn't a worthwhile subject, but it simply does not belong in a Agatha Christie mystery at all. Then they went out of their way to go after sexism, making sure Penelope Cruz's character was ""trained to fight"" which is also absurd given the time period, and generally absurd given that she is tiny, and a reasonably healthy fifteen year old boy could probably win a fight with her. Agatha Chritie didn't write Buffy. The most likeble character was Ratchett himself, which is a big problem, and the opposite of what Christie wrote. I can't think of a worse adaptation of this work, and I have seen many. Just terrible.",Murder on the Orient Express
245,graves-scott,"So, was everyone guilty in the book too?",1,1 March 2018,Oops. That might be a spoiler. To be fair my wife often watches movies I can't stand. This was no exception. I had zero expectations when she dug this up on a premium channel and put it on. Since I wasn't wearing my glasses I thought we were watching a previously unwatched episode of Monk where he has a dream he is an annoying French detective with the same basket of issues. Imagine my shock when she told me it was the new Murder on the Orient Express. Still with no expectations I soldiered on. Roughly an hour in we all announced that it must have been all of them who offed the guy. It took the master defective another hour to figure it out. I seem to recall Johnny Depp saying around 2016 0r 2017 that those who didn't vote for his preferred candidate for president wouldn't appreciate any of his movies or something in that tone. Maybe that's why I couldn't stand it. I had no idea he was in it until reading the IMDB page for the movie and had I known I wouldn't have bothered since I am the kind of person who isn't going to like any of his movies.,Murder on the Orient Express
246,mirkobozic,Semi-successful but visually impressive.,6,11 November 2017,"When I first heard of this new adaptation, there were two things that came up to me: why do we need an another take on the world's most famous murder case after two successful adaptations, and why in god's name Branagh wants to put himself in the shoes of David Suchet, THE Poirot incarnation in most people's minds. It's a losing battle almost by default, like comparing the bland Kate Middleton to the glamorous superstar that was Lady Diana. But anyway, I decided to give the poor guy a chance to impress me and maybe,do a decent job. This proved to be a false hope from the moment I was confronted with that monstrosity right in the middle of his face, which was so distracting that you couldn't concentrate on the talking whenever his face was in focus, which is quite often. Here, he's trying to solve a murder case in a compartment of the luxurious transcontinental train Orient Express, and each and every one of the title characters seem to have a motif for murder.There are-to be fair-a couple of novelties Branagh brought to the character and the film itself- his version of Poirot (while equally impeccably dressed), has a sense of humour that Suchet was lacking, which occasionally borders on slapstick. The opening plot is completely irrelevant for the main story save for the fact that it was obviously used merely as an excuse to enchant us with Poirot's little petty obsessions and his little gray zellz. Also, in the breakfast scenes we can see Branagh visibly enjoying the role which reassures the viewer that this movie just might be worth the while. The new Poirot is also much more romantic than his predecessor and not afraid to show it (if talking to a photo qualifies as affection). Ultimately, the new sleuth is in a much better shape and doesn't need Hastings to chase a suspect down a dangerously fragile railway bridge. But. Branagh (doing double-duty both as the main character and director) assembled a whole galaxy of superstars to embody the suspects (in the former version, only Jessica Chastain was a known name). What works great on paper proved tricky on film, since there are too many suspects for the director to give each one enough screen time to seduce us with their personalities. Instead, we get just a taste of the immense talent with which the famous train is loaded, and many act merely as prototypes instead as full-fledged characters. While Michelle Pfeiffer uses every opportunity to shine as the flirtatious Mrs Hubbard, someone as charismatic as Judi Dench is reduced to a grumpy princess Dragomiroff who isn't doing a lot of talking but alas, a lot of dog-fondling. This might just be the single biggest issue of this reiteration of Agatha Christie's novel: all those A-list actors are underemployed in the whole scheme of the script. Johnny Depp, of course, plays the shady victim, and Penelope Cruz doesn't really impress as Pilar Estravados, a character borrowed from ""Hercule Poirot's Christmas"". There are some factual misinterpretations: Vinkovci, in Yugoslavia, where the murder takes place, is in the continental part of the country which happens to be as flat as a chess board, and the scenery in the movie rather resembles the Alps. Other than that, the redeeming qualities of the whole undertaking are the gloriously executed production design: the glamorous Art Deco interiors, the stylish costumes and the breathtaking panoramic vistas of the surrounding scenery. Details from the train are the icing on this semi-successful cake: the table settings, the white tablecloths and decorative lights, the lavish armchairs and the delicious desserts delivered by waiters in white suits. If there's one thing you'll take away from all this, no matter if you liked the film or not, it will be the urge to take a train ride to anywhere at the earliest opportunity. And that might be a success in itself.",Murder on the Orient Express
247,ranblackman,"Not too good, I do prefer the original.",6,25 April 2019,"This film, from renowned actor\director Kenneth Branagh, is sorta let down for many reasons. First, it makes far too many unnecessary changes. The ending, in my opinion, was done so much better in Lumet's original, it's much more subtle. While the ending here has pretty much the same meaning, it's a little overdone and melodramatic. The directing as well I feel is a bit on the showy side, lots of weird angles that don't seem to serve any sort of a creative purpose, other than to show off how clever the cameramen can frame scenery.Speaking of the scenery, that's where I will lead into my positives. This film is gorgeous, the winter months, the sense of isolation, even the way the trial is filmed in these are damn good, as are some of the cities and locations we visit at the beginning. The acting as well is across the board impressive. We have to likes Of Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Jonny Depp, Penelope Cruz, and even Josh Gadd, an actor most known for his more comedic roles, is even good here. The weakest length is, unfortunately, our leading man, his accent was kind of overdone to me, he has his moments, and I would not call him bad, but that was a distraction.All in all, this film really did not need to be made. The only reason I can think off is maybe Branagh wanted to make a closer adaptation of the book by Agatha Christie, which is a sound reason to do a film like this, however, I've heard it's not that at all, (I kind of have to trust other readers here, as I have not read it myself, for the time being). That's kind of the biggest problem with it. It has its good qualities and is perfectly watchable, but it fails to have any sort of a reason to exist.

249,shadow_blade-89459,Modern Day Clue,7,5 March 2018,"""Murder on the Orient Express"" (2017) is a crime drama directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh as Hercule Poirot, the best detective in the world, as he attempts to solve a murder he was unknowingly thrust into on the Orient Express. Detective Poirot is a last-minute addition to the train as he has been summoned to another case when Edward Ratchett, played by Johnny Depp, is murdered. The film is set in the 1930s and the script is superb for the era coupled with wonderful acting from an all-star cast. Though this film didn't invoke any feelings for me, I was highly entertained and thoroughly intrigued. The film reminded me of the board game Clue, which I loved as a child. The surprise ending offered by the director, Kenneth Branagh, was well concealed through the film. He effectively keeps the viewer on the verge of figuring it out only to pull the rug out from under you. The production value of this film is immaculate. It is difficult to spot anything in this film that doesn't belong in the 1930s and everything looks authentic. However, with a budget of an estimated 55M, it would be hard pressed to not appear as real as possible. With a gross of over 100M, the film was well able to make its investment back, but it comes as a surprise it hasn't made more. This is a great film that can offer a certain level of nostalgia for lovers of the game Clue.",Murder on the Orient Express

Just read the whole list with illogical mistakes, geographical and historical mistakes! The geographical is probably the biggest insult! Yes, if you are from the USA or Asia or didn't have geography in school yet, this movie could be believeable. But any European person should know, that the only place with such an alpine senery, with such high mountains and snow in this part of Europe are acutally the ALPS! And where did the train get stuck? Between Vinkovci and Brod, in the middle of good old Yugoslavia- in the middle of the flatlands! Are you kidding me? If the last station would be Vienna, it could have maybe be acceptable.. but this? And also the whole PC Holliwood BS. Ok, let's say that there was this one black doctor in 1930s England- but black armee officers in 1930s Yugoslavia?? Dude, there are probably not even 10 black armee or police officers in todays Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia together..and not to say in the 1930s! This is not modern day USA, this is not even 1930s USA- it's 1930s Europe and if you like it or not- Europe was veeeery white in the 1930s. But, it's not enough to make the black guy a doctor (nothing against it), but they have to throw in a couple of speeches about racism and stuff like that. Who cares?! It's an Agatha Christie crime novel remake? It's not about racism, it's not about politicall correctness, it's not about some moral preaching. It's about crime! I hoped also, that we, as the audience, would be dragged into the story and could guess who the murder is and then be surprised about it! But no! Mr. Poirot just comes up with some clues and knowledge about all the characters out of thin air! He just knows it!

I think those who are not familiar with Agatha Christie, Poirot, or the story may very well like this movie.I, on the other hand, was massively disappointed, especially by Branagh as a sort of English upper-class colonel with a stick-on cavalry moustache and by the needless addition of an introductory scene at the Wailing Wall. But I am prejudiced. I read the 1934 novel decades ago and again more recently. I liked the 1974 star-studded version with Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, and Michael York—despite the fact that Albert Finney was a very poor version of Christie's Hercule Poirot.

His phony French accent is utterly unintelligible. Far better to have a French actor trying to speak English in a way that allows people who speak English natively to understand him than to have an Irish actor trying to speak his native language with a foreign accent. And most of the other actors similarly speak unintelligibly, the fault for which is also Branagh's, because he is the director, and it is the director's job to make the actors speak intelligibly.",Murder on the Orient Express

Branagh is well know for adapting English literature classics into movies and I think he is really great at that.The movie tells us the story of Hercules Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) who has to find out who is the murder that has killed a person inside the Orient Express. The story keeps you interested, its full of tension, suspense and even drama, and it surprises you at the end in a way I couldn't see coming (I won't spoil it).The cast is what you could call a Dream Team of the Actuation. You have Kenneth Branagh, Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Josh Gad, Willem Dafoe, etc. All of them are great in their roles. They all have a little part in the story, but they all have little moments to shine (well, apart from Branagh that takes the main role).As a director, Branagh gives us some really interesting shots that are really beautiful to look at, even they were created in a studio. He creates longs shots where he likes to show is big ensemble cast by long panoramic of the train windows or inside the train. He is a usual collaborator with composer Patrick Doyle, who here creates a really beautiful score for the moments where it's needed, but also creates some really tense tracks that help build the tension a lot.I would recommend you this mainly because it does not happen that much that we have a cast as wonderful as this all together in the same screen and also because it's a really interesting and entertaining movie, a little bit different of all of the modern action blockbusters were are getting again and again.",Murder on the Orient Express

264,jvdesuit1,To make a movie you have to understand the character of Poirot: Branagh didn't.,1,2 December 2019,"I have not seen the movie and although Branagh is a famous actor without any possible discussion, by reading the 2 quotes from the dialog here, it shows that he did not understand the character of Poirot and what Agatha Christie really wanted to say thru this great novel.
If I dont mistake Christie did not like Poirot. So she personified in him a kind of macho, misogynist man. He's very proud of his skills as a detective and thinks he will never fail to bring the culprit to his judges. He's also more or less a true catholic. The first error which appears on the first quote is to think that Poirot will listen to his heart. He listens to what is right or wrong and wont fail to do so in all the novels the author wrote; it is an error to make of Poirot another Miss Marple.
The second error is to believe that Poirot will justify himself like the second quote tends to show. He is too proud and his inner debate is for himself and no one else. He will never justify his actions before anyone.
Those two traits of character were superbly shown in the David Suchet's impersonation of Poirot in the television series. There was something of that too in Sydney Lumett's movie although the movie tends more to be a spectacular super production with an extraordinary cast difficult to equal today.Even the music of the film was spectacular with it's theme in the rhythm of waltz punctuating the sound of the locomotive and the rails, and somehow referring to the decadence of the period the late thirties and the horrors impending later.
The television adaptation has a great cast but not really movie stars like Widmark,Finney,Cassel, Bacall and others in the movie.
In the television production Poirot gives us the date of the action: 1936. The book was published in 1934 and make reference to the Lingbergh kidnap case of 1932. But may be that already Christie had some doubts about the political events going on after Hitler's and the Nazis coming to power in 1933. Justice is more and more torn to pieces by those monsters. This revolts Poirot. The ending of the television production is by far in accordance with the character and the way Christie judged Poirot. Poirot for the only time in his life has lost his case in his eyes.",Murder on the Orient Express

If you go back to it afterward, you may find a new tidbit here or there, but the original thrill is gone.Such is the case with the latest adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel.This is a beautiful film to look at, as are many modern films, and it is fun to immerse into the period of the 1930s, especially the details of the crime (which revolve around a case that is based on the real- life murder of Charles Lindbergh's baby in 1932), and the mystique of the Orient Express, for as one character muses, how fascinating it is to see a group of people with nothing in common but the shared need to go from one place to another, forced together, never to see each other again.The characters, too, are interesting portraits of the many types of personas familiar to the era, with the most stereotyped personified in director Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of detective Hercules Poirot. Like the critically acclaimed 1974 adaptation of Christie's novel, this film assembles an all-star cast to fill the roles of murder suspects, including Johnny Depp, Daisy Ridley, Judy Dench, Josh Gad, Willem Dafoe, and more.The film expertly weaves the tapestry of the crime and the many, many red herrings that are left by the murderer, as well as Poirot's attempts to establish a motive to explain the crime. At each turn he finds links, but something eludes him until the grand reveal at the end.However, it's that grand reveal where the film can feel a bit lackluster, especially if one already knows how the story ends, for as best as I can tell, this film does not add an new twists or surprises to the original Christie story, and when the reveal finally happens, not only does it feel somewhat underwhelming because it seemed perfectly obvious all along, but the motivations is played without a sufficient amount of weight.That's not to say that the reveal wouldn't be powerful to someone unfamiliar with the particulars of the story, but for someone who is, this film's replay value is essentially nil.However, this film's brilliant performances and dry wit throughout makes this film enjoyable for anyone with a taste for mystery and wonderful theater, for this film feels more like a traditional play than a film, and it's the better for it.",Murder on the Orient Express
270,fletcherc21,"Fans of Poirot steer clear, for there is no Poirot here",6,10 November 2017,"This movie was clearly made for a modern audience with no familiarity with Agatha Christie's work. Branagh's portrayal of the legendary Belgian detective Hercule Poirot bares only a passing resemblance to the source material with an inconsistent accent, the wrong mustache, and only some of his iconic quirks and mannerisms. That being said, it is a decent mystery that follows the plot of the story pretty well and it would probably be enjoyable to people seeing the story for the first time and having no preconceived notions of what Poirot should be.A strong supporting cast featuring Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, and many other familiar faces performs well. However, no one stands out in the way Ingrid Bergman did in the 1974 adaptation or Jessica Chastain in the 2010 version.There were also several semi-action moments that were incredibly out of character for Poirot, yet provided no actual excitement to justify the sudden stylistic change.

Before i give detailed feedback, I must say that the camera work in this movie is astounding.

I was quite disappointed with performances from Johnny Depp and Willem Dafoe. I was incredibly impressed by Josh Gad, who really showed how flexible he is as an actor.

276,pranderson063095,"Refreshing Remake of Poirot, Finally",8,7 December 2017,"First I do question those who are panning this movie so very much. It is hardly as bad as their opinions make it sound. Also, the complaint or question of why yet another ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a bit of a reach. That this viewer has seen, this is the second filmed for the big screen (1974 & 2017). Two television movies have been made (2001 & 2010). In our opinion one of the made for TV versions (with David Suchet) is the only TV one that is respectable as it fit very well in the long- running Poirot series for TV with Suchet. In 1974 Albert Finney filled the role of Hercule Poirot and he along with Suchet, presented the character of Poirot as a near fancy man. Suchet certainly did Poirot for many viewers in our generation what Rathbone did for the Sherlock Holmes character. Albert Finney in the 1974 film may have set that tone as he did little to establish Poirot as anything different. That is the really refreshing thing about the 2017 film and Kenneth Branagh gave us a Poirot that has backbone and not so much silliness. Yet, he remained the refined character which we believe Agatha Christie originally created. Even his mustache had character instead of being some pastie glued on each day. Branagh is already a favorite out of his Wallender series in both English and Swedish. As an actor he has breadth and many faces. We found ourselves cheering his significant physical encounters and cannot imagine either Suchet, Finny or Peter Ustinov (in the 2001 TV version) engaging the other passengers/suspects as is seen in this recent film. Peter Ustinov on both the Nile film and the TV modernized version was almost embarrassing. Here, we see a respectable Belgium able to stand and hold his position. Granted the 1974 was cast with much more care and used significant quality actors across the board. This one petered out and is why it get an 8 rather than a 10 from this viewer. It is not difficult to see that one film really had a cast of quality heavies. Besides Albert Finney as Poirot there was also Martin Balsam, Richard Widmark, Sean Connery, Lauren Bacall, Anthony Perkins, John Gielgud, Michael York, Jacqueline Bisset, Vanessa Redgrave and Ingrid Bergman, who won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Greta Ohlsson. That made 10 out of 12.This version was lacking significantly in the cast of notables. the notables included Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penélope Cruz, Dame Judi Dench, and Willem Dafoe. Only 5 of 12. Even of these few, Pfeiffer and Cruz are not in the league of the previous list. This was a disappointment for this viewer and perhaps some of the reason others downgrade the movie.We even have to say Depp was totally miscast for this movie. The man just couldn't bring across the meanness necessary to be one deserving of what happened.Over all the story is told well in spite of name and ethnic changes that had to fit the actors cast for the parts. Always pressed to have diversity, stories are rewritten and original threads dismissed in order to achieve that diversity. Original intent and custom of the era are cast aside for the sake of the ever present need to be ""PC"". And while the cast suffered some weaknesses the main character HP, the man with the little gray cells was much better and more on the mark of how the original story created him to be. And if they are going to change names and ethnic origins for the story's characters then we can indeed say, ""Love That mustache.""

279,neobateman,A competently made remake that no one asked for.,6,11 November 2017,"I have not been too kind on Hollywood remakes. Generally they take a film that was very successful and want to 'recreate it' for younger audiences, hoping that it would make even more money. However often these films are the remakes of brilliant originals and whilst these remakes can be very entertaining, they are still miles away from the quality of the original. Murder on the Orient Express is such a film. It has an amazing cast (like the original) which consists of great names such as Kenneth Branagh, Willem Dafoe, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz and Josh Gad. All of these actors give their everything, in particular Branagh who is amazing as the eccentric Hercule Poirot. He manages to recreate the character but also keep the traits that made him so memorable when the likes such as Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov played them. However the rest of the characterizations felt dull, I was uninterested in them plus I saw the original and knew how it ended. So even in that category the film failed to surprise me. What made the original film so good was that when Poirot was investigating it felt like that he was investigating real people. The characters were all flashed out well thanks to excellent writing. So when Poirot spots something odd, you as the viewer are ultimately challenged to re watch and check whether you can see what he sees. You were investigating with Poirot. In this adaptation the characters were so one dimensional that I honestly didn't care. I knew the ending of the original and so didn't care about the actual murder either. The film looks beautiful, it has awesome camera work and costume design. The actors do great and Branagh will no doubt catch Oscar buzz for his performance. I only recommend this film for audiences who have never read the Agatha Christie novel or seen the original film. This is because that way at least the murder remains interesting, if we know the conclusion the film loses much of this effect. The original had great characters that were three dimensional and felt real. There was re watch value, this film is a perfect Netflix watch. If you have never seen the original you will be entertained while it lasts but you are not encouraged to watch it again (at least I'm not).",Murder on the Orient Express

283,rbr-41299,A Slightly Different Tale,3,17 November 2017,"Fans of Agatha Christie are rightfully disappointed in Branagh's film because the screenplay changed so much as to make the film a mockery of the novel. I'm surprised the Christie estate supported it. Comparisons are naturally being made with the 1974 Lumet film which closely followed the novel and was a much superior production to this one. There are only a few positives in Branagh's film. The cinematography is outstanding and the set design demonstrated attention to detail. Branagh made the train car interiors wider than actual to accommodate camera angles, a major challenge to the 1974 production which used actual train cars. Also, the much-maligned mustache is closer to the Poirot of the novels than the Suchet- mustache. The actors did the best they could with a bad script, although I think Ridley with her quirky grin was miscast as Miss Debenham, and Depp's portrayal of Ratchett was weird.Branagh's film makes many changes to the novel. The film opens in Jerusalem with Poirot stepping in a pile of manure (why?) and then shifts to a scene in front of the wailing wall. Poirot has a Muslim imam, a Jewish rabbi and a Catholic priest standing in front of the wailing wall, giving the appearance of an acted out joke. Maybe the screenwriter was trying to inject humor into a serious story, but in my view made Poirot look silly and showed a lack of sensitivity to the holiest site in Judaism. The producer and director deserve to be censured by the Israeli government.The Arbuthnot character is a black doctor rather than a British Colonel. Perhaps Branagh wanted to preempt criticism from the PC crowd as experienced by the film ""Dunkirk"" for not including black soldiers in the British Army. But, the PC crowd is not concerned about accuracy. Then tension was added to the story with other elements not in the book: the train being stopped on a trestle over a gorge, omitting Dr. Constantine, Arbuthnot examining the body of Ratchett and giving a medical opinion, Mrs. Hubbard being stabbed, Poirot chasing McQueen onto the trestle, Poirot being shot, and Poirot offering Mrs. Hubbard to shoot him since he couldn't live with the knowledge of accommodating murderers.The final summing up of the case takes place outdoors rather than in the dining car as in the book. Branagh no doubt wanted to avoid the difficulties encountered in the making of the 1974 film. In that film Albert Finney as Poirot had to repeat the dining car summation multiple times in order to get the camera shots of the various characters that Poirot was addressing.Branagh's film (as well as the 2010 made-for-TV movie starring David Suchet), has Poirot struggling on the horns of a dilemma: bring charges against the 12 people who conspired to kill Ratchett, or say nothing and become an accessory to murder after the fact. Both Suchet and Branagh want Poirot to act as judge and declare the conspirators morally wrong, which Christie does not do.In the novel Poirot accurately deduces those responsible for Ratchett's death, but remains neutral. He proposes two solutions to the crime, one in which the crime was committed by an outside assassin and the other in which twelve persons on the train killed Ratchett. He leaves it to the owner of the railroad to decide what to tell the authorities. The owner with agreement by Dr. Constantine decide on the assassin. Christie essentially leaves the moral dilemma to the reader.Liberal film-makers, of course, don't believe murderers should die for their crimes and confuse justice with revenge. In my view the actions of the passengers to kill Ratchett was justifiable homicide. Ratchett was a serial murderer who had not been held to account for any of his crimes. Christie's choice of 12 victims meting out justice is actually based on the Bible since God decreed that those whose testimony condemned a man were to participate in his execution (Deuteronomy 13:9; 17:7).As an adaptation of Christie, I give the film a ""3."" If the novel did not exist, I would give the film a ""6.""

I read that Sir Kenneth Branagh wanted to do a fresh version with a different take so he deliberately did not view the 1974 film. His Poirot is a bit sweeter and more sentimental than the one written for, and acted by, Finney. However, I find him very convincing! There are touches of humor, especially in the first half of the film. The second half is more serious as Poirot realizes he must solve the crime and has limited time to do so. The cast was excellent, and the scenery whether real or CGI was beautiful. The opulence and grandeur of this kind of train travel in the 1930s came across vividly. If anything, these characters are a bit more touching, a bit less campy and ""over the top"" than the characters in Lumet's film. That's not a bad thing, it is just a different approach. Even at the end, Poirot displays a little unintentional humor because with his perfectionism, he cannot help himself. It is a very enjoyable film, and Branagh is a fine actor, always.

However, remaking Poirot as a character does not work, not when the character is already so established - Branagh's Belgian detective is emotional, lacks cool, sulky and dull, i.e. he does not look in any way like Christie's Poirot. By way of comparison, Sherlock gives us a new Holmes too, but the classic and modern Sherlock still share some likeness to which audience can relate. More importantly, Sherlock retains logic in its storytelling, as opposed to Murder on the Orient Express, where Poirot's solution of the case seems heaped upon speculations. They might not have been speculations - as the book has all the clues - but this adaptation leaves out a lot of information essential for solving the case.

292,postmortem-books,Unnecessary remake.,2,5 November 2017,"I am loathe to put the boot in to any film but the barrage of publicity for this, plastered all over the BBC news and chat shows - Graham Norton and Andrew Marr interviewing the phalanx of ""stars"" in a suitable subservient way - has pushed this reviewer over the edge. It is a film that didn't need a remake since the original was perfectly acted and nuanced. Perhaps that is half the problem - I know the ""solution"" and therefore the denouement is no surprise- but there is something more deeply flawed with this movie. Firstly - that moustache. Ridiculous and in the end it becomes something that you stare at and wonder just why something so outrageously stupid would NOT get in the way of what words the actor is actually saying. You stop listening and just try and see where it is stuck on. Branagh stomps around the various scenes like Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia (even down to walking along the top of the snow-covered carriage as if he was king of the castle) and then addresses the suspects in a scene that is reminiscent of The Last Supper painting. Everywhere he goes everyone knows him. Absolutely everyone. The opening scenes in Jerusalem are unnecessary and only serve to raise Branagh/Poirot into God like status where the population of the city are happy to take his word and trample a suspect policeman to death. No jury, no trial, lynch mob rules. All of which seems to bother the guardian of justice not one jot.Cut to the train - at last. We hear that the train is full and that Poirot will have to share a cabin for at least one night. As we discover that there are just 12 passengers on the whole train I wondered what happened to all the other empty berths on the other carriages. Let's just pass over that one. We are now introduced to the various characters. I don't know how much these stars got paid for this movie but boy, apart from Michelle Pfeiffer, they don't have too many words to say. The main action is sitting around looking suspiciously at each other. Depp is mostly unintelligible evidenced by his recent performance on the Graham Norton show where he found it difficult to string two words together. It is only Branagh who has the dialogue - and he works it as hard as he can into some kind of Shakespearean dialogue. Judi Dench plays the part Wendy Hiller took in the 1974 film. I know Dench is supposed to be the public's ""favourite"" but Hiller's sneering haughtiness will remain one of the highlights of the earlier film long after this one is forgotten.In the novel and the 1974 film the train gets stuck in a drift. Here it is struck by an avalanche and teeters on a wooden viaduct. Ain't CGI wonderful? The engine is derailed but never fear he comes a gang of ten workers who will dig away the snow and pull a 100 ton engine back on to the tracks - with their bare hands. Marvellous.And the music score? Possibly the most disappointing part of the whole film when one considers the classic Richard Rodney Bennett score for the 1974 film. Patrick Doyle's offering is just insipid and uninspired. The closing credits roll with some vapid pop song burbling away in the background. Well, if you've never seen the 1974 film and you don't know the ending you may enjoy this but perhaps you should locate that earlier film and wait for this to end up on the £3 shelf at Tesco. It would appear, to judge by the final quip by Poirot in the film that Branagh is planning to redo Death on the Nile. God help us.",Murder on the Orient Express

294,kashidomar,"Agatha Christi's ""Murder on orient express "" Novel (10/10)......Kenneth Branagh's Movie 9/10",10,3 November 2017,We always do the same mistake when a movie is made following a best selling novel is that we compare the novel and the movie. But we must keep in mind that novel is always superior than movies in many aspect.So my earnest request to the audience please don't compare it with the novel. When you compare you will loose the momentum of the movie. Because it is an excellent movie...A pure crime thriller of pre modern era. It has suspense as well as buried past mystery of all the passenger's life. This made the detective process more complicated.The movie has many aspects to cheer about. It has a good portrait of some 18 th century look with all those etiquettes and manners. The movie is fully loaded with the part part story of different suspects that made it difficult for the audience to guess the final answer.As you know most central roles were done by excellent actors and actresses there is no complaint about the acting. All the acting was very much splendid. Only it can be said that they have done it a little heavy. The dialogues are sometimes a bit too much for the audiences to capture.Over all the movie is a little slow..Like the thriller movies of early 1960's or 70's . But it has many good things to offer. A group of excellent actors together with a fine plot and diffuse suspense has made it a good enjoyable movie. But as i said it is a bit slow and dialogue dependent movie some viewers may experience it as a boring time. i have to say you had better show some patience and you will find the gold. This is A movie that can shake you when you will watch it even for the second time..Imagine what will happen when you go for the first time??????,Murder on the Orient Express
295,GoldenBlunderbuss,Not a train wreck you might've feared but it does run out of steam midway through,6,25 July 2018,"One of the passengers on board the exquisite Orient Express is murdered, and only the legendary detective skills of Hercule Poirot can bring justice. Every face should be familiar as the phenomenal cast are put against Poirot's line of questioning.
The biggest draw to this film is undoubtedly the cast. Each member gets their chance to shine from relative newcomers like Daisy Ridley to seasoned professionals in the shape of Judi Dench and Derek Jacobi. Meanwhile, the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp, Willem Defoe, Josh Gad and of course Kenneth Branagh mean you're never wanting for talent on the screen - the sumptuous 1930s costumes and set decorations also mean there's always something interesting to look at.As characters are introduced across the opening 30 minutes, it's interesting viewing until one of their fellow travellers is brutally stabbed in a frenzied attack. It'll be lazy to simply say it runs out of steam or comes off the tracks once the titular murder is committed, but there's no other way to describe the middle portion of the film.One by one, Poirot interrogates the passengers and begins to piece together what happened on the night of the slaying, but it feels more like the actors are being paraded to do their bit to camera and then promptly leave, rarely to be seen again. That said, it's fun for the audience to play along since nothing is confirmed or denied until the final act when the suspects are confronted by the detective. Without wanting to spoil the end (as I'm sure there are people, like me, who don't know the outcome in the book), the pay-off is ultimately worth the wait and even a little clever.This Agatha Christie adaptation is sure to be the first of a series which will see her moustached detective (hell, is he moustached!) solving cases all over the world. Indeed, the closing scene shows that they're planning for the famed Belgian sluice to go to Egypt next. If what follows is anything like this initial helping, it will be a nice alternative to the samey Marvel mush.Best Quote: ""Some men have a good look. All they have to do is keep their mouth shut and they can take home any prize they want. Still the mouth opens.""",Murder on the Orient Express
296,orlando-somera,The only film I've seen recently that is way better than advertised,9,13 November 2017,"Kenneth Branagh has created one of the most unforgettable Hercule Poirots imaginable, far more impressive than the other film versions, in my opinion. It is a unique pleasure to spend time with this exacting, world weary man. And unlike some of the other critics, I admire the man's over- the-top mustache which is an ambitious, if crazy, work of peerless face art!About two-thirds of the way through, I finally remembered who did it, but this production is done so well, I didn't really care. Far more than the other renditions, this movie places you in the action very successfully on the Orient Express in a snow storm with an engaging group of people ranging from the always formidable Judi Dench to a sleazy Johnny Depp to a captivating Michelle Pfeiffer to an annoying Willem Dafoe, and much more. The whole thing made far more sense than the other versions.I think this film deserves multiple rewards and I highly recommend!",Murder on the Orient Express
297,mt-95256,"A solid whodunit thriller, but a mixed bag. Despite a few missed opportunities, Branagh leads a phenomenal all-star cast with some excellent performances",6,5 November 2017,"It's strange to think that over the last 10 years or so we've had two popular incarnations of world-famous detective Sherlock Holmes, but no real big incarnation of Christie's wonderful Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. Although the David Suchet series only ended in 2013, these episodes never reached the heights of popularity like we saw with Benedict Cumberbatch's or Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock. So it's about damn time something was done about it – so thank you Kenneth Branagh! Adapted from one of Christie's most famous novels, this version of Murder on the Orient Express brings with it a very impressive cast for Branagh's Poirot to interrogate his way through and find the murderer. We've seen Branagh take on Shakespeare and even Marvel so how does he fare with a bit of Christie? Well, fortunately the excellent and varied cast keep the film consistently engaging, captivating us as only these fine actors can do; but a lack of consistent style and slightly messy reveals overshadow what could have been quite an exceptional whodunit.As far as the actual story itself goes, it really is exceptional; it's difficult to fault Christie and her intricate plots and director Branagh and writer Michael Green really do put across the story well. Yet the way the story's told doesn't quite seem to do the book justice. We've seen from BBC's Sherlock that when filmed well investigations can be delightfully exciting and lavishly filmed in a really stylish manner, flashbacks and effects utilised in a way to make each revelation and finding of a clue thrilling. Here however, clues are often underwhelming and almost forgettable, their importance not necessarily highlighted leaving it a little cluttered and making us feel slightly lost at times. All this culminates in a slightly underwhelming finale where we're still trying to play catch up with Poirot and navigate the maze of clues and motivations.Still, despite this, detecting and investigating the murder with Poirot can still at times be fun, feeling like we're part of the action. This is best done right at the beginning during a sort of mini-case, similar to small action scenes at the beginning of James Bond films; this scene in particular is done very well. A lot of this is down to the quips and jokes that come from Poirot, really making his character and adding a personality to the film. Sadly this doesn't last for the entirety, actually starting to stop around the time of the murder. This is a shame since the film loses an element of its personality when the laughs stop. Still, when they're there, they really do help for us to fall in love with Poirot.Most of that though is down to Kenneth Branagh, whose performance is excellent. If you think David Suchet is the only one who could play Poirot, this film will convince you otherwise. With an understandable and mercilessly non-annoying French/ Belgian accent, Branagh's incarnation is absolutely likable and played to perfection; you can't have too much of him and that wondrous moustache. The only issue though is perhaps there's too much Poirot; if you weren't already aware of the rest of the cast, you'd be forgiven for thinking they were all unknowns instead of A-list actors. This is definitely a Branagh film, with everyone else in supporting roles but then again, when he's as great as he is, it's really hard to care.This doesn't mean to say that the rest of the cast are just throwaway celebrity cameos. On the contrary, where the middle section is less detecting and more a series of interrogations, it could easily edge on being dull and monotonous. However this is saved by sharp dialogue and, more than this, the excellent cast. It's a shame they don't interact together more; we usually see them with Poirot as opposed to each other. Still the cast is eclectic and all-starred – quite simply an absolute joy to behold. They make every scene polished and fun to watch, each delivering stand-out performances with unique characters with different sides, never letting us know who we should trust.Then again, that's what you expect from a whodunit – a tense atmosphere where you can't trust anyone. Sadly there's rarely a particularly tense scene, something that feels particularly lacking. Considering they're trapped in a train because of an avalanche, snow surrounding and isolating them, the barren outside a deathly cold mountain, you'd have thought this would be an excellent way of heightening the claustrophobia and sinister atmosphere. Instead, although the scenery is beautifully filmed, it looks more like a Christmas card than a deadly setting for a murder investigation.On the whole a solid whodunit thriller, but a bit of a mixed bag. While the style, atmosphere and slow unveiling of the mystery isn't as strong or fun as it could be, Kenneth Branagh and his inimitable Poirot moustache leads a phenomenal all-star cast with some excellent performances. With a sequel set up in the end scene, I think you can rest assured that before too long Poirot will be on the case again.",Murder on the Orient Express
298,scntyguy,Horrible acting,3,15 June 2021,"This is the worse version of this movie ever made! Michelle Pfeiffer looks very old and haggard in this movie! Her years of making movies is over, she is yesterday's news!",Murder on the Orient Express
299,Mohican15,Certainly not brilliant but still rather enjoyable!,7,6 November 2017,"I must admit, after his first directorial debuts with the appalling THOR movies, I was a little hesitant about Kenneth Branagh's latest outing as director (and star) with Murder on the Orient Express, and though there was a fair amount of material to enjoy, I'm sad to say that I WAS fairly spot-on. Don't get me wrong, there IS enjoyable stuff here but there were also various problems that left me rather disappointed. Let's first focus on the good things. First of all, one thing Branagh REALLY does well in this movie with his directing, is he delivers a brilliant and authentic slice of nostalgia. We begin in 1930s Jerusalem and Branagh captures the spirit and style of that period spot-on. The fashion, the clothes, the cars, the expensive clubs and bars. We see beautiful shots of Istanbul too with the glorious steamboats and the incredible Cathedrals. We're really transported back in time, but the other way Branagh delivers that nostalgia is with the absolutely breathtaking natural scenery that revolves around the Orient Express's journey. The cinematography in this film is BRILLIANT, courtesy of Haris Zambarloukos and really flies us into the snowy mountains or across the sun- kissed plains. The journey of the train is REALLY beautifully shown all the way through the film. Another good thing that Branagh captures is the attitudes and politics of the period. He's changed the British Colonel Arbuthnot into an African Dr. Arbuthnot, but this change from the original text is actually really interesting and adds another level to the story. A lot of the characters suffer from period racism, and that is authentically portrayed VERY well. Another thing is the set design, the interior of the train. It's beautiful, classic and very stylish. Also, another obvious thing to mention about Branagh's directing is that he does pull together a formidable cast. Almost every member is on top form. The whole line-up from Pfeiffer to Dafoe is great. Pfeiffer delivers a very emotional and strong performance as Mrs. Hubbard. Daisy Ridley plays a posh heroine and she plays that authentically too. Leslie Odom Jr. isn't bad as Dr. Arbuthnot but his muddled accent IS a distraction. Judi Dench and Olivia Coleman are two other interesting and authentic performances as the Russian Princess and German maid. Penelope Cruz delivers a interesting and surprising performance is Pilar Estravados. The great Willem Dafoe delivers enjoyable authenticity and some charm as the Nazi Professor. Derek Jacobi and Manuel Garcia- Rulfo deliver two very enjoyable performances. Jacobi harnessing his inner Alfred Pennyworth and Rulfo ringing with charisma... I am however, rather divide on Johnny Depp's sinister businessman Ratchett. He DOES play a thug well but there are STILL ghosts of Captain Jack and he can be a little laughable at times. Now we've gone through the GOOD members of the cast, onto the bad. Four performances stand out as REALLY poor. Josh Gad, Lucy Boynton, Sergei Polunin and Tom Bateman as the assistant, Count, Countess and train manager. They ALL deliver poor and rather weak performances with Gad, Polunin and Bateman all trying vainly to portray real emotion and Boynton basically playing a female Jack Sparrow. I've saved Branagh's performance for last. I was incredibly divided on his performance as Hercules Poirot which is a combo of Sherlock Holmes and Howard Hughes from THE AVIATOR . He DID deliver emotion and authenticity but there were times when his raving about the ""crime"" and the ""truth"" did feel a bit over-dramatic. His accent wasn't bad but I (personally) think that David Suchet did the best accent. Also, as many have mentioned, his mustache is simply not Poirot, it's more of a John Ruth from the Hateful Eight in my opinion! Now, the script. It, like the film has both good AND bad points. The dialogue is usually smart, sharp and interesting. It displays Poirot's genius and the personalities of the passengers very well. It really showcases the nostalgia of the times VERY well and slightly hinges on the 1974 film of the same name, but it also really grafts the tragedy and horror of the fictional ""Armstrong Case"" very well too. However, this version does have slight changes in plot to the original novel by Christie. There are various twists and turns that are interesting but, VERY messy. Things could do to be tightened up a lot in this film. Also, it just isn't exciting and it didn't really grab me at all. There is almost no dramatic atmosphere or tension. However, all the good performances, great cinematography and interesting dialogue DID deliver a fairly enjoyable picture. But, as I have listed, it does have problems! Not bad but definitely a B-PICTURE!",Murder on the Orient Express
300,mattkerr-73017,Murder on the casting directors part(?),7,23 April 2018,"I often feel when Hollywood studios adapt acclaimed novels, particularly popular ones, that they are mocking me for having never read them - condescending in their attitude of ""oh, well you've heard of it, but you've never actually READ it, have you? Ah well isn't it so much easier to sit and watch the film now that we are releasing it anyway?""
Either way, as somebody with little to no knowledge of the source material, MOTOE is a fairly well directed, well executed, well acted by an all star cast (for better and for oh so much worse in the case of a certain actor whose name is nothing short of dirt right now) and has a twist that is fairly satisfying - that and I'm always a complete sucker for mystery/detective stories.

My biggest objection was exterior shots , some of them looked like cgi and kinda poor at that. Next and think about it. The train is derailed ,they send 8 to 10 men to fix it on a pump car, You would need a crane at the very least, and since it is winter , cold how do the cars keep warm.

302,metztex,"Not great, but not that bad either",6,16 January 2020,"Bottom line up front: This adaptation of the classic Agatha Christi's book is a decent who done it story and is very exacting in the details. While the film does not seem to follow the original book too well it still follows the book enough to allow the viewer to be engaged. This film also has a spread of characters filled by many cultures, which Christi did not do in the book, to appease the PC police, it is passable in this case.While I am not an Agatha Christi guru I have read this particular book and felt this film was a decent adaptation to the original story. The detective was exacting and in some ways compelling but that is pretty much where it ends. The suspect's, which many are played by well known actors/actresses are good but felt their talents would have been better spent on other projects. This was evident by the lack of character development in many cases. If the character development had been better I think this film would have benefited greatly but probably would have suffered from time limitations.Cinematography is pretty good and the effects, when needed were well done and complement the film. Plot line follows a Christi like line but does take a few liberal turn to appease the PC police. This is usually annoying but is not as bad in this film.If you are an ardent Christi fan I would avoid this film as it is likely to upset you. If you are a mystery fan more than a Christi fan, you may find this film worth watching.",Murder on the Orient Express

305,glasslens,Thoroughly enjoyable but a very flawed film,6,14 November 2017,"Let's start with the elephant in the room. If you were going to set up a remake of a Hercule Poirot film, you would not in a month of Sundays cast Kenneth Branagh as Poirot. Not just because he is nothing like David Suchet but because he is nothing like the character that Christie describes. In this film, Branagh simply dresses up in a moustache and thinks that makes him into Poirot. Unless he thinks he is setting up a brand new version of Poirot, but he doesn't even do that. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Branagh as an actor but his weakness is that he always plays himself somehow. I expect he was too busy trying to direct. Why on earth try to play the leading role and direct when there are perfectly good directors and far better actors for this part? Truth be said, this has all the hallmarks of a vanity project for Branagh. One suspects that Branagh cannot understand why everybody does not think he is the world's greatest actor and by directing admire him even more. Actually the film is rather well directed but more of this later.Now, the rest of the cast play their parts well and are clearly well directed. We see them clearly and we hear them clearly as they speak their lines to perfection. The film relies on it's plot and from this point of view it works really well. That said, the previous versions were also very good but certainly not better. The fight scenes were absolutely ridiculous and if any one thing pushed this film towards being a turkey, they did. Read the book Branagh and learn!!!!!Now of course this film was not meant to be ""realistic"" in any sense, and clearly the producers and director wanted to product a visually stunning tour-de-force. And stunning it is but in a very unrealistic way - it all looks a bit like a realistic cartoon. The special effects are brilliantly done but they are very very obvious. The bridge, the train in the snow and the station look totally artificial although as I say, very cleverly done. I have only to assume that this ""Hugo"" look is intentional. Now, I always comment on the cinematography. The 70mm film origination looks stunning especially in the effects-driven swooping shots of the train in the mountains. The camera motion on the train, especially considering the narrow corridors is top class and Haris ZambarlouKos must take credit for doing a great job here. I'm assuming the over use of shots looking down from the ceiling and the tracking shot early on of people walking through the train from the exterior were Branagh driven - they were unnecessary and irritating but some of us found them fun.Near the end of this film Poirot - well Branagh of course as he is nothing like Poirot, alludes to Death On The Nile. Let's hope that if they have a go at that one, they get a decent Poirot! BUT actually I thoroughly enjoyed this very deeply flawed film! Unlike a couple in the row in front. Said one to the other, I kid you not, ""Nice cinema, shame about the film"".",Murder on the Orient Express
306,joshgibbs-35276,Good effort but highly inaccurate and a mess,1,13 November 2017,"Although I am a great fan of Kenneth Branagh but the adaption of Agatha Christie's most famous mystery is full of major holes. For starters they eliminated an important character, colonel Arbuthnot who served with John Armstrong. His famous line ""I prefer a jury of 12 men"" was a major clue to Poirot. Then they renamed the doctor's last name to Arbuthnot for no reason. Secondly, this case happens later in Poirot's career and he is older, and much heavier and bald. The reinvention of Poirot is utterly wrong in this hip sleek back hair with a giant mustachio. The real Agatha Christie's Poirot cannot fight! He is a brainy but physically unfit man. The (Spoiler alert) fight seen with the doctor is another made up seen to add some Hollywood action to the mix. But it is out of place and again distracting. Finally another major flaw is (spoiler alert) the stabbing of Ms Hubbard which is made up to add some sort of diversion that does not exist anywhere else. The set and cinematography is very nice with high production value. But overall this movie fails to capture the real fans and can not appeal to casual mystery fans either as it is too distracting. I was really hoping for a masterpiece with this star studded cast and Branagh acting and directing. But clearly something terribly went wrong as it is the usual case in Hollywood these days. And what resulted is this expensive looking mess of a movie!!!",Murder on the Orient Express

With stunning cinematography, costumes, and locations, Murder On The Orient Express has me hooked from the opening scenes in Jerusalem, to the gorgeous train journey through Europe Kenneth Branagh has directed a film that makes you forget that the film for its most, is set in a train carriage and works wonders with the cameras, including some lengthy camera tracking shots that will make film makers smile with admiration. As Hercule Poirot, Kenneth makes him his own, and whilst we all still love David Suchet, I now declare that Kenneth is a Poirot for what I hope is a long series of films to come. Within minutes I was 'yep, he is indeed Hercule' with his insanely unique moustache and OCD 'quirks' making up the slight comedic moments in this tale.Even though some people may be familiar with the novel or previous screen adaptations of Murder On The Orient Express, there is still a lot to love about this revisiting, and watching the film whilst not recalling the story, but watching it with someone who was very familiar with the story and its plot twists. We both adored this film the same amount. In the world of bang bang action movies, treat yourself to a very cinematic film in your home this March.There is also the announced 'sequel' to the film, due out in 2019, which if Murder On The Orient Express is anything to go by, will most definitely be a pleasure to watch and experience.",Murder on the Orient Express
310,darcywinchester,Disappointing remake,4,11 December 2017,"In this Kenneth Branagh (My Week with Marilyn, TV Wallander) directed film, screenplay written by Michael Green (Logan, TVs Heroes) based on the novel by Agatha Christie, Kenneth Branagh also stars as Hercule Poirot.When Poirot decides to leave on the Orient Express, directed by his friend Bouc (Tom Bateman), the train gets stopped because of an avalanche caused by heavy snow and this gives way to a murder plot unfolding. The murder victim American businessman Edward Ratchett (Johnny Depp: Edward Scissorhands, Finding Neverland) has secrets.An eclectic bunch of first class travellers include Governess Mary Debenham (Daisy Ridley: ), doctor Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom Junior), Ratchett's valet Edward Masterman (Derek Jacobi) and secretary Hector MacQueen (Josh Gad), Austrian Professor Gerhard Hardman (Willem Defoe), American Socialite Mrs Hubbard (Michelle Pfeiffer), Italian car salesman Beniamino Marquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), elderly Princess Dragomiroff (Judy Dench) and her assistant Hildegarde Schmidt (Olivia Coleman), unhappy missionary Pilar Astravados (Penélope Cruz) and the Count and Countess Andrenyi (Sergei Polunin and Lucy Boynton) and they are all now suspects. The victim was stabbed 12 times, Poirot has to work out by whom.For me, Poirot will forever be David Suchet, but I was interested to see what this new take on the classic Agatha Christie story would be, especially with such big actors in the roles.It started well, a great couple of scenes demarcating Poirots' character involving the capture of a criminal at the wailing wall and an amusing set piece when he runs into Bouc.After this however, it goes downhill. Branagh does not make for a good Poirot (don't get me started on the moustache - does it have it's own twitter account? If not, it should), there are gaping plot holes/flaws (e.g. the film makes a point of telling us that the train is full, which with only 12 passengers does make you wonder what happened to all the other carriages) and I am not sure what technique Depp was using for his character, but it was not working. The film drags apart from the last 20 minutes and the alteration to the storyline is unnecessary and does not improve on the original, rather the opposite.The scenery is stunning, as are the sets and costumes but the film is ultimately disappointing.At the end of the film Poirot is asked to go investigate another crime which points towards a planned remake of Death on the Nile.

Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh), the best detective in the world and the crew of this expressed, you will need to know which is the killer, between all the crew of the Orient Express...Let's start with the actors. Kenneth Branagh as detective Hercule Poirot, is by far the best of the film. The incomprehensible accent complicated and very sophisticated type makes it to be the center of attention in the film. The truth is that takes all of the movie, there is none that exceeds or character of the character, or in acting. All the actors, and their respective roles, they are very good. Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Josh Gad, Johnny Deep, Jody Dench, Willem Dafoe, wow what a great cast!The characters in the movie are many, and it is very difficult to make that each one has his argument in the film. But this film does very well the difference between the characters, none is simple to decipher. The other detail that I liked that anyone could have been the killer, either.The bad... The explanations of the detective Hercule Poirot, are very fast and difficult to eat for the hearing. (I am already accustomed to, thanks to Sherlock) and the actions taken by the detective are very fast, and impulsive. There are also very, very uncomfortable to the director (that is the same Kenneth Branagh) that makes the movie super uncomfortable.The end, oh my God, the end is the most unexpected in the world.Entertaining 7/10",Murder on the Orient Express
313,theopinionatedindian,Don't Miss It,8,2 December 2017,"For someone who had loved reading Agatha Christie's acclaimed novel - The Murder on The Orient Express, watching the characters come to life in a movie was a dream come true. We obviously expected a great deal from a movie based on the best-selling novel. The problem with making a movie based on a whodunit novel is that some people already know the entire plot. We ensured that we do not read up on the novel again, as to have no recollection of the novel & to judge the movie solely on its merit. We had to catch the 10.45PM show. Due to the movie being in its second week since release, there were three shows per day. The movie had to better be good to compensate for us staying up & travelling late. Kenneth Branagh stars as Agatha Christie's legendary Belgian detective - Hercule Poirot. He also dons the director's hat for the movie. The movie boasts of an ensemble cast which includes Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer & William Dafoe among others. The movie starts off with a Hercule Poirot prequel in 1934 Jerusalem. We are then transported to Istanbul, Turkey from where the famed Orient Express is scheduled to depart. We are then introduced to all the co-passengers (most of whom can shoulder a movie all by themselves). A day post departure, one of the characters is murdered & the trains get derailed due to a snowstorm. It is now up to Hercule Poirot to solve the mystery before the train is pulled to safety & the police arrives. The stage is set for a grand & engaging whodunit. The movie takes its time to get to the central plot, but once it does there never a dull moment. The post interval part will keep you guessing about the culprit. There are several characters with a motive to kill the victim, but who killed him is a question you will be left grappling with. Within the last ten minutes of the movie the killer is revealed. Only those who have read the novel, could have guessed it right. Kenneth Branagh has largely done character roles in the past & that bodes well for the movie. There is no baggage of previous roles. He carries out both his responsibilities – acting & directing very well. He gets into the skin of his character. He embodies all the eccentricities & mannerisms including the French accent of the legendary detective. Not for once will be able to detect his British descent. Post viewing the movie, Kenneth Branagh's face will pop up in your head every time Poirot is mentioned. We loved the cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos. The movie is a visual treat. The Orient Express is the train version of The Titanic. The train looks luxurious. Trivia: It is one of the few movies to be shot on 65mm film since the 1970'sThe only issue we had with the movie is its ensemble cast. There are some amazing actors in the movie. You can't help but feel let down by how their talent has been unutilized. All the actors barring Branagh barely have a few scenes to display their histrionics on screen. The director could have just as well cast lesser known faces for these roles. Johnny Depp barely has 5-6 scenes in the movie & is not playing the lead as one might expect. What is an A-lister like him doing in a movie not revolving around him? But barring this once hiccup, the movie is an absolute delight. It keeps you at the edge of your seats. You will definitely not repent watching it. We suggest you watch it soon!",Murder on the Orient Express
314,bigkingtut2000,Spoiler Alert: I gave this movie only 4 stars,4,2 November 2020,"I thought I had to give you an explanation why I gave it such a low rating. Having seen the original film I just questioned the pretzel logic that would make someone think we should 'remake' this film??? ESPECIALLY, when it is a murder mystery???? It has a wonderful cast but, this is the ONLY Agatha Cristy Herccule Poirot that could be made??? Such an obvious waste of talent and money.",Murder on the Orient Express
315,pablovete,Unnecesary word takes a new dimension,3,6 July 2018,"I've always think that de 1974 film is overrated. It's boring and without rythm most of the time but it was great to watch the cast all together.
In this case you can only see Brannagh's ego and artificious direction for a nonsense. If you know how it ends there's no surprise so you try to enjoy the shots, the acting or maybe ( that was too much to ask for... ) a surprise!
Boring , unnecesary and at the end they are tryin' you to go into a sequel Murder at the Nile?

316,Kranadon65,Beautiful cinematography and some amusing moments.,7,10 November 2017,"I've seen some reviews comparing it to the 1974 version. Having never seen that version as I was much too young when it came out in 1974 was probably a good thing.One thing that was very nice was the beautiful cinematography. I never had an interest in these type movies much but the actors in it drew me in. Kenneth Branaugh is rather amusing with the ridiculous moustache which in itself deserves an Oscar for the makeup artist who created it. His Poirot is amusing and delivers the best lines without missing a trick. Johnny Depp as a sleazy art dealer also has some good scenes. The rest of the cast though is disappointing , although it's not entirely their fault as Branaughs direction suffers from sleepwalking ,as if the actors are phoning it in. Judi Dench and her servant are wasted in their roles, Salma Hayek is just terrible , she does not belong in this movie. Daisy Ridley of the new Star Wars trilogy is also miscast here , while a decent actress, she is just uneven. And Michelle Pfeiffer who physically has not aged well does have a few moments towards the end of the movie but by then it's a bit too late. I kind of figured out who did it halfway through the movie so the ending twist was no surprise at all.",Murder on the Orient Express
317,tom-43722,A perfectionist dealing with imperfection,7,2 December 2017,"I'm referring to both myself and Kenneth Branagh's character, Hercule Poirot, in the title. This isn't a perfect movie - then again very few, if any movies are - but it's far, FAR better than The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi combined. I'll get into why I'm comparing it to those train-wrecks later. First, I should say that I haven't read Agatha Christie's novel so I don't know how faithful this is. The only version of this story I've seen was from Doctor Who, and that version took place in the future, in space, and had a Mummy who lets you live for 66 seconds when you see it.With my ignorance of source material out of the way, let's get to the actual review. The most interesting character in the movie is Hercule Poirot, which works fine since he's the lead. A brilliant detective (albeit a somewhat egotistical one, as he proclaims himself ""the best detective in the world"") and a perfectionist through and through, right down to requesting that people straighten their ties, his character arc is about realizing that justice and injustice can depend on people's points of view, and that not everybody can be separated into the categories of good and bad. There are shades of grey, which throws his view of perfection, be it perfect innocence or perfect villainy, into question. Kenneth Branagh did a good job at directing the movie, but it might have been better if he'd let someone else do that, because he stood out more as an actor than a director. His ridiculous mustache and strange accent were somewhere between charming and annoying but what made him likable to me were his perfectionist tendencies, as I'm a perfectionist myself.Unfortunately, since the movie has to juggle so many characters, some performers don't get the amount of screen-time that they deserve. Branagh seemed so focused on crafting the film around his own performance that he forgot to give his co-stars time to shine. For example, the legendary actress Judi Dench has played many different roles such as Queen Victoria and Lady MacBeth and holds a special place in my memory as M from James Bond, but she wasn't given much to do in this movie. Penelope Cruz's character also receives little attention although she has enough time to talk about Lucifer and God. Even Michelle Pfeiffer, who looks incredible for a woman who's rapidly approaching her sixtieth birthday (she's well over twice my age but she's somehow managed to stay attractive), didn't leave much of an impression, for better or worse. With so many characters fighting for screen-time, it's hard to become memorable.However two performers outside of Branagh did manage to be memorable, one in a good way and one in a not-so-good way. Despite looking at the cast before I entered the movie, I didn't recognize Johnny Depp at all whilst he was playing Edward Ratchett. He didn't have much screen-time but in the time that he had, he was sleazy and clearly had a shady past, but fear motivated him to carry a gun wherever he went and request Poirot's help, showing that he was still human. I literally never recognized him as the same man who brought us the eccentric Jack Sparrow, perhaps because he looked presentable instead of a drunken mess. It seems to me that Johnny Depp has a rather forgettable face but that works in his favour because it allows him to get as close to literally disappearing into his characters as a live-action actor can get.Now let's get to why I mentioned The Force Awakens. Daisy Ridley is annoying. Her voice sticks out like a sore thumb and she doesn't seem to be very bright, but the most annoying part... was that she actually wasn't that bad in this film. After her lousy performance in The Force Awakens, I was ready to tear this performance apart, but she toned down the over-the-top expressions and even her irritating voice suited Mary much more than Rey. One can always tell it's her voice and it doesn't blend in, but due to the time period and her character's social class, it doesn't sound nearly as out of place as it did on Rey. Ridley is just a pretty face with little brainpower behind it, but she's better here than she was in both of her Star Wars movies put together, which plays into my understanding of Poirot's story arc. Just as he must come to terms with how good and bad, as well as justice and injustice, are not black and white, I must come to terms with the fact that Daisy Ridley's not a terrible actress and my judgment isn't always perfect. It seems that supporting characters are more suitable for her, which emphasizes how poorly cast and directed she was in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. It also proves that, for all his faults, Kenneth Branagh is a far better director than Jar Jar Abrams or Ruin Johnson (pardon me for the immature name calling but frankly, those two hacks deserve it).",Murder on the Orient Express
318,garabedbaghsarian,Ignore the negative reviews and watch it for yourself,9,23 October 2019,"Despite the fact that I haven't watched the classical version(1974) of this movie, I can say that this ""remake"" is still good enough if not compared with the original version.
Even though whenever I see a movie that contains many famous people, i can automatically conclude that the movie is weak and the director used those actors to boost the revenue, but not with this movie.
The movie talks about murder that happens on a train that got blocked on railroad by snow and the detective on board tries to find the murderer. The movie was performed in a way that every 10min makes you suspect someone but then something happens and you change your mind again and suspect someone else.",Murder on the Orient Express
319,gailmoir,Dull,1,3 August 2019,Tried watching this movie on the plane and turned it off. So incredibly boring. But thought maybe it didn't transfer well as a flight movie so tried again at home. Shouldn't have bothered. He is no Poirot. Can't stand Johnny Depp. And the other so called big actors acted like they were in it for the money they were just 1 dimensional. What was with his apparent magical skills in knowing??? The book is so good. And Agatha Christie would have turned in her grave. I also agree with another reviewer who points out that however wrong it was. There would have been no black doctor and not one travelling first class in those days. Don't try and be politically correct when the story was set in a different era. (And yes. It was sooo wrong during that period but portraying it differently doesn't change it). All in all. A shocker of a movie,Murder on the Orient Express
320,m-arsic0708,How Agatha Christie was brutally ruined,2,10 February 2018,"This movie is actually a piece of art. It takes a really true artist to ruin Agatha Christie at her best and a Dench-lead cast and come up with a boring Branagh soliloquy. What he has made out of Poirot, it's just unbelievable. I don't remember him being described as a walrus in any of the books where he also has converstations with all involved so that readers/audience can participate somehow. In this movie it's just Branagh, he knows it all, he sees it all and he understands it all. Out of thin air. Such wonderful actors were gathered for this monstrosity and it felt as is they were there only a set for Branagh. And oh yes, when talking about scenery - which ignorant fool came up with alps between Vinkovci and Brod??????? The thing is, there is nothing going on in this film, no suspension building up, no substance. It is just a pale vessel for Kenneth Branagh to try shining. 
Watch 1974 Lumet version. And from what i hear, it's going to be a sequel, Death on the Nile. Watch 1978 John Guillermin version. Branagh should.

321,Yee_Reviews,An All-Star Cast and a Vintage Style Cannot Shine in a Lackluster Story,5,2 November 2017,"Good: The amazing all-star cast of academy award winners. Even though each actor/actress plays their role well, no one was a standout. The setting of most of the movie is the Orient Express, which helps contribute to a trapped and isolated feel and makes you feel as if you were there with the detective. The introductory to Hercule Poirot is great, but as the movie chugs alongBad: Overall, the movie lacks comedy and heartfelt moments. At times, the accent of Poirot is hard to understand, which leads to clues that are not clearly understood and a story that is hard to follow along. The movie is more of an interrogation of each character, by just going down the huge list of suspects and giving each character equal screen time. It progresses at a slow pace and the clues never lean me towards one person or another. I also did not find the murder to be inventive or creative. Overall: Even with an outstanding cast, the movie suffers from a generic plot. The movie lacks the engaging aspects of a crime movie and relies too heavily on its cast to deliver its moments. 2.7/5",Murder on the Orient Express

Terrible dialogue, faux suspense, actors who were either dialing it in or terrible to begin with (how does d ridley keep getting cast as someone who is neither attractive nor talented?) and the most cringeworthy lead performance.

Murder on the Orient Express,6,3 January 2018,"So...Murder on the Orient Express***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***I was in two minds about going to see this as I do like Kenneth Branagh as a director, (though I still haven't really forgiven him for Frankenstein), but it is an all-star cast and it looks very beautiful and made me want to drink champagne out of dead posh cut crystal glasses (rather than just swigging it from the bottle as per usual).But see it I did. It looks fabulous though a strange lack of frosty breaths during lengthy conversations in the freezing cold and a lot of hugeous long exposition that just felt like a TV movie.Then I realised it was just a very very expensive TV movie. I got a bit bored at one point.Some of the VFX and CGI or whatever it was was a bit rubbish, I don't understand why when there is so much money they can't just fix an incongruous shot or even just cut it.And I got a bit bored again.And I wondered why in 1934 they used a neon sign for the titles - felt out of place and if I was feeling that then I was missing something somewhere.Some of the acting was alright and then some of the actors were doing 'The Acting' which was rather annoying.I didn't really 'feel' anything for anyone, Ken is supposed to be able to get performances out of a wooden chair but clearly he was just working on characters here rather than performance.And then it was over.

It should be a wrestle of the minds on observations and logical deductions against the smoke and mirrors of deception. The test of skills for filmmakers and script writers of this kind is to fool the audience in such a way that makes revelationary sense when the truth is revealed. This is not the case for Kenneth Branagh who is both the director and the star who played the famous detective Hercule Poirot. He in his character is too eager to pontificate like a running Wikipedia with mustache with his knowledge on the back story of the Armstrong murder as if he wrote the scripts to both murders past and present. The audience is left passively in the backseat like some numb and mindless spectators to this sport-event like commentary. This isn't how a detective film should be. However, if you decided that it isn't a detective film but a film that questions moral justice over legal justice, the film does present that as a case for Poirot to solve and he solves it quickly in which moral justice prevails. In that sense, the film is not entirely heartless. The visuals are very nice, especially the wide establishing shots of the train speeding through the snow storm in the wilderness of the mountains, thus setting the stage where because it is so far from civilization, morality is justifiably above the law.",Murder on the Orient Express

My review is based on this version the way I just viewed it on the big screen. And even though the story may be known, even though it's a star vehicle with a group of big names and not all of them get the time to truly show their strength, it works in my eyes. Why? Because of the spherical way it has been filmed. In a way, it reminded me of the Grand Budapest Hotel. And I have to say, I loved it. The book was written for entertainment, the first movie was made for that and this movie has just one purpose and that's entertainment. A good night with visual pleasure. Not to find out who did it, most of us already know. It's the way it is found out that matters. People who say it was an unnecessary remake in my eyes are in love with the first version and rightfully they are. But that does not make their review objective. If you have an open mind, if you like to be entertained. Then go watch this movie and have yourself entertained. For me, it was a pleasure from start to end. Only negative... it's a bit short.

Covered by an avalanche, the train passengers are all stuck in the train with the killer, as the detective races against time to solve the crime before the killer strikes again.Not far from the other three screen adaptations, the 2017 remake of the Murder on the orient express does not present the film with an active question, solving the mystery for the viewer it lacks engagement and therefore is made as a passive audience film. Even though it does not stimulate the viewer to ask active question after, the film does indeed succeed at telling a murder mystery plot. Sweeping us off our feet, as any deduction made by us along with the detective is then dismissed and started anew.With good set design and good cinematography, the film tries to capture the aesthetic of the 1930s, however fails to do so, as the visual effects, used to recreate Istanbul, do not stand up to the expectations of a large budget feature film.

330,taylorhammons,How do you tell a story when everyone already knows the ending?,8,10 November 2017,"Agatha Christie was the queen of all things murder, and in perhaps her most quintessential story, she gives us an ending so incredibly inventive, so inspired, that few have dared repeat it. For the few of you who haven't read or seen Murder on the Orient Express before or had it spoiled for you, I won't tell you the ending. Suffice to say, it's extremely unpredictable and could only have been done by Agatha Christie. But for those of us who do know the story, how do you make it entertaining when we all know how it ends? Therein lies the genius that is Kenneth Branaugh. In the next installment of a stellar career, Branaugh shifts focus from the comedies of Shakespeare to the suspense of Agatha Christie and proves that his talent knows no bounds. Expertly directed and wonderfully cast, Branaugh's adaption keeps all the charm, glamour and suspense that Christie intended, while modernizing it for a younger audience. And for those who say the story is no longer relevant, I argue that Branaugh's true genius lies in the ability to make a period piece as just that: a period piece. While the story itself may not be as relevant as it was in its day, the lessons behind it are just as true today as they ever were. In perhaps her greatest work, Agatha Christie blurs the very lines of good and evil and causes even the great Poirot to question his long held morality. Was it necessary? Maybe not. But is that really the point? It's entertaining, the cinematography was beautiful (the murder scene especially), and it stayed true to the source material. I for one, thoroughly enjoyed it.

I like the timing and emphasis on Poirot's idiosyncrasies as well as the flight of events. What suffers is the supporting cast as they don't energize their characters well enough but being fair that may be because of the nature of each person's relation to the events that occur.

That's the anchor that keeps this adaptation of the story firmly in the same spot and doesn't allow it to move one inch, despite the remarkable twists, theme and design of the narrative.Problem is even if one accepts the coincidences surrounding the simultaneous appearance of all this pour souls on the same train, along with the killer who destroyed their lives, which of course is later proven that is anything but a coincidence, the presence there of, as he so eloquently phrased it, probably the best detective in the whole world, and one that in the year we live in everyone knows, completely destroys the story. Missed the first five mins, and I don't know whether the killer hunted down Poirot to ask for his help, and that's how they got on the same train, but even if that's the case, I don't see it making much sense.I mean they managed to get the killer on the train and booked the whole trip to extract their revenge, and they invited along the only person in the world who could solve the crime. That's just trying too hard ...Maybe a better adaptation that better suits our time would've been to start from the ending of the film. A detective calls the FBI or whatever and basically surrenders the case. I have a train full of people and a murder case I cannot solve. Please help me.

336,Keatonics,We may be seeing Branaugh's masterpiece-will anyone take notice?,10,24 November 2017,"I have always been a Kenneth Branaugh fan, and in this film he goes beyond anything he has ever put on the screen. I have to wonder, though, why his best work is done as a murder mystery? Nevertheless, it is a true masterpiece. Almost like watching Da Vinci, Picasso, and van Gogh all paint on the same canvass at the same time. Just like any artist, Branaugh paints his film onto the screen, taking the time to make sure every stroke is just right, the colors are true, and the scapes brilliant and alive.The cinematography is exquisite. From the ever moving camera shooting exteriors from high above, to way below, from rotating around the moving train to fluidly moving and circulating among and around the characters in the cramped space of the train's interior. The magnificent long shots of the train traveling great distances in the dark and snow, to the extreme closeups showing every pour and flaw in the actors' skin (including and especially in the extreme self-aware closeups of Branaugh, himself). The camera sets the tone.The production design is glorious. The cramped reality of the train's finely finished carved wood interior; the uncomfortable dress and style of the period; the dual images of characters as the camera passes behind the beautifully framed leaded cut glass windows, the dirty and greasy exterior of the train, and the rickety wood trestles it travels over. Even the period Godiva chocolate (can you say ""product placement?"") was convincing. It is the production design that adds the stark reality of the period, both of its beauty and its ugliness.The script is so strong and characters are so well cast and well developed that Branaugh really did not need the cinematography, production design, costumes, and makeup to carry the film. He could have directed them on a bare stage and still had a great film. The strength of the story and acting added the depth of light and shadow that only a master artist is able to achieve. The actors were directed with the awareness that only an actor's director can bring to the story. The brushstrokes of a master artist.In fairness, I will also say that sometimes Branaugh's greatest strength is his greatest weakness. The constantly moving camera gave the film a self-awareness that is actually distracting at times. Most directors are not even aware that the camera can be another character in the film, while others just try to avoid camera movement. Banaugh clearly made it an integral part of the film. I had to work hard to look past that, but once I lost the awareness I was fine.It is a very beautiful film. And it is just a murder mystery. Why was his greatest film to date a murder mystery? That goes to the heart of why the film will probably not win any awards and will get very little recognition.It was just a murder mystery.

That being said, this is a very decent film. If you like movies that are shot and acted in a very traditional way, you'll like this film. That is to say, it's a murder mystery, which isn't done much these days, as well as mostly shot in one small location, which doesn't happen in most films as of late. It has some really great talent in it as well, but does do that thing where there's big name talent that doesn't do much (like, Judi Dench is great as always, but WHY IS SHE HERE SHE HAS LIKE ONE SCENE). If you already know the story of this film, as it is a remake, you could probably skip it, as from what I can tell there really isn't anything new done here. It's very well shot, with the acting and directing performance from Kenneth Branagh being very notable, he does a great job in both roles in this. The whole cast does a pretty good job (Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom Jr., Josh Gad, Judi Dench and ESPECIALLY William Defoe are all favorites here), although there are a few corny line deliveries and the computer effects and makeup are sometimes kinda distracting (at one point I turned to my friend and asked; ""It's 2017, why does the train look like the Polar Express?""). Overall, I'd say if you're a fan of old movies, you'll like this film.

When I discovered it was the same director, I watched the movie again and enjoyed it all the more, this time realizing I needed to watch it a bit more closely. My opinion is the opening at the Wailing Wall truly introduced us to both the detective and some of the other main characters in a meaningful way, and one thing I love is this director knows how to bring meaning to his movies with every choice he makes, no matter how subtle. Naturally, the first time I had no clue who the culprit was, but the second time I was catching the clever clues and realizing that we are watching a performance about a performance. Things that seem disturbing the first time are actually humorous the second time, because you understand the motives behind that behavior much better. Shallow, stereotypical characters gain depth when you realize that they are trying to distract the detective, and even making up some of their stories as they go. I have no clue when Hercule truly had it all figured out. The way his mind works, it could have been earlier than portrayed. When I saw the preview, I was so used to the Hollywood formula that I didn't think I needed to watch the movie. The culprit was the missionary. Even if I was wrong about that, I was sure I knew who had not done it. Turns out I DID need to watch the movie, and I'm so glad I did!",Murder on the Orient Express
344,imdb-936-837144,Thinking Outside the Box,8,13 November 2017,"In 1934 world renowned detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) is vacationing on the Orient Express as a means to relax his mind. Unfortunately, a man turns up murdered by some­one on their Calais Coach, and rather than let the local gendarmes at the next station flub their investigation, he decides to solve it him­self and hand it to them on a platter.Based on an Agatha Christie novel by the same name—she being a whiz with words—the title bears considering. It seems to distance itself from any dualism: i.e. not life and death, but murder; not on and off but merely on; not Orient and Occident (East and West) but Orient only; and Express with­out any Impress.Timothy Materer writes on *James Merrill's Apocalypse* that ""Merrill struggled with the limitations of dualism  In a journal of 1954, he addressed the way dualities interfere with our perception of reality: ¶""' in all circumstances we are deluged with interpretations, simplifications, falsifications of our experience, by reference to non-existent poles, life & death say, or any of the convenient dualities. We think in these terms, see life as Life—and at once it is simpler, slightly evaporated, on its way *away* from reality'."" (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 2000, 12).An example of this in a train novel is the western *Night Passage*, by Norman A. Fox: ""Harbin asked,'You know him, Utica?'""'I ought to, Curly. And I think I can tell you why he's here. He's been following me around for a long spell, trying to talk me out of the trail I ride. Now he's caught up with me again. Isn't that it, Grant? You spotted me from the train, so you came after me. You see, Curly, he's my brother. I'm Lee McLain—and he's Grant McLain.'""Harbin said, 'The hell you say!'""'That's it, Curly. The McLain tribe balanced up even—one owlhooter, one honest man.'""'Lee and Grant,' Harbin said. 'You're funnin', Utica'""'We were Missouri folks, Curly. Missouri was a split state while the war was on, so Pappy straddled the fence. He named his first son for Grant and his second son for Lee.'""'This is straight, Utica?'""'Straight as a string. Tie a can to him and send him down the mountain, Curly. We'll likely be shaking the dust of this place by sunup. It won't matter if he talks about this hide­out. And he won't talk any­way. He always tries to keep me in the clear.'""'I dunno,' Harbin said with a shake of his head. 'This takes some thinking.'"" (New York: Dodd, Mead & Co., 1956, 136–7)It's not a matter of us and them, but of us and us. Maybe. It's going to take some thinking. And if this example is any indication, the Orient Express detective has his work cut out for him.The color scheme of ""Murder On"" is amorphous. Only two colors are used much: blue and red; and these but sporadically. There are blue panels on the train, and red lipstick, lights, and wine. Beyond that it's muted earth tones. The whole movie is a waste of a scenic journey, the diverse characters as bland as an unbroken field of snow.Then we encounter the ""husband hunter"" Caroline Hubbard (Michelle Pfeiffer) who sports a purple dress (mixture of blue & red) and suddenly a single character amidst all the suspects is flagged, at least visually. But alas, the dancer, too, having blonde hair and red lip­stick wears an orange garment (combo of yellow & red). Since she's eliminated as a suspect on account of lacking the strength to knife the victim with such ferocity, the camera's attention to Mrs. Hubbard must have some significance other than her guilt or innocence. Her purple dress materialized right after dialog about the combining of two elements; that's all we can say.However, there is noted a common saying in ""Night Passage"" about the combining of disparate elements: ""A forty-four barrel on a forty-five frame./ Never bet aces in another man's game."" The last line would indicate a winning hand that the card player for some reason doesn't want to play, but it's a reach to apply it here. This movie doesn't even mention the saying.There is, though, a throwaway line at the end of ""Orient"", about the detective's next assignment, which also shows up in the ""Passage"" book. Poirot is being sent to ""Egypt, right on the bloody Nile."" In ""Passage"" one of the brothers involved in a three-way love triangle is said to have visited ""a river in Egypt called de nial.""Poirot is portrayed as one smart detective, right up there with Sherlock Holmes, I'd say. And he's not bashful about his accomplishments. It's like (Eccl. 8:1) ""Who is as the wise man? And who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.""This movie is well constructed, and it keeps us guessing until the end. I think Agatha Christie should be her own genre, because those novels all bear her stamp. However, this one is similar to a western I mentioned above, so perhaps one should keep an open mind. I liked Christie but haven't read but two of her novels. Maybe I'll read some more after seeing this movie.The actors also included Judi Dench, Leslie Odom, Jr, Penélope Cruz, Johnny Depp, William Dafoe, Josh Gad, and Daisy Ridley. They all worked well together and got along off-set, too.Don't see this one for the scenery as it's hard to even tell when the B&W flashbacks occur, the colors are so muted.

347,umashankarpati1997,"""There is right. There is wrong. There is no in-between.""",8,11 March 2018,"After solving a theft in Jerusalem, famed Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, is looking forward to a break before his next case. His friend, Bouc, the director of the Orient Express, convinces him to travel on board his train. Seeing the time on the train as a welcome break from crime-solving, Poirot agrees. The passengers of the grand and luxurious carrier come off as an odd bunch of people travelling together.Based on Agatha Christie's celebrated crime 
mystery novel, the film revolves around the murder of a dubious businessman aboard the luxurious first class compartment of the Orient express. With almost every co-passenger being a suspect, Belgian detective Hercule Poirot's (Kenneth Branagh) sharp deduction skills are put to test once again.Loaded with mysterious intentions, cheeky humour, clever repartee and an ensemble cast that comprises some of cinema's biggest names, Murder on the Orient Express makes for an intriguing watch. Strangers being stranded on a stalled train makes for a great premise, given the thrill of finding a killer lurking around.
After receiving some threatening letters, Ratchett tries to employ Poirot for his security, but the latter declines. On the same night, as the Orient Express runs aground due to an avalanche, Samuel Ratchett is found stabbed multiple times in the chest and abdomen. With much reluctance, and his friend's insistence, Poirot takes up the investigation. As he gets down to the exhaustive process of interrogation, it is clear that things aren't exactly as they seem.He maunders on about knife wounds and sleeping potions and missing kimonos. The clues are at once vital, finicky, and dull, and Branagh, perhaps fearful that his tale might be sagging, peps it up with escapades that would have had Christie dropping her teapot. Poirot, who starts by fretting about boiled eggs, finds himself chasing a caped figure along a precarious bridge. He even gets a shot in the arm. The movie could use one, too.Of the rest of the impressive cast, only Depp as Ratchett and Pfeiffer as Mrs Hubbard make any kind of impression. The film comes closest to giving an insight into its characters when Depp is interacting with Poirot and Hubbard, but since Ratchett is the one to be murdered, that doesn't last long. the snow-capped peaks is so marvellously filmed On a technical scale, the film scores a perfect ten. The scenes involving the murdered body and the cabin that houses the corpse are shot entirely from above with great ingenuity. 
The only con of this movie is the last dialogue which is a bit sentimental but the pros of this movie overshadowed this con.
Murder On The Orient Express pays homage to Agatha Christie's timeless detective story in more ways than one.
It's a must watch.",Murder on the Orient Express
348,geisesanja,Sometimes you need to give it a chance.....,9,26 August 2018,"I was and I suppose, still am, loyal to the older Albert Finney version. Especially the music! The classic score seemed to make it even more amazing and glamorous. But as I have watched this newer redo several times, I have concentrated more on the characters, the dialogue, and the scenery. I love the scenes of the train going through the mountain areas with the thunder and lightening before the avalanche. Just that made me wish that I had taken a chance and gone to the movie theatre to see it. That was AWESOME! A really nice touch. And when Poirot sticks his head out of the door of his berth and asks, ""Did we die?,"" it's hysterical. 
But the beginning of the film was puzzling. I have read the book. Where did this strange small crime that Poirot needs to solve before he gets on the train come from? And the even stranger issue of his breakfast eggs not being perfectly matched, ""I blame the chicken,"" Poirot says, as he runs off to other business, was just plain weird. But I digress.
Johnny Depp actually makes the character of Ratchet even more sinister than Richard Widmark did. And when 'Ratchet' tries to pretty much buy Poirot to be his bodyguard, so to speak, Poirot declines by telling this person who looks like a criminal, ""I do not like your face,"" Ratchet's fate is pretty much sealed. No one would be able to keep this terrible person safe. Those of us who know the story, are clued in (pun intended) to how it ends. They all did it. 
But the bottom line is this. Give this film a chance. It's very entertaining. And since our NEW Poirot is now heading to Egypt, us Poirot fans know why. And I will see the next one in the theatre. Tickets to see a movie with all the cool sound effects on a really huge screen, are not that expensive.",Murder on the Orient Express
349,hellebenzon-26367,Disappointing to a true Christie-fan,5,20 October 2018,"One thing is, that I do not think that Kenneth Branagh do the great Hercule Poirot justice. As a true fan, I think that David Suchet is the most perfect Poirot, and it is obviously too big shoes to fill for Branagh.
Another thing is, that the strong finish, that Christie is a master of, gets kind of blah. It is make to seem, that Poirot cannot solve this crime, which is so obvious, and first at the end it hits him *Sigh* In the novel and in the Suchet movie it is pretty clear, that Poirot knows, but is having a moral dilemma. He understands the motive, but do not condone of murder, and therefore he is less than inclined to solve the riddle, than in his other cases. This fact is totally left out of this remake!

351,sascha-17,Runs out of steam halfway in,6,10 November 2017,"*** Some spoilers ahead for the handful of people who are not familiar with Christie's classic murder mystery. ***As a fan of the book and the Sidney Lumet adaptation, I was curious how Kenneth Branagh's take on Agatha Christie's famous story would play out. On paper, all the ingredients for a decent (or even great), modern day adaptation are there: A star-studded cast, beautiful production-design and costumes and a seasoned director with deep roots in both stage- and film-work. And for about half of the film's running time, all that seems to hold the piece together pretty well. There's a sense of ""class"" about the flick: Grand vistas, beautiful art-deco environments, exotic locations and a general flair of slower, more elegant era (not so) long gone-by. I can even live with the director's odd choice of playing the lead-role himself. Branagh sure wouldn't be my first pick for Poirot and he does have a slightly different take on the famous Belgian super-sleuth. This Poirot seems more brooding and ""conflicted"" than any other version I've seen before - but I'm not sure this change adds anything to either the character or to this particular story. On the other hand, we do get satisfyingly quirky moments showcasing Poirot's little eccentricities. His obsession with orderliness, cleanliness and his quick and witty sense of humor.As expected with this sort of group, the rest of the cast are more than up to the task as well - if they are allowed to occupy the screen, that is. Sadly, a lot of characters are criminally underused. We hardly get to know some players who are vital to the plot and who held much more prominent roles in Sidney Lumet's version. For example: One of the main suspects and an important character overall has so few lines that he almost seems superfluous in Branagh's adaptation. And I think we have the director to blame here, who seems to be infatuated with his own face. Instead of spending more time with the rest of the ensemble, he gives us one long close-up of himself after the other - a decision whose negative impact on the film is exacerbated by a seemingly trivial item - Poirot's facial hair. At some point while making the film, someone must have thought that having ""the greatest mustache in London"" means that Poirot goes through life looking like a walrus. It wouldn't have been a huge deal, if Branagh hadn't insisted to stick this hairy monstrosity in our faces again and again. By the fourth long close-up with the monster-stache center-stage, the audience in my theater were beginning to chuckle. But I digress ... It's when the titular murder occurs that the movie really fell apart for me. And it's mostly down to unforced errors committed by the script. For example: In a lot of places, this film is closer to Christie's novel than the Lumet-version of the 70s. Little details that Lumet left out are included here - like the fictional Mr Harris whose berth Poirot occupies on the first night on the train. But in other places, the script veers off and tries to trick us into thinking it was headed towards a different conclusion than the source-material. Which, if you know the story and the ending, feels more like an attempt at trickery than actual creativity, because (Spoiler!) ... the movie ultimately does not have the guts to re-write Christie's solution.And then there's the matter of leaving out crucial details which rob the ending of its original tone. A major point in the original was the fact that the victim had been found guilty and more or less convicted of murder already, but then had to be released due to a technicality. Making his death on the train less of an act of revenge or vigilantism and more like an act of citizens trying to ensure that justice is being served. Branagh's version leaves out this crucial detail about the trial and thus makes the group of murderers seem more like an angry lynch mob ... which in turn makes Poirot's decision to let them go feel out of character for him. In the original, we could comprehend why Poirot (albeit with much inner conflict) decided to let them get away with murder. In this version, we get a hysteric Michelle Pfeiffer and lots of close ups of Poirot staring into space while the music swells in the background. Ultimately, we're left to wonder why this stickler for justice and righteousness would let this particular murder go unpunished. I also take some exception to the somewhat lame attempts at ""diverse casting"". I have no objections to transforming white characters into ones of color - but those changes should make sense within the story and within the period that's being portrayed. In this particular case for example, it would've made much more sense to re-write the character in question as either an Indian or Middle Eastern man. But going with a black guy, the story has to perform some serious mental gymnastics in order to explain his presence in the story. I do wonder however, whether someone who goes into this film without any knowledge of the original story will share my concerns and might actually enjoy the film more than I did. If you look past the puzzling decisions made by the screenwriter, there's much to be admired here. Sadly though, I couldn't help but notice the needless changes they chose to make and thus this film, for me, wasn't better than slightly above average.6/10",Murder on the Orient Express

The only sort-of previous history I have with the character of Poirot is the parody in Murder by Death (1976).This movie was ridiculous but fun. I think that's often the case with Branagh, and he certainly raised the ridiculousness for this one. His accent went all over the place, ridiculous jokey scenes and his acting performance, not to mention his moustache. The shots were lovely and the ensemble cast did a good job. Can't say I'm a big fan of Depp the last few years but the scenes he had he did very well. He also had one of the funniest throwaway lines I've seen in a while. Something about dogs... the rest of the cast, including greats like Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer and perhaps a future great like Daisy Ridley all did very well and showed their chops in the scenes they had.

353,peterm1,Off the rails?,1,13 November 2017,"I have to confess not to having seen it yet so make what you will of what follows. I have read extensively about it though (and not just the negative reviews) but I have seen enough to be afraid - very afraid. This is a movie where Hercule Poirot has lost weight but his mustache has gained weight. Who would have thought that this seems to be one of the more interesting things about the film. Look, I acknowledge that it is hard to make a movie when everyone knows the characters, the story and the ending. But when will Hollywood at last wake up and call it done. It does not work to remake films and just stuff them full of ""stars"". You actually have to make it interesting and when dealing with a classic story, this means either being absolutely true to the original or have a new ""take"" on the story that engages people. This movie is a feast of stars but few of then strike me as being particularly suited to their role - as glamorous (and no doubt professional) as they all are. For me an ensemble cast has never been a reason in itself to ante up the cost of a ticket. The other thing that makes me itch with annoyance is when I look as the character list and see characters I never remembered in the original story or any of the past remakes. Characters that seem to be more related to Hollywood's mania for political correctness than fidelity to Agatha Christies' plot. But - they just gotta have a token mix of races just to balance up the list and satisfy 2017 sensibilities. But what does this do to verisimilitude and willingness to honor Agatha's original story? People who love Agatha Christie love the nostalgia inherent in those stories - the feeling of being in the 1920s or 1930s. Update that and you had better have something pretty damn good to replace it - you will lose the Agatha fans and not pick up enough patronage from the general audience who probably don't know the difference between Hercule Poirot and Lady Gaga. Maybe I am doing it a disservice but what I am inclined to say is this - you can't put lipstick on a pig. Though apparently you can put an great big monster mustache on Kenneth Branagh.

The costumes were great. But honestly, really honestly other than having several A Listers or B+ Listers who hardly open their mouths and a Hercules Poirot in Branagh not in the same class as Finney or David Suchet I would say that TV does these thrillers much much better these days.

Who else should the reigns be given to then to Kenneth Branagh for such a great book?Murder on the Orient Express (2017) follows the famous inspector Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh with a ravishingly wonderful moustache) finishing up a case in Istanbul before taking a well deserved break on the one of a kind train the Orient Express, however while on the train shady business man Edward Ratchett gets brutally murdered and it is up to Poirot to solve what might be one of his greatest cases in his life. Because of spoilers I will not say more.When you take on a role that has been perfected according to some it can be a daunting task, it can be even an impossible on according to others but Kenneth Branagh takes the character and makes it his own. In this case Hercule Poirot is an obsessive compulsive who is able to detect what is wrong in the world and ""make it right..."" He is also more proactive in this version with him defending himself at certain points him the film. A change that has had some of the hardcore Christie fans cry in anger is the introduction of a past love interest for Poirot, I think it fits the film and the character Kenneth Branagh is portraying as, it also fits into the themes of order vs. chaos and grief. I also believe that Branagh disappears into the role of Poirot, his accent is more believable then any of the previous versions of the character and I just do not seen an actor playing a role I see Hercule Poirot.The other members of the cast are well chosen for their roles, Johnny Depp is scummy enough to be Ratchett in regards to his performance and Michelle Pfeiffer is brilliant as the irrupting Ms Hubbard while insuring she never gets too annoying and remains sympathetic to the audience. There is also a rather interesting bit of casting with Dr Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom Jr) that adds the commentary of race relations in the 1930s, while it does get dangerously close to peachiness at times it works all the same, I would say the film is decently written if some of the dialogue is a bit blunt. The film very well shot and looks exceedingly beautiful, lots of soft blues and whites paint very breathtaking views of the mountains, the CGI does look a touch cartoonish especially on the wide outdoor shots of the city and the train, this makes it very jarring when the very next shot has the practical effects in full view. I wonder if a few more days refining the CGI would have made it less jarring.Some might consider this movie to be a pointless remake; I think that would depend on what you consider to be pointless in regards to remakes. I do think Murder on the Orient Express is not a pointless remake because it tackles different angles and makes itself unique enough to stand out unlike the Nightmare on Elm Street remake or the Carrie remake. I really enjoyed this movie.",Murder on the Orient Express
362,Frame-By-Frame,Probably the best screen adaptation so far.,6,19 March 2018,"The production, direction, acting all superb. Problem is the original story, it's just ridiculous.

Worth Watching",Murder on the Orient Express
363,E161TZ,Loved it from start to finish,10,7 June 2019,"Accents come in and out, so don't get hung up on these, Judi Dench was awful, another actor should have been cast in my opinion and given the chance. But this I have to say is very good. I have read the book over and over again, I have watched the Albert Finney and David Suchet versions plenty, but I did enjoy this too. Visually it is stunning, the train is magnificent, superb.",Murder on the Orient Express
364,fcullen,"Quibbles aside, I preferred this version to the 1974 film.",7,24 August 2018,"Yes, one can quibble. Yes, Branagh's Poirot moustache was prominent enough to qualify for separate billing, and only once, upon his waking do we see it encased in its own individual overnight casing.
Qualifying as a more serious 'goof; is that the multi passenger-car Orient Express was reported to us, the audience, to be filled to capacity; yet there are only a dozen ticket-holders in evidence. Granted they occupy first-class compartments, and the rest of the coach cars may well be filled withe invisible hoi polloi segregated from everyone rich, famous or had a motive to murder, and forbidden to enter the club or dining cars. It seems the screenwriter was determined (thank heavens) to speed along the journey by ignoring each inconsistency as if it were a third-class passenger trying to enter the clubcar or an avalanche threatening to impede the pace of his plotting. 
On my plus side are the performances, evero one of which equalled or bettered their 1974 incarnation. Of course, no one EVER betters john Gielgud in any role, but I preferred Branagh to Finney, Although AF is a favorite, i found
d his Poirot a bit too stodgy and forced. Michelle Pfeiffer reminded me she knows an d uses her craft, as did Johnny Depp, who masterfully and consistently chose an intonation and vocal rhythm unlike I've heard before from him.
Does anyone know the background of Sergei Polunin? Is he related to that clown genius Slava Polunin?
Also on the plus side for me was Kenneth Branagh's direction. The 1974 version moved like cold molasses, and some of the acting seemed like star turns rather than ensenble work. I appreciated Branagh's comparatively brisk direction that momentarily whisked us though and past an infelicity in the script. The denouement chugged and then halted along with the train. Perhaps it was blocking: the actors arrayed in a row, waiting for Poirot as if they were at an employment agency agency awaiting a chcck and, hopefully, their next gig. Yet I do not regret for the two hours spent in their company.",Murder on the Orient Express
365,indyj1,I'll Tell You Whodunit - Kenneth Brannaugh,2,21 November 2017,"The true crime in this film is how badly Kenneth Brannaugh's hubris murdered a nearly century-old classic character and made a tremendous case for an ending to remakes, as this one totally spit on the 1974 Sidney Lumet version as well as the novel.It's really a shame that Brannaugh once again used a film he was directing to highlight himself as much as possible at the expense of making a good movie. This could have been a modern day ensemble cast re-telling of a classic tale. But thanks to Brannaugh, it instead was a complete and unnecessary overhaul of a great story for the worse. For some reason, Hercule Poirot is now part James Bond, and while it was one thing to add a little diversity to the cast, it was completely ridiculous to then add a ton of garbage about racism.If you're not very familiar with Agatha Christie you may find something good in the film.

He has twelve suspects that can be the murderer but he has to find which one is it, while also everyone isn't really helping because no one is really answering his questions.Let's start with the performances, everyone is truly great in the movie especially Kenneth Branagh. He gives one of the best performances of the year. The beginning of the movie is very unexpected because it's very light hearted and funny. There is a scene were we see how good Hercule is at being a detective and then the next scene we get told how good he is, even tough we just saw it. When the murder happens then the movie starts getting good the story is very interesting and we are invested in it. But when you know who the killer is after that they try to make this statement about revenge and it's just stupid and not logical, no spoilers.This movie is fine, it's perfectly watchable but the end is just dumb and it's a shame because I felt like this could be one of the best movies of the year and it's not even close. It's a movie with a good story, great acting but the tone of the movie is just all over the place. If you want to see this movie then know that it's nothing special, but if you have doubts then just skip it.",Murder on the Orient Express
367,nelleke-97387,Rather boring with wasted talents,3,21 November 2017,"I was disappointed by this movie, because it had a top cast, and undoubtedly a very good crew, but the movie is too static and too boring. Of course, if you have never read Agatha Christies story you will like her story, because it is unique. But the scriptwriter and director of this movie could have done so much more with the great talents who were at his disposal. I do understand the fact that there's a lot of money in the ticket sale at this moment, just because the movie uses the great name of Agatha Christie. I do see the good work of the camera men and the dedication of the actors, but ..the scriptwriter and the director haven't had any real inspiration to get the great actors into their job: great acting.

Appallingly awful; it actually led me to revisit the David Suchet version made for British television, and upgrade my previously poor opinion of that strangely conceived version of Agatha Christie's best book.
Of course, neither is a match for the extraordinary 1974 Sidney Lumet film, with its extraordinary cast and transcendent Richard Rodney Bennett score--despite the eccentric (but ultimately quite serviceable) performance of Alfred Finney as Poirot. But the Suchet version is better than this monstrosity.
The less said about Branagh the actor's crazy rendition of the detective the better...other than to wonder how Branagh the director let him get away with it (or those mustaches!).
Poor KB has not been himself since the break with Emma Thompson. Almost all of his excellent films were made before that divorce. Since then he has become progressively more self-indulgent and commercialized. If not his muse (or perhaps even a co-creator), she certainly seemed to supply some kind of governor, which is now sorely missed.

I have long been a fan of Agatha Christie and attempted to read all her books in a twelve month period. Unfortunately I only managed 56, but I digress.
This film was quite simply a Branagh ego trip. His depiction of Poirot must have had Agatha turning in her grave. The intense blue eyes, his head of hair and the ludicrous moustache were most certainly not as Agatha had described or intended.
I cannot comprehend how such a blockbuster cast of some truly great actors could have been persuaded to be involved in this drivel, they must have had a very large tax bill to pay for them to be in this waste of everyone's time.
This is a remake that should have been left unmade, I thought the Albert Finney portrayal was bad but at least the cast in that version was first class, but Branagh has taken it to a new depth.

375,moviebuffchick,Great cast and decent plot... yawn worthy execution,4,9 November 2017,"This movie got off to a VERY slow start somehow got even SLOWER and finally climaxed and all came together with like 17 minutes left. I found myself either bored or REALLY bored for the vast majority of it. It's not that it's NOT interesting... it just never REALLY grabs you like a mystery should. Protagonist – The detective played by Kenneth Branagh – Very cliché character with a distracting mustache akin to a combination of the Swedish chef from The Muppet Show and the Monopoly Man.Character development – The only one with any real character development was the Protagonist. The opening scene to demonstrate how great of a detective he is was extremely forced mainly because the point of it was just so painfully clear.Cast – great but grossly underused (considering the talent that was all there).Costumes – Great. One of the best things about the movie.Plot – Murder mystery on a train I love a good mystery but this plot was long and drawn out. I do believe that the end had a (slight) payoff. But if you've seen the original there's no payoff for you. Score – Lazy and unimpressive Visually – Well the train scenes were pretty cool.Pacing – Went from slow to slower to OMG please hurry up and find the killer so I can go home.Overall I wouldn't recommend running out to see this in the movie theater. Even if classic murder mysteries are your thing this can definitely wait for Redbox. I give it a 4 out of 10 I don't think this was a pointless remake, I think they just missed the mark.Find me on Twitter and YouTube for audio reviews @MovieBuffChick1",Murder on the Orient Express
376,joonaslaine,Good adaptation of the book,8,31 March 2019,"It's hard to turn a well written mystery into a movie. This, I would say, does pretty good job at it. Lots of the elements are well put and modifications from the book are done well enough. Also the actors are good and pretty much many of the best have been gathered for this. Towards the end, it gets harder for the movie to keep the excitement up to par like the movie does and the ending takes a bit away from the movie by being so oddly put.Nice movie, good murder mystery with the comedy value of Hercule Poirot.",Murder on the Orient Express
377,alex_moerke,Kenneth Branagh's one man show,5,25 September 2020,"Don't get me wrong, I really like Branagh's performances, and his depiction of the famous Agatha Christie detective is no exception, though he plays it with a little too much pathos and self-indulgence for my liking at least. The main problem might be that we do not get any background of the detective's biography, only a couple of scenes where he looks at a photograph of his dead wife and mumbles to himself. At least for me, that isn't enough to get the emotions across or make him an empathetic character whatsoever.I must admit I haven't watched any of the earlier film adaptations of the story or even read the book yet, so the reveal at the end was a rather interesting and new concept to me (though I managed to figure it out a few minutes before). Problem is the path to the answer to the great whodunnit question is pretty muddled, most of the time it feels like major parts of the investigation are left out of the script - either in order to cut the run time or to make the detective seem smart (a typical problem with the Sherlock Holmes character). Thus it doesn't really feel like you're being invited to be a part of the investigation, instead the viewer is confined to watching from afar, lacking relevant information most of the time.I also have an issue with the movie's overall style. It tries to capture the atmosphere of the contemporary time the plot is set in, but it's look is way too clean and the abundance of CGI and green screen scenes do their part in cementing the feeling that we as viewers are not really there with the characters. Peter Jackson's King Kong did a much better job with this, though they used their fair share of CGI themselves.",Murder on the Orient Express

About the only difference is that it's not artificially dyed black, which Branagh could not have pulled off in a million years. It's a relic of a bygone era, the mark of a gentleman imprinted on by an autistic childhood Poirot, along with the wired-in sensibilities of right, wrong, and a sense of patterns in human behavior.People seem to want to pick one Poirot and crown him king: Suchet, or Ustinov, or Branagh. I don't, I just think they're different Poirots, just as there are different Spidermans. This is a psychological Poirot, a Poirot absorbed with being authentic because he cannot be other.

It's hard to even pay attention to what the characters are saying, how the plot is developing, or other details of the scene when that face-rat is on screen.However, the primary failing is simply that even great talent and generous resources cannot always produce great movies.

There are SO many characters that need to be developed for both the mystery and for the sake of just developing the characters so we care. But 2 hours isn't a lot of time. If it weren't a cast jam-packed with stars, it would have been even harder to care about them. Because there were sooo many characters, I found myself a bit bored at times. It was just impossible to get to know everyone enough to feel invested in them. That said, the conclusion at the end was quite good - how it all came together and the who/what/why/how of the murder. I hadn't evet read the book, so I didn't know how it would end, and the conclusion did surprise me. If you're looking for a suspense/thriller, this is not that.

384,Obi_Bamm_Karaoke,A Nice Change Of Pace And A Solid Throwback,9,9 November 2017,"When was the last time Hollywood gave us a true old school style ""whodunit"" type of film? (Don't strain your brain here. You can take it as rhetorical.) These types of stories, where a detective is presented with a crime scene and figures it all out with just their intellect and powers of observation have always been a big part of my life. Trying to figure out the culprit before its eventual reveal was always challenging to me, and putting these stories on the big screen have kind of faded into the background. So, what do you do when you want to bring them back? Call Kenneth Branagh.In his latest film, he brings to life one of the most famous detective novels in Agatha Christie's ""Murder on the Orient Express"". He plays the famous (and infamous, depending on who you are) Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, who is taking a bit of a vacation on his way to his next case on the famous Orient Express. Unfortunately, fate has its own plans for him as a murder most foul (I have always wanted to use that phrase in a review) happens during a snowstorm that derails the train. No one is seen by Poirot as innocent as he questions the passengers, follows the clues, and races against time to solve the case before the local authorities arrive and could accuse the wrong person of the murder.OK, so let me run down the cast for you: Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom, Jr., Tom Bateman, Josh Gad, Penelope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, Olivia Coleman, Willem Defoe, and Dame Judi Dench. And yes, they are ALL in this thing, as well as Branagh, who also directed. Given all of that paired with the fact that this runs less than two hours, and I was intrigued on multiple levels. And trust me here: this film does not disappoint. Sure, there are some liberties taken from the source material, but none of them are so far out of the norm that will drive the fans of any previous iterations of this story. Branagh is truly enjoyable as the character who is a genius but has his own issues that actually enhance his powers of observation, and his direction is top-notch here. This is gorgeously shot, including a few shots where there is a nod to the old ways of effects, giving a tighter and more nostalgic feel to the modern telling of this tale.The performances here are exactly what I expected from a cast of this caliber. With a story that has been around as long as ""Murder on the Orient Express"" has been (the book was written in 1934), there is a bit of a minefield when it comes to bringing it to life that could easily fall down the slope into parody or cariacature, but diverse screenwriter Michael Green, whose resume covers everything from ""Green Lantern"" to ""Everwood"" and even ""Logan,"" is able to write dialogue that lets the actors really get into the skins of these characters to treat them with the proper respect and dignity. Yes, there ARE a few liberties taken with the characters themselves, but there was nothing done that gave me even a little bit of growling. Each character has its own arc and motivations that work into the larger picture in a way that is engaging with no wasted space at all.There will be people that will find this film to be a bit outlandish, but I feel that those people are those that have not taken the time to really study the genre. Not every film has to dumb itself down to cater to the lowest common denominator, and I really enjoy it when a film tells me to engage my suspension of disbelief and simply entertain me. For great escapism and a reminder of a simpler time, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" achieves this goal for an audience that can truly appreciate its greatness.",Murder on the Orient Express
385,linnet100,"Forget the sniffy critics, this is a fabulous film",10,5 November 2017,"Kenneth Branagh does it again. For many years the sniffy set of Guardian-types would turn up their Metropolitan noses at Agatha Christie. Her writing was, evidently, not high-brow, she churned out too many and (horror of horrors) she wrote airport thrillers. But Christie understood human nature in its myriad forms and she wrote accordingly: at times with brilliance.It is this which Kenneth Branagh so fabulously unveils in his Murder on the Orient Express. Yes, he has assembled a world class cast of superstar actors, but it's Branagh himself, both as actor and Director, who pulls the real meaning of this story out.This is a tale of loss, sorry, unrequited grief and, above all, revenge. You don't get much more powerful emotions in human existence and these are wonderfully executed here. It's fantastic, even if you know the plot. Go and see it and watch this wonderful tale again from a different perspective. Don't go just for light-hearted entertainment. It is that on one level. But it's also a tale which plumbs the depths of human existence: what Poirot calls 'the poison of deep grief.'Fabulous film.",Murder on the Orient Express

It's almost begging for it.If you put the two films side by side I would defy anyone to discover a single line of dialog that appears in both films. It seems quite deliberate.It's not out of the question to remake some of the characters, as they obviously do. After all, it's Agatha Christie, not Shakespeare. I prefer the claustrophobic feeling of the first film with everyone stuck on board the train, but to shoot some scenes outdoors is a fair interpretation. All filmmakers make alterations. But to do so to this degree shows lack of respect for the source material. Such wild moments as the shooting incident (actually, two shooting incidents) will make Christie fans wince. Branagh is fine as Hercule Poirot. With a better script his performance would be considered memorable. (I wouldn't dare say ""And with a different director"", for Branagh has directed some fine films.) Most of the performances are serviceable, if not particularly memorable. And the scenery is great, if you think that Agatha Christie and CGI belong together.The ending is horribly maudlin, as opposed to the delightfully tongue-in-cheek feel of the earlier film.When I was in college, PBS did a series on all of Shakespeare's plays. I don't recall which play it was, but the day after it aired my English professor asked us ""Did you all watch ""Hey, Shakespeare. Up yours!"" last night?""This isn't quite on that level.

393,magnusmax,"Murder on the Orient Express: A Chugging, Steaming Adventure (Murder on the Orient Express Spoilery Review)",7,4 January 2018,"Murder on the Orient Express is a delightfully calm and thoughtful picture, presented by director and star Kenneth Branagh in the now-novel 70mm film, and thus becoming only the fifth release in such a format during the current millenium. Though I passed on the opportunity to view the film in 70mm, I can safely presume on the elegance accompanying all of its lovely artistically panoramic wide angles. I deeply appreciate a contemplative and tranquil film - standing in such sharp contrast with the inundation of clamorous, loud and often witless matter we are ceaslessly confronted with - and Murder ticks these crucial boxes.I haven't read the book on which this adaption was based, nor can I very succinctly recall the 70's rendition, and so I can hardly comment on the originality or possible modifications this version may have entertained. Regardless, it is hardly an understatement to say that the ending largely ruined the film for me. *SPOILER ALERT* Sadly, Poirot fails in his post as detective when he essentially looks the other way, allowing the guilty criminals to part ways and leave almost entirely unchastised. At an earlier point, the Belgian detective had remarked on how he saw only good and evil - no grey areas. However, by the end, our supposed hero (and this seems to me the true motivational power behind the story) has ""converted"" to a sort of corruptive empathy which leads him to deny justice its due - something he ironically tries to avoid, in the very act of negating judgement on the felons. True justice requires the requital of damage rendered, yet in this case justice has come to Rachett, while the murderers (let it not be forgotten what a great offence cold-blooded murder is) escape scot-free, without any necessary reparation for their wrongs. Perhaps the outcome would be somewhat different, had the offenders admitted their culpability and thenceforth resolved to make recompense and amend their lives for the better. For all the audience knows, another murder would not be unthinkable to these people, since as Poirot points out: Once one has murdered a first time, it is far easier to murder a second. As it is, Murder monstrously humanises an act obviously heinous - the premeditated theft of another's life. *SPOILERS END*Moving on to a happier subject, the film's acting is reinvigorating and fresh. Rather than the crowded number of Oscar-winning or nominated actors and actresses obstructing the story, they all lend the afore-mentioned an interesting facet; in the face of which, unfortunately, some feel a little sidelined or unexplored. Kenneth Branagh's Poirot isn't so damnably distracting as some reviewers have made out, although admittedly his wonderous moustache does draw the fascinated viewer's eyes at times. More concerningly, at some point during the movie, he faces away from the camera, and his large and all-too-smooth ear shows itself evidently prosthetic. He is a man with flair and yet sentimentality plagues him, reminding him from time to time of his lost love of former years. Josh Gad plays a slippery yet finally emotional character (somewhat redeeming in the face of such horrors as Olaf and LeFou) who delivers an interesting performance. Daisy Ridley adds a fresh face to the cast, proving her talent is not limited to intergalactic battles. Johnny Depp plays a thieving, extortive rogue well - a personality surprisingly distinguished from his previous roles. Altogether, the varied cast functions far better than I originally anticipated. Visual effects aid the story without casting too great a shadow of trickery over the movie on a whole. We see lightening and plenty of snow, but they aren't too gratuitous. I noticed that throughout the film, especially the first half, we are presented with a number of delicious vistas which set a rather uneven mood. Though the spectacles are artfully produced, they seem a little meaningless, failing to really push the sum atmosphere of the movie, as they do not (for the most part) carry well into the following interior train sequences. Murder is also an interesting film, as it seems to me to fall into a unique category - hardly a standard crowd-pleaser, yet not exactly an arthouse production. Instead, it seems to play with elements of both worlds, becoming thus a sort of hybrid, at least in my opinion. Some shots in this movie seem largely artistic, but in most senses it takes an approach more widely pleasing. The cinematography delivers very thoughtful, aesthetically pleasing and unique angles In closing, I recommend Murder on the Orient Express not as a morally sound piece of cinema, but certainly as an entertaining, considerate story that will be especially effective on viewers unaquainted with the mystery's solution. It is a credit to the team who put it together, and had I missed seeing the movie in the cinema, I would eagerly await its DVD release.",Murder on the Orient Express
394,austrohungaro,"Why, why, why, Mr Branagh?",5,3 December 2017,"Went to see it with my friends this afternoon... as one thinks that a title like this has to be good and there's somehow no way they can destroy such a wonderful story, but the changes made by Mr Branagh to the story are absolutely meaningless, they add nothing to the plot and simply answer to... do they ever answer to any reason? Maybe the market. Let's check out a few of this changes...1- The character of the Swedish nanny has been changed and now is, I guess, a Spaniard... a Spaniard because Pilar is a thoroughly Spanish name, although... Estravados? Such name doesn't exist in Spain but, yes, there is a Pilar Estravados in Christie's book Hercules Poirot's Christmas. Really can't think of a reason for this change. My compatriot Penelope Cruz isn't a great actress, let's face it, but she's well known here, in Italy and in Hollywood -I wonder why-, so maybe... are you using her as a decoy to trap the Spanish speaking public? As for the name... are you perhaps thinking Mr. Branagh, that if this movie works well -I very much doubt it- you can start directing an Agatha Christie movie every year and maybe you want to include Ms Cruz in one or more of them? Heaven forbid! 2- The character of the Italian chauffeur has been changed and now is a Latin guy!!! Are you being politically correct Mr Branagh? Really, if dear Mrs Christie wrote about an Italian driver we want to see an Italian driver on the movie adaptation, if she included in her story a sweet Swedish nanny, we want to see a Swedish nanny. Especially because the change you've made ads Absolutely nothing to the story. As for the name... Biniamino! are you inventing names too? You're such a creative guy! A Mexican guy with a misspelled Italian first name, so very creative. And the last name, Márquez... maybe because Márquez is the only Spanish name you remember after the famous Colombian writer? But including Manuel García-Rulfo in the movie you're calling for a Mexican public... you're a clever guy, Mr. Branagh! 3- And yet another change. The role of Colonel Arbuthnot isn't a Colonel anymore, it's a doctor and, oh my, he's black. You're so very politically correct, Mr. Branagh! You could have used a black actor in the role of the colonel... but wait, I very much doubt there would be retired black colonels in the British army in the early 30s, so to be politically correct you've made a believable Scottish character vanish from the story to create a black doctor in the 1930s Britain that travels around the world... I don't find quite believable this part of the story. The story takes place around 1930... not in the 80s. Of course the change of character here changes something in the story: Dr. Arthbutnot shoots Monsieur Poirot... wooooooow, that's a bit of exciting action in the movie! Really, Mr. Branagh? 4- Why changing the character of the French conductor from the father of the poor French maid who is falsely accused and commits suicide to the brother of the poor French maid who is falsely accused and commits suicide? Wait... Marwan Kenzari is a good actor, and he's a hot guy. Also he's a Dutch of Northern African descent. Once again, you're catering for all public, don't you Mr. Brannagh. There are great French actors of Northern African descent who could play the role of the father. But they don't attract young girls, don't they? 4- I'm not going to talk about more character changes, but really, is there anything less convincing than a Hungarian duke that's a classic ballet dancer? And this ads SO very much to the plot, really! I couldn't help but laughing at Monsieur Poirot running after and fighting with Mr. McQueen... so very not Agatha Christie's, but some action was needed in the movie, wasn't it Mr. Branagh? Really, a movie like this relies -or should rely- on good acting and a good director. The acting isn't bad at all... not too sure about the direction.The main reason for not liking this movie is that changes on the plot can be made when adapting a novel (or maybe should be made), and so did Mr Wilder when he filmed Witness for the Prosecution, and it even seems Mrs. Christie loved it and congratulated him for the changes made, but changing characters in a story that ad nothing to the story in order to attract every possible public that's plain bad direction, that shows no interest in the story, just a wish to make the movie more profitable. Finally, I absolutely hated the final moment when the British officer tells Monsieur Poirot that he's needed in Cairo... are you really thinking of filming an unnecessary version of Death on the Nile? Are you perhaps trying to turn Monsieur Poirot into a sort of Art Deco James Bond? Are you threatening us with a Hercules Poirot franchise? Oh my, they're right: the movie business is really f*cked up!Bye bye Mr. Branagh, I guess we'll never meet again at the movies.",Murder on the Orient Express

Cause that will make this film a total trash and a total waste of time.The film started as good and while the film continues, the film gets boring and boring. Plus the bad CGI, a non-sense chase scene, and some of the actors are not helpful at all they are like narrating the lines. Also what's wrong with the Ballet Dancer's Attitude and personality? Maybe cause he got only a few scenes and lines JK. The only thing I like in this movie is the Camera, Kenneth Brannagh and Johnny Depp's act.",Murder on the Orient Express
396,danielfnemes,Superb cinematography,9,16 March 2018,"I have heard and red negative comments before seeing the movie and I prepared for worse.
Instead, it was a pleasant surprise. Most of the people who gave negative reviews addressed the ""version"" of Poirot which is not faithful to the book, the pace of the movie which is too slow, the other great actors who could not develop their characters. There is also great nostalgia in comparing it with the ""perfect"" Sidney Lumet version. I will not argue on this issue, I will say only one thing: get over it people!. Get a life! It's not the Bible, it's just a book which has been translated into a movie. There is no ""perfect"" version in art. I mean look at the Guy Ritchie version of Sherlock Holmes. Nothing could get further from the books. But I like it as well as I like the Granada series which is so brilliant and accurate to the books.I say the movie must be watched at least once for the visuals. The cinematography is fantastic. The colors, camera angles, costumes, sets, landscape, the atmosphere are just gorgeous. One can say anything about this movie but cannot deny it is very good looking one.
Go see the movie and feast your eyes. You will not regret it.",Murder on the Orient Express

399,BadSausages,Disappointing (some comments may be considered spoilers),5,16 November 2017,"Beautiful sets, especially of train cars. But, other than the first two scenes, and first few minutes, of the film, in Jerusalem and Istanbul, all we see are four train cars: the Pullman Coach (sleeping compartments); the Dining Car; the luggage car (briefly); and the bar car. Almost all of the film takes place in the sleeping and dining cars. These are very narrow, confined spaces. So, the action is very limited. This isn't an action movie. But all that anyone can do is stand or lie down in a compartment in the sleeping car, stand or sit in the dining car. We're not talking about the absence of running, jumping, chasing, or whatever. We're talking about the near absence of body movement. Head turn. Vertical arm movement. Maybe a small hand gesture.The acting was very good, of course. Top notch cast. The main cast (Detective Poirot, the Victim, and the Usual Suspects) includes Legends Judi Dench and Derek Jacobi, Stars Kenneth Branagh, Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp, Penélope Cruz, Establisheds Josh Gad, Olivia Colman, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Marwan Kenzari, Lucy Boynton, and Leslie Odom, Jr., and Newcomers Sergei Polunin and Daisy Ridley.I'm familiar with the works of the Legends and the Stars. I'm not at all familiar with the works of the Establisheds. I saw clips of Josh Gad in the abomination that is Disney's live-action Beauty and the Beast. Not particularly impressive, but that's no surprise given the vehicle. But I liked Gad's performance here. I liked everyone's performance. Never heard of Sergei Polunin. And, no particular reason, I don't expect to hear of him again. Among the Establisheds, it seems to me, Gad and Odom are the two most upwardly mobile.Ridley's only other film work, of course, I know. Really no surprise that she, rather than some other similar age actress with more film credits (and I mean no one in particular), is here. Ridley held her own in good company. She, too, seems to be upwardly mobile.Unfortunately, there wasn't much for any of the actors to do. I've never read the book and I've never (unless I've surpassed the memory of it) seen the 1974 film or any other adaptation. From what I understand, this is pretty much the standard version. Nothing unusual. Which makes me wonder why anyone cares at all. I found the story to be not at all interesting.The film has two components: physical searching for clues; and interviews with the suspects.Every interview goes like thisPoirot: ""Who are you and why are you on this train?""Person: ""I'm person X, profession Y, going to Z for A reason.""Poirot: ""No. You are person M, profession N. You are lying. And you are a suspect.""There are 13 of these. Maybe a quarter of the film.(Possible Spoiler) I thought the solution was obvious before the halfway mark. I mean, after two or three interviews of suspects, it became, ""WTF? Is anyone not ...?"" And the answer is, ""No. Everyone is ..."" Which doesn't leave anything to the imagination.I'm not a fan of mystery fiction. I haven't read any. I have no intention of reading any. I've seen some TV mysteries: Columbo (not whodunit, but howcatchim); Murder She Wrote (my mother loved this, of course); miscellaneous others over the years. It seems to me, a good mystery doesn't drop all the clues at the beginning, but drops them in what seems to be a natural sequence.I don't know how this story was told in writing or previous adaptations, but it seems to me the writers of this film should have rearranged things quite a bit. There were no really dramatic moments. No ahas. The actors weren't part of a cohesive whole story. They didn't interact in any meaningful way. There weren't dialogues so much as a bunch of brief monologues or just statements.(Compare, for example, with the scene in You've Got Mail where Meg Ryan, Jean Stapleton, Steve Zahn, and Heather Burns are standing at the cash register talking about the rooftop killer. I like these actors. But a scene from a silly little comedy shouldn't be, but is, better than any scene in MotOE 2017.)And some of the things that people say and do, maybe they're supposed to be red herrings, but, in the end, they just don't fit. For example, papers being destroyed to prevent discovery of a crime that the criminal had no reason to commit; and one person taking blame for what another person has been accused of doing, even though the blame-taker knows the other person didn't do what the person has been accused of doing, and neither of these people handle the situation in a (dramatically) reasonable way. Worst of all, when these things are happening, we already know they aren't correct or relevant.(Possible Spoiler) The only dramatic moments are those that appear in one of the trailers; about 60 seconds of a two hour film.And who the hell is Katherine? or Catherine?",Murder on the Orient Express

But the cast wasn't way I had to see the movie; I had to see it because Agatha Christie is one of the world's greatest murder mystery writers!So when Hercule Poirot travels towards a case, he decides his ride will be a short holiday. Sadly, he quickly finds himself inspecting a case along his travel! He looks from a countess, to a doctor. From a chauffeur to a footman. From a co-worker to an actress and dancer- so many suspects... but Poirot gets it figured out. The movie is excellent and visually stunning! With an amazing cast and accents out the wazoo- I loved the movie just as much as the original. Sadly, I can't tell you too much about the movie without giving it away! Even stating the stars and what they do could mess things up for you! Primarily when I say who gets killed - but Dame Judi Dench is magnificent.

I would have certainly enjoyed this movie more had I not read the book beforehand. This movie just comes off as a modern mystery story to an audience who has no knowledge of Agatha Christie and the great detective Hercule Poirot. The movie tries to apply more to the audience by adding some things I find irrelevant or unnecessary. Alas, I can definitely say I was dissapointed watching this movie in comparisment to the book.

406,puppyzwolle,Ken Bran does it again.,9,7 February 2018,"Kenneth Branagh is famous for recreating theater on film. That is exactly what he did with a story. But sadly this wasn't a play but a mental exercise. And it shows. All info and events need to be crammed in an acceptable runtime.The cast of 14 main characters makes for a fragmented story that is hard to follow even if you know the story and know what to pay attention to. It works in a book and will get you in a zen state (yes there is scientific proof that actually happens) but in a movie the mind wanders and.....that is a bad thing.The film is visually stunning, the actor are great in the limited time they get to shine..... I even like this version of the Belgian detective that is (for me) a far cry from the man portrayed in the book.It is a valiant effort that tries to stay true to the dry story telling of Agatha Christy. It works but for some this may be to Shakespearean to enjoy. I for one await the 4+ hour directors cut where all the left out pieces.",Murder on the Orient Express
407,BogdanH,Only watch if you don't know the story,6,28 January 2018,"When young, I was a big fan of Agatha Christie and I've read most of her books. Most of them have a ""unexpected twist"" at the end, which is probably the reason one just need to grab her next book. Needless to say, A. Christie was a master in playing games with readers mind. But you know how's with the stories that have ""unique"" twist at the end: one is surprised (jaw-drop) only reading/seeing them for the first time.
Murder on the Orient express is no exception: if you know ""the story"", then there's no point to watch this remake. Actually, compared to the book, this remake is quite poor and I can imagine, those who didn't read the book, may be disappointed (in sense ""what made this title so famous?""). We have a bunch of great actors, but none of them leaves a mark -except K.Branagh playing famous detective. I would blame a script for that. Let me explain:
In A.Christie's books, reader has always the feeling he can solve the mystery. Of course, reader's guess is usually wrong.. still, even after the crime is solved, reader still believes he could solve that, if he would pay enough attention when reading. Now, in this movie, that feeling doesn't happen.. it can't happen, because there's no time for small details and hints.
Regardless of my title above, I recommend the book.Being picky about details myself: landscape between Vinkovci and Brod (where story happens), is in reality totally flat.",Murder on the Orient Express

410,John-564-342449,"The 65mm cinematography is marvelous, but Sidney Lumet's 1974 version is still superior",6,11 November 2017,"The only reason, why I write a review for this rather mediocre film is the stunning 65mm cinematography. I've seen it on a big screen, sitting in the center close to the screen and it was visually very impressive: The amount of detail you get with 65mm is astonishing and a reminder of how poor many digitally shot movies look today compared with 'the good old days'. The actors' skin looks organic, the highlights are not 'blown out' and you see a great richness in color and contrast. Because the movie demands for splendid production design and costumes, the 65mm can shine in its full glory.Like Kenneth Branagh's update of ""Sleuth"" before, this is an inferior and misjudged version of well-known source material. In this case, Branagh was a victim of the Baz-Luhrmann-school: The direction forces a comical style on the material, that's too over-the-top even for Agatha Christie's rather artificial murder mysteries. No, I'm not only talking about the now infamous mustache of Poirot, which is so absurd-looking, that it distracts from the story, but everything else is slightly off, including the good cast, which does not compare to Lumet's 1974 ensemble. Lumet's film is a small masterpiece of direction and ensemble acting, where every element is in its place and the plot works. I still remember how much fun it was watching it on TV as a child. And it was so well told, that I understood the rather complicated plot then, but now - even as an adult who knew the story - I found it hard to follow. You really get the feeling, that neither the screenwriter nor the director are especially interested in the mystery aspect of the story. They focus instead on grotesque behavior, funny accents, racism in 1930s Europe and all looking 'postcard good'. And it does, but people who see this expect some excitement and elegant storytelling, too. Sure, some people already know the ending and the movie is easy to spoil, but a huge part of the young audience didn't read the novel or saw the other versions, so there would still be the possibility of a great mystery. I don't understand, why they cared more for comic effect than suspense and surprise. The audience is smarter than that and deserves better...Reading Agatha Christie and seeing Lumet's adaptation is like assisting Hercule Poirot in solving a crime. That's the fun of it: You usually get all the information you need to participate and it usually plays fair with the logical conclusions, even if it's far-fetched. But in this movie the mystery is told so fast, that there is no chance of participating - and therefore no suspense. This movie fails at understanding the appeal of Agatha Christie novels. It was never the mustache. And the few inventions by the screenwriter, that are not part of Agatha Christie's novel as far as I remember, are trying to make Hercule Poirot's character 'more complex', I think, but that's not the point of Christie. Poirot is only an avatar for the audience who wants to assist in solving an exciting mystery. Poirot is not the center, therefore all additional scenes to give him a 'character journey', to introduce him in Jerusalem and give him a 'big dramatic speech' at the end are distracting additions, because it all takes away from the mystery-solving-fun. The storytelling is out of balance. I'm pretty sure, Agatha Christie would have hated this one.Recommended mostly for the 65mm imagery and the production design and costumes, but don't forget to see Sidney Lumet's superior version, too.",Murder on the Orient Express

It's a simple story that is easy to follow and it is a story first and foremost. It's not one of those films where the protagonist attempts to dazzle you with his intellectual brilliance, or where he challenges you to a duel of wits. No. It is a process of discovery and the detective, throughout the story, keeps his cards open, letting you know as much as he does. I loved Kenneth Branagh's style of acting. When I found out Johnny Depp was in the film, I automatically assumed he had the leading role, but he didn't. I haven't seen Kenneth Branagh in any other film prior to this and I'm very pleasantly surprised. He managed to completely win me over. The character of Hercule Poirot is all about charm and elegance, and this actor managed to pull it off. In fact, he was the most believable of all the fictional characters on the train.I loved the atmosphere. Loved the choice of angles - to shoot lengthy scenes from the outside of the train, or to go full overhead like in a computer game. Everything about the movie I loved.

418,Barbara-4,Garbage - review with spoilers,5,12 November 2017,"If you want to see Murder on the Orient Express, check out the 1974 version starring Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot. It is a wonderful movie, very close to the book. And guess what.... spoilers...In this movie...Hercule Poirot does not get attacked by *any* of the suspects, still less shot by one of them who also confesses to the murder.Apparently Brannagh thought modern day audiences couldn't sit through a murder mystery without 3 fist fights - and a shooting.Then of course there's the political correctness. It's set in the right time period, the 1930s, but the doctor who has nothing to do with the crime has been morphed with Arbuthnot, one of the killers - and is now black.I suppose that's okay, if it's true that one black man per medical class is allowed in, in 1930s England...but it's just dumb - and the fact that he actually shoots Poirot - when no matter who he may be, there's no evidence against him or the white woman he's in love with - is just stupid.Then there's the most egregious bit - the opening where an Iman, a Rabbi and a Priest are accused of stealing a valuable relic at the Wailing Wall where thousands of people of different ethnicities are waiting. And of course it isn't one of these three religious people - no, it's the head of the British police who steals it in order to foment discontent and cement British rule, apparently. Stupid stupid stupid.Then there's the fact that Poirot has been turned into Mr. Monk. He steps into a pile of dung with one foot. Poirot is a neat freak, and a clean freak, not a 'balance' freak.

I admit that being a fan of David Suchet's defining, penultimate interpretation of Poirot, I wonder what gave Branagh the idea that he could even come close. Sure, Branagh is a fine actor, but he's barely second best to Suchet's Poirot. You wonder if Branagh watched the 2010 version of Orient. Despite being a TV production, the 2010 Orient is vastly superior to Branagh's and is the best I've seen (although I haven't seen the 1974 version}.

I decided to give it a try because it was the holidays. I should have listened. I have never, and I mean ever fallen asleep on a movie in a theater before. But my daughter elbowed me, when I began to audibly snore. I was so embarrassed (after all, seeing this movie was my idea) I strongly denied I'd fallen asleep.

423,audacity10,Tedious,2,4 December 2017,"Maybe it was that a stage-play was advertised before the start of the film which depicted a ""lovable"" comedic Karl Marx fighting to get his murderous ideology across that set the tone for this tedious movie. Maybe it was that Murder on the Orient Express was itself typically stuffed to the brim with cultural Marxism that unsettled me during it's 2 hour screen time.So I was already in a bad mood as we entered the world of Agatha Christie's Poirot, following a Jewish boy finding the detective's breakfast in the streets of Israel. From there the cast of characters start to introduce themselves in a range of absurd (a dancer using his dancing skills to beat up some photographers) or dull (Penélope Cruz moaning on about religious stuff) encounters as we make our way towards embarking the Orient Express. The train and the scenery is generally excellent in terms of visuals - and to be fair - the visuals are the only saving grace of the movie. This is where my 2 stars are awarded.From the moment we're on the train, the topic of racism becomes impossible to overlook, and we're ""treated"" constantly with lectures about miscegenation. Ironically (and is always the case) is that while Willem Dafoe's German alias makes outbursts against black people, it shows that the director, Branagh, is inadvertently racially stereotyping Germans as hating non-whites. But if we can manage to ignore the constant race-baiting, what's left in this film is tedious dialogue and characters I don't care about. In the end, I don't care about who the murderer is and I don't care if they're caught.And yet, when the conclusion is drawn that they're all murderers, the result of Poirot letting them go free like he was detective, jury and judge all wrapped up in one was extremely irritating. Who was he to decide whether they should go free?A very tedious and frustrating movie that I've already averted others from wasting their money on going to see.",Murder on the Orient Express

425,bottomsgaming,"All that talent, and so little for anyone to do",4,20 November 2017,"I'll start by admitting I've never read the Agatha Christie novel or the original film. I don't have any details from the original story affecting my opinion of this, for better or worse. Branagh's 2017 version is a competent tale of revenge and redemption, complete with a star-studded cast and an Oscar-worthy mustache. Unfortunately, that's about all it has going for it.I'll get right to it--the movie is boring. And I don't mean that in a ""needs more explosions/I prefer all the MCU movies"" sort of way. I actually have a predisposition for slow paced, dialogue driven films. The thing is, there actually needs to be interesting dialogue/characters for any of it to work. Just about every major character in this movie is played by a well known actor or actress. This alone does not make them interesting, however, and as the movie plods on, we realize that none of them have anything notable to say or do outside of Branagh's Hercule Poirot. Branagh himself actually puts out a respectable performance, and the mustache really is glorious, but no one else has the material or screen time to be anything more than a vehicle for the plot to get to its underwhelming conclusion. Everything looks pretty enough. The movie is well-shot, the costumes are full of life, the characters all look important. Then we find out that the only notable thing about every single person on the train is the fact that they're all coincidentally tied to an older case that (also) coincidentally is the one case that haunts our main character. This leads to the obvious conclusion that every guest must be tied to this in some sort of conspiracy, right? Well, yes. That's it. Except most of the audience will figure this out an hour in, and then be forced to watch the greatest detective in the world slowly figure out the same conclusion over the next hour. This would be fine if the movie was building to something greater and unexpected, or was filled with characters that are fun to watch, or included any instances of smart dialogue that wasn't ham-handedly explaining the simple-yet-rushed plot to the audience. In the end, all we get is the expected conclusion (delivered by Poirot in a five minute expository monologue) tied together with some late themes of revenge and redemption. Nothing about Murder on the Orient Express is explicitly bad or incompetent, but it all just feels simple, rushed, and watered down. Any interesting moments are short lived as the plot rushes to its tired, ""It was everyone"" ending. Not the worst movie you could find yourself watching, but possibly the most uninteresting.",Murder on the Orient Express

I saw all the trailers, and said to myself each time after seeing them, this is going to be great. For the first half of this movie I was right, it was tension filled and entertaining. It took me right along for the ride and I felt like I was the detective solving the mystery. But as I kept watching, my interest kept leaving me, I watched this movie deconstruct itself by the minute and by the end, I found that I had forgotten the overall point of this movie. All of the character alibis became more and more convoluted as I couldn't solve this mystery what so ever. Then once it tells me what actually happened it seemed so stupid that I felt very unsatisfied with the final product.

432,tye1138,Murder on the Orient didn't need a remake.,6,21 November 2017,"Kenneth Branagh is at it again, with a dialog-driven, murder mystery that in a lot of cases, didn't need to be re-made.As a railfan and 70mm buff, this was a movie I've been anxious to watch for quite sometime. Murder on the Orient Express is the very simple ""who done it"" with the twist of a seemingly random journey that puts one of the best detectives in the world, in the heart of a crime only he can solve. The Agatha Christie story has been modified heavily for this new venture, the writers taking some of the best elements of her writing and adding some new twists and turns in hopes to revitalize the story. It's clear from the first scene, Branagh's intentions were to make an ""actor's"" piece, rather than one of sheer entertainment. Where this film falls short is with it's characters, less it's casting choices. Unfortunately, whether due to time or financial constraints, even the most talkative characters feel very flat and missing important dynamics. Every time you want more from them, the filmmakers cut away. Every time the filmmakers show you more, it feels poorly written and doesn't make sense. I would make the assumption it was pretty long and it was substantially cut down. Furthermore, the lead character Hercule Poirot, has a heavy French accent and talks very fast. So much of the critical clever dialog can be missed with the blink of an eye. This is unfortunate because within the script, there are some good moments, it's just the translation from actor to audience, was weak. In terms of the production, this was a massive undertaking because they couldn't afford to shoot on location, so the entire movie was made on the back lot. This includes the grand station at the beginning, nearly all of the train scenes and of course, the mountain causeway which is where most the film takes place. There is ""some"" real train footage in the movie, but only a few seconds here and there. Unfortunately as a consequence, there are a lot of visual effects shots. Mostly set extensions, but almost all of the wide shots of the train, is done in CG, which is unfortunate. Branagh only works on film and he felt this movie deserved the ""royal"" treatment and would be entirely shot on 5 perf 65mm. He had worked with 65mm making 'Hamlet' and was excited to do it again. The cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos, has worked with Branagh a few other times and was excited about working on large format. They shot most scenes with 2 cameras, and some of the bigger scenes that didn't have dialog, they used upwards of three cameras. This allowed them to shoot very fast and with a very experienced cast, it was easy to bang out scenes without much fuss or re- shooting. Since the film was being shot in the UK, they used Cinelab UK's 65mm processing machines and had overnight dailies, which was a perfectly acceptable workflow. The camera seems to be always in motion, either on a dolly, Steadicam or jib/crane. This created a really nice look, along with some excellent lighting choices from Zambarloukos. Instead of using green screen outside the windows of the moving train, VER provided the world's largest LED display solution for a movie. Zambarloukos shot plates in New Zealand on a rail line up in the mountains. They shot with both 65mm and digital cameras and wound up only using the digital media for those plates. With that said, the 65mm format was so crisp, you could tell the background was projected, which was a real shame. Had it been shot on anamorphic 35mm, you may not have been able to tell. I felt over-all cinematography wise, the film was made like a typical Hollywood venture. Outside of a few cool shots, like the Steadicam shot which goes through the entire train and shooting through some of the beautiful glasswork inside the coaches, there wasn't anything really outstanding to see. The production simply felt rushed and they weren't taking many risks, especially in the cinematography department. In summary, the production felt rushed, post felt rushed and even the printmaking and projection felt rushed. This left me semi-unsatisfied and at one point, I nearly dozed off because frankly, it just wasn't that interesting of a movie. There were a lot of great elements, but no glue to hold them together. Technically it wasn't anything to write home about either, which was disappointing. Even the score was very 2nd rate and lackluster, which was a real shame. There really wasn't any ""redeeming"" value to the movie and that's the biggest problem. Worth the watch on home video, but now that the prints are about to be retracted, I wouldn't bother seeing on the big screen. Hopefully Fox makes some money off the prints and see's the value in perhaps striking more for future releases.",Murder on the Orient Express

But the story felt a little sloppy as by the end of the movie you try to piece together the clues to see if they add up. Kenneth Branaghs acted brilliantly as the lead role of the film, but the can't save the film from it's plot-holes and rough script. The movie's reveal of the killer isn't what you'd expect, some may like it, other may not. But with Daisy Ridley's performance, Willem Dafoe's, Michelle Pfeiffer's and Penelope Cruz's the film was entertaining but wasn't expected from the source material of the novel it's based on. Kenneth Branaugh's directing and producing wasn't what it was when he directed Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, Macbeth, and Cinderella. Also he was producer of Thor: The Dark World. Michael Green wrote the screenplay for the movie previously he did Green Lantern back in 2011, this year's Blade runner 2049, Alien Covenant and Logan.

443,MaxHuskins,High budget trash and an absolute waste of time.,5,13 November 2017,"A perfect example of high budget crap. The only thing this movie gets right is the marketing. (Pat your selves on the back creative team behind that, you did a good job and are most likely responsible for 50% of the box office behind this movie.) I felt as it was an absolute waste of my time. This is a high budget movie, filled with top billing actors which are the only two saving graces of the film. It all starts off with an extremely slow first act, filled with pointless character introductions and equally pointless CGI shots. Opening act feels as if someone watched a bunch of old movies thinks a movie is supposed to be but manages to entirely miss the point. This movie has perhaps some of the worst writing I've seen since Suicide Squad and actually shares a lot of traits with it. An ensemble of famous people who play a bunch of over the top but flat and boring characters. It really is the Suicide Squad of non- superhero movies. Out of like 13 people not a single character stands out or feels human. A bunch of loud douchebags. Everyone is written over the top and robotic. I can't blame it on the actors when the script is at fault but you could've just as easily cast Tommy Wiseau and have him run around and yell ""I did nawt kill her, I did nawwt"". The whole plot revolves around a separate crime that we as an audience do not care about in the least. The main character Hercule (I had to look up the names to write this) feels like a cheap Sherlock Holmes and completely fails to portray the ""careless genius"" who is superior to everyone (also who reads Dickens, which makes it worse). They try to establish him as the greatest detective in an opening scene that is so basic and predictable that I as a viewer ""solved the crime"" minutes before the answer is presented, at which we were supposed to be impressed. The casting itself was terrible, they just shoved any A-lister who would say yes with a bonus of an unnecessary amount of bad accents. The rest of the characters were so forgettable I'm not even gonna bother telling you about any of them. The mystery itself felt bland and disconnected. I did not feel engaged at all throughout the movie and kept looking at my clock. The murder, all the clues and revelations felt like they were just dragging out the movie. It was in fact so bland that the Doctor Who interpretation of The Orient Express was just as good if not better. The movie tried to have some comedic moments most of which fell extremely flat. However, the biggest red flag for me was the fact that I was laughing out loud at some of the most serious and important scenes of the movie - including it's revelation and conclusion. I mean there's nothing more hilarious than a character barging into a serious scene with a gun yelling ""NO, I'M THE KILLER!"" Finally, the conclusion of the movie was not only predictable and boring (ruined a great premise/twist though) but just down right stupid. It even featured a possible sequel set up. (Which isn't gonna happen cause this movie flopped). I could keep on ranting about how much I didn't like this movie for a long time, but I'll spare you from it. You want to hear the good? Well, the cinematography was pretty good, also the costumes were great. That's about it. So, if you want to go see an excellent movie that features a train, go watch The Darjeeling Limited, thank Wes and I later. P/S What was up with that ""Last Supper"" shot near the end? I sighed out loud at it.⭐️ 5/10 - Maybe watch it on a plane if there's nothing better to do? - 5/10 ⭐️",Murder on the Orient Express

447,man14,A Poirot for the clinicaly dumb,3,9 March 2018,"Ever since I heard that Kenneth Brannagh was going to direct, produce and star in this movie that I dreaded this would happen, and it did - Brannagh is so self centered that he made the whole film about himself, turning the rest of the cast into mere decorations. He managed to turn this Christie's masterpiece into a self agrandising piece of crap. Let's just say that it makes the 2002 version with Alfred Molina look like a masterpiece in comparison - and that's saying a lot, because it was simply one of the worst films I'd ever seen.
I don't know who the hell Brannagh is supposed to be playing, but it sure as hell isn't Poirot - not the one Agatha Christie wrote about. Anyone who has read her books about the egg shapped belgian sleuth - and I have, all of them, more than once - knows that he's nothing like the buffon Brannagh plays in the movie: Poirot walking on top of the train!?? Going beneath the train!?? Poirot willingly plunging his shoe into a pile of excrements just so both his shoes get equally dirty, all in the name of simetry!?? For the love of all that is holy! Poirot would have an apoplexy if only one of his shoes got accidently dirty with sh@t, can you imagine him doing it on purpose!? And what about that freaking mustache? It's so damn big it becomes distracting. Poirot's mustache is supposed to be big, yes, but not gigantic! And what's with the fly in his chin? Poirot doesn't have one, what was Brannagh thinking? Oh yeah, I forgot, he wasn't. And don't let me get started on the annoyingly fake french accent he uses throughout all the freaking movie - he even mispronounces repeatedly the plural for egg (oeufs), and Poirot is supposed to be a french speaking belgian! 
Also, on this film Poirot doesn't have conversations with people, as he does in the novel, he simply delivers endless monologues, conjuring facts out of thin air (or out of his ass, is more likely), things he couldn't possibly have known. He looks more like a witch than a detective. And he's everywhere, in every freaking scene. Ego much, Brannagh?
Brannagh's direction is so pedestrian it hurts. All those freaking camera angles - shooting the damn train from every possible position, shooting the action literaly from above, - were so ridiculous and pretensious, it's beyond words. It's the worst kind of in your face grandstanding directing you could get.
The screenplay is beyond bad - it completely butchers one of Christie's masterpieces by adding sex and violence that wasn't there, dumbing down her expert character development and plot, and adding artificial diversity just to please the hollywwod pc bullshit brigade. Don't get me wrong, I'm all in favor of diversity, but in movies that take place in na era where diversity exists, like today or the future. But in a story that takes place in 1934, in the most luxurious train in the world? Really? Can you really see a black doctor travelling in first class on the Orient Express in 1934? As much as I hate it, the answer can only be one to anyone familiar with the world's history: hell no! Nevertheless, that's what you have: an amalgamation of two characters into one black british doctor in love with a white middle class english girl, all for the sake of hitting the audience over the head with not so subtle references to the terrible evils of racism. If only Hollywood would get it in their thick heads that audiences only want to be told a good story, not to be preached at every time they go to watch a movie...
In conclusion, this is Poirot for the clinicaly dumb. You want to see the real Poirot, as he should be played? Watch the ITV series ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"" with David Suchet - he IS Poirot, period. Want to watch the best version of this story? Watch the 1974 version, directed by Sidney Lumet and learn how to correctly adapt Agatha Christie. But better yet, buy the freaking novel and read it - you still know what reading an actual book is like, don't you? Either way, do yourself a favor and stay away from this piece of garbage (I'm giving it three stars for the sets and costumes, for Judi Dench and for Johnny Deep, that's it).",Murder on the Orient Express

It's just not as predictable from my side I didn't watch the original one made in 1974 nor read the novel written by Agathe Christy so I'm comparing here and may be if I compared I would have given this remake much lower rating as this what I see from the reviews from people who have watched both no I'm so curious to watch the old one and see how it was made before",Murder on the Orient Express

The 2017 Kenneth Brannagh couldn't survive the comparison and it doesn't. I missed the elegance and the wit. Albert Finney got an Oscar nomination for his Hercules Poirot here Kenneth Brannagh's mustache will get all the attention as well as Johnny Depp's incomprehensible performance.

461,edgepros123,Won't keep me up at night,6,1 December 2017,"Murder on the Orient Express is a lavish, entertaining film that will grab mainstream audiences in an instant. Based on the hit Agatha Christie novel, Murder on the Orient Express follows Poirot as he attempts to solve a case of (you guessed it) murder on the expensive, upper-class European train, the Orient Express. This is clearly a massive ""star actor"" vehicle with many famous faces popping up all over the place. Michelle Pfeifer, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, the suddenly famous Daisy Ridley and of course acting directing star Kenneth Branagh. I must say I enjoyed the film. It never dragged; the pace was solid all the way through. The visual are stunning (although quite obviously fake) and the cinematography is very interesting with the films use of birds eye view for each cabin. The acting on the whole was good although no one ever took any of my interest. There wasn't a defining character that really interested me and invigorated the story. Judi Dench was Judi Dench, Johnny Depp was a less drunk Johnny Depp, and Kenneth Branagh was witty but rather plain to say the least. These problems all most likely arise from how many star actors there are and how little screen time any of them receives mainly to the size of the cast and how short the run time is. Kenneth Branagh is an interesting person. He is clearly a very clever individual capable of directing and starring in his version of Orient Express and his acting is always on point. However, he never really shines. I don't personally hold anything against him but I have never once really seen Kenneth Branagh become engrossed in a character. I feel that he has the potential but never feels he wants to push it. Watching his directing is almost like seeing the same thing occur. I never feel he really pushes the story, style and talent to its most and therefore the final product is a little lacklustre. I feel the real problem behind the film is actually the story. I hate to say this (because of how much of a literary genius Christie is) but the story is actually a little drab. The mystery is interesting while it exists but the ending feels like a cop out. I understand it was probably the first to use this type of ending as a device but there's a reason mystery stories that end in that way have no future. The mystery excites and hypes people up to find out who the killer is. And then it's all of them. I mean, come on. I get that they got around the massive coincidence factor by stating it was all set up before hand and Poirot just happens to be there but I can't stand it. Sorry Ms. Christie. I don't think it's all down to her though. The film obviously adapts from the novel and while the major story elements are there the film will condense and adapt them which I feel has clogged up the story a little. While it never drags, that doesn't mean it doesn't have problems. The film will impress people and make a lot of money, which is what it's designed to do, but at the end of the day the film stands with the words ""Blockbuster"" and ""simple"" all over it. Will it attract attention and make money? Yes. Will it be remembered in 5-10 years? No.",Murder on the Orient Express

The preview made it look suspenseful.It truly was not suspenseful. Granted, I went to the 9:30 PM showing, but I nodded off out of boredom no less than twice during the movie. It started off rather promisingly, but the actual murder scene was droll and the investigation consisted of an hour of interviewing stock characters repeatedly. This comes off as a low-rent, uneventful Sherlock Holmes rip. It does have a good look about it, but the star-studded cast is wasted upon the aforementioned stock characters. As Presented, Poirot himself is just not interesting enough to carry a movie. The audience is shown that he is a great detective, but not shown a reason to care.To top it off, the ""twist"" at the end is entirely unsatisfying.",Murder on the Orient Express
463,gamertaboo,Excellent movie...,9,25 January 2018,"I'm not sure what is with the harshness of every single review now days, I don't know if it's just cool to hate everything and have absolutely no joy in your life anymore, but I'm sick of it so I am going to start reviewing more movies now. At the very least the ones that I feel aren't being given a fair chance or rating. Seems like every single movie just gets slammed now days.This movie is excellent. I have to start off by saying that I haven't read the book, so if you're the type of person who's read the book and are excited to see the adaptation, I cannot comment on whether you'll be disappointed or not. Movies rarely seem to live up to the book though there are exceptions of course so let's not get stuck on that. I just feel like it's very hard for a two hour film to live up to who knows how many hours you spent on the book. There's only so much they can do with the time they have.I personally went into this movie knowing nothing about it besides what I saw in trailer and read in the plot synopsis here on IMDB. And the movie was fantastic. Now I have to say, the trailer gave me the impression that the movie was sort of a comedy, and to me the movie was quite different. It has a tiny bit of comedic relief here and there but it is a fairly serious film. The trailer does not do the movie justice.The movie does try to be a puzzling ""who done it,"" but towards the end you may be able to figure out what's going on. This doesn't subtract from the movie at all. It's well written and adapted, and EXCELLENTLY acted. I would suggest people watch this for the acting alone, it's fantastic. This a great little film and I loved all of it. It's unique, has a great setting, and enough mystery to keep you wondering for almost the entirety of it. It has a fantastic cast of A-list actors, all of whom play their well written parts extremely well. There's a bit of comedy sprinkled in here and there, and it's a very enjoyable hour and forty-eight minutes or so.",Murder on the Orient Express

Like if the writer did not read a single Christies novel before writing the scriptIt anticipate the conclusion. It jumps to the evidence with no method. You have no surprise at all, because is like an spoiler all the time. OK that is a very famous novel, and has very famous films, but you can spot the end since the middle of the film. Is terribly boring. They want to be very politically correct, so they are many thing that are out of time, character and remarks impossible at that time. Is ridiculous. No rigor at all. Is not a serious effort. Poor Agatha Christie.The other actors are terribly wasted. Judie Dench, Olivia Colman, Derek Jacobi, Willem Defoe wasted.

I think this compares with Paranormal Activity on the NOTHING IS HAPPENING scale. Characters were boring, dialogue was boring, plot was dumb, and the pc/progressive/liberal angle, enough already. The only things that had value were Depp and some of the CGI, which I kept asking, was all this cgi necessary? So there you have it, a boring movie that you will be begging to end. Now, I've never seen the 74, but apparently, it's better than this thing was.

478,amylunabelly,A Blasphemous Offensive Steaming Pile of Dung,1,12 November 2017,"We actually know what Agatha Christie would have thought of Kenneth Branaugh's bastardization of ""Murder on the Orient Express."" She predicted, in ""Mrs. McGinty's Dead,"" that some idiot would dramatize her books by adding sex and violence that was not in her original work and hypermasculinizing Poirot, while dumbing down her expert character development in a way that insults the audience's intelligence. She knew it had to happen. And it has.So much about this movie was so bad, it was laughable. Branaugh's heavy handed direction--""Look at me everybody! I'm so clever! I'm going to put Poirot on top of the train! underneath the train! on the side of the train! And film the train from every possible angle like a fight scene from the Batman TV series!"" was the worst kind of in your face grandstanding directing. The shots from above--and I mean directly ABOVE--the action were simply ridiculous.Branaugh even MADE SURE we ALL KNEW his Poirot was HETEROSEXUAL by repeated non sequitur contrived references to a young, thin, pretty, white female love interest in a photo who had about as many lines (none) as the ""prostitute"" added to a scene with the creeped up Monsieur Bouc character, whose only line was to gush over meeting Poirot, when she wasn't simpering like a child. I honestly have never been so repulsed by a handsome male character in my life as Bouc's predatory lecher.What the heck was Branaugh thinking? The only thing worse than dumbing down and sexing up the story with psychopathic violence and creepy lechers was the hitting- you-over-the-head-with-oh-so-unsubtle white savior references to the terrible evils of RACISM!!! Please, someone save us from Hollywood white male liberals bending over backwards to be politically correct about race and thinking they are sooooo progressive while maintaining the worst female madonna/whore lampshade character tropes and adding stabbings, guns, fist fights and shootings not in the original story. ""Yes, I took a masterpiece and made it into a self serving piece of crap--but that's OK, because there's a black doctor who gets to make some great speeches about how his white male friend helped him get into med school.""So...let's review. Branaugh ADDED to Christie's original story 1) Poirot's righteous finger pointing at the horrors of racism (adding an empowered black MALE character) and 2) Poirot chuckling with his buddy (wink wink) about buying and selling women for sex. In 1934. In Istanbul. Creating a disempowered female character known as ""the prostitute"" who does not even get a name and whose entire narrative purpose is to stroke Branaugh/Poirot's ego and 3) adding a female love interest whose only narrative purpose is to proof Branaugh/Poirot's ""manhood"" who is literally an inanimate photograph and 4) male characters punching walls, fist fighting, stabbing and shooting people and 5) giving Poirot himself characteristics completely antithetical to Christie's beloved detective. As if we needed any more proof of Hollywood's hypocrisy in the treatment of women and sex in our films and normalizing toxic gender stereotypes in both male and female characters.And the script! It read like some high school freshman TRYING to sound erudite. ""Overt overture?"" Uh...I was waiting for them to serve a ""cheesy cheeseburger"" in the dining car. Many of the lines would have been more appropriate in a Steven Seagal movie--""Why won't you DIE!"" What!??!?!Only a fool would take one of the masterpieces of British literature by the great Agatha Christie and make it into a pandering show of ego and arrogance, while insulting the audience's intelligence and perverting Christie's moral dilemma on the definition of justice into a tale of vigilantism and revenge by a bunch of thugs little better than the man they murdered. I am HORRIFIED to think a whole new generation will think THIS detritus has anything to do with Agatha Christie's novel. If I could, I would give this film negative stars.Do yourself a favor. Watch David Suchet's virtuoso performance in the 2010 Murder on the Orient Express. That production did Christie justice and then some. Or better yet, read the book. Remember reading? Then you'll know that Branaugh should be tarred and feathered for what he did to her epic magnum opus.No, Ken, you didn't have to mutate Christie's story to pander to today's audiences. She is literally the best selling author of all time. Christie needs no help. She appealed to people's humanity and intelligence, creating one of the most popular characters in the history of literature, not to mention a pantheon of assertive female characters and humane male characters, breaking stereotypes 80 years ago that, unfortunately, still survive today. All you did was play to the lowest common denominator, appealing to our baser instincts while maintaining arguably the most brilliant whodunnit plot of all time. So, new audiences think this ""cheesy cheeseburger"" is great, not realizing that they could have had filet mignon.And the tragedy is--she even predicted you would do it. Strip her legacy of it's intelligence and humanity, add male and female stereotypes and neanderthal violence all the while using her brilliant plot to make money. And you STILL did it.",Murder on the Orient Express
479,halseyad,Mixed Messages (Why Make the Movie?),2,17 November 2017,"It seemed as if this film was meant to have viewers arrive at a deep, introspective consideration for human life, but it fails miserably by missing the compassion within the death by public execution that takes place.When we see remorse in the passengers for their act of killing a murderer (someone who should be killed), we are lead to believe they have done something wrong; that they should not have held him accountable for his actions. This is evident by one women's attempted suicide after they had been discovered and also by the inspector's inability to be content with the ending (once it is fully revealed). The story really falls apart when we compare the inspectors quotes from the beginning and end of the movie. When the villain asks him for protection, the inspector refuses on the grounds that he ""detects criminals, not defends them."" He even says something to the effect of ""you want to deal with gangsters, you will suffer the consequences.""At the end of the movie, however, he clearly has lost his marbles because he says, ""sometimes the scales of justice are unbalanced; may we all find peace with it."" If he really was as astute and rational as he was portrayed to be, he would have realized that their actions put the scales back into balance. There was an injustice committed and the real bad guy was previously running free until they stopped him. There were prolonged consequences for the man, and they had caught up to him. The passenger's actions rectified the unpaid/delayed punishment and now they can move on with closure. It's as if the man representing law and order would have preferred to let the killer go. This film could have been a great argument for how sentencing someone to death can be a loving act that truly magnifies the value of life. Instead, it sunk into a black hole of moral relativism, where the protagonist is confused with right and wrong.Make up your mind, Hollywood!

485,RunRabbitRun87,The intensity of playing 'Clue' with the grandparents,5,4 November 2017,"I came into 'Murder On The Orient Express' having virtually no familiarity with Agatha Christie's work. For this film to be successful director and star Kenneth Branagh knew he must branch out to ignoramuses like me, but unfortunately in his attempts to do so he may have ended up underwhelming both Christie diehards and casual observers.The year is 1934, and after solving a mystery at the Wailing Wall, Hercule Poirot (Branagh), the Belgian detective of international repute, must board the Orient Express on his travels from Jerusalem to London. Tragedy strikes the train the same night as an avalanche, leaving it derailed and with a murder to solve.At no point was I especially intrigued as to who the killer was, which for a two-hour murder mystery is an issue. Neither is there any real doubt Poirot will solve it, leaving the enjoyment to be had from its character interactions and the how of Poirot's discoveries.The film has a multitude of stars onboard, each with their part to play in the plot. Unfortunately, there are a few characters too many, which does shrink the screen time for each of them. I've read that Pilar Estravados (Penelope Cruz) is an addition not in the novel, perhaps an unnecessary one. That said, the mix of accents and acting techniques blends well enough, and Branagh is a consistent and affable screen presence.Branagh is also careful not to define the whole film as Poirot talking to people in compartments, and there are some decent exterior shots and even a chase sequence (though why Poirot ever needed to risk his life strolling along the top of a carriage in a separate scene is never explained).A stand-out performer is Johnny Depp as the sleazy, grasping crook Ratchett. Miss Debenham (Daisy Ridley) has a few decent scenes with Poirot, but her relationship with Col. Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom Jr.) never holds. The decision to change the race of this character from the novel also leads to groan-inducing sanctimoniousness and reeks more of tokenism than high drama.Some problems with the film must surely derive from its source material. There can be few premises more contrived than a complicated murder being assembled while the perpetrators are fully aware of the greatest detective in the world sleeping a couple of doors down. If a modern screenwriter had conceived this story they would have been laughed out of Hollywood. Perhaps I'm just being a sourpuss who should have a bit more fun with the whole thing, but the plot convolutions do at points undoubtedly make for an uneven journey.'Murder On The Orient Express' needed to either embrace the campiness of the whole thing or dive into the darkness of it all. There's Poirot sleeping with his moustache-holder, there's a Lindbergh-esque tale of a baby abducted and murdered. It's 'Miss Marple' meets 'Mindhunter'. The Jerusalem scenes at the beginning especially had a BBC Sunday night, Stephen Moffat, irritatingly chummy feel to them.The wintery vistas, Branagh's over-acting moustache, the Christie twists and turns, there's plenty to take from 'Murder On The Orient Express'. But if you're going to enjoy this film you must leave your disbelief at the station and just go along for a sedentary ride.",Murder on the Orient Express

First of all, I haven't seen the other versions, nor have i read any Agitha Christie, but this Movie makes me want to do both. I really hope they make a sequel. To me, a seriously good movie in a period of extreme crap being put out by studios, it was just so refreshing. In response to other reviews, specifically those who really hated this movie, I saw all of those things mentioned: focused on the main character, rather steady in pace compared to the rise and fall of modern movies, and so on. I feel like this approach really adds to the responsibility/reaction of the main character in the end. It gave that sense that they were all connected and left the main character on the outside, and then when it resolves, he is drawn into their condition and grief and even has to sacrifice himself as well... this is brilliant!",Murder on the Orient Express

490,amberlitteken,Whodunit!,7,13 November 2017,"I definitely enjoyed Murder on the Orient Express. It was a fun murder mystery. The greatest thing about this movie was, hands down, the whodunit feel. Murder on the Orient Express was very reminiscent of the Scooby Doo or Nancy Drew mysteries from my childhood. The detective, is Hercule Poirot, a borderline OCD character that strives to find an even balance in everything in life. Because of his unique outlook, he has throughout his life become a great detective with the ability to see things that are out of place. While trying to go on a real vacation, he takes the train Orient Express where there is eventually, of course, a murder. The movie follows the detective as he strives to ascertain the murderer by finding clues, questioning the other passengers for motives, and cross referencing alibis. I thought the characters were well played by their actors, the flow of the movie was never stale, and the detectives mustache were on point. Throughout the movie I was switching between which passenger was my top suspect for the case, and the ending did not disappoint me.",Murder on the Orient Express
491,spencieboi,Fine,6,10 April 2018,"Why did they have to remake this? Was it really necessary? The movie isn't bad or anything, I just wish they did more. The characters are boring, except for Poirot of course. I've seen the 1974 movie and I've read the book so I already knew what was going to happen. That's why I wanted more, I wanted something new. The visuals are spectacular though, the cinematography is beautiful, and the sets are gorgeous, but that's not what makes a good movie. Overall, I thought Murder on the Orient Express was a fine movie, if you haven't read the book you'll probably love this, but if you have then you probably won't. I'm in the middle on this one, it's not boring, I had a good time so I guess I would recommend it.",Murder on the Orient Express
492,CharlesAncelle,No vision or talent.,3,18 November 2017,"What becomes very clear in the first five minutes of the film is how badly Kenneth Branagh has wanted to play Hercule Poirot, seemingly his whole life. It comes out of every pore of his being and yet, his unleashed and unchecked infatuation for the role only leads to a series of poor and mostly incredibly mindless choices.One of the most talked about ones is clearly the mustache and it is a perfect symbol of Branagh's completely unrestrained and cartoonish take on the story. It's not unusual for the director, of course: restraint is not exactly the first adjective that comes to mind to describe his previous work, but here, it is simply so over the top that it becomes quickly unbearable.Add to that that his French accent is horrendous when it doesn't disappear almost completely (by the way, all artificial accents are awful in this movie, Judi Dench barely makes an effort to sound Eastern while Willem Dafoe doesn't even try to sound Austrian), and that all the details he adds to the character are so completely British that it is astounding that no one in his entourage ever stepped and said, wait a minute: ""why the hell does Hercule Poirot give a damn about egg size? Seriously?""He carries around a ridiculous cane that then serves to choreograph an incredibly lame and unnecessary action sequence that, I suppose, was attempting to add some excitement in an otherwise incredibly flat and boring series of interrogation scenes, and other than that, he spends a lot of time yelling for no reason, or making theatrical moralizing speeches that are completely ridiculous for anyone familiar with him: Poirot's new arc is to recognize that there may be a gray area in our moral code. You have read that right, this incredibly intelligent man who has been in this world for decades didn't recognize until this particular point that the laws of men may be flawed and that everything can't always be black or white. How remarkable!Last but not least, Branagh was so focused on giving himself screen time that we barely see any of the rest of the cast, which, granted, may not be a bad thing sometimes (Penelope Cruz is stunningly awful), and sometimes quite disappointing (more Michelle Pfeiffer or Lucy Boynton in particular would have been welcome). I would strongly recommend watching the Sydney Lumet version instead, there is a chance you will actually enjoy it.",Murder on the Orient Express
493,johannordin1,"If you liked Clue (1985) for not only it's comedy, you'll enjoy this",7,21 February 2018,"Like the title I found this drama extravaganza was very entertaining leaving you guessing and suspecting alongside the dashing detective Poirot and his amazing mustache.The acting is superb in this film, which is not surprising when you consider the list of actors, and the filming is incredibly well done. Using creative angles you rarely feel that the cramped setting of a couple of carts in a train is ever an issue, rather it's taken advantage of well by using the long lengths of the carriages. You're sometimes intimately placed in the middle of the conversation and sometimes looking down upon the cast which you can recognize immediately by the unique styles of each and every one.If you, like I, have not seen the original we can consider ourselves lucky (at least according to user Bob-the-movie-man) and I do consider myself lucky to have went into this movie knowing about the original but not yet seen it. I will certainly take the time to watch the classic as well, as should we all, all the more reason to if you liked this film.Short summary: While twists and turns are expected in a murder mystery you'll find yourself enjoying the ride even if you do solve it before the reveal is shown. I do find myself missing some comic relief but I guess I am comparing it too closely to Clue. A cozy and enjoyable ride on the orient express, don't forget your ticket!",Murder on the Orient Express
494,mister-ed-1,Cant really add much to ecastrodesign's review,8,12 November 2017,I enjoyed the film as it was a night out. It didn't quite meet my expectations but then again I had heard mixed reviews. I guess what it lacked was just that feeling of atmosphere in the carriage. Did we particularly see an evening on board with a meal served ? As they said we didn't really get to know the characters terribly well beyond a few caricatures. I got a little mixed up with the Johnny Depp character and another man who looked quite similar. But overall a good story-go and see it - Kenneth Branagh was good but the moustache was over the top !! And the mix of French (with a translation which I guess you had to do but as I speak French this seemed ridiculous !!) as he spoke a few words of French so we know he is Belgian then into English ! But overall I enjoyed it. Go and see it - its a good film and I hope to see more as I love Agatha Christie and all mystery things like this. I hate CGI but can see it probably saves a whole lot of money in a film like this. Thanks all though - enjoyed the film.,Murder on the Orient Express

496,nulla_29,Interesting remake,6,12 August 2018,"As a huge fan of Agatha Christie, I find myself thrilling by the idea of another movie adaptation of her books, and I was not disappointed by this one.
This remake is an interesting try, with good casting, amazing photography and very good acting from Kenneth Branagh. It is clear a great challenge to play this role after David Suchet, who's by far my favorite Poirot of all times and the most talented Peter Ustinov, and, in my opinion Branagh interpreted Poirot in a fresh way, focusing on his wits instead of supporting its ""caricature"" side. Of course Agatha Christie at her books praised this features of her detective, but even though, the main power of Hercule Poirot always was his little gray cells and his upright character, qualities that Kenneth Branagh brought to life successfully.However, I cannot give more than 6 stars because of that almost unbearable,dreadful mustache! Whose idea was that and Why?
Please, if there's another movie, spare us from this mustache.
Also there were some useless fighting scenes and the completely unnecessary mention of a past love of Poirot. That spoiled Poirot's true nature according to the books
In all, a good movie, worth watching.",Murder on the Orient Express
497,thecanterburr,Awful performance,3,12 November 2017,"To say it short: a film, which made Branagh to show how awesome Branagh is, isn't worth watching. Even from the trailer: ""My name is Hercule Poirot, and I'm probably the best detective in the world"". Really? Was Poirot a poser with strange moustache? I think not, and that starts to annoying in the first 10 minutes.I was unlucky to read the book after that film- I lost everything - pressure, interest...all that feelings killed that film, which doesn't grab your attention at all. Numerous times I've heard that the film is very beautiful itself. Of course, for a drama. But not for a detective story. Just imagine - the train got under the snowfall, left in the mountains, when another one can come. It's not 100%, that the help will come soon, and you are the only one, who is left to find a murderer! It's sounds like a true horrible detective, which had to have atmosphere like ""Se7en"". As I didn't know who the murderer was, for me it was the only interesting thing. As Branagh left time only for his character, though, we didn't know anything about Poirot, except that he is arrogant and thinks of himself as ""übermensh"". The film clumsily tells us that all characters are connected to Armstrong. That can't be a coincidence - no way count, Princess, doctor etc. could be in one place occasionally. Leading to one logical statement, who the murderer is. (still, I wouldn't write it). I put 3 only because of great cast - Judi Dench, Depp (though he performed poorly, for a person who receives such threats), Dafoe and others. Thanks for the spoiled book, will never watch another film directed by you.",Murder on the Orient Express

Mr. Kenneth Branagh, I really don't know by which way or how to praise a genius that he is and also don't know what exactly do I praise him about, is it his direction of the film and the fact that he director a wonderful looking film with great cinematography or do I praise his acting performance which is THE BEST I'VE SEEN THIS YEAR ! I really don't often praise films like that and I'm the kind of person that looks deep in any film just to see any misconceptions or flaws and I really was searching in this one but I really didn't see any ! Yes I waited for the film for about 5 months but honestly speaking I really forgot about the film.I don't recall many films that I've seen and didn't see or faced any problems or flaws with, this film was just Perfect, the fact how funny it was or the fact that the film looked great in a big screen or the soundtrack that made most of the scenes made more sense and very emotional especially at the ending !If I'm going to describe the film to anyone I really have only one word for he/she and the word is: Perfection.I really wish that the academy awards appreciate this film and especially to at least nominate Kenneth Branagh FOR AN Oscar !Overall: One of the best films I've seen this year and nearly as THE best film, Murder On The Orient Express in opinion was just wonderful, beautiful, funny, sentimental and as I said I rarely compliment any film as I've done for this one and it's just simply because the film was perfect.",Murder on the Orient Express
500,wilkiecollins,Puffing boredom,2,2 December 2017,"Since the very beginning, with the dartagnanesque whiskers of the improbable Poirot-Holmes, you understand that Branagh is going to serve you a bunch of topics interrupted by digital visions of a toy train crossing the heights of boredom.

501,medcolpa,Hercules Branaugh,3,6 July 2019,"This film raises the question ""Should movie versions of books be true to the story and characters."" The core problem is books are long, and films are short. So how do you pick what to film? Given that you have to miss most of book out, does that mean you should add ""new parts"" in lieu of the redacted? I am tempted to think than Kenneth Branagh thinks so. In his version of MOTOE he makes some unique story changes to a Classic tale. The standard justification for this from film makers is that this adds to the ""narrative drive"" when moving from book to film. However, to have Poirot fight like Jackie Chan is so absurdly James Bond-like I wonder what on earth Branagh was thinking! This goes against the very core of the famous Poirot character and his method. (He can solve a crime by simply sitting in office and thinking about all the evidence. Though it is important to note that Christie was quite inconsistent with her characters - Poirot did indeed look for and find ""clues"". Things he often made fun of Hastings for always wanting.)How does this adaptation compare to others of this well know detective novel? It is a book I know very well. I have not seen the 1974 version for many years, but did enjoy it very much. The BBC radio version is much better than David Suchet version for TV as it is truer to the novel. The Alfred Molina modernization is interesting attempt to deal with the ""problem of the remake"", but is unwatchable. All these versions highlight the problem of the extreme edit that is required for condensing a 350 page novel into 90-120 mins giving rise to the idea that bad novels can make good films, but great novels will result in bad films.Examples of great book and film: Pride and Prejudice (1940).

Branagh is so consumed with himself trying to imprint his own stamp on Poirot as a gastronome that he makes an nearly unrecognizable cartoon out of a caricature, and loses any of Poirot's sympathetic characteristics. In an enormous betrayal of the character, he eats from the plate of someone he despises. In a further effort to impose 21st century sensibilities on an early 20th century world, we are shown women adept at physical defense, an upper class anglo african physician, aging beauties who speak to strangers of ""women's needs"" and, in a completely gratuitous scene, outspoken embrace of what at the time would have been considered ""miscegenation"".

510,FamousGirlfriend,"Not a Poirot we wanted or even needed, but a brief moment of entertainment",5,3 March 2018,"This film isn't awful. It just terribly disappointing. It had lots of potential, the actors were doing fine, the scenery is pretty and there was obviously lots of money put into the project. Branagh's take on the character of Poirot isn't that bad. His accent needs some work and the fact that Poirot is vain and as meticulous with his appearance as with everything else, should have been noted. Poirot dyes his hair dark and has those dandy moustaches, that old Western movie moustache of his doesn't really fit the character. Apart from this, Branagh's Poirot is NOT bad. If you look back at Peter Ustinov's Poirot in Death on the Nile from 1978 you see that Branagh's Poirot is more true to the books. Death on the Nile from 1978 was well-made and well-written, though. Murder on the Orient Express is messy, script, cinematography and all! The landscapes and surroundings are oftentimes beautiful, and some of the shots are really great. However, very often it feels like the director of photography, or whoever, didn't really know how to make the shot or when to cut. Sometimes a shot starts out beautifully and leads us in a grandiose way just to break off and end in some dubious jump cut. It's so anticlimactic.In the very beginning, Poirot's quirky personality gets pushed down our throats - with commentary! You really don't have to be TOLD why he does things the way he does, just show it. That's one of the benefits of this new hot thing called Moving Pictures, you can give the audience a chance to watch, think, understand, instead of just telling it to them as if they were unintelligent children. It's a detective story, if there's no mystery, there's no point.While the original detective story is dark and chilly as well as intelligent and comedic, this take on Murder on the Orient Express is far less about uncovering the mystery of the murder and the mystery of human nature, and more about an ensemble cast in an adventure flick, a bit like Indiana Jones. Branagh's Poirot is very nimble for being an old man. Then there are the things that are just plain stupid. The film hints at the possibility of a sequel, a death has occurred on the Nile, but that's ludicrous, since Poirot was present while that death occurred in Death on the Nile, not snowed in in Yugoslavia. And while I accept the artistic freedom when making the Swedish character Greta Ohlsson a Spanish subject, why naming her Pilar Estravados, as is the name of one of the major characters in the book ""Poirot's Christmas""? Are these supposed to be clever nods to Christie fans? Because as a fan, I just find them idiotic and unnecessary.Though I wouldn't mind seeing Branagh reprise his role as Hercules Poirot, some adjustments should be made, but most of all: take care when adapting the stories! Agatha Christie wrote simple, fun and clever books, stick to that. Don't try to put in old flames of Poirot's in dusty picture frames and other pointless things into the film just because you can. If you want to change something for artistic purposes, be sure that you know what and how to do it. The British Poirot series have made countless changes during the series run from 1989-2014.

513,mastersparky,First class enterTRAINment,8,3 November 2017,"Fill a train with a most impressive cast line up, throw in a grisly murder mystery and have the mighty impressive Kenneth Branagh go on a quest to find out who done it and you got yourself a delightful little movie which will most certainly entertrain.A take on Agatha Christie's popular novel Murder on the Orient Express, the story follows that of detective Hercule Poirot, who is called on business to London, and so takes the last available room on the Orient Express. Though wanting nothing more than to relax and enjoy his journey, he inadvertently finds himself working, when one of the passengers is mysteriously killed. It's a wonderful simple story which sees detective Poirot go from guest to guest questioning them on their whereabouts on that fateful night. The opening scene did worry me somewhat with it's overly smart-arsed series of events, akin to that of a last few SHERLOCK TV episodes. It risked going off the rails and being too clever, well beyond believable, but thankfully for the main mystery it calms itself down.The 1h 54minruntime steams by as I sat and enjoyed first class performances from all the cast. Stand out characters were Daisy Ridley's Miss Mary Debenham, Josh Gad's Hector MacQueen, Leslie Odom Jr.'s Dr. Arbuthnot and of course the brilliant Kenneth Branagh as the brilliantly quirky and intelligent Hercule Poirot. Only Michelle Pfeiffer's performance lacked somewhat and took away from what could have been a much more emotional scene towards the end.For a story that takes place almost entirely on a train, the director uses the limited space well, for as this narrative unfolds, it doesn't feel too claustrophobic, even in the narrow hallways and the tight compact cabins. Shifting the camera into creative perspectives at times helps keep the scenes fresh and visually stimulating (I especially enjoyed the birds eye view of the murder scene). The pacing is snappy and energetic and at no point feels like its running out of steam. Kenneth Branagh should also be commended for the way he juggles a story consisting of such a myriad of actors, by giving each character their own perspectives and motives, helps to keep the viewer on their toes; questioning every nuance and detail and while some are barely given any screen time, most feel substantially explored. Overall Murder on the Orient Express conducts itself well, an interesting ""who done it?"" mystery that will keep you guessing throughout. Wonderfully paced and fantastically performed.

519,arsenalboy-17374,Kept me guessing throughout!,7,4 November 2017,"I went to see Murder on the Orient Express last night and this is my review. I am rating it 7/10 A quick overview of the film is that someone is murdered on the Orient and the worlds best detective played brilliantly by Kenneth Branagh must solve this case with caution and intelligence. The film starts smoothly with some laughs produced by Kenneth. We meet every character before the train journey and that's when the guessing begins. I really enjoy a film that keeps you guessing and gives you a few unexpected twists. The orient certainly delivers that. Pros: Few well timed laughs, Kenneth Branagh is fantastic, Guessing Twists, Being focused on what is going on Lovely scenery, Great cast and an intense story.Cons: To be honest, with the type of film it is and plot. There isn't anything bad I can say about it because it delivered Agatha Christie's story very well.An entertaining watch for those who like a mystery film with a strong cast and to be engaged throughout but getting you to guess at most stages of the film.

If you're departing from the original novel then, have some decency and change the names, call it a ""Murder on the Something Else, Fantastic (not Orient) Express"", otherwise it is just a cheap attempt to cash in (again) on the original story.

532,fudgesinger,Disappointing dull wordy remake,2,3 November 2017,"I was so looking forward to this remake.. Kenneth Branagh is so very talented. His live action Cinderella was delightful, But this remake looks beautiful but is so wordy and boring. For the first ten minutes we are shown how clever Poirot is and after a lot unnecessary padding eventually we get on to the train . With all its glory. Great photography. But there was virtually no character development; and the sound was so poor ( even At The Odeon Leicester Square) that I did not have a clue what was going on.(which is partially why there are no spoilers.)In fact it was so dull I nodded off and woke up when the murder had been committed . So I did not have a clue who was dead.( so no spoiler! An hour had passed and the rest of the film trundled along like a slow goods train, whilst Branagh did his stuff. I think he thought he was playing in Shakespeare's Henry the fifth. For at the denouement, he just went on and on and on with speech after speech, in that phoney French accent which was like a bad imitation of Maurice Chevalier. In fact had it been a musical, I was waiting for him to burst into song! Mercifully this travesty ended and we left. Incredibly disappointed.The original1974 version and the Richard RODNEY Bennett score was such fun which captured the light Agatha Christie feel. This was like a very heavy plum pudding. Branagh alluded to Murder on thrnNile. Please NO Kenneth . Go back to Disney",Murder on the Orient Express
533,gamefreak548,One word: A-MAZING,8,17 November 2017,"Do not be fooled by the many reviews here claiming the 1974 version was better. They are usually written by people oppose any kind of innovation and are forever stuck into the past. Everything before the 90's = good everything else that comes after = bad, I'm sure you know that kind of mind set we all have that one grandparent.This movie is a masterpiece. The acting was impeccable, the story was mind blowing, the setting...god the setting made it all fit together. This movie makes the viewer follow the investigation step by step, evidence by evidence and even gives room to the viewer to conjure his/her own case. The combination of the different accents and backstories, who were incredibly well done by the way, gives a great sense of immersion.Rarely have I ever been so amazed by a story such as this one, and the ending... was just perfection. It's a movie I'll definitely be seeing again.If you have any sense of objectiveness, this remake pillars over the old one by miles and miles.

The film itself is long. At times the character of Ratchett is forgotten Why is He here?, so the motive of some of the characters is diluted.The cast is interesting, but some changes were not well achieved, for example the character of Daisy Ridley was not well interpreted here, a higher category actress had to be sought (before it was in this role Vanessa Redgrave and Jessica Chastain).In the case of Penelope Cruz (who is a great actress), her character shows that she was forcibly changed, what happens later is that you forget why she was there.The characters of Willem Dafoe and Leslie Odom Jr. Fail to establish themselves and convey their importance in the film.In conclusion, the film has good intentions but misses the central objective, which was to have the audience interested in the mystery.",Murder on the Orient Express

538,rachele_margarita,Makes Adam Sandler's Murder Mystery look Oscar-worthy,1,3 November 2019,"I was really looking forward to this movie, thinking it would be an intriguing and atmospheric period piece mystery. With all those big name actors, it had to be, right? Not even a minute into this movie and I already knew I was wrong, dead wrong. Was this supposed to be a comedy? Seriously, how was this movie ever made, or worse, allowed to be released? It felt like a cheap Pink Panther knock-off, with all the subtlety and acting prowess of an SNL skit, and honestly that probably would have more deep and meaningful than the abomination we are instead delivered. Branaugh's acting is so pathetic it's amazing he didn't get banned from ever acting again. What is with that accent? And the French is so bad that even an elementary school French class could point out the many many mistakes. For example, Michelle Pfeiffer's character says ""c'est de rien"" and it translates underneath as ""it's nothing"" which is the literal translation sure but carries none of the context (it actually means thank you). I think my favorite part was when he says ""n'est pas de probleme"" and then it has English subtitles on the screen that say ""it's no problem."" If your target audience is so stupid that you literally need to translate something that basic for them, maybe Agatha Christie isn't the right material for you.So many other things wrong with it I don't even know where to start. The CGI is a joke, which makes me wonder what drugs some of these other reviewers were on who claimed it was good in any way. It's beyond fake. The train scenes look like something out of a children's Christmas fantasy movie. There's even a scene where Depp and Branaugh are sitting on the moving train and the background doesn't even change for like ten whole minutes. They use the same fake backdrop for the entire scene, without even bothering to add any movement or anything. It's so amateur it makes me angry that these people still have jobs.Plot-wise, it gets is even worse. There are so many holes and inconsistencies and downright ludicrous things that it's impossible to even follow the storyline no matter how hard you try. For example, a lightning strike causes an avalanche (I haven't read the novel so forgive me if that was part of the actual story; either way, it's beyond ridiculous). They are supposed to have just left Istanbul that day yet they are somehow in the middle of the Alps and also in an impossiblly high, remote snow-covered peak like something out of game of thrones, and yet noone is wearing any winter jackets and none of them ever seem to be cold at all? The doctor went to school in England yet has an American accent? The Judi Dench woman is Russian yet speaks perfect English and has no Russian accent? The Jerusalem townspeople are all gathered around wearing various culturally inappropriate garbs and listening to some foreign detective ranting rather than their own officials, one of whom is a black man despite it being Israel in 1934?I don't want to use the race of the actors as reason to criticize the historical accuracy of this film, but my God, they butchered the time and place so badly it was worse than 300. The first few minutes of the movie is some of the most racist, stereotypical Orientalist garbage ever put to screen. And ironically enough, the movie then goes on to hammer a supposed anti-racist message into our skills as if we need to be lectured, when they're the ones parading people around in culturally misappropriated costumes and constantly pointing out the race of all their characters, some of whom it feels distinctly clear were only chosen because of their race in the first place. The oblivious hypocrisy is not only annoying it's downright offensive.This kind of stupidity is tolerable in a comedy movie, where it's intentional, like say, a Jack Black movie. However, here it's just inappropriate and embarrassing. Even the Jack Black of this movie (Josh Gad) is a pale parody of the real thing. And sadly he delivers what is arguably the best performance out of the whole cast.It's so abysmal you'll be wishing that the train plummeted off the tracks and killed everyone involved. It would be a much more interesting and satisfying mystery than the one we are left with.",Murder on the Orient Express

The photography was beautiful. The camera movements around the train, the shots through distorting glass where everyone had two faces, the interesting camera angles were superb. The CGI was extraordinarily brilliant, especially the shots of the train chugging through picturesque landscapes. The period feel was captured wonderfully. 
The staging was brilliant. Having the train perched on a high trestle bridge whilst the investigation was conducted was a stroke of genius, as was the recreation of the Last Supper painting when all the suspects were lined up. 
I knew who done it already. But that didn't spoil it, because the business with Poirot handing the gun over and saying they should shoot him, was a wonderful surprise trick. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for me it was a perfect cup.",Murder on the Orient Express
544,alanjudge-30219,Matinée,8,19 November 2017,Saw this with my wife. Good film for either gender. I had read the book many moons ago but forgot what happened at the end. So I was alongside Poirot trying to guess the culprit. Won't say more on that (spoiler).Anyway what I liked about this film was the cinematic quality. Branagh used old fashioned film cameras and the plush decor of the Orient Express looks great on the big screen. Especially with all the (Alps) snow outside the train. Gave it a sort of 'christmassy' vibe.Anyway I always envisioned Poirot as being a little swarthier than Branagh but non the less he does a good Belgian impression. Also I liked how his mustache was shaped just like the old fashionable facial hair of the era (1930s).Yes there appears to be a black character shoe-horned in to satisfy the liberal cult. But they did not overdo it and it did not spoil the film. In fact even down to the way characters talk it was mostly historically accurate.Not a classic by any means and for some reason Branagh just seems a tad too Anglo-Saxon to be Poirot but I never felt bored and left quite satisfied. I think Agatha Christie is a great writer and it shows.,Murder on the Orient Express

546,J-enni,"Mediocre and dull, unfortunately",6,1 January 2018,"A mediocre murder mystery movie. If you're not familiar with Christie's Poirot stories or David Suchet's version of Poirot, you might find this film more entertaining than I did. David Suchet does so impeccable job as Hercule Poirot that it's almost impossible to beat. And as someone here already said, Branagh's Poirot is from time to time more like Mr. Monk than Mr. Poirot. Branagh's Poirot has too many quirks that don't feel like ""Poirot's quirks"" but more like Mr. Monk's or someone else's. So, I'm sorry to say, but I didn't like Branagh's Poirot.The plot has a couple big holes in it, which makes the film bit clumsy. Maybe the erased scenes would shed some light to few things. Nevertheless, the film is ""easy to watch"" and scenery is beautiful. Not a mind-blowing spectacle, but not totally garbage either. So, if you have plenty of time to watch films, you could check this out, but if you don't have that much time to watch every mediocre film, choose some other movie.",Murder on the Orient Express
547,junkmail-48566,Avoid this at all costs! See the 1974 Sidney Lumet version instead!,1,26 July 2018,"Kenneth Branaugh receives the raspberries for this unnecessary remake of Dame Agatha Christie's classic novel. Having seen the 1974 version when first released, it was full of glamour, as a period piece set in the 1930s should have been, and each character was fully developed. Branaugh spent too much time and energy with his development of his portrayal of Christie's sleuth, Hercule Poirot, that the development of any other characters failed to occur. Branaugh focused on Poirot's obsessive-compulsive disorder to make his own character three-dimensional, leaving all of the suspects characterizations as one-dimensional MacGuffins, to use a Hitchcockian term. Another weak point in this film is the dramatic score, which contains nothing memorable other than Michelle Pfeiffer's vocal over the closing credits. Lumet's 1974 film contains a score by Richard Rodney Bennett, lushly orchestrated with hummable themes that complement Geoffrey Unsworth's beautiful Panavision cinematography. Although Branaugh's version was shot with 65mm cameras (the same ones used by Christopher Nolan for ""Dunkirk""), the process was wasted here since most of the shots in the film are confined to a set, and only the exterior shots benefited from its use. Super 35mm (what was once known as SuperScope), Panavision or digital cinematography would have been just as suitable for this production. Lumet's film also made use of an all-star cast whose acting skills were well proven in advance. It's unnecessary to list the cast here, as it can be viewed on the IMDB page for that version, however this version has few recognizable names, and some will even enjoy the fact that the murder of Johnny Depp's character occurs less than halfway through the film, and that his screen time is kept to a minimum! Sitting through this poorly-done remake of what was previously filmed with style, class, and glamour in 1974 is a waste of time. If you want to view a great whodunit, beautifully crafted, with excellent characterization, see the Lumet version. Dame Agatha Christie claimed that Lumet's version and Billy Wilder's 1957 film of ""Witness for the Prosecution"" were the only two films that did justice to her literary work.",Murder on the Orient Express

The film has a nice vintage feel to it. In the start of the movie you would thought it's just a simple story where there will be a murder and the detective at the end will solve the crime, but it's not just about that. It imprints a question about morality, of justice, of conscience. It would make you think deeply after the climax of the story unravels to you. You may get shocked or say ""Aha! I'm right about it"".

Watching it was like watching a slow motion train wreck. The miss characterization of Poirot was bad enough. The importation of another character (Pilar) from a completely different Agatha Christie story for no apparent reason compounded the damage. The cast members were mugged by what President George H.W. Bush used to refer to as, ""That vision thing."" We know from their other work that they are all capable of brilliance. Alas, this remake by a committee of dunder heads is the worst of the several versions of one of Christie's best.",Murder on the Orient Express
563,owenddavis,A Remake in Search of a Purpose,5,22 July 2018,"Is it a lack of creativity or imagination that leads movie makers to endlessly retell the same stories? Especially with a story like ""Murder on the Orient Express"" - which was done to perfection only a short time ago starring David Suchet - it's not surprising that the all star cast really had nothing new to add to Agatha Christie's masterpiece. The decision to take a character from a completely different Christie mystery and plunk her onto the Orient Express was also puzzling. Are there no new tales to be told?",Murder on the Orient Express

Anyways, the movie was good. The intrigue didn't build up as I'm used to but it's not a thriller. It's mostly a character driven mystery. I was not familiar with this story, so I was a bit surprised by the reveal and Poirot's choice at the end. And, Branagh's Poirot was a great rendition.

Branagh mumbles his way through the film and the amazing cast gets very little plot background or screentime. The camera angles at times are poor and it just felt soulless. There is hardly any tension, minimal background music/suspense and it was all a bit boring to be honest. 
There are un-Poirot like action scenes, Branagh's moustache changes every time we see it, they are outside in the mountains without warm coats on and it just feels like it could have been a whole lot better. 
I wanted to see drama and the great actors playing off each other and smart dialogue and direction, but none of that really happens.

579,kaylarada,Murder on the Orient Express,7,15 November 2017,"It was Mrs.Peacock in the conservatory with a dagger!Everyone loves a good murder mystery, this film allows the audience to watch the mystery unravel before their eyes as if they were playing the classic board game of Clue. Murder on the Orient Express was written in 1934 by Agatha Christie, is one of the most well known mystery novels of all time. Kenneth Branagh brings this clue-like murder mystery novel to life. Branagh stars as Hercule Poirot, the worlds greatest detective looking to take a much needed vacation after solving a theft in Jerusalem. During his travels, Hercule runs into his old friend Bouc, who happens to be the director of The Orient Express, he is offered a room on the train after receiving a case from London. Once aboard the Orient Express, Hercule is met with thirteen unlikely strangers together just for the sake of traveling. One of the first characters we meet is Mr.Ratchett (Johny Depp) a business man who had made many enemies in his line of work. He had begun receiving life threatening letters and asked Hercule if he could be his body guard. Hercule declined and that same night the train was thrown off the tracks due to an avalanche and Mr.Ratchett was murdered. It was clear to Hercule that the murderer was still aboard the train and he must find his killer before they kill again. The Orient Express is the setting for the remainder of the film, this luxurious and gorgeous train transports you back to the 1930s. The film was shot using 65mm lens which allowed for brighter colors, texture, and emphasized the significance of lighting. The use of lighting in this film had to take you back to the 1930s and that's just what it did. The 1930s primarily focused on the use of high-key lighting, this is often unflattering and can be difficult to work with. However, Branagh uses this lighting to his advantage and brings out the beauty of every character. The music in this film was transcendent and brought you back to the 1930s with music by Patrick Doyle. His classical style of music was a perfect fit for the movie and time period it represented.The breath taking long shots bring you aboard the Orient Express with the rest of the cast. The entrance onto the Orient Express is a two and a half minute continuous shot that is very well choreographed. This shot introduces the characters that will be riding along with Hercule, this single shot brings you through the entire train and gives you the feeling that you are actually aboard. This single shot was by fair the most impressive shot taken during this film, to have all the characters in the perfect spots and to move at the appropriate times in order to get just two minutes of film must have taken days. This shot used elaborate blocking elements such as other characters, windows, and props to signify the camera movements, in this shot the characters become apart of the mise-en-scene. The significance of using the continuous shot gives the scene a seamless view and really allows the audience to focus on the beauty of the set and emphasizes the mise-en-scene. The cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos also uses the reflection made by windows to create the divided personality of good vs evil within the charactersThis film has beautiful scenery, amazing shots, music that transports you, and breath taking lighting. However, your enjoyment will be dependent on your familiarity with the story, this remake feels as if its main focus was to showcase the stars of this film. Having read the book and seeing the original film, the typical final lineup scene of the suspects felt over dramatized and used to emphasize the talents of each actor. But if you are unfamiliar with the killer and are still engulfed by the mystery, then the resolution will blow you away. The final resolution brings forth character development for Hercule and ends the film on a positive note. With this being said, the experience of viewing this film allows for the audience to escape their own reality and take a trip back in time, which is the sole purpose of film.",Murder on the Orient Express
580,habitaciondeduvi,Better than I expected,9,24 November 2017,"This film I think has become a clear example in which bad criticism and low score makes when you go to see you take a pleasant surprise.Yes, it has its negative points. Example of this are some scenarios in which clearly the use of technology or some jokes that Hercules Poirot makes and do not seem to end up fitting with the character.But the plot, as well as being a very good adaptation of the novel, makes you want to stay stuck to the screen from start to finish. The use of the camera from the ceiling in some moments is a good strategy to indicate the lack of space in the car-bed, getting a somewhat claustrophobic atmosphere, but believable, gives the feeling of being on a train.The soundtrack is incredible and the dialogues, especially at the end of the film, reflect everything the characters feel.",Murder on the Orient Express
581,redpaperweight,Tenseless,6,24 November 2017,"Let me start of by saying that I loved the scenery/decors, the costumes, the hair, the accents and most definitely the mustache! The idiosyncrasy of nearly every character was also delightful I must add. As such the movie was a wonderful experience for the eye indeed. The unexpected humor of Poirot and the pile of poop he steps into is also an add-on to the authenticity of his character.However, unaware of the book by A. Christie it tries to capture, it was a bit of a disappointment to only be able to experience Johnny Depp for such a short period of time. I understand that he was the one to be murdered but why not let him have another character so we can adore him so much longer? Now Poirot was definitely an interesting character as well, but not close to the performance of Depp. Poirot does make we want to have a walking stick very badly though...Onto the main problem of this movie and that is the lack of any real tension. I simply felt none of it, I never was sucked into the movie that much that I actually was waiting for the murderer to be discovered. The fear of having to sleep on that train with a potential murderer was completely lacking. Even the ending, where Poirot comes to his final conclusion that every single suspect is the murderer, feels anti-climatic. The gun being dry fired didn't manage to pull me in.Summarized: eyes say yes; brain says no; heart says no.",Murder on the Orient Express
582,BadMovieFan94,A Fantastic Mystery,8,16 November 2017,"Full disclosure, I never read the book or saw the original movie that every other reviewer has mentioned. Obviously I am going to track it down soon. Because of this my impressions of the movie are from the point of view of someone who had no idea what to expect, only that someone was murdered on a train in the 1930s and a quirky genius guy was there to find out who.I very much enjoyed this movie, and was impressed by the way the film pulled me into the world it sets up. The sets are spectacular and the CGI is stunning without being over the top. The impressive cast did not put on their best performances, although there were not a lot of lines or screen time for any individual (besides Kenneth Branagh) to work with. Branagh did an outstanding job and I found his character walked the line between being eccentric and unbearable just right.As someone who was unfamiliar with the plot, I can see why the book was popular and now has two movies. It is very exciting and fun to follow. Many reviewers are complaining that there never should have been a remake, but I feel there is enough of an audience in the same situation as me to bring fresh eyes and excitement. I loved the movie and would gladly see it again.Also, my mom has read the book and seen the original movie, so she knew the plot and still sat wide eyed next to me the entire time.

The story has a lot of holes for someone not familiar with this novel or older adaptations. There are no any explanation of Poirot conclusion. The thing that bothered me the most is main character - Poirot. The actor was trying, but it was simply not good enough. His english with French accent is more like english with Polish (reminded me a lot of John Malchovich) . It was really bad and obviously this role did not fit to its actor.

595,pzhuwang,Remakes can be great!,9,16 November 2017,"Murder On Oriental Express is a film directed by Kenneth Brangan about a famous detective, Hercule Poirot, played by the director himself. He was on-board of a train called Oriental Express. However during the trip there was a murder happening and the killer is being limited to passengers in just one cabinet. Being the best detective in the world, Poriot must try to solve the crime before the police took the matter on their own hands. Right off the back I can tell you that this is Kenneth Brangan's best film to date. His film to be are mostly very classical and Shakespearian, he made mostly Shakespeare film. I enjoyed his interpretation of Thor 1, it has flaws but I enjoyed it. Cinderella is an eye candy film but didn't last a long impression. Jack Ryan shadow recruit is a massive disappointment that derailed the Tom Clancy franchise. I really loved this film and to set the record straight I didn't see the 1970s version or read the book so I came to see the film with blank state. I think this is a very masterfully made film. The biggest strength is its cinematography, the only film this year that came close to rival with Blade Runner 2049 in this category. I highly recommend seeing it on a big screen because it is absolutely gorgeous. There were many long takes and it took its time to use the camera to tell a story, reminds of some old films like Casablanca. This also compliments the acting, which are superb. Everyone did an amazing job. There were many close-up shots and it is, again, one of those films where images tell a thousand words. Some may not like it but I loved. Speaking about acting, the stand out is definitely Poirot. The way I see it, this film is taking from his perspective rather than your normal crime drama. From the start of the film, you can see he is an overconfident detective who is obsessed with precision and logic. But as the film goes on and he is discovering the depth and the cause of the crime as the audience we can see that crime is eating him up and inside and by the end of the film he is completely changed by this experience. The supporting actors aren't there just as show piece, their emotional turmoil pushed the story along. To name every single one actors showed up would take a while. There were no particular stand outs but some of the more memorable ones are Daisy Reily, Josh Gash, Michelle Piher and William Defoe. The writing was very good and there were a great deal of humor too. O, let's not forget about the absolutely amazing score from Patrick Doyle. I loved this movie so much that I decided to wait for 24 hours before I post my review just to clear my head a bit and I have to say I still love it. To me, this is the most surprising movie and certainly the most underrated one. As for flaws, the beginning felt a bit rushed because they have to introduce all the characters also there were few moments where I felt I was watching a detective Conan live action movie when Poirot was rumbling. And I do know that some people may not enjoy as much as I do because the film is made very old fashioned and it is not your average crime drama.

I liked the back-story and how things twisted and turned and I thought Kenneth was fabulous as Poirot....he is one of my favourite actors though and I'd like him in anything but jackoby and Depp were both also very good as was Dame Judi Dench. It wasn't the most action packed movie I've ever seen and I do wish that the audience could have been given more in the way of evidence and time to work things out for ourselves as I did feel Poirot kind of got to the bottom of things based on intuition rather than evidence which gave us the audience no hope in getting there first!

Like Jeremy Brett can't be surpassed as Sherlock Holmes (no offence to Mr. Cumberbatch), there's no point questioning David Suchet as the Poirot Madam Christie would've dreamt of. Mind you there's some lovely picturesque and some strong performances too but something is missing, something which keeps you bound to a murder mystery; was lacking. Kenneth Branagh, I think is a bit rigid, a bit strong. The subtleness and the mischievousness of David Suchet is what I missed may be. The plot can't be wrong as it is a classic in itself.

I particularly liked Judi Dench and Olivia Coleman as Princess Dragomiroff and her maid Hildegard Schmidt. For me, the key elements of the plot were all true to the novel and while a lot of changes had been made I felt they'd enhanced the film. I actually got quite emotional at the point where the full story is revealed and we discover what really happened.

The cinematography, production and costume design, and music is also very good.While the ensemble supporting cast does very well with the very little they've been given (Michelle Pfeifer and Josh Gad being the stand-outs), the film could have benefited from adding an extra 15 minutes to flesh them out, to make the film's big reveal more effective, even if the ending was already emotional. Also, the film suffers from its inability to ""show, don't tell"", especially from a mystery. You aren't able to solve the mystery with Poirot, as the film instead uses flashbacks and exposition scenes.Murder on the Orient Express is a solid mystery that could've been much greater, but still a very pleasant and entertaining time.",Murder on the Orient Express
606,Defender_of_the-Faith,The Politically Corrected Agatha Christie,1,9 December 2019,"I watched the first 15 minutes of this film and realized that Branagh wanted to update Agatha Christie's nuanced and deep analysis of ethnics and ethical systems with a 'woke' version. I turned it off in disgust.After seeing that the film had achieved an IMDB score of 6.5 and made money, I thought I'd give it another look. I love Branagh as actor. Maybe I was wrong?I watched another 15 minutes somewhere in the middle. Branagh had cast a black actor in one of the roles. In the dialogue Poirot makes a point about the actor's race! What? Was Branagh's condescension and virtue signalling embarrassing for the actor? I cringed.A nuanced story was turned into a caricature of woke morality. Terrible. Branagh had the chutzpah to believe he could fix the story and make it right.",Murder on the Orient Express

It doesn't look like the character from the books, with a hipster style moustache that was totally inaccurate. Branagh's accent mostly just plain English with little or no accent.
This has a brilliant cast and great cinematography with all the romance and drama of the Orient Express captured, which should've made this a great film. The dialog was quite stunted in a number of places, with people looking at each other wondering what was going on, not just the audience. It's a simple enough story made hard to follow by actors who didn't appear to know their characters.
I can only say that I didn't watch the whole film. I was expecting Hercule Poirot and just got Kenneth Branagh with a massively oversized inaccurate moustache being an English man trying to be Belgian.",Murder on the Orient Express

Any guesses as to the murderer? If you're going to rewrite much of the book anyway why not change the ending given anyone remotely interested in this film knows what to expect? Most of the stellar cast has precious little to say or do while Branagh's Poirot grandstands all the way to the preposterous level of pontificating from the top of the snowy rail car.

This is a super boring movie with no suspense whatsoever, which is not what you want for a good murder mystery movie. The characters are dull, and the story is one that could have been interesting, but just wasn't. The only thing positive I can say about this monstrosity is they it was shot well. The big reveal at the end about who was the murderer is horrible and anti-climactic. I haven't read the book or anything but I can tell you that this is a horrible adaptation to it.

This movie has everything you could ask for in a crime/mystery- stunning acting and an intricate plot and beautiful cinematography.
It also managed to do something other movies in this genre such as Sherlock Holmes, failed to do - it was emotional and really managed to touch the audience.

Not only did he fail to delivere a convincing French accent... but he also failed to deliver an authentic Poirot, otherwise we might forget about the accent. The real Poirot is all brains and no brawn. But Branagh/Poirot chases a suspect around a train testle (it holds up the train just fine but is so rotten the suspect falls through the wood). Branagh's Poirot is weary, he needs a vacation. He is tired, he is devastated by the evil he is deciphering, he's overwrought. Alright, he can play it this way, but there's no payoff. There's not really any thrill along the way, and the ending fizzles. The whole movie seemed tired and listless.Positives, a cast of big names. And as a period piece, it did that well.

618,chrisvonoot,Pleasant Surprise,8,7 February 2018,"I avoided this film for the longest time because I have serious reservations, and rightly so, about this trend of remaking films. Not even the star power of Johnny Depp could pull me into watching this film under normal circumstances. It was not until I was utterly desperate for something to watch that I relented and gave this film a try. I am glad that I did. First off, I am an Agatha Christie fan. Murder On the Orient Express is one of the crown jewels of the Christie crown. So, naturally, there was a preponderance of skepticism from the start. I mean, how could anyone but Peter Ustinov play the indomitable Hercule Poirot? This was an open and shut case.....that is, until Kenneth Branagh took up the mantle of the saucy Belgian's mustache. Branagh's performance gives more than enough reason to overlook certain creative liberties taken with the plot or the fact that someone actually had the unmitigated gall to commit acts of cinematic terrorism such as casting Josh Gad McQueen in this film. Branagh truly is the rightful heir to the role of Hercule Poirot and I hope to see more of him. Perhaps in my second favorite Agatha Christie tale, Death on the Nile? The writing and directing in this film were good. Johnny Depp's character lacked depth as did most of the other characters. Michelle Pfeiffer was her usual glorious self as was Judi Dench, Willem Defoe and Derek Jacobi. Nevertheless, the strength of Branagh's performance is more than enough reason to overlook the liberties taken with the plot and the casting misfires. I was pleasantly surprised with this film and look forward to more Hercule Poirot a la Kenneth Branagh.",Murder on the Orient Express

I really wanted to love this new adaptation and found that while its not close to a favorite I did manage to enjoy it. I did wonder why they chose to make it and would have rather seen a different story used. I think that this movie is aimed at drawing new viewers instead of pleasing old ones. Maybe I am easy to please but I recommend giving the movie a watch, and if you enjoy the story to try the classics if you are new to them.",Murder on the Orient Express
620,ccedevitt,I made an account to write this review,2,1 November 2018,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.I have tried to watch this film twice and fell asleep 5 times in the middle. It is extremely dull - and that is coming from the perspective of someone who's never seen the original / read the book and has no idea who the killer is - I should have been on the edge of my seat!
(I should mention that I used to watch watch the tv show as a kid so I know a bit about what Poirot should be.)There are absolutely no clues for the audience and Poirot seems to have some magic source of information that, we audience, are not permitted to to know. There is no feeling of suspense at any point in the film. The sound track was exceedingly dull. The 'evidence' Poirot uses to wrap up the mystery at the end is completely new news to anyone watching the film bar perhaps one or two things but certainly not enough to make the viewer feel in any way a part of the experience. By the end of the film the whole thing just seemed wildly improbable to the point of absolute ludicrousy.The cast is (obviously) great but I felt all their performances fell flat - no matter how good a cast, you just cannot make up for a dull script, especially in a murder mystery!Anyone who thinks this film is any good must just be a fan of pretty posh people walking around in pretty posh clothes in a pretty posh set (with a couple of good CGI effects thrown in for good measure) because, honestly, anyone with a brain would be bored out of their mind.",Murder on the Orient Express

I kept wondering if it was me being difficult, not getting into it, but the user reviews turned out to be very reassuring. Yes fellow reviewers, I make mine most of your statements and perceptions - this film was lame, so unbelievably dull. The cinematography and the CGI were so poor that I genuinely wondered if they were testing a new genre (I didn't want to believe that it was just bad, I mean *that* bad) topped by an irritating cheesy soundtrack, which gets increasingly unbearable towards the end. One can't take Kenneth Branagh's past contributions to filmmaking for granted nor remember him as a respectable actor/director after watching this. His narcisism was utterly disappointing - by making this about his ""performance"", not only he has ruined Agatha Christie's classic but has made anyone else's acting pathetic. It felt like he was trying to be the Indiana Jones' version of Poirot without the character's wit (but if anything, without Harrison Ford's charisma). This is truly regrettable for the stellar cast, but that's hollywood so let's not worry about their embarassment, usually well compensated by the cash. Far more worrying is the fact that this kind of thing makes its way to the theaters and the audience pays $15 with no refund or compensation for the 1h50 lost in their life.",Murder on the Orient Express

With all of today's technology and the real life location shots, I was expecting spectacular. What I got was a dud.I was not expecting for them to change character names, drop characters, have other characters change their professions, add chases (can you really see Poirot chasing someone?), Poiroit making light of his OCD (really???), a derailment, a stabbing (not Rachett), a shooting, etc that never happened in the story. Also left out was some of the logic leading to the solution. They could have made a splendid movie with all the great scenery, CGI, etc., without changing the actual story. Poor Agatha, must be having fits.In addition, even though they had splendid actors, only Daisy Ridley and Johnny Depp gave worthy performances. All of the rest were unconvincing, even Branagh.Then the topper.. the last scene has a officer coming to get Poirot to ask him to go to Egypt to solve a murder on the Nile. What is the world???

He had a stellar cast, a wonderful and well-known story, and he got in his own way.
I know it is hard to remake a classic murder-mystery and give it a fresh take, but this was a serious fail. I hated the way Kenneth portrayed Poirot. 
I admit that when I read the book years ago, I figured out who the murderer was, but even so, I enjoyed the way the 1974 version strung the viewers along until the big reveal.
In this version, the clues and solution pop up like memes or hashtags on social media.

When the original had true stars like Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, Anthony Perkins, and Sean Connery, how in the world do you replace that?

Kenneth Branagh is a talented fellow, and there was a vast array of talented actors here, and yet, it was strangely uninvolving. It was all so disjointed and pointless, the murder, the journey, the suspects, the raison d'etre of the story. And Branagh uttering these words, as Hercule Poirot: 'I am probably the greatest detective in the world' took things to a new level of banality. It's a great pity, though. I'm sure he started with a half-decent idea. If I damn it, it's also because it's a product of modern cinema, plagued by some very untalented artists, or those too easily swayed by the executives who call the shots. Drama is a very old principle. This film had no drama, no interesting interaction, a complete failure of dialogue. The makers should watch old films and take copious notes.

Greedy studios with no imagination other than rebooting a film or franchise that doesn't need to be re-booted and then letting a hack scriptwriter get hold of it and murder it. Completely pointless opening sequence to pretend the film has something original to offer and then a slapstick pastiche rip off of the 1974 classic with zero charm, zero dialogue, zero soundtrack plenty of dull, lumbering monologues and in total a clumsy excuse for film-making.

I do have to admit...I wasn't the biggest fan of the 1974 version, so maybe that's why. And it's not that I just reject older Agatha Christie movies. I loved Death on the Nile (1978), and Evil Under the Sun (1982). But this remake was beautifully shot, well written, and DIDN'T move at a seemingly glacial pace, which is something that occasionally annoys me about a lot of early 70's films. I love film from every time period, but seriously...I think the popularity of quaaludes had an obviously quantifiable effect on the films of the 70's. Everything was soooooooo drawn out and kind of boring. And washed out, color-wise. Yes, yes, I know I'm going to catch a ton of s**t about this. Anyway, I thought the actors did a fine job, and I especially have to single out Branagh for his take on Hercule Poirot (and his directing!). I would never have believed anyone could replace Peter Ustinov in my heart as Poirot, but he made the character his own. He went with a more serious, more complex and tortured, more inward-looking Poirot, instead of the quippy, sassy, amused and amusing Poirot that Ustinov gave us...which is not to say Branagh's Poirot was humorless...""Forgive me, I am Belgian"" had me laughing out loud.

652,wcddhd,Terribly miscast and static,2,31 March 2018,"First, Branagh has staged this movie like a stage play. So many shots are static pans of the cast seated like tableaus including the big reveal at the end staged like the Last Supper. So many characters are miscast age-wise especially Daisy as a governess. Since the gimmick is to portray the characters as strangers to each other, the major fail is that they do not interact as strangers are want to do. The few ridiculous overhead shots are disconcerting rather than adding to the movie in any way. Frankly, 2 hours of long shots of the train traveling through the countryside would have been a more enjoyable movie.

As an avid fan of Agatha Christie novels and David Suchet's depiction of Poirot, I found Kenneth Brannagh's portrayal quite welcome. I walked into this movie already knowing how it might end and still found his Poirot likable (Hercule's mustache is ridiculous regardless of the length) and the passengers convincing (but otherwise, as forgettable as the cast in Suchet's Murder On the Orient Express). It was an entertaining movie. It certainly had flaws. The intro scene could have been tighter and some of the passengers could have had more character development, but compared to many of the other titles released this year, I found this movie pretty decent overall.",Murder on the Orient Express

Poor & Very poor performance from everyone else. For too many liberties taken and changes made in this movie. Important clues not in the movie but the conclusion was. What is with that mustache, which is so wrong to the Poirot. Bottom line the movie just did not come together and was cornball. It seemed to me that Kenneth Branagh was having a love fest with himself. If Albert Finny was alive I would be sending him an apology for going to see the re-make. Agatha Christie's family clearly was in just for the money and not the integrity. After the movie I went home and put the 1974 Albert Finny movie on. 200% a better movie which Agatha Christie attended and approved of.",Murder on the Orient Express

He might pull of such an interesting caracters. It is not nesseseary as a main role but he might be one of the people on train. I would like to see him as a suspect. And also movie publicity made all about Johhny Depp. Probably makers thought he will gather attention for the movie but it is a mistake that give him such a small role.Except that i like the visions.

656,giankouf,With zero expectations..,9,29 November 2017,Almost every review i read is filled with disappointed expectations or comparisons with other movies..I will review the movie as my eyes saw it in the cinema.First of all the main actor. He played the Hercule great the acting was 10/10 the accent the appearance and everything fit so good like we've seen him before.The acting of the rest of the cast was little but still amazing. Every actor played his/her part as it was needed and as much it was needed to send only the necessary messagesThe whole movie gave the perfect feeling of an Agatha Christie novel and like it was written for the theaters. The two hours of the movie never tired me for a minute. The action was constant (as much action it can have for a mystery murder case movie i mean no fighting situations)The directing was flawless in my opinion the music amazing and the plot and execution brilliant. These were 2 hours of my life well spend and i would spend them again. Isn't that the point to have fun? well that movie was a ton of fun. Have a good day.,Murder on the Orient Express
657,Unfalr,The mistery,1,11 February 2018,"The plot over all is good but presented in a weak way , the old movies of this sort are good but this one is missing all elements of those movies from the days. No back ground of the lead role detective for example , and his choices are not explained in any way and don't make sense if this was not a movie. Whit no evidence and no explanation everything is pieced together for the sake of a grand finale that i find stupid and boring from the unexplained choice of the lead role that states one way of life and just turns and forsakes all that he stands for.If I went to the see this movie in theater i will demand a refund for the disappointment that is this movie.",Murder on the Orient Express

It's very funny and deep in places. I almost like his version of Poirot better than David Suchez. I may watch that version next which was made a few Christmases ago.

661,soraswork,Good performances let down by the screenplay,7,21 November 2017,"Murder on the Orient Express is the second most known mystery novel by the Agatha Christie, the best selling mystery novelist in of all time. And it's a pretty good book, with a very out there mystery which Poirot, in his usual manner, sums up in a seemingly impossible series of logical leaps right at the end as all the twists and turns are suddenly revealed.And therein lies the problem with this movie. Oh, to go over the rest, well it's fine and dandy. Branagh brings a great, thoroughly entertaining Poirot to the screen. Really he's the reason I enjoyed it at all. The rest of the cast feels like they're giving a good effort as well, even if most of them don't have enough screen time, or lines, to be as effective as they might have been.Heck I'll give an extra bonus to Daisy Ridley, who gives the best performance of all them next to Branagh himself, and that with far less screen time to do so. Other than being obviously too young for the part she's playing she's near perfect in the role. And while I'm praising the movie I might say I'd be tempted to vote it for best Cinematography in the Oscars. It's an absolutely gorgeous film at times.But, well it's a mystery film. And that's getting back to the problem that lies at the heart of it, which is that writer Michael Green doesn't give the audience nearly enough credit in figuring out what the actual mystery is; nor does he give the actual mystery part near enough focus. Unlike the book we are given far, far too many real suspects, and far too many hints and coincidences to really be blown away by Poirot's revelations by the end. Instead of a dramatic, shocking twist ending that makes the likes of The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense feel like they broadcast and foreshadowed their endings to the high heavens we just get an ""Oh. OK I guess. That makes sense.""And this preys upon the rest of the movie as well. It isn't an engaging mystery where the mystery itself is the star of the show, and we're honed in on trying to figure it out. Instead it plays more like a character piece with the amiable Poirot himself as the star, rather than the mystery where the focus should be. Which is a shame really. The writer does a very nice job otherwise of adapting a book that could be a stage play into something more filmic. All the characters are introduced well, taking Poirot's personalityless Watson clone/foil out entirely works out wonderfully. But a mystery without the mystery as the star really does fall short in a fundamental way.",Murder on the Orient Express
662,tbtomblueberry,Even better than the film adaptation with Sir Peter Ustinov,10,19 February 2020,"The cast is brilliant! Kenneth Branagh portrays a kinky but most intelligent Hercules Poirot, even more congenial than Sir Peter.

663,flaviu-11839,an useless remake,6,9 February 2018,"With all due respect to Mr. Branagh's ilustrious career as actor and director, one question arises in my mind: WHY? Why ruin an exceptional book, and a brilliant who-dunnit plot, only for the ambition of YOU playing the Master of little grey cells? Yes, Albert Finney played a poor Poirot in 1974, mumbling around and shouting, but the assembly cast was remarkable: starting with easy-to-hate Ratchett/Widmark, to the other exceptional actors. Of course, the 2010 version, with David Suchet ((= Hercule Poirot as would've been blessed by Dame Agatha Christie herself...) was the most accurate, from start to finish, beautifully played (even there, were some weak characters but, Poirot WAS top of the act). Now? Poirot involved in fist fighting, holding a gun (?), watching with deer-like eyes to his lost love Katherine (not Vera Rossakoff, everyone?). climbing on top of the train, Arbuthnot changed as rase and behaviour (sorry, Mr. Connery!), Penelope Cruz was not a good choice, even Johnny Depp plays a poor Cassetti, going down the hill, and easily forgotten, the Andrenyi guy a martial arts expert (really?!) and, of course, THE moustache (like a cavalry colonel in India or Burma, in late 20's). Of course, some hints of a different view on the plot arised from the trailer, a while ago but, come on, folks! Sorry, but I think I've lost 114' of my life, watching this poorly directed/played so-called ""remake"". Unfortunately, the world of cinema continues to go down, slowly, living out of remakes (Death Wish on the run, right?), poor acting, and vision lost. Hardly a fresh adaptation of a brilliant book: where is the thrill of any Poirot mystery? Long gone, after the 25 years Poirot/Suchet reign, sorry. The Sherlock Holmes from Guy Ritchie was not Jeremy Brett, but it was fun to watch. This one, no. I rate it 6 only from enormous respect to the work of Agatha Christie (who made this movie possible, after all) and to the efforts of Mrs. Michelle Pfeiffer, the only true actor in this 2018 version. I am SO disappointed...",Murder on the Orient Express

First of all, I like to say the positives: the production design is beautiful and the cinematography is very impressive. The cast is full of talented actors and actresses. What could go wrong?Then, it goes downhill from the crammed mess of a screenplay. I was left confused during expository scenes, and I found myself not remembering any of the characters, except for the main protagonist. I feel like the writer and director is so sure that audiences would remember every exposition/information thrown at them in almost like a 3-minute sequence of a bunch of interrogations. And a couple of moments where the writing crew thought it would spice up the action, but instead they really did nothing to the already convoluted story. I guess Hollywood's gotta Hollywood with a mystery by adding unnecessary action scenes.And when it comes to the climax of the mystery, I already predicted the twist. After the first hour passed, I began to realize how unbelievably convenient these individual characters who are seemingly strangers to each other, are somehow connected to a crime committed by Johnny Depp's character. I had the all-of-the-passengers-murdered-Johnny-Depp theory in mind until the climax, and I was glad that it was true. I think that twist made my spirits lift a bit, but I wasn't feeling the drama that unfolded after that.

After waiting excitedly since Dec 2016 I could only bare 55 minutes it was too painful and I walked out on this $USD55 million doozy. Final straw was Kenneth Branagh's moustache which seemed to distract from his dialogue rather than add to it (a la Nanny McPhee). Think Horatio less Hercule.Tragedy finally struck this movie with lack of flavour in the editing and soundtrack selections. I wasn't even bothered by the fact it was a remake of a 1974 classic as this is the pulling power of a great writer.

If you require explosions and gratuitous sex, then I advise that you pass.Filling two hours with familiar whodunit intrigue, ""Murder"" chugs down the tracks at the pace of a scenic railroad. This is not to say that the film is ever boring; however, one is advised to board this train with a tall coffee and an empty bladder.The train-car set used throughout the film is truly gorgeous. With all its clever camera work and CGI blending, I wonder if National Geographic was behind this film. Cinematography alone earns this film several stars... and probably an Oscar. With all its clever lighting, perspective, and composition, ""Murder"" would actually hold up well in black & white.Don't hold the mega cast against this film; they aren't there so much to dazzle you as to support a story in which everyone truly matters. Even if you know that story, you'll enjoy it.If only the wind-up weren't quite so long and labored, this could be a five-star film. I think Messr.

I haven't read the book either, but was really curious to see this movie. I saw it in cinema a couple of hours ago and when I came online here, I had to write a review of my own because I only saw negative ones and wondered why. I loved it. It's a movie I'd go and see multiple times. Yes, it can be a bit slow some times, but I think it matches the theme. (Of course, the Imagine Dragons music in the trailer and the hideous modern, blue fonts were a mistake I find odd. True style breaker.) The costumes and set is just lovely, I was blown away by the creative aspects of the camera. There's one shot that's 'hanging on the ceiling' and you look down at two heads. I thought that was brilliant, in that setting at that specific time in the story. Furthermore I thought all performances were good and it wasn't a Branagh one-man show, it was the full cast that got me. I believed their characters and didn't expect the ending of this film.

673,littlebittykitties,"World famous, infallible detective Hercule Poirot is on the case. Sit back and let him do all the thinking!",6,13 November 2017,"Murder on the Orient ExpressKenneth Branagh, Director Overheard during Previews of Coming Attractions: ""Well, I like Liam Neeson, but that looks stupid.""We feel ya, lady seated in the next row back. We like Kenneth Branagh, and Johnny Depp, and Judi Dench, and Willem Dafoe, and Michelle Pfeiffer, and Penelope Cruz (well, sorta), and Josh Gad and Derek Jacobibut this movie is stupid.OK. Maybe we're out of line to say such a thing about this lush production full of all these beautiful people. There were at least a couple of noteworthy elements to this 70mm spectacle: 1. Branagh's mesmerizing mustache and 2. that super cool avalanche.It probably is unjust to impugn a film when you're not the intended audience. And there was fair warning. We knew going in that it was an Agatha Christie murder mystery; that Hercule Poirot would treat us like Perry Mason treated our mothers back in the day – rudely! Condescendingly – as though they were in the room, but unworthy of a glance let alone intelligent participation.But we went to MOE anyway. The previews were just so pretty.Also, we grant that it's not reasonable to downgrade a movie that we slept through, even if we snoozed only a very few minutes, 10 at the most. But let's be clear:Hercule Poirot is not normal. Yes, yes, we know, that's the premise. He's extraordinary. By his own declaration, he's ""probably the greatest detective in the world."" But come on – nobody is that deductively gifted. Nobody. We wanted to set aside our disbelief, but we just couldn't. Maybe because he is so irritatingly smug as he plies his powers of observation; though admittedly Branagh in the role brings a more likable facet to Poirot, maybe when he gazes regretfully at the photo of his long-lost love, Katherine. (It's actually a pic of a young Emma Thompson, Branagh's ex!)And once, when he was rejecting the gangster Edward Ratchett's (Johnny Depp) request for Poirot's services as a body guard, did he seem to be acting on normal, believable human instincts. The rest of the time Poirot ricochets from suspect to suspect, exposing their most obscure inclinations and carefully secreted skeletons with barely a glimpse of their knuckles. He revealed Gerhard Hardman (Willem Dafoe) as a phony because of a misplaced accent on one syllable of one word! Lucky it had no impact on the plot.Hercule Poirot doesn't play nice. He has all the good clues and won't share them. His mode of operating is to spring them on us when it's most likely to make us, embodied in his shadow tag-along, feel dumb – less competent, less insightful – than HE is. We want to play along with the detective thing and feel at least dull-normal in our ability to track. But Poirot keeps all the real clues for himself, never giving the viewer a fair shot.Speaking of which: Too many red herrings! O.M.G! Every passenger has a perfectly good motive and opportunity. The ins and outs of the convoluted threads of the intertwined lives of the complex relationships and the improbable likelihood of their all having E- tickets on the same train on the same day, across this scary computer- generated landscape – well, it's more than an earnest crime solver can endure.The resolution is beyond implausible. Don't worry, we won't spoil it for you here, but rest assured, if you're a normal, investigation- loving, CSI-binge watching, Forensic Files geek, you will be so angry by the time you get to the Last Supper tableau in the finale, you'll want to turn on your cell phone right there in the theater and, and, and...what? Call your mother? Tell her what she already knows: All this exposition of the inexplicable (in reasonable, believable terms) makes a movie-goer want to spin around and explode.Perfectly good actors left us unmoved because even though MOE is a period piece, NOBODY ever thought those thoughts or plotted those plots or did those things. In this script their characters are useful only in delivering misdirection. So Golden Globe winner & Oscar nominee Michelle Pfeiffer, as Mrs. Hubbard, is only to be avoided. Golden Globe & Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe, as Gerhard Hardman, barely rates a dismissive shrug. And Golden Globe & Oscar winner Judi Dench – Dame Judi! – whose glances can wither, seems bloodless and full of moth balls. Only Daisy Ridley, as Miss Mary Debenham, truly engages and challenges Poirot, and grips the audience with a true air of mystery.So, yeah. We probably weren't the intended audience and this is a biased review. This story, this movie, is of a time gone by. If you can still enjoy Sherlock Holmes talking down to sweet old Watson, you'll be fine. If you don't mind being treated as a lame second fiddle rather than a full on partner in solving the crime, well, this is the show for you. Have fun watching Poirot in action.For today's mystery fans and crime solvers, not so much.*********Six DegreesDaisy Ridley in Murder on the Orient Express 1.

The film starts with a relatively entertaining light-hearted action sequence which brings Poirot to the forefront of the story-line. But, it quickly goes downhill from here. We are then introduced to the rest of the cast and we quickly learn they all have their own stories. After this though, the film becomes incredibly dull and slow.

692,dalelandkaties,A testimont to Branagh's directorial talents but falls a little flat.,7,21 February 2020,"It has taken me ages to get round to watching this film - despite being a huge Agatha Christie fan - and I was not disappointed. That said, I was not wowed either.The absence of David Suchet, who I was clearly not expecting to see going into this, is still hard hitting. He is Poirot! And it took well over half an hour to accept Kenneth Branagh as the acclaimed detective. However, he provided a powerful performance throughout the film as he highlighted many of Poirot's obvious quirks and a suitably sufficient Belgian accent. The moustache is unusually different but noticeably iconic non the less.The supporting cast is full of big names and noticeable faces, from Daisy Ridley to Penélope Cruz. The biggest of these by far was the doomed salesman, Johnny Depp. Unfortunately, much like every film I see him in now, I only see a shadow of the actor he once was and far too much Jack Sparrow still peeking through in his performance. Thankfully, he isn't on screen for long and does play the sleezy salesman with sufficient success. Many of the other performances fell flat for me too, with many underdeveloped characters and dry dialogue. Josh Gad was able to break out from this however in his role, perhaps due to an extended screen time or further action based sequences.There is not much to speak of in terms of plot without spoiling the film or reiterating the book. But, as previously mentioned, Poirot and the other characters are introduced hastily and with mild success. Their back stories are brushed over in a helpful way as their paths that led them to the Orient Express are unveiled. Whilst this is necessary for pace of the film, it makes it hard to find a connection with many of these people.Much of the cinematography in this film is outstanding, with excellent overhead shots within the compact compartments of the train carriages. There is also a shot near the end that appeared to perfectly resemble that of The Last Supper, which is a superb nod of what is to come. For this alone, this film is worth watching.Overall, this film was another testimont to Branagh's directorial talents and has left me yearning for further adventures of Hercule Poirot.Overall, this film was another testimont to Branagh's directorial talents and has left me yearning for further adventures of Hercule Poirot.",Murder on the Orient Express

Also the all star cast is sadly wasted in the director's personal ego trip. The scene between Hercule Poirot and Edward Henry Masterman is tedious and too quiet and the conversation is bland and doesn't lead the mind to a convoluting plot, you are still conscious that you may have left the kettle on in the kitchen, and that the dog may need to go outside. The whole film is tedious in the extreme, you have to have suspense, you have to have alluring flirtatious ladies, you have to have sneaky suspicions of murder, you have to have impending danger, all you get is boredom, no suspense.

Kenneth Branagh was sensational as Poirot. A top performance and the character was very well written - very human, not cartoonish. The introduction (the scenes before boarding the train) were really great as well, set design, pacing, everything. The action scenes, while not strictly necessary, did not bother me.

I don't get hyped because of the casts but i expect something grand from the main case and how 2017 can squeeze the elaborate occurrence happened in the train.the positive vibe that i get from the beginning of the movie is constantly becoming bland repertoire among the detective and his suspects. i wish they prepare this movie more serious, in a sense, with an exception of the ending, the whole movie is rather boring, there's no suspense or thrill. i am clueless on how much the movie deviates from the book but i lost the same excitement i got in seeing other distinguished detectives or crime-solving movies.however, it is concluded with a stunning ending that in my opinion can do some amend to salvage the movie.i am not sure how much were skewed from the source due to the filmmaker interpretation, and certainly as someone who hasn't read the book i cant compare both of them, but after seeing this movie, i think it's rather a disappointing one, again, with an exception of the mind-blown reveal at the end accompanied by a question about the value of justice when justice is fail to be served.i am quite satisfied with the start and the end but i think the movie can be more interesting in the middle, its just too plain. i wish i can give 7 but 6.5 for me.",Murder on the Orient Express

713,bachir-08,Should've been better.,3,18 November 2017,"First of all, I feel obligated to share with you what this movie means personally to me. I have read the book by Agatha Christie twice, then watched Sidney Lumet's 1974 take and adored revisiting Hercule Poirot's investigation every single time. Albert Finney perfectly captured the essence of the character and the M. Lumet's directorial skills left me on the edge of my seat for the entire run time of the movie. ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is my favorite Agatha Christie novel, and Hercule Poirot one of my favorite literature characters. Having said that, it is with absolute sorrow that I say that Kenneth Branagh's remake made me leave the theater utterly disappointed. The movie's not all bad, of course. One thing that really caught my attention was the set and costume designs. Everything looked authentic, and I can see the film getting a couple of Oscar nominations in these two categories (maybe even win one à la Suicide Squad). Something that was talked about a lot was the cast. Everybody did a good job but unfortunately nobody was given a real chance to shine. I found some of the casting choices unnecessarily distracting and questionable (Daisy Ridley, Josh Gad or Johnny Depp). Kenneth Branagh was okay I guess.. But Albert Finney was a superior Poirot in my opinion. As I mentioned earlier, I found the movie to be very disappointing, and here is why: The film was tonally inconsistent (it started off goofy and over the top to suddenly take a much more serious approach), there was no character development, the cinematography could've been better.. But the thing that annoyed me the most was the screenplay. The dialogue was cheesy, some added scenes took me out of the general ambiance the movie was going for, and I never felt included in the investigation. That movie added nothing to the original. In fact, the few scenes that were added ruined what is one of the best detective stories ever written. And that's too bad.",Murder on the Orient Express

The ending!!!! Poirot almost crying, .. really ( I would not even speak about the sequences where he stares at his girlfriend's picture... that is not Poirot) !?? What about the sequel , ""Death on the Nile"" ? At the end, a guy goes to Poirot and tells him there has been a murder in Egypt, probably opening the door to the famous "" Death on the Nile"". The problem is that the movie doesn't start by the murder and Poirot is already on the Nile when it occurs ( both in the book and the previous version of Death on The Nile). The only good point is the photography. It looks good, nice CGs, I wish they would had Computer generated the actors as well...

The film is enjoyable enough but I'm glad I didn't pay cinema prices to see it. 
I guess it will probably more acceptable to younger Christie fans who haven't seen Sidney Lumet's 1974 classic with its fabulous ensemble cast and sumptuous settings.

Kenneth Branaghs portrayal as Poriot which I initially viewed as hilarious in the extreme given the ridiculously comic moustache he donned for the role culminated in a rather convincing performance with me totally buying into him as Belgiums finest ever detective. The film although beautifully shot is still just a little too glossy and smooth, lacking the atmospheric tension of the original. The plot is pretty faithful with the cast doing what's expected of them, although some like Penelope Cruz had peripheral characters who offered little throughout. Remaking a whodunnit especially a famous one seems rather pointless, as most people will know who the culprit is anyway.

There is a point in the movie where you realize there are too many coincidences and you can pretty much guess who the killer is, but you really can't say for sure until the very end. I loved all the scenery and vibrancy of the time. Each character in the film is very much their own and unalike others. I have never read Agatha Christie nor seen early versions of this movie, but I really enjoyed her plot. I think the classic murder mystery needs a revival because very many these days leave me feeling down about the world, but coming out of the theater from this one, I felt satisfied. For those wondering, there was no foul language and no sex scenes, so, besides a scene of violence, it's pretty safe for all ages to see.

The first thing that hit me is Poirot's accent. I have worked with Belgians for 35 years, and that is, at most, a bad Flemish accent. Certainly not a French speaking Belgian's. Belgian French is pretty much French, and when they speak English they sound more or less like French people. Branagh's accent is not at all that. Probably close to a Dutch or German speaking English. And besides when he speaks French he does not even sound French. I guess this is the problem with actor-directors. They often fail their character because there isn't a director to guide them, and they focus so much on their character that they forget to direct the other actors.

Given the narrative structure, could it be said that a more nuanced take and portrayal of some things would have brought out more of the actors' skills and given the work a greater depth?

This is the worst adaption in plot and second worst in the total appreciation. Only the CGI scenery lifted up the score a bit. Even the Japanese adaption which put the set on Hokkaido instead of Balkan is better than this. Unnecessary subplots like the wailing wall case and money stealing only lengthen the movie and shorten the reasoning. e.g., The association of Freebody and Debenham was gone and suddenly, magically, Poirot was convinced Debenham was the governess. Amazing. The association of twelve people in a jury, threatening letter and the no. of passengers was gone. Poirot also didn't need to ask the maid for the first name of the Princess (which is Natalia) so that he could deduce the association N and H in the handkerchief. So, this Poirot suddenly accused the whole team of passengers of killing and they amazing admitted right away. In the original novel, it was only when Poirot ""guess"" quite correctly about what happened in the train on the night of murder then the passengers confessed that he knew everything. Also, an elegant Poirot who insisted on using his grey cells needed to fighter in this adaption. Did the studio require the writer to add some fight scene? This is a fail adaption.

Except the ""Poirot"" and how he was written, directed and acted. End result literally had nothing in common with the original other than the name. Some change is good and preferrable (otherwise there would be no reason to make remakes) but if you change everything of the character, why still call it that? Why not just go one small step further, change the name and be done with it.While Poirot was snobby, proud to a fault and at times arrogant (but never attention seeking as that's not how gentleman behaves), this version just seems like more of a overacted parody version of him.
First nails to the coffin was the egg-scene.. Enough about that. The next was the ""step in pile of poo"".. Jeez!!! And from there thing really started spiraling down! One of the last and biggest nails to the coffin was a serious physical altercation between ""Poirot"" and a other passanger. Hercule Poirot was, to say it bluntly, obese. Despite his years in police force while younger, he really had none of the fitness left in him. He actually suffered from it and was forced to take health vacation to lose weight. In this movie, ""Poirot"" fights like Crouching Tiget and runs stairs up and down without breaking a sweat... Again, total, absolutely opposite of the original material. 
Sad, i was really hoping much from this. Good follower for David Suchet and his performance. Instead i got spoonfull of cinnamon.I give 6/10 stars to the general quality and other cast, but ""Poirot"" gets -1/10 making the final 5/10. Couldn't bare to give more stars for a movie that's main point is the title character and that sinks down like a lead weight.",Murder on the Orient Express

742,u-14102,Just OK,6,13 November 2017,"This movie has some amazing CGI, But some of it felt overacted and rushed. While this wasn't Kenneth Branagh's best achievement it was all right. I felt that it dragged on for a bit too long and, i'll admit some people fell asleep during the first 20 minutes of the movie. Daisy Ridley was alright in her role, so was Willem Dafoe and Josh Gad. It was an awesome cast but they didn't stand up to their full potential. 6/10!",Murder on the Orient Express
743,DancingLiv,A nice surprise,8,3 November 2017,"I was a bit skeptical about this movie, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, it's not perfect, and sometimes Branagh overdo it a little, but whoever likes the genre will be captured by the fantastic atmosphere and will not be bored, because Branagh has been able to put some pepper on the story. His Poirot convinced me and the old glories like Judy Dench, Willelm Defoe and Johnny Depp do their job and do it well, but in my opinion the most interesting notes come from the young people: I personally loved Josh Gad and Daisy Ridley, but the real surprise was Sergei Polunin: I mean, for those who saw him performing as dancer, it's not a real surprise, but it's really hard to believe it was his first time in a movie! He has given to his character this melancholy, turbulent and passionate aura, halfway between a Shakespearean prince and James Dean. His expressions, his little gestures, the way he looked at his wife, he made me feel like a teenager who cannot wait to buy his poster and stick it over her bed! And let me say, that guy definitely knows how to ""handle"" a woman as well as he can deliver a kick! As usual, more the critics hate a film, more it worth to be seen.",Murder on the Orient Express
744,jeffoswald,Dreadful,2,13 August 2018,"I am a huge fan of the 1974 Sidney Lumet version. Even if you already knew what was going to occur, Lumet managed to create tension and drama by utilizing an excellent cast and pacing of the plot. The David Suchet version is also exceptionally well done and is a 1b to Lumet's 1a in my opinion. What made these adaptations so good was that they were more or less loyal adaptions to Christie's novel and managed to capture the spirit of the original story. So when I heard that a remake of this movie had been done, I initially refused to see it. Far too many classics have been recently remade and most have been disappointing or downright awful. I wish I had stuck to my original decision.Alas, I found it on one of the premium movie channels and I could not resist the temptation. I knew that we were in trouble early on when Branagh (whom I usually like very much i.e. Dunkirk) decided to play Poirot not as the dandy that ANYONE who is familiar with this classic character knows him to be. It is like taking James Bond and making him a pacifist.Then there are the goofy camera angles. What is the point of the shots that literally only show the TOP of the character's head? What the hell is he doing on top of the train? Ugh. The casting. What a waste of a good cast. Here is a clue for you scriptwriters. When you dramatically change the characters, you dramatically change the script. The story begins to morph into something that is completely unrecognizable. This is definitely the case with this movie. The characters do things that are completely incomprehensible and only adds to the confusion. The classic ""reveal"" scene at the end of the movie falls completely flat. Here is a suggestion to all of you movie moguls. Instead of butchering classic versions of movies (Murder on Orient, Magnificent Seven, Poseidon Adventure, Ben-Hur, etc etc.) why don't you take some of the mediocre or above average stories of the past and try to IMPROVE on them. If you feel compelled to remake a classic, at least try to be loyal to the original movie and material. After all, we call them classics for a reason.",Murder on the Orient Express

746,bs-33761,A great movie that blew me away,9,14 December 2017,"Pre-Spoiler: The movie is great with the focus more on the people and less on the murder.
I can't agree with the negative Reviews of this movie.When i went into the cinema, i was expecting a movie that tries too hard to showcase it's stars but not the Story. And in my opinion... i was dead wrong.The movie begins very lighthearted. Not only showing Hercule Poirots remarkable skill, but also explaning and especially showing, that he is not a genius, but in fact a broken human being who needs to right the wrongs, so his inner balance can remain.Hercule Poirot explains, that he sees the world as it is supposed to be. Perfect. And all the little flaws are therefor much more noticeable.The movie reflects this wonderfully when introducing the cast. All the characters are slightly over the top. It appears that their acting is just a tad too much.Johnny Depp is the obvious Gangster.
MacQueen is the typical lackey
Mr. Masterman is a typical Butler without any special features.
Caroline Hubbard is a mancrazy (and crazy) woman
Count Rudolph Andrenyi is a violent Psychopath.
etc.The movie shows us... and Poirot...these people the way we are supposed to perceive them. In Black and White. Right and wrong.After the murder, the whole perspective starts to shift. The more time we spend with the characters, the more they become 3-dimensional.The black and white starts to blur into grey. This contrasts with how Poirot sees the world and he needs to come to grips with the world being grey.That's why the focus of the movie doesn't really lie on the actual murder itself, but on the Impact it has on our hero.When he discovers the real reasons for the murder and how it happened, the movie gives us one obvious but very strong Picture.The last supper. The orchestrator sitting in the middle. 11 collaborators around her. But one seat remains empty. The seat of Judas.Because Judas isn't part of the collective. Poirot is Judas. And he needs to decide if he will do the ""right"" thing and betray them, or if he will have to accept grey... for the first time in his life.
The movie showcased the pain of Hercule Poirot perfectly and leaves you with an ending where there are only victims.The murder victims.
The murderers.
and the last big victim

750,thatguythatnoonelikes,Was expecting much more.,6,11 November 2017,"As a fan of murder-mystery movies, I was quite eager to watch this film when I first heard of it. I came in expecting an exciting story that would keep us at the edge of our seats, avidly anticipating the solution to the murder. What I got was quite the contrary. The premise of the film was quite intriguing, however the plot was dull and beyond disappointing. There is a promising start, but the rest was just... purely mediocre. There is no building of suspense, just the detective indulging in idle discussion with the suspects that leads nowhere. The ending was also quite predictable, though I won't spoil it in this review. My 6/10 rating receives most of its credit for the aesthetic cinematography, which did an excellent job in creating a fitting mood for the type of movie this is. I also must admit the casting was quite impressive. Yes, I did get an emotional response from this film, and yes, it did have some nice themes. I just felt the plot really let it down, and although it was almost 2 hours long, it felt too short to be an effective mystery movie. Not bad, overall- I was just expecting more from it.",Murder on the Orient Express

753,huginn-74819,A must see of 2017,9,6 November 2017,"What I liked about this movie is that Branagh has managed to add action and humor to the story without spoiling the claustrophobic and mysterious atmosphere of the original novel. The care for the details is great, the movie it's shot on 65mm film, not everyone like this, but I find it very interesting. In general, I enjoyed the whole cast, but some impressed me more than others.Kenneth Branagh. I like his Poirot, I know that everyone is fond of previous versions but I've always found Poirot's past interpretations too ""two-dimensional"" and repetitive...Branagh has managed to make Poirot a more ""human"" character. And even though many criticize his mustache, I found them much more reasonable than those ridiculous little mustaches that I always see on Poirot's face.Johnny Depp. I know that lately he's not in his best shape, but it's still Johnny Depp and his sharp smiles are an happy vision for those who have always loved his films. Dame Judy Dench: She is always a guarantee and a living reminder of the blessing that theatrical actors are for cinema.Penelope Cruz: her transformations have always fascinated me, her acting has a peculiarity that goes beyond the simple ""exotic"" charm of her beauty and accent.Sergei Polunin. The camera simply loves this guy. I really enjoyed the documentary about his story, Dancer, and in a real movie he didn't disappoint my expectations. He has a magnetic charm and an intensity of expression that remain impressed and he was able to emerge even in a minor role among so many big stars. I hope to see soon Polunin in roles that give him more freedom of expression.Daisy Ridley: To be honest I hated the new Star Wars film, so I'm happy to saw her in a totally different context much more suitable to her recitation skills.In conclusion, if you, like me, feel real joy in seeing that you always disagree with this pseudo-intellectual critics who are just waiting to destroy movies like this just to show everyone how intelligent and alternative they are, Murder on the Orient Express is the movie for you!",Murder on the Orient Express

I have seen only one preceding adaptation of this Poirot story, and it was the one in which David Suchet forms Hercule Poirot on screen and I have to say that I liked that film much better, than this new one. It's my personal opinion, maybe just because I've already seen another perspective I cannot be objective in judging the new one. I give still 7 points out of 10 for it, because it is till enjoyable and I can recommend to watch it - at least once.",Murder on the Orient Express

Imagine sitting on the edge of your seat, waiting for the miraculous twist of who could have murdered the man? The clues have been lined up, your mind dwelling into all the signs that were presented to you.But no. No. It required little to no effort at all, as the twist was the lousiest piece of screen writing I have ever witnessed. I expected more from this film, as the gradual pacing and excellent character development left me unsatisfied.They teased me with the mysterious set up, and successfully poured acid on my arsse in return. Not what I expected, and certainly not what I wanted. To conclude, disappointing ending that left me frustrated",Murder on the Orient Express
756,petra_engstrom,"Don't overanalyze, just enjoy!!",8,10 January 2021,"Okay, so I'm tired of hearing/reading peoples' overly critical reviews for this film. If you cannot see a film without breaking it apart and scrutinising every part like it's some kind of science project, of course you will find flaws with any movie. But calling this film a disaster and advising others against even seeing it is silly.So back to the review: I love the book and the old version of the film (I've watched it many times). That aside, I really like this version too. I have watched it 3 times so far and there's no denying is a highly enjoyable film to watch, it's visually stunning and it's filmed in an interesting way with unusual angles and perspectives.

I begrudgingly have to admit MotOE is a great story, and I am old enough to remember the original's realease. That was a tight, claustrophobic achievement, a lasting record of a number of players now dead.Neither am I a fan of Branagh. Why bother remaking Wallander, except to get his face front and centre? Why make such a horrible hash of the Magic Flute? Whjy is this lipless actor with a very ordinary presence and a mid range voice so praised?Dunno, but I thought I'd watch this and from a few of the reviews I see Branagh hasn't fooled anyone this time. He adds a prologue which adds nothing to the story except his own face and which loosens the focus and drama of the story. 
So many many many shots of his face! And all put there by himself, the director, with an entirely absurd moustache and a superstar grimace. Oh dear. This film should be renamed 'The many faces of Kenny B on the Orient Express'. Appalling.",Murder on the Orient Express

While I agree that Hollywood needs to calm down on the remakes and start valuing original content, I thought this movie was simply fantastic. Why do people say that this movie was an ego boost for Kenneth Branagh? Seriously, why? He's the main character of the story. The other actors each had smaller parts than him. Yes, I did read the book, and I have to say that they were very similar. If the story was told even partially from another character's point of view the plot would have been completely spoiled! As for Daisy Ridley's performance, I thought it was great! Please judge her honestly apart from Star Wars. It's pretty obvious that she receives biased criticism. As for the ending, I was incredibly moved by the cast's performances-especially Branagh's. He really showed a passion for justice the entire movie, and he realized what a grey area the crime committed lies in at the end. Perhaps this is why the color palette is particularly dull in the movie, to represent the grey areas of justice? Or perhaps I'm being pretentious and looking too much into the artistic decisions. Wouldn't be the first time! Overall, I loved this movie, and I'm shocked to see why so many people hate it. If it's only a preference, then fine, but I'm reading a lot of reviews that seem ignorant, arrogant, or biased from the start.

786,f-76078,Overall very well done rendition,8,24 January 2020,"In this new rendition of Agatha Christie's 1932 murder mystery, Murder On the Orient Express, director Kenneth Branagh stars as Hercule Poirot; the world rebound Belgian inspector. In this all-star movie we see actors such as Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench and Willem Defoe. However, many of them were given not much more than cameos as Branagh perfects his own part.
During a lavish trip on the Orient Express, famous inspector Hercule Poirot expects a relaxing journey instead has to race against time to find a murderer. As an avalanche blocks the Orient Express, Poirot uses this to his advantage to find the killer. Not only is everyone on the train a suspect, we soon come to learn that many of them have a strange connection to the Armstrong case and a motive of revenge for the fallen billionaire.
There have been many depictions of not only Agatha Christie's Murder On the Orient Express but also the famous inspector Hercule Poirot. Hercule Poirot is described as a very confident man, who is very attentive to details, as said ""I can only see the world as it should be. And when it is not, the imperfection stands out like the nose in the middle of a face. It makes most of life unbearable. But, it is useful in the detection of crime"". In this version, I feel that Kenneth Branagh played Poirot exquisitely, but a tad bit overdramatized at times. As for the rest of the all star cast, we see Josh Gad portraying Hector MacQueen, the private secretary to Ratchett, he shows more of a range that we normally don't get to see from him. As always Michelle Pfeiffer, was amusing and entertaining as she played the rich chatty husband finder Caroline Hubbard. Other actors such as Willem Defoe and Judi Dench, though perfected their roles as a German professor Gerhard Hardman and the Russian Princess Dragomiroff, were given not much more than underwritten cameos. I feel that the screen time could have been better divided betwixt actors.
The overall design of set, costumes and makeup almost perfectly match the time period and create the cozy but yet mysterious atmosphere. The wardrobe matches the time period as well as the characters themselves. The women wore long silhouettes that go just above the ankles, which were a new trend in the 1930s, as well as pantsuits and pinned up hair. Men wore suits which was proper in Europe, very few wore leisure wear as it was not the custom in this time period. For example, Inspector Poirot's attire matches his OCD personality, he wears a clean cut suit, everything is is place including his facial hair. The setting of the train quite accurately represents the furnishings of those in the 1930s, a very lavish a luxurious club car represents the feel that the Orient Express is trying to convey.
If you have ever read or seen Agatha Christie's Murder On the Orient Express you know the whole whodunit mystery.

Kenneth Branagh, one the most overrated actors of modern times, has been allowed to waste somebody's money on this travesty. Everybody is miscast...the lighting is awful, the sound muddled, the CGI unnecessary and basically rubbish. The train itself looks like a local theatre set ...15 foot wide coach interiors to facilitate movement...missing the point that the whole reason Christie set it on a train was to exploit the claustrophobic environment.Whatever else might be wrong with, it falls alone on Branagh's continued bizarre belief that he can do accents...which he can't...and that he can act...which he can't...and that he can direct...which he can't.",Murder on the Orient Express

I am aware that it is not possible, or even desirable, for movies to be a literal copy of novels. Both forms of art have different languages, rhythms, and goals. But what you can't do is twist the essence and nature of the characters in this way. Here, as in all Agata Christie novels starring Hercule Poirot, the only character is the genius Belgian detective. Everything else, the places, the characters and the plot are at the service of a ""character"" characterized not only by being a maniac of order, a defender of justice in black and white, but also, and mainly, by being a mind thinking, a set of small gray cells that act only as gray cells do: with the weapon of intelligence, on the basis of a vast knowledge of human nature. But it was not enough for the great Kenneth to portray the maniacal and intelligent detective. He had to make a transcript of him between Indiana Jones and MacGyver ... pathetic! As if all this were not enough, he dedicates himself to discovering throughout the film the links of each one of teh caracters with the ultimate motive for the murder and presenting them to us in comfortable little pieces, breaking in this way the climax of every mystery work in which the pieces only fit at the end, at the climax of the last minutes of the footage.

By far, Kenneth Branagh was the worst Hercule Poirot I have ever seen. He had nothing to do with the Agatha Christie's character, the way she described him in her books. That moustache was beyond ridiculous, to say the least. And how come the characters went outside in that terribly cold weather with hardly anything substantially warm on them (and nothing on their heads) and had long conversations like it was a nice summer day? I don't recall seeing any warm air coming out of their mouths either while talking. Add stiff and embarrassing acting to match, and some weird geographical errors, and you have one of the worst unnecessary remakes of all time, not to mention a huge ego trip for Kenneth Branagh. I wonder if he or anybody involved with the making of this movie are reading these comments. I would be ashamed to take people's money, pandemic times or not, for this garbage. And a final message to the cast: try not to rely on your fame (past or present) and do something of real quality before you claim and cash those huge paychecks.

As an avid fan of Agatha Christie's Poirot, I noticed that there were quite a few things things that were not quite right. First, foremost and most noticible was the appearance of Hercule Poirot. The moustache was all wrong and the real Poirot had no chin hair at all. Also, his manerisms were quite a bit off. The story line and some of the characters had been altered. The Kenneth Brannagh version of this movie was not a very good depiction of the original story. I doubt that I will ever watch this version again.

Going in knowing whodunnit is especially fun when there are people in the audience who audibly don't! I had a great time!Now, I'm sure people want to know how it compares to the 1974 Lumet film with Albert Finney. And the answer is... IT DOESN'T AND IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT YOU EVEN ASK!Honestly! That was a FILM! This – and it makes no attempt to hide the fact – is a MOVIE!!! It's a delicious, giant, Agatha Christie themed cake. It's the kind of movie that requires you to eat while you're watching it. So, if you see it and don't like it because ""boo hoo it doesn't compare to the original,"" it's you're own fault you didn't enjoy it.There are a goodly number of reasons not to enjoy this version on its own merits. But first, the good stuff!Kenneth Branagh, director. He keeps things moving at a good clip. It survives the true test of a period piece: I wanted to buy or wear everything in it. It's not easy to make a mystery where everyone over 40 knows the ending! He approaches it with style and aplomb!Kenneth Branagh, actor. His Poirot is surprisingly understated; shockingly so when you consider the heinous moustache (it's the kind of moustache that requires the spelling with the most letters). The anacondapillar on his face aside, there's wit, charm, subtlety and grace in his performance. It's not iconic Finney or Ustinov but it'll more than do. In fact, I found him quite moving.Josh Gad. I am not a fan. I don't find him funny or appealing at all. Except in this because he's fabulous! The character's pathetic slovenliness is actually endearing and the period look really works for him. It's terrific work.Leslie Odom Jr. I did not see him in Hamilton so this was my first experience. He's beyond appealing.The very best thing about this film: Michelle F-ing Pfeiffer! Between this and mother! I'm loving how much fun she's having. She OWNS this movie!Now the other stuff.A lot of heavy hitters have very little to do. Dame Judi, Derek Jacobi and Olivia Coleman are only here to give the cake some class. And they do! But...Some of the other characters are given extremely short shrift. The Count and Countess (played by Michael York and Jacqueline Bisset in the original) are played respectively by a non-actor and a relative unknown (Lucy Boynton, who was delightful in Sing Street but is no Jacqueline Bisset) and are barely in it. I'm still not sure how the one Latin guy was involved.While the movie deserves props for at least trying to make a period murder mystery with at least a few actors of color, it would have been nice if they all actually had stuff to do. But when even Dame Judi is just collecting a paycheck...The screenplay and some of the acting is a bit cartoony. Daisy Ridley is serviceable. Willem Dafoe is trapped in a character with no way out but DAMN if he doesn't commit to his Choices! Johnny Depp seems like he's in a different movie altogether.There are unnecessary action sequences and the screenplay's other attempts to get you to where you're inevitably going to end up feel forced: like someone at the studio said ""I think you need a car chase only without cars and on a stalled train."" When people actually start confessing, I was like ""don't DO that!""The reenactment of the murder is a bit too stylish for me and takes away some of the horror of what's happening, though it does capture some of the rage.All that said, I really did enjoy myself!

I rarely ever take the time to write a review, but I feel obligated to share my opinion and maybe save some people from wasting roughly two hours of their life. The plot unravels somewhat as you would expect, and the buildup to the climax is engaging like you would expect from a murder mystery... with the acting and scenery, it becomes convincing that the climax will blow you away. (Reason I gave two stars instead of one) But, it doesn't... at all. The plot becomes completely wasted on the outcome of everyone onboard being directly involved in the murder. The fun of guessing the murderer is completely ruined, and it leaves the viewer (me and many others, at least) frustrated that there is basically no point to any of it aside from a web of characters seeking revenge on the antagonist. It is instantaneously converted into a boring tale of morality that resembles a cheesy 80's family TV show. Considering the rapid decline of creativity in the entertainment industry and shift to more machine-like profiteering and pandering, I don't expect much anymore.

Although I had my own theories, I was kept guessing throughout and I was still surprised the twists and turns throughout the plot. The fantastic choice of language and the fantastic portrayal of Poirot by Kenneth Branagh really helped pull it together.The cinematography in this film is great. There are some well thought out angles used to portray an interesting perspective and some fantastic use of movement really emphasised the feeling of being on the train. The sets and costumes are also excellent which further emphasised the great use of environments, especially the train carriages themselves.Some of the casting choices felt a little unnecessary, and there were some characters which really didn't get the screen time they deserved to really understand their stories.Overall this was a great movie, and I can not speak for comparison to the original film.

At least watch a movie that takes place upon a train. Maybe read the book. Completely missing the claustrophobia of a train, this debacle attempts to be stylish according to a nerd and CGI. The story that so pointedly got across the idea of an enclosed area with so many people as suspects that allows no one to breathe, has completely been missed here. People don't bump into each other. Nobody has to stand aside to let someone past. Instead the train scenes are envisioned by someone who thinks a truck could be driven through a train and nobody would even have to step aside as long as it looks cool on CGI.This was a movie that could have been shot exactly as Twelve Angry Men in a single room. Probably should have.

Only a film for those new to the story.,1,24 March 2018,"Beginning scene with the wall was pointless. then begins to look promising with an uplifting feel, however this was short lived. Was not impressed with the performance of Kenneth Branagh as Poirot I understand he might of decided to make the character his own & show a different kind of Poirot but it did not work for me. There just wasn't any chemistry, Even though I know the story and always enjoy watching the 70's version & the TV adaptation, but with this I was bored, I found myself checking how long was left as I just wanted it to be over. It looks fantastic, they already had the story & had a great cast (unfortunately with the exception of Branagh casting himself) 
so how could it possibly fail but it really does! 
I only watched it to the end because I felt I needed to see it through in the vain hope it got better & because I enjoyed some of the other performances but as a whole it was utterly disappointing. I am glad I did not buy the dvd as I won't be watching it again. If you've never seen the originals and are new to the story you might love it.

I have them all in my library of classics. When the BBC produced the Hercule Poirot series I got addicted. The productions are movie length, made for television and David Suchet as Poirot is masterful. Suchet's version of Poirot in Orient Express should be considered definitive. The script is true to the book and deals with the story conflicts in a powerful way. Now for this most recent attempt... The cast is great but I need to agree with comments of other reviewers.

When filmed from outside, the train is tilted about 20 degrees, but inside the train everything is level... this is some Hogwarths stuff.. The scenery where the murder takes place looks like Alps.. in reality it is a plain. OK, I understand this will not matter much to anyone who is either from Croatia or who is not a geography aficionado, but in case any of you were inspired by the scenery and wanted to book a ski holiday there - don't. It is always risky doing a remake of a great movie, and this one is a flop through and through. The first 30 minutes was unbearable.. I thought it would turn into an action movie with the fast camera, bar fight kung fu sh*t, and overly dramatised characters... (I bet Agatha Cristie is rolling in her grave like a revolving door).",Murder on the Orient Express

837,ptp-664-500883,Opt for the Sidney Lumet version instead,5,26 November 2017,"The 1974 version holds up well even by today's production standards, but the story is far closer to Agatha Christie's original novel and the performances are far better, in part due to far superior screen writing. The set design and costuming of the original are also an improvement to the current version. The exterior cinematography of the 2017 film is the only improvement to the 1974 version, but as the film is filmed mostly in the interior of the train, that is not terribly significant. You can view the original on a number of streaming services in HD for $3.99, so if you have a decent home theater set-up you'd be well advised to go that route and save some money for a more worthwhile production.",Murder on the Orient Express

I found this version much more compelling than Sidney Lumet's 1974 picture. I also appreciated Kenneth Branagh's more thoughtful interpretation of Hercule Poirot in contrast to Albert Finney's over the top histrionics in the earlier version. There are some dramatic scenes which are a departure from the earlier version, but they help develop certain of the characters and the overall story remains intact and suspenseful. Highly recommended.",Murder on the Orient Express
840,djpukeliss,The review,6,24 November 2017,"Ahhh the movie... To be honest I expected something more from it. Me and my friend decided to go see this movie because Jhonny Depp was starring in it. I liked it how in this picture Jhonny Depp was not playing ,,himself,,. Everyone knows him as the fun, charismatic and a charming actor.But here he was different in every way possible. I guess this movie was a new experience for him which he handled pretty well. Enough about Jhonny Depp let's talk more about the movie. The movie is set around the 50's, a lot of Stalin references. The main character is Hercule Poirot who thinks that he is the most clever man on earth. The directors tried to make him charming and a bit egoistic but it in my opinion they failed because the character became to good to be true. So Poirot ends up stuck in a train with a murder on his hands. Man was I disappointed how the ,,mystery'' was solved. It was so hard to keep up with his motives, you have to hear every single word that he says or you will end up sitting there and not understanding anything. The thing I liked about the movie is Hercule Poirot's mustache, I don't care if its fake or real it looked damn great to me. Also the landscapes really caught my eye as they were pleasing as hell to me All in all I would definitely not recommend this movie to my friends.",Murder on the Orient Express

The movie is incredibly (sub)standard in presentation. Eg showing train wheels moving with lots of noise all the time. And what is the purpose of showing the train blowing out steam and honking frequently throughout the movie. Should this impress the viewer? Or cover the lack of content of the movie?None of the characters sparks any interest. And in all honesty the story and the plot are also of no interest whatsoever.

Really I give a positive review to this movie because I enjoy a surprise plot ending. In summary, apparently only people unfamiliar with the story could enjoy this movie.

Together they quickly showed the audience the very essence of this prolific character in Christie's works. Much like when I see Austen redone, I feel I know the main characters intimately, and the margin for error by the actor is small, but this portrayal was just right. Thank you Kenneth Branagh. The movie is striking in its look, and the star studded cast does not disappoint. I only felt it was overdone a bit at the end while Poirot solves the mystery. Otherwise it felt genuine to Christie's intent, was very engaging, and made me hope they do Murder on the Nile next. Amazing story, amazingly done.

Yes, maybe Walz could be a better choice for Poirot, but Branagh did a fine job. Everything is shot beautifully, the costumes are just marvelous, and the cast is mostly A class which you just can feel through the entire film. In conclusion, I liked it!

Branagh is unable to film anything that is not from his own culture and it also has to take place in his own country, and here he has an international cast and action in a foreign country - that apparently brings some serious problems problems. A cast full of stars with Christie´s story should bring crowds to the cinema and what does bring instead is pure disappointment. Add a ridiculous, very distracting mustache on the main character (what is the point of doing that? such a stupid decision), some unnecessary scenes, pointless conversations here and there making this kind of boring - Poirot starts an interview in German but he turns to English after 2 sentences, it makes no sense, but it is kind of what happens with the entire movie, the first part seems to take one direction then it turns into another.

863,dragonwarrior-94899,A fresh air of mystery,8,18 November 2017,"Yes, I admit it. It was not what I expected. But, still, the movie was far from a disappointment.Starting from the plot, anyone can point out how slow paced it is. But let's not forget that it is based on a mystery novel and books are nothing but slow until it reaches the action. I have not read any book from Agatha Christie neither I have seen any old TV stories/movies based on Christie's works, but I can say that it was a full story with a start,middle and an end. No any unanswered questions (ok,maybe this one,how the heck did they walked around in the snowy place with these light outfits?), not any crazy plot twists. The ending was somewhat predictable from me. I really liked the small actions scenes, especially the use of the walking cane.The cinematography, the colours, the setting, the outfits... Each one is unique on it's own way.Regarding the music, there are some nice pieces there. Not something fancy with a variety of chords and basses, just something simple to fit the era and feel the mystery.Talking about the cast, the acting is not something ""special"" but some faces are really fitting to the luxury of the train. Some had more screen time than others but none of them had enough to cover in their shade the protagonist. Although, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo got lost somewhere in the background.Last but not the least, the one only Hercule Poirot. Kenneth Branagh shined in the role especially in the final confrontation with the murderer. The character is not like the ""modern"" detectives like Downey's Sherlock or Cumberbatch's high-functioning sociopath. He created a humane character,calm and imposing who follows the old fashioned crime-solving by interrogating and counting on clues and rather than making crazy deductions. I had no problem with the enormous double mustache. It gave to Poirot a kind of charm.In conclusion, a classic story with an amazing lead and a rather impressive cinematography created an underrated movie. It definitely deserves a sequel and I would love seeing Branagh reprising again the role of Hercule Poirot. The movie industry needs more classic stories with this kind of direction, more trains, mustaches and more walking canes in action :P. And, please, don't read these negative reviews.

Maybe it is the curse of reading the book right before watching the movie, but Murder on the Orient Express was a train wreck from start to finish (pun intended). Now i don't mind if the movie changes some of the details of the books in order to make the movie more glorifying and entertaining. But Kenneth Branagh, who has surely justified some classic stories in the past, takes the soul out of this one. I particularly could not stand the personality difference of the main character 
Hercule Poirot who doesn't even seem to be the same legendary character from the Hercule Poirot classic book series.Now credit should be given where it is due. The sets are quite impressive, the scenery is astonishing and the continuity has done a justifiable job to give the feel of the older period.But other than than it is extremely difficult to connect with the movie.

It is worth mentioning that I was thinking the friend of Hercule Poirot is the murder who has the ability to summon all the victim in the same train and familiar Hercule Poirot's inferential model which can mislead him easily. That makes me malicious surmise the only innocent people except Hercule Poirot. But the movie itself seem a little chaos for the too long prologue and too short supporting characterizations depiction which makes me too tired to remember almost 60% characterizations in a few minutes. At last, there are a few redundant plot in this movie. For instance, why those murder want to put the bloody clothe in Hercule Poirot 's case?

-Well done visually. Great color palette, sets, costumes, and especially the cinematography
-Impressive cast, and all of the actors who received a decent amount of screen time gave good performances
-Some very good scenes sprinkled throughout. The scene between Branagh and Depp was the only truly great scene in the movie.The Bad:
-Underused actors. Many great actors are given barely any screen time. Judi Dench in particular only has a couple of minutes. Hardly what an actress of her caliber should receive.
-Awful CG shots of the train. The movie legitimately looks like The Polar Express at points.
-Drawn out first act, including a very unnecessary and poorly done opening.The Ugly:
-The dialogue/script. The dialogue has occasional moments of greatness, especially in the second and third act, but most of it is unbearably bad. All of the characters just give a giant monologue explaining themselves completely out of nowhere. The movie even had the perfect opportunity to put this exposition into Poirot's interviews with each character, but instead characters just launch into monologue. Bouc in particular is very grating and poorly written. 
-The mystery. In the book, Poirot's detective skills, whilst extraordinary, still felt grounded and realistic. In this, it feels almost supernatural. Clues and leads from the book are cast aside and Poirot pulls all of his revelations from thin air. Very lazy writing.
-The pacing. First act is too long, second act is too short, third act is too long. The film takes it sweet ass time to get going, but leaves out all of the setup from the book, making it feel less like setup and more like 40 minutes of nothing. Less material took more time than more material should have. The investigation, which should be tense and slow burning, is rushed through and feels empty. Rather than letting the audience figure everything out alongside Poirot, the film makes the audience watch him interview everyone and then explain everything. Very boring. Ending was simply drawn out, unsatisfying, and too long.
-The twist. Didn't make sense in the book, makes even less sense here.
-Filler. The film, without filler, is barely feature length, when if done properly it should be well over two hours.TLDR- Boring and poorly paced, despite interesting visuals. Very disappointing. 3/10",Murder on the Orient Express

Brannagh in contrast offers us the Belgian detective in a much more measured way with a smooth combination of deduction, wit and measured anger when required. The cast of this version are largely excellent too and do not let the film down, and Johnny Depp exudes understated menace. Visually the movie is stunning and the way it is filmed is varied and original giving you the impression at times that you are eavesdropping and observing private conversations.

Don't listen to butt-hurt old schools!,10,12 March 2018,"One man show - Kenneth Branagh!I agree only on this one point with a lot of Hard-core fans of the 1974 version, this one is purely a Kenneth show. But as a lot of other people are whining and comparing both the movies - This stands far better in Art direction and the hidden humor all along. You are truly Entertained in this new version unlike the 1974 version which is more of a sedative and just background music with the camera showing inanimate things. Loved this one, keeps you engaged, a good mystery if you don't know the story already and you finish with a happy state of mind - what else do you expect from a movie?",Murder on the Orient Express

Quite a stunner.,9,3 November 2017,"I haven't seen the 1974 version so this movie easily stands out in all aspects to me, whether it was the camera view or the cast ensemble. While reviewing, people often forget the issue with the original story i.e. it's set entirely in the train. Considering the limited space that they had, Branagh does an amazing job with the direction. This isn't just a remake but in fact an entirely different adaptation. Not that it runs away from the main story but it has a sort of different take on it. Apart from that, Branagh easily manages to portray Poirot with all his eccentricity. (The accent was the pull factor for me). Josh Gad does an amazing job with Hector McQueen. Judi Dench shines as Princess Dragomiroff along with Pfeiffer as Mrs. Hubbard. The only bummer was the fact that it leaves you wanting for more.",Murder on the Orient Express

Poirot's French accent is difficult to understand and lots of his dialogue is missed. Prolonged overhead camera work at times on the train, although understandable is very unsatisfying as you can't feel the atmosphere in the room by seeing peoples facial expressions or mouths moving.

It is no different from the book (with the killer being all) they make it sound like they are going to change this and suggests otherwise of it being a single killer. The dialogue is just laughable. It is incredibly cheesy and half of the scenes are just pointless, these scenes include the start with the predictable chief inspector being the thief and the stick which trips him up. Also the references to skin color were completely unnecessary and had no real part to play in the story. I am also incredibly surprised that Dame Judie Dench was not given more screen time.

His portrayal is significantly flawed and unfortunately over the top, even to the point where there is an attempt to replicate a certain scene from the original 1974 version with regard to keeping his moustache well kept whilst sleeping. This constitutes the 4th rehash of the original and personally the worse. Performances from the remainder of the cast appear to be ""dumbed down"" and inadequate as Kenneth Branagh steals the limelight.

I didn't feel any mystery nor excitement. When I basically compare it to the TV series (an adaptation of Agatha Christie's stories) which are made by BBC for the New Year & Christmas every year, I must say they are far more better and elaborated than the movie itself. I think the scenario of that one kept as simple and superficial as possible with the confidence of working with well-known actors. The producers and the director thought the actors would attract the people and they didn't pay attention to the story which is necessary and it's resulted in a movie which is tasteless and prosaic.",Murder on the Orient Express

I went in with mixed feelings and the fear that this would be a typical horrible Hollywood remake, well it wasn't. Especially with a star cast like this it would have been easy to just let the writing and directing slide by so my fear was not that irrational. Branagh absolutely shone in his role as Poirot just like the rest of the cast did in their roles. Sure they added to the background stories of the characters but why shouldn't they? And are people seriously complaining that they added a black doctor? Seriously people. I was afraid they would americanize it but they didn't. This movie is not worse than the original. It is not without the Christie Charme. This is the best movie I've seen this year. I enjoyed it immensely and will absolutely watch it again.",Murder on the Orient Express

895,warreneckstein,A train wreck ruining a 1974 Classic,2,10 November 2017,"If you have never seen the 1974 original..you may want to see this, may that is. If you HAVE seen the 1974 original, which I refer to as a CLASSIC, stay as far away as you can from any theater showing this waste of time. The original version, directed by the awesome Sidney Lumet and starring the brilliant Albert Finney (an Oscar nominee) as Poirot, was a masterful piece with great writing, directing and a cast that couldn't be beat!! And this new version, Directed by ego-magic Branagh, and starring a so-so cast, with some stellar actors, all being decimated by this production is downright tragic. From the opening piece, set in Istanbul which has nothing to do with anything, with regard to the plot, till it's exceptionally tedious laughable end, taking place in a tunnel in a snow covered mountain, you just won't believe your eyes.The 74 original showed the opening part of the mystery story, which foretold all, but here that investment comes way in the middle of the things, where it has no place, and after so much disinterest has already occurred. Branagh hams it up, takes all the scenes, gives no space for anyone else to breathe, let along give any type of performance, then appears to be almost clairvoyant, as he seems to figure everything out through thin air. Basically because he never has any legitimate conversation with any of the major characters to determine what happened and why. Oh yes, he's the mystic seer. Maybe stolen from a 1960 Twilight Zone episode. No, more he is ego-centric and arrogant Branagh who can't stand being out of the limelight. You're in the limelight now, Kenny....you screwed up a major production and were all laughing at you, not with you. Arrogance reigns The use of totally unnecessary CGI is annoying and silly, the action scenes are dull, tedious, pointless, adding nothing to the plot. The plot, for what it is is convoluted. Never really explained. In the original we were given clues, had ideas, questions, we could follow along. Not here. It's as if they made this thinking EVERYONE knows all the answers, and so they skip numerous (and I mean numerous) plot points..but again, the mystic seer, with the most stupid looking and idiotic mustache in history, knows all. Watching this flick, you'll wish Poirot got knifed, instead of Mr Ratchett. Plot devices that all fail, where do I start, the opening wasted scene, Poirot measuring the size of his hard boiled eggs.(oh, please) A avalanche comes down and stops the train, but oh yes, only derailed the front engine, not the rest of the train, which it certainly would have done. People firing guns at each other, but why? Racial issues being brought up about skin colors and nationalities. And this is entertainment? What were these people thinking? To my knowledge Branagh is a Shakespeare lover, let me quote this..""How much did revile this film,let me count the ways"". I could go on, but I shall not. The 1974 version ran 127 minutes, this one runs 114 minutes and feel terminally longer. I squirmed and squirmed waiting for it to end. The music score, non-existent. Star turns, none to be found, excitement in the plot, 0. That about sums it up.I simply say this, with $$$ as tight as they are, we should only be subjected ourselves to worthy films, especially when they are overblown remarks. The 1974 original is avail on DVD and in the UK and foreign markets even in a nice blu-ray version. My suggestion, spend your money on that and do not support this type of overblown ego-driven dribble.Bye, bye Branagh, you made no friends with this tripe. You do not work much and it's understandable to see why. I read a UK review earlier that bashed this flick out of the World...good for them, they know junk when they see it. And now, so do I.For me, I'll stick with the original anyway. As a matter of fact, I'll go and watch it now and wash this toilet water taste from my mouth, and this film from my memory",Murder on the Orient Express

A good dinner can be easily found. A great movie is a bit harder to predict. Murder on the Orient Express is one of those movies in which you can be entertained, saddened, surprised, and unable to avoid discussion afterwards through many conversations.Kenneth Branagh and the accompanying eclectic troop have accomplished something extraordinarily difficult. For 2+ hours, I was not watching actors and sets, I was experiencing characters and locations. It felt like I was on the train. It felt a bit claustrophobic. It felt dangerous. It felt like there were so many lies it was hard to know which piece of evidence or statement was a fact. And it felt fun!I saw the first incarnation of this movie about 10 years after its initial release when I was 15. I then read the book. It made both better as I could ""see"" the story that much clearer. Watching this retelling has again spurred my interest into a genre which clearly needs even more additions.One can only hope that Death on the Nile is around the corner.Suggestion: make it a date night, see the early viewing, and then go somewhere with background music and have a wonderful chat with someone whose company you deeply enjoy.

899,tmm-56190,A Lame Attempt,4,12 November 2017,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSI was quite disappointed with this movie. Granted I'm a huge Christie fan and I believe David Suchet's version of Poirot is the most faithful interpretation of Christie's sleuth. If you are a hard core Christie or Poirot fan, this movie may be more annoying than interesting. IMHO, I'd watch either the Albert Finney or David Suchet's versions before spending time and money on this. Didn't Like: - Branaugh did not bother with having an egg head, which is one of the most distinctive physical characteristics about Poirot.the moustache is totally distracting and it was all I could do to listen to the dialogue instead of watching the moustache in fascination. It deserves its own film credit for Pete's sake. And in keeping with Poirots character, while enormously proud of his moustache, Poirot would never allow it to become messy like it was in several of the scenes. It would be waxed to perfection.Poirot stepping into the manure pile twice. So ridiculous! He would never ruin his shoes in this manner. While his murmured comment about balance rings true, he would immediately stop and clean the one shoe before continuing. Poirot isn't just focused on balance but cleanliness and tidy are imperative. He'd never be able to stand dirty, smelly shoes plus the fact that the leather would be ruined, would render him incapable of moving on until it's cleaned up. the scene towards the end where all the characters were seated at the long table, looking like The Last Supper seemed an indulgence and overly dramatic on Branaughs part. - so many flat performances by such skilled actors. Compared to older MOTOE films, the performances were disappointing. I was excited to see all these great actors in one film but sadly they didn't get to shine. the introduction of the characters was tedious and for those not familiar with the story, probably confusing.Poirot holding interviews outdoors without being muffled up in coat, scarf, earmuffs, gloves and seemingly unbothered by the cold. Poirot famously hates to be outside in cold weather, far preferring the comfortable indoors with a tisane at his side, so this was so silly that I found it distracting. further to that, Poirot sitting at the very edge of an open baggage car with the wind blowing cold air over them, for a chat with Daisy Ridleys character seemed very out of character. While perhaps an interesting camera angle, it was not his style. Branaugh expects us to believe that a handful of men with rudimentary tools were going to force the two engines back onto the track. Sigh, it's just so unrealistic. Liked: the scenery was gorgeous, whether CGI or real, it was spectacular and there were several interesting camera anglesI like the Easter egg about Death on the Nile (although I fervently hope Branaugh doesn't attempt a re-do of that story).while I hated the moustache, I did enjoy the moustache cover Poirot wore to bed. That is definitely a Poirot type of thing to do. the scene at the beginning with his cane in the wall, Poirot loves to be showman so that seemed in character. I liked the set, the ambiance and decadence of the trainwe finally saw some skillful acting at the very end when all the characters were together for the climatic resolution.I liked how Branagh did Poirots comments about justice at the end of the movie.",Murder on the Orient Express
900,dtheories-72535,The Dining Car,8,12 November 2017,"Branaugh's performance as Poirot closely followed Mrs. Christie's depiction of the Belgian sleuth.

903,isaacreynolds-51776,Murder on the 'Mediocre' Express,6,13 November 2017,"Movie Review: Murder on the Orient Express (2017)Director: Kenneth Branagh Studio: 20th Century Fox Genre: Crime, Drama, Mystery Release: 2017 Run Time: 1 Hour 54 Minutes IMDb Rating: 6.8/10 Metacritic Score: 53/100 Rotten Tomatoe %: 58First Impressions – This film is the fourth adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel, following the 1974 film, a 2001 made for TV movie and a 2010 episode of Agatha Christie's Poirot. I had a budget of $55 Million and features and all star cast.The Plot – The movie opens with the establishment of our detective who must solve the case of an artifact thief in Jerusalem. Soon after he is granted passage to his next destination on the famous Orient Express. However, during a troubling weather event, the train is stopped and a murder takes place. It is up to the detective to find out who is responsibly for the murder, and everyone is a suspect. The main problem with this movie is the problem that most movies that are adapted from novels or other literature have; it is severely missing details. Details that without we cannot become invested in various elements of the mystery and the entire film for that matter. The movie is well focused once the murder is discovered but without some important information that we as viewers are denied, it becomes difficult to understand at parts and throughout I couldn't help but question why I should care about certain things.Characters and Acting – While directing, Kenneth Branagh also stars as the main character; Hercule Poirot, a Belgian man who describes himself as ""Possibly the greatest detective in the world"". Branagh does a fine job playing the character and giving him a great identity but unfortunately that's where the interesting and stand out characters stop I'm afraid. It's almost a shame and a waste that this movie is jam packed full of talented and A-List actors but none of them shine whatsoever in their roles. They lack to convey anything interesting in the slightest, they have very little screen time between them and spend most of the movie staring outside of a train window. It's impossible to talk about the actors roles without spoilers but the A-List includes: Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley and Willem Dafoenot one of these actors give a necessarily bad performance but are incredibly under utilized to say the least. A big problem at the beginning of the movie and few times throughout was some of the line delivery was a tiny bit corny and silly, that being said the lines they were delivering didn't fit the context of a movie or a scene and it just felt as if they were reading some lines straight from the novel with little to no direction or context. It was incredibly distracting but only happened a few times with one or two B list actors.Film Techniques – This movie has some creative camera work and interesting shots that utilize the setting of a train well but can at times be distracting. For example, when one shot involves weaving through the windows outside a train whilst two characters are talking it comes difficult to focus on what is going o when you only see them for mini-seconds at a time while the rest of what you see fro that scene is just the metal of a train. The music is fine and the small amount of action is gripping enough; the movie uses a surprising amount of CG for it's set pieces and back grounds, it ranges from not half bad to clearly fake.Tones and Themes – The tone of the film is consistent and it shifts well from the serious mystery to a few light moments of humour here and there. The theme of the movie is justice, but it gets more complicated than that when some things unfold. Conclusion – This movie did it's job in keeping me intrigued throughout with it's mystery and entertained me enough to feel like satisfied with the performance of the main character but with it's lack luster usage of it's great cast and lack of overall detail, it didn't deliver on a memorable or intense enough murder mystery. Would I Recommend? YesWould I Watch Again? NoMy Score – 6.6/10",Murder on the Orient Express
904,bradleymj,"Atmospheric, Superbly Acted, and Highly Emotional",10,19 November 2017,"This is Poirot as I have never seen him before. The whole film feels fresh and helps introduce new generations to a classic tale of Christie twists.The winter atmosphere makes one wish to cuddle up by a fireplace and sip hot tea. All the shots either give a sense of the isolated cold winter outside or the tense claustrophobia inside the train cabin.Each of the actors give quite good performances. For Branagh, David Suchet's Poirot is a hard act to follow not to mention an Oscar-nominated turn by Albert Finney. However, he makes the Belgian detective charming, witty, likable, and portrays all the brilliance the character has to offer. Some of the other stand outs include an amazingly dramatic Josh Gad, Michelle Pfeiffer is sexy and suspicious, Johnny Depp oozes all the vile traits for a putrescent man, and Daisy Ridley plays a strong-willed and delightful character perfectly.This version goes in a not before seen direction by adding heart and emotion into not only the suspects, but even the detective himself. This is rarely seen in other incarnations, but Branagh gives chills of emotions while others leave you in tears by the charged ending.This is a wonderful blend of classical and modern film that Branagh has gotten so good at over the years with his Shakespeare adaptations.

And I liked what I got. The acting in my opinion is very nice, especially with Josh Gad. The mystery is also good. Even when I figured it out, I found myself enjoying to see the characters trying to solve it. One of my favourite things in the movie was the music. It creates a wonderful mood and really stands out. I actually stayed alone in the cinema through the credits, because of the music. Although the song by Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't that good.After seeing the film, I read the original book to compare them, and to be honest this movie is a pretty good adaptation. There were some differences, like in the book Colonel Arbuthnot and Dr. Constantine are different characters, but in the movie Arbuthnot is also a doctor, so we don't have Constantine at all. There is also some added action in the film. 
These little changes did not bother me, but one downside of the film would perhaps be Poirot himself. He is a much nicer and warmer character in the book. The acting is still good. His personality is just a little off.

No, I couldn't sit through this film as it was plain irritating. Worst of all was the interpretation of Hercule Poirot with a ridiculous mustache, accent and countenance. And he was too tall, and did not resemble Christie's physical or personality description.
For a viewer unfamiliar with Agatha Christie books or David Suchet's masterful and definitive Poirot, it might be a watchable movie. But as I have been a Christie fan for 50 years, have read all her books more than once, and own all the wonderful TV series DVDs starring Suchet, this movie was a waste of time.

920,writeminded-71537,Who Cares Whodunnit?,4,2 February 2018,"A murder has been committed on the renowned Simplon-Orient Express.Hercule Poirot, arguably literature's most famous fictional detectives is - coincidentally - on that train.Those of us who chain-read Agatha Christie's mysteries during her resurgence in the 1970s can recall how the parsed and slow confessions of murder suspects could be thrilling in the trusted hands of a great storyteller/detective team.This new re-imagining of Murder on the Orient Express, by director-star, Kenneth Branagh, takes Christie's 1934 page-turner and transforms it into a self-conscious melange of hypotheticals that confuse rather than titillate its audience.For nearly two hours we sit, hopeful, through a litany of plot-thickening star-turns from the likes of Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfieffer, Judy Dench and Willem Dafoe.Poirot, undaunted and ever-observant, unravels the spewed clues in good time, briefly considering their merits until his keenly recalled, pre-murder encounters with each suspect leads him to his own formulary of conclusions.Inside and around the Sturm and Drang exposition of plot is the unremitting scrutiny of Poirot's interior life and an abundance of uncomfortably tight close-ups of the character's overly manicured mustache. This psychological and physical investigation of the detective does little to advance the build-up of anticipation required for the finale of any self-respecting whodunit.Audience attention is further undermined by a large dose of digitized, gauzy photography which steals the story's thunder out from under itself, as if the Alps - the film's location - needed visual enhancement.Instead of amplifying the fear and loathing small places can engender, the train's interior, lovingly detailed down to the luxurious thread-count on its upholstered dining chairs, is invisibly pried open at the top to allow cinematographer, Haris Zambarloukis, a series of overhead shots that add nothing but needless cinematic hocus-pocus.The film's final scene - a bizarre mug shot of the cast, reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper - is a pummeling rehash of the story's twists and turns by the exhausted, Poirot, who throughout the film claims he's in dire need of a vacation from the rigorous mind puzzles that would confound a lesser detective.By the end of his diatribe we care little about the characters and think even less of their predicaments.In the end there's only Poirot.We can see how Agatha Christie, herself, during an interview in the 1960's, began to talk of Poirot - her own invention - as a ""detestable, bombastic, tiresome, ego-centric little creep.""Poirot's popularity did not wane, so Christie - deemed the best-selling author of all time - waited to kill off this central character of 33 best-selling books until her 1975 novel, Curtains.Upon his literary death The New York Times ran the only obituary ever published within its pages of a fictional character.",Murder on the Orient Express
921,pikegarver,Best Version,9,30 April 2019,"This movie seems to get piled on by both critics and users. There's always the comparison to the revered 1974 ""classic"" by Sidney Lumet. I enjoyed this movie so much, I rented the original with Albert Finney as Poirot. I found it unwatchable. Finney's portrayal was cartoonish and way over the top. It reminded me of Charlie Chaplain talkie and nobody likes that.
I first saw some of this movie in a public setting and was immediately drawn in. After not being able to find an affordable rental,I purchased it from Directv. After rewatching it yesterday it still delivers. All the actors that get dumped on are brilliant. Johnny Depp is very convincing and Kenneth Branagh is brilliant. I also thought Penelope Cruz' performance is vastly underrated. Those elements, combined with the sweeping 65 mm cinematography give this picture an old time Hollywood feel with a few nods to modern day political ""niceness"". I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",Murder on the Orient Express

The film also stars Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Johny Depp, Daisy Ridley and others. This film is a good detective story which centres on a famous investigator who is traveling with a group of people and takes place on The Oriental Express. This film opens in Jerusalem. By the evening Poirot travels to Istanbul and after that he gets on The Oriental Express. The film reaches a turning point when a murder occurs and as the story progresses everyone helps Poirot find the killer. During the film Poirot finds interesting facts about the passengers of The Oriental Express. The film has an interesting twist though.The film has its faults like it was so boring in the middle. But the best thing was at the end when they get closer to discovering who the killer is. Also it was filmed well and has great special effects.I would recommend watching this film. If you have read the book you can compare it with the film. And if you haven't read the book it will be a great experience to read the book after you watch it.",Murder on the Orient Express

EXPLANATIONS.",9,8 February 2018,"This film directed and produces by Kenneth Branagh (who is also the actor of Hercule Poirot, the film's main actor) and was released in november 2017. In this movie, a lot of famous actors are playing, like Johnny Depp (Samuel Ratchett) or Daisy Ridley (Mary Hermione Debenham). This adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel is faithful to the novel, even if a bit of violence brought from Holywood's blockbusters is present.

From the beginning, the film plunges you in an atmosphere, serious and comic at the same time, that we are used to seeing in Agatha Christie's books and more particularly with Hercule Poirot. The only bad thing, in my opinion, are the clues corresponding to the characters which confuse us because they are too many.Definitely a film you must see if you have not seen it yet, especially if you like detective stories.",Murder on the Orient Express

Especially thanks to the casting that I find very relevant. I like most of the actors in this movie. Whoever plays Hercules Poirot matches Agatha Christie's character. The plot was interesting overall. It's some kind of psycho-family drama. There are a few twists and turns during the film but I found the ending a little flat.
In the end it's a good entertainment film but it doesn't match the book.",Murder on the Orient Express

932,madcattrindade,A decent watch,5,11 February 2018,"Murder on the Orient Express is your perfect average go to movie. It's not fantastic by any means, it's not horrible. Depending on the person you might finish this movie with a good vibe and a bad one, why?First of all this movie is beautiful, cinematography wise that is. From beginning to end this movie just gives a very fresh and clean look and while this might not be the most important point to people I just like to point it out because I love cinematography and this movie nailed it.Characters wise is okay, it's nothing out of the ordinary. The main focus on this movie is the detective Hercule played by Kenneth Branagh and his great character work and the way he deals with this murder case. Hercule is a decent enough character that should have been much more but works fine. Every other character I found to be either boring or irrelevant. May that be lazy poor acting such as Johnny Depp or Daisy Ridley or just boring characters who really offer nothing more than just a filler in this movie (literally everyone else).Story wise it's fine, the twist is amazing and it was by far the best part of it. The reveal and the build up to it grabbed me in a way that the movie didn't in any other scene and it was a vital point on why i'm not downgrading my opinion on it.Overall Murder on the Orient Express is a decent movie, nothing out of the ordinary. You should just stick with the classic.",Murder on the Orient Express
933,everlyerin,Has Kenneth Branagh ran out of ideas?,1,13 February 2018,"Seen this joke of a movie, I will not call it a ""Murder on the Orient Express"" remake. It does not deserve to be labeled as such. For all of those who are true Agatha Christie avid readers, fans of the beloved Hercule Poirot, it is quite clear how forced, disappointing and failed Kenneth Branagh is in his poor interpretation of this great character, even mixing a little bit of ""Mr. Monk"" in his desperate attempt at one of the most complex and mysterious Agatha Christie characters, Hercule Poirot. And why, Mon Dieu, why that hideous, absurd, horrendous mustachio?! I can't call it a ""moustache""... I'm sure it was supposed to exhibit the character's eccentricity, but for me, it kind of turned into poor taste, and Hercule Poirot could not ever show poor taste or present such a ridiculous facial asset. It would be the death of Poirot. 
In my opinion, the most memorable and the most accomplished ""Hercule Poirot"" will forever be David Suchet. This man, was, is and will be Hercule Poirot, he walked like Hercule Poirot, he used his ""little grey cells"" like Hercule Poirot should, his moustache was truly the Hercule Poirot Moustache, all of his mannerisms and little quirks were beautifully alive is David Suchet's master interpretation. Anything else will not even come close, so why would a director or actor try to top that? Has Hollywood become so devoid of original film ideas, or great scenarios?

I had no intention of paying to watch this version, but is was free on a recent flight. The first 30 minutes were a total snooze, I was waiting and waiting for the story to get going. For all the time they took setting up the characters I didn't feel like I knew them at all. The rest of the movie was just mundane, the ending just didn't get there. I would highly suggest the 1974 version, which moves from start to finish, has incredible casting and does a much better job of explaining the story.",Murder on the Orient Express

For me this is a really great movie.",Murder on the Orient Express
938,montesjerome-55635,Not like other Christie films--- but that can also be a good thing,9,21 March 2018,"I watched this movie with hesitation, having already read some lukewarm reviews. But I am a huge Agatha Christie fan. I have many of the novels, have numerous film DVDs-- including the 1974 Orient Express-- and I couldn't stay away. I'm very glad I took a chance on it, and I now have a copy of Brannagh's version.It is very different from other Agatha Christie films. It's the least faithful adaptation of the Orient Express novel, but for me it's also the most emotionally affecting. This is to take nothing away from the 1974 version, or David Suchet's excellent version as well. But this film delves into the devastating consequences of loss and grief the way few other Christie adaptations do. It shines a light on how death and murder can leave someone twisted, broken, changed forever. It's a theme carried masterfully throughout the movie that pays off in the inevitable denouement in ways you won't see in other Christie films. The climax had me tearing up slightly, because of the magnificent performances, but also because of the perspectives the film takes.Brannagh's Poirot has more growing to do than in many other films as he anguishes not only with the complex whodunit but with an assault on his world view and sense of justice. Again, a very clear choice on the part of the filmmakers and writers and one I'm glad they focused on.This version may not be for everyone. It speaks to me, and it could be that this is because I watched the 1974 version as a young person with no attachments, and I watched this version as a parent. If you are fine with some changes from the novel and are open to new perspectives on a classic whodunit, see this version and soak it in.",Murder on the Orient Express

The liberties taken in adapting the novella in the Lumet production actually (dare I say it?) improve the story, while the relentless, significant, and almost entirely pointless alterations made here improve...not one thing. An amazing cast of actors with the proven ability to give wonderful individual performances, and beautiful set, scenery and photography, are wasted.

This is a disaster.Kenneth Branagh is a director who has never quite bridged the gap between stage and screen. His movies are awkwardly theatrical and never feel comfortable. He's a stage thespian who tries to mimic the same style on screen and it never really works. His Poirot cannot hold a candle to Finney's.The plot is almost the same with a few cosmetic changes. The support cast are either miscast or too wooden in their performances. Compare the performances of the normally good Judie Densch vs 1974's Wendy Hiller in playing Princess Dragomiroff to see what I mean.If comparisons are seen to be unfair between the 2017 and 1974 versions, let me add that even as a standalone movie this falls short for the same reasons. And cannot Hollywood make a period piece without CGI nowadays?A filmmaking failure this. Way off the mark. But a surprise return at the box office. Strange world.",Murder on the Orient Express

945,tinvillanueva-16935,Not as Bad as You Think,8,11 June 2018,"SUMMARY: If this film had an awesome script, it would have earned more than it did (think Jumanji, Thor 3 numbers) . It's well-made and entertaining at the most. Poirot in 2017 is struggling to find himself and does it at the suspects' expense. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM IF: 1. You expect an on-point remake of the book. - You have the 1974 remake for that. Or for an on-point image of Poirot or if your distracted by his cat-like of a mustache, check out David Suchet. That guy basically lived Poirot. Murder on the Orient Express is a plot-driven book so all the characters played their part in the big picture of the crime. Orient Express 2017 made a futile attempt to know more about the characters and Poirot, which given the time allotted would have been impossible anyways. So the audience ends up with bits and pieces of half-baked people and an even more puzzling detective with his own inner turmoil. Again, this is not a wrong perspective but a good script would have tied everything together. Several characters were miscast and even if some of the characters had massive potential to be liked, the script does not expand on them through their interrogation scenes or their storyline. This, in my opinion, is where the film failed. Strangely enough, while some of them I felt were miscast, the cast had chemistry. 2. You don't like vague dialogues - The big weakness of the film is the screenplay. I haven't watched the deleted scenes yet but the script was the let down. It had a good cast but did not maximize it. Orient Express is a beautiful film and directed wonderfully but there were times when it was a pain to listen to because of the cringe-worthy exchange between characters. It just proves that a film comes down to script, casting and budget regardless of storytelling. The debunk screenplay is pretty much the main reference on why everything went wrong. 3. If you want to see a decent amount of screen time for a character who is not Poirot - The film is more about who Poirot is while solving the Murder on the Orient Express so it's pretty pointless to ask for a monologue for, say, Olivia Colman's character. 4. You have an irrational dislike for Kenneth Branagh - No, it's not an ego trip of a film. He happens to direct and star in it--if he were only the star, I'd figure you would be less annoyed. If you don't like him then there's nothing one can do. Don't watch. There are several movies on the plane or more DVDs to choose from. I am amazed to read paragraphs dissing him. That's not an opinion. You don't like him or his films, that's all. It's not The Human Centipede or a Lars Von Triers movie and even they seemed to had more support than him. DO WATCH THE FILM: 1. If you want to be entertained - I found the film funny sometimes because of motherhood statements that Poirot or some of the characters say, which I am still figuring out why they say it. Having said that, DON'T ANALYZE. Branagh as a director gives perspective to those who have not seen, read or hear the book so in the case of enjoyment, he succeeds (for me, at least). Some of the best scenes are those where Poirot interrogates the suspects as well as when the cast are in groups together. The chemistry between most of the actors (except Johnny Depp) is great, 2. Amazing production value - Production and cinematography is class. Again, if this film had a good script, it would have been up for awards with a more outstanding box office draw.",Murder on the Orient Express

It is hard to mess this up, but Branagh managed to do it.He over played the role of Poirot. His mustache was way over top and totally distracting in every scene. There were many inconsistencies in the movie....scenes of the frozen mountain here the train is trapped in an avalanche frequently shows the cast outside without a coat, or sitting in a freight car with the side doors completely open, wind blowing their hair WITHOUT COATS or any signs of being cold; and then at the end, in the big reveal scene, Branagh WEARS A COAT!! but later briskly goes up and down narrow steps covered in 'ice' without any caution and gets inside vehicle WITHOUT A TOP...in the snow, in the mountains, in the winter.

These are some of the smallest problems with making a new adaption.The biggest problems are the script and cinematography. The script is not in line with what I see on the screen. Examples of this are ""Poirot"" saying that he needs a relaxing vaccation while he later is running around on the train roof and yelling that he needs a vaccation. Does he not have a bad leg? Also, in the previous adaptions you could almost feel the cold as the passangers slept in one wagon with the few heat sources they had. The deadly cold wind blowimg outside while the threat of a murderer inside was looming. In this version they have an interrogation scene with the walls of the wagon open. There is a big disconnect with what I see and how the world works.Another example of bad decisions is when the film a scene of 3 people talking from above. Now you can't see the faces of the people reacting to whai is being said which is important in a murder mystery. Is there thought behind who the rilm the sceens or do they just think that a nice backround is more important than what the scene should tell the audience?I believe that Johnny Depps performance was the best and most convincing, the other I do not remeber except Branagh who is bad compared to his predecessors.To summarize, watch the older versions of Murder on the Orient Express instead of this mess.

Firstly Kenneth Branagh is not hercule Poirot, doesn't look like him, doesn't sound like him, doesn't have his hobbies or quirks, doesn't even involve Hercules his Catholicism (im guessing didn't want to upset the liberals) .....he is best described as general Kitchener in the famous ""Brition wants you!, Join your country's army!)...Also you can see the whole writing was designed for a modern audience, no whodunnit clever riddles or genius intellect enigmas......simple wiritng for simple people.....maximise profits from the film rather then stick to any actual theme....You also see some rather stunning political correctness in the part where the train operator tries to convince Poirot to take on the case....saying that either Hakesh or Dr Arbuthnot will likely to be hanged.....firstly Poirot is a catholic which is unbelievably not included, but also means that murder is repugnant to him and takes the case without any prodding.....secondly even in those days they didn't just outright hang men with coloured skin for murder without trial, esp someone in a position such as a Dr.If your anyone with any Agatha Christie knowledge STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM......If your anyone with any passion for authenticity or passion for your material STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM....If your anyone who will watch paint dry or garbage rot THEN GO DO THAT THEN WATCH THIS FILM.....I wouldn't watch this film for free.....",Murder on the Orient Express

I'm not sure that the writers, directors, or producers did read the novel...this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I wish they would stop production on Death on the Nile before that ruin that as well...",Murder on the Orient Express
960,aelefteria,Painful to watch such a ... train wreck,1,20 November 2017,Don't waste your money and time! If you want to watch a good version of this movie watch any of the older ones. This one is ... a ridiculous error. It was painful to watch Kenneth Branagh playing Poirot. PAINFUL!!! It is boring and has nothing of the Agatha Christie or the older versions spark. All in all a disappointing experience.,Murder on the Orient Express
961,icatq,Most enjoyable!,8,8 February 2019,"Maybe my expectations were low having seen the overall score and read a few reviews, or maybe it's because I'm not an Agatha Christie purist, but I loved it. Depp was naturally superb, but equally so was Branagh. I think other reviews have been unfairly harsh on him. Most of all, I loved the atmosphere of the film set on that gorgeous train against a snowy backdrop. For me, it was like watching a movie in the era in which it was set...a classy bit of old-school escapism designed for the big screen!",Murder on the Orient Express
962,wassociatesins,Totally Awesome,10,2 March 2019,One of my favorites. Great acting and plot. Great smart crime drama....need more like it.,Murder on the Orient Express
