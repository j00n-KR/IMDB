0,TheLittleSongbird,Chucky gets lucky,7,22 December 2018,"Have an appreciation for the horror genre, although there is a preference for other genres. Mainly watched 'Bride of Chucky' having decided to recently watch and review all the films in the 'Child's Play'/Chucky series, having been intrigued for a long time by Chucky the doll's horror icon status, a deserved distinction.Do feel that the character himself is better than the films, as has been said before. Having said that, enough of the films are watchable and a few are even good. 'Bride of Chucky' is one of the good ones. It is not the very best of the 'Child's Play'/Chucky films, it for me will always be the original. It is though one of the best and one of the franchise's most entertaining. Was expecting it to be really dumb, weird and near-intelligence insulting, as the premise sort of indicated, 'Bride of Chucky' by some miracle managed to be neither.There are faults in 'Bride of Chucky' but actually there is not an awful lot wrong. The story is extremely lightweight and tends to be predictable and at times contrived. There is occasionally some clunky dialogue and some characters are more interesting than others.Pacing is not always secure, again with a rushed feel in spots.However, 'Bride of Chucky' looks slick and suitably ominous and the special effects are far from underwhelming, they blend very well, look eerily life-like and move easily. Quite great in fact. The music fits very well and is suitably haunting. Ronny Yu's direction is suitably colourful and of all the directing jobs for me it is second to the original 'Child's Play' in terms of the most personality and panache.Chucky's lines are like in the first two films, darkly witty and clever with one-liners that are smart, frighteningly sarcastic and entertainingly twisted. 'Bride of Chucky' is one of the better scripted 'Child's Play'/Chucky films, with its wicked humour, irresistibly entertaining interplay between Chucky and Tiffany and witty classic past and present horror film references. Intimacy has rarely been more hilarious. Some may not like that 'Bride of Chucky' takes more of a wickedly comedic route rather than providing lots of scares, it wasn't a problem for me and that it went that route was what makes it stand out amongst the rest of the 'Child's Play'/Chucky films. Like the first 'Child's Play', it mostly avoided going the cheesy, goofy and formulaic route that it could easily have done considering the premise.'Bride of Chucky' does have some creepiness despite the more comedic tone, with some genuinely unsettling set pieces. Chucky is an ever unforgettable character, the writers, Brad Dourif and the effects team clearly let loose and had a great time. 'Bride of Chucky' is one of the better acted films in the franchise, with appealing performances from John Ritter and Katherine Heigl in a relatively early role.Even better are the performances for Chucky and Tiffany. Am not usually the biggest fan of Jennifer Tilly, but she is hard to resist here and matches Dourif's Chucky in the darkly wise-cracking stakes. The biggest acting plus though once again is Dourif, again personifying malevolence and is also wickedly funny.Overall, well worth watching and one of the best in the series. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Bride of Chucky
1,Leofwine_draca,"A glossy, self-referencing comedy",5,13 December 2015,"As post-modern, self-referential horror comedies go, this one isn't bad. With a tongue firmly in cheek, BRIDE OF CHUCKY is definitely more comedy than horror. As a horror film, it's a total failure, with a string of gory murders having little impact on the viewer. It could be viewed as a shining example of all that's wrong with the genre at the moment - a lack of the real understanding of horror. As a comedy, though, there are plenty of laughs to be had from the two bickering dolls and the amusing storyline which recalls NATURAL BORN KILLERS. Another plus is that it's an improvement on the previous sequels in the series - but then what couldn't be? Besides, how can you not laugh at a film where two dolls share a very intimate scene?The violence here is played for laughs and there's a lot of it. The puppet animation is rather good too, coming from old hand Kevin Yagher. Coming after SCREAM, there are lots of references to horror films, as you would expect. The obvious influence here, though, is THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, seen playing on television at one point.Brad Dourif returns as the voice of the foul-mouthed doll, Chucky. However it's Jennifer Tilly who provides the most laughs as his bad-tempered and psychotic companion, Tiffany, both in human and doll form. Other characters come and go (usually in bloody ways) and make little impact, apart from the leads playing the teenage couple - the usual flawless and talentless young actors. Apart from this, the plot is contrived and hopeless, and far too simplistic. The film works best when focusing on the love/hate banter between Chucky and Tiffany. It's worth a few laughs, but viewers looking for serious horror should go elsewhere as this is just the latest in a long line of recent lame-brain good-to-look-at glossy films catering for the mainstream crowd.",Bride of Chucky
2,SnoopyStyle,good addition of Jennifer Tilly,5,19 October 2014,"In the Lockport Police Dept Evidence Depository, there is Chucky along with the remains of the greatest horror villains. Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) was serial killer Charles Lee Ray's girlfriend. She gets a young policeman to steal Chucky and then murders him. She reassembles him into a cooler looking Chucky. She does the voodoo rituals again and Chucky comes alive to kill Tiffany's admirer Damian. Tiffany gets angry that Chucky doesn't want to marry her. Later he electrocutes her and using the same voodoo, puts her soul into a bride doll. Chucky needs the amulet Heart of Damballa buried with his body in Hackensack, New Jersey to return to human form. Tiffany gets his neighbor Jesse (Nick Stabile) to drive the dolls there. Jesse convinces Jade (Katherine Heigl) to come with him despite the objections of her police chief uncle Warren Kincaid (John Ritter).It's fun to have Jennifer Tilly introduced into the franchise. She is the best part of this movie. Chucky is still kind of fun too. The two characters have good banter. I could do without the teenage melodrama. It only serves to take time away from the fun of Tiffany and Chucky. Jesse and Jade are annoying and not worthwhile. They are a major decline from child Andy.",Bride of Chucky
3,kosmasp,Funny how?,4,2 April 2007,"There are people who laughed their head off with this and the makers of this movie are really proud of it. Even the actors are excited if you watch them in interviews talking about the movie. But I didn't feel the excitement. It's not really horror, it's not really comedy, it's a mix of both.A mix that doesn't entirely work out for me, but maybe it's something for you. If you're a fan of the series, you'll obviously gonna like it a bit more than I do.It's no necessary to know the other parts to understand the movie, but if you do, you might get a few more laughs out of it!",Bride of Chucky
4,lee_eisenberg,glass ceiling has a new meaning,10,21 March 2009,"They obviously made ""Bride of Chucky"" with the aim of impressing only people who really like slashers. It doesn't disappoint in that sense. To be certain, they're clearly playing everything for laughs. As the title explains, Chucky (voice of Brad Dourif) takes on a mate (Jennifer Tilly)...and she's as much of a wise-cracker as he is.Yes, these movies have no real point. They're just excuses to show people getting killed. But they're so much fun! The best scene is easily the sex scene. Number 2 is the glass scene. But whatever the case, this is one movie that you're sure to enjoy - assuming that you've decided in advance that you like it. Really cool.Also starring John Ritter and Katharine Heigl.",Bride of Chucky
5,jboothmillard,Bride of Chucky,5,8 July 2005,"The original Child's Play is worthwhile, the second was okay, and the third was terrible, this fourth entry, also the first of the series I watched, is essentially what reinvigorated and rescued the franchise, directed by Ronny Yu (The 51st State, Freddy vs. Jason). Basically Tiffany Valentine (Jennifer Tilly) is the former girlfriend of serial killer Charles Lee Ray, ""The Lakeshore Strangler"", Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) (named after Charles Manson, Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray). Bribing police Officer Robert Bailey (Vince Corazza), and killing him straight after, she has recovered the remains of Chucky the killer doll, she believes Ray's soul may still inhabit the doll. She crudely stitches Chucky back together and gives him a new body, she then performs a voodoo ritual to bring him back to life, but it appears to fail. However, Chucky reawakens during a visit from Tiffany's goth admirer Damien (Alexis Arquette), Chucky kills him, and Tiffany watches with excitement. Hoping to pick up where they left off ten years ago, Tiffany shows Chucky the ring he ""left"" her, she assumed he was going to propose marriage, he laughs at her. Enraged, Tiffany traps Chucky in a baby's play pen, and later gives him a talking doll with a wedding dress to make fun of him. Chucky manages to escape the play pen, and kills Tiffany, electrocuting her in the bath with a television, and immediately performs a voodoo incantation to transfer her soul into the bride doll. With Tiffany now a doll herself, Chucky reveals his plan to retrieve an amulet that is buried with his human corpse, which will enable them to transport their souls into human bodies. Meanwhile, Jade (Katherine Heigl) and Jesse (Nick Stabile) are trying to be with each other, but are constantly kept apart by her strict and possessive uncle, Chief Warren Kincaid (John Ritter). Jesse receives a call from Tiffany, she offers him $1,000 to take two dolls to Hackensack, New Jersey, he sees this as his opportunity to escape with Jade, and marry her. Warren plants marijuana in Jesse's van to frame him, he wants Officer ""Needlenose"" Norton (Michael Louis Johnson) to catch them with the drugs and sabotage their plan. But Chucky and Tiffany catch Warren, they rig a trap, causing several nails to embed his face, they hide his body in the van. On the way, Norton pulls them over and finds the drugs, but Chucky stuffs a shirt into the officer's gas tank, and sets it alight. Norton is killed in the explosion, while Jesse and Jade panic and flee the scene, they both begin to suspect each other of foul play, much to the amusement of Chucky and Tiffany. Despite their trust issues, Jesse and Jade get married, while Chucky and Tiffany are forced to kill Warren, who is still alive. Jesse and Jade stay in a motel for the night, con artists Russ (James Gallanders) and Diane (Janet Kidder) enter their room and steal Jesse's money. Tiffany murders the criminal couple while they are making love on a water bed, she throws a champagne bottle to the mirror ceiling, shattering the glass, slicing them to pieces. Chucky is astonished and decides to finally propose marriage to Tiffany, using the diamond ring from a severed finger, she agrees, and the dolls have sex. The following morning, the corpses are found by the Motel Maid (Kathy Najimy), Jesse and Jade again flee the scene, joined by their gay friend David 'Dave' Collins (Gordon Michael Woolvett), who reveals they are suspects wanted for the recent murders. Dave assumes that their paranoia about each other is a simple misunderstanding, but then he finds the dead body of Warren. Dave assumes they are the murderers, that is until Chucky and Tiffany come life holding guns, causing Dave to dash out of the van, and get hit by an oncoming truck. Chucky and Tiffany hold the couple at gunpoint and force them to keep driving to the cemetary where Chucky's human corpse is buried, they plan to use Jesse and Jade to transfer their souls into with the amulet. Tiffany makes dinner and bakes cookies for Chucky, but he refuses to do the dishes, this causes an argument between them. Jade uses this opportunity to lock Tiffany into the heated oven, while Jesse pushes Chucky out of the window. Chucky returns and forces Jade to open up Charles Lee Ray's recently exumed grave and remove the amulet, but Jesse has found the charred Tiffany, who he holds at gunpoint. Tiffany however turns against Chucky, saying they ""belong dead"", but he stabs her and apparently kills her. Chucky is trapped in the grave, when the ladder is removed, Jade shoots him dead, with Lieutenant Preston (Lawrence Dane) witnessing, who clears the couple for the murders. Preston inspects Tiffany's unconscious body, she suddenly wakes up screaming, she gives birth to a baby doll before dying, this newborn child attacks a terrified Preston. Tilly is a gorgeous minx in human form, and good fun as the new doll girlfriend for the main antagonist, Dourif as always is great with his menacing and wisecracking vocals, and young Heigl isn't bad either. Whereas the previous films concentrated on trying to be eerie and scary, this one has a more humorous turn, with spoofs, and knowing nods and jokes about the original franchise itself, the puppet effects are pretty good, and the bloody deaths are both nasty and funny, all in all it is an entertaining horror comedy. Worth watching!",Bride of Chucky
6,BA_Harrison,How could anyone dislike a film featuring hot doll sex?,8,20 November 2009,"Sexy murderess Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) still yearns for a life of wedded bliss with ex-boyfriend, crazed killer Charles 'Chucky' Lee Ray. After getting her hands on the mutilated Good Guy doll that last played host to his spirit, and doing a spot of repair work, she conducts a satanic ritual that returns his life to the toy.Unfortunately for poor Tiff, the reanimated maniac shows no interest in marriage, and so she traps him in a cage, with a bride doll for company. Eventually, a rather angry Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) escapes his confines, electrocutes Tiffany in the bath, and traps her soul in his 'bride' as retribution.Realising that they are now both in the same predicament, the plastic pair put their differences aside and decide to head for Hackensack, New Jersey, where they can lay their hands on the magical amulet that can relocate their spirits into human hosts. Tricking trailer park hunk Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his tasty girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) into taking them to their destination, the psycho dolls embark on a murderous rampage, with their unwitting companions copping the blame.Although the idea of a kid's doll being possessed by the spirit of a mass murderer has always been rather comical, it wasn't until the fourth film in the Child's Play series that the makers fully embraced the sheer lunacy of the premise, opting to plays things much more for laughs than for scares (although there is still plenty of OTT splatter for us gore-hounds to enjoy).Talented Hong Kong director Ronny Yu oversees proceedings, deftly translating the witty tongue-in-cheek script into a slick and thoroughly enjoyable cinematic ride. Similarly, the excellent cast handle the camp material perfectly, with Stabile and Heigl making a likable couple, but smoking hot Tilly stealing the show as blonde, buxom, pouting, PVC-mini-skirted temptress Tiffany. Kevin Yagher's impressively expressive doll effects also go a long way to making the film such a success.Overall, this film is unlikely to find many fans amongst 'serious' horror aficionados, but those who enjoy the odd spot of mindless popcorn entertainment, full of twisted, black humour, crazy death scenes, and magnificent cleavages should have a blast.",Bride of Chucky
7,Quinoa1984,Genuinely classic,7,9 October 2000,"(Spoilers)Like Bride of Frankenstein, Bride of Chucky follows the tradition of slashings, killings and doll sex (and birth).  This story shows Charles Lee Ray's girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly is smokin) as she brings back the chucky doll he's in after a 7 year abensce.  Then horror ensues, when Chucky puts Tiff into a doll and the adventure ensues.  Plenty of fun, and it is the second best in the series, even in the sex doll scenes make you cringe. A-",Bride of Chucky
8,Coventry,the best thing that could happen to the series,5,29 July 2003,"I'm not sure what I should think about director Ronny Yu. Either he provides the genre of horror with the new wind it needed or he is a below average comedian who tries to be funny by spoofing the big titles in the genre. At this moment he is working about Freddy vs Jason which brings the 2 perhaps most famous horror icons, together on the screen and in 1998 he brought us this 3rd sequel in the Child's Play series. I'm not saying he did a bad job on this Bride of Chucky. Not at all, actually. The Child's Play films were never great. The first one from 1988 was original and fun. It went downhill from there. The second one had its moments (a few) and the third one was barely watchable. If you look at it that way, Bride of Chucky is a good film. It's not required to have seen all the sequels. If you know how Charles Lee Ray ended up in the body op a doll, you can easily watch this film. It kinda picks up on the social life that Charles Lee Ray left behind when he died. His girlfriend from back then finally found the dolly (or what's left of it) and brings Chucky back to life. Bride of Chucky has a few gore and bloody moments but it's definitely more of a comedy. The whole film is built around the funny personality that is Chucky. He's a sarcastic, woman-hating, psychotic doll and that provides the movie with lots of quote material. All the little easter eggs make this movie funny as well. If you don't like the story, try to amuse yourself by searching all the references to famous horror film. That should keep you busy too. I wouldn't have mind if Child's Play 3 never received a sequel, to be honest. But if it did have to happen and that's most likely in Hollywood, I'm glad it turned out to be something like this. Brad Dourif returns as the voice of Chucky. This guy is great. If you're not familiar with his name or work, look him up. He played some of the greatest villains in movie history. The girl, Tiffany is a good role for Jennifer Tilly. She has the most irritating voice possible but that turns out as a great advantage for the character she plays here. In conclusion, the movie isn't ashamed to admit it's based on Bride Of Frankenstein and will provide you 90 minutes of good laughs. I'm not saying it's a great film but you won't regret spending time watching it.",Bride of Chucky
9,michaelRokeefe,Is it true that love will set you free?,5,4 May 2002,"For the hard-core Chucky fans. The lasting remains of Chucky are stolen from the police evidence room and a dizzy, twisted woman (Jennifer Tilly)puts the doll together again in order to find a home for her dead boyfriend's spirit. Demented, comedic, violent and gory. One humorous scene is where Chucky gets a ""woody"". Another highlight finds Chucky and his newlywed bride having a duel with shovels in a cemetery. Tilly also supplies the voice of Chucky's bride. Tilly always seems to get the parts of sexy air heads; this role is no different. Some of the insults between the miniature couple are quite funny. Brad Dourif again provides the voice of Chucky. This comedy of gore also features busty Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable. John Ritter takes some gruesome punishment in his role as the Police Chief. If you have seen the first three installments, you owe it to yourself to witness Chucky in unholy matrimony. It goes to show that love sometimes can be a bitch.",Bride of Chucky
10,Doylenf,A rough ride to Hackensack for Chucky and his bride...,6,29 October 2008,"Clever is the word that comes to mind when I think of the mixture of horror and comedy that makes up a good deal of BRIDE OF CHUCKY, much of the humor due to some good one-liners by Chucky (courtesy of BRAD DOURIF's voice). And JENNIFER TILLY does an exceptional job as a dim-witted, evil partner of the doll eventually turned into a doll herself who is just as manic as her boyfriend.NICK STABILE and KATHERINE HEIGL are the leads, the unsuspecting victims of much of the mayhem, who have to confront the evil they're dealing with which leads toward a cemetery in Hackensack where the evil dolls hope to retrieve an amulet from a corpse that will restore their original bodies.It's photographed expertly, well directed by Ronny Yu and there's an unusual amount of range to the expressions on both dolls that make them seem eerily real. The final scene in the cemetery is guaranteed to give you a final startled moment.JOHN RITTER plays his role as Police Chief Kinkaid with some restraint, but it's not much of a part until his gruesome demise.Summing up: Not bad as far as these sort of horror capers go.",Bride of Chucky
11,preppy-3,Silly but fun,9,6 July 2006,"Chucky (the murderous doll from ""Child's Play"" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using ""Voodoo for Dummies"") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds. After the last two sequels to ""Child's Play"" (both of which were horrible) I was expecting the worst, but this actually was lots of fun. The movie doesn't take itself seriously for a second (seriously--how could it?) and the lines and situations are actually quite funny. Also there are a few VERY gory murders thrown in to satisfy us horror fans and the film never stops moving. The movie also has a few things usually not found in a horror movie--a gay best friend (Gordon Michael Woolvett) who is intelligent and not played for laughs and a sequence in which Stabile has his shirt off just to show his muscular body. John Ritter has a nice cameo too as a sheriff.The acting is good--Stabile is young, VERY handsome and likable; Heigl doesn't have much to do but pulls it off and Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky) and Tilly are hilarious as the murderous dolls. My favorite part is when the dolls have sex (don't ask) and she asks for a rubber and he responds, ""But I'm MADE of rubber!"" The special effects are good (no lousy CGI here) and this is one of the few horror films to mix humor and violence in an entertaining way. Well worth seeing. I give it a 9.",Bride of Chucky
12,poolandrews,"""You looked in the mirror lately? Now's not the time to get picky."" Wonderful horror with lashings of dark humour.",9,6 August 2005,"Bride of Chucky starts late one night as Officer Bob Bailey (Vince Corazza) sneaks into the evidence room at his police station & amongst all the horror film in joke props he steals the remains of the Chucky doll that serial killer Charles Lee Ray possessed way back in the original Child's Play (1988). He drives the remains to an isolated area where Ray's ex girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) slashes Bailey's throat & takes the remains back to her trailer. There Tiffany stitches & staples Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) back together again & using a 'voodoo for dummies' book brings him back to murderous life. Thing don't go as Tiffany had hoped & Chucky turns out not to be the man of her dreams after all so she locks him in a play pen at which Chucky is less than happy. While Tiffany takes a bath Chucky escapes, electrocutes her & using that book brings her back to life in the shape of a female doll dressed as a bride. Neither want to be stuck in plastic bodies & have to work together to get to a cemetery in New Jersey where Ray's natural body had been buried with the amulet needed to switch their spirits back into human bodies. The bodies of Tiffany's neighbour Jesse (Nick Stabile) & his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl), who are both on the run from Jade's corrupt uncle Chief of police Warren Kincaid (John Ritter), will do nicely...Directed by Ronny Yu I love Bride of Chucky. The script by Don Mancini is great fun, very fast moving, highly entertaining & references plenty of other horror film with good affection. From the opening sequence where we see Jason Voorhees hockey mask from the Friday the 13th films, Freddy Krueger's razor blade glove from the A Nightmare on Elm Street series & Michael Myers mask from the Halloween franchise. To the clips used from Bride of Frankenstein (1935) when it virtually recreates the same scene. Bride of Chucky never takes itself seriously which is just as well, there are lots of one liners, self referential gags that Scream (1996) made trendy a few years earlier & it doesn't seem afraid to poke fun at itself & the horror genre in general. I love the scene when Jesse & Jade are having a clichéd slushy romantic conversation that Chucky hears & he makes funny derogatory comments & gestures throughout. That's not to say that there isn't a damn good film in there as well because there most certainly is. Director Yu manages to create good atmosphere & a real sense of fun, both human & plastic sets of characters are likable & shine as each pair suffer their own sets of domestic problems that the trail of corpses that they are leaving behind would obviously cause. Technically Bride of Chucky is great for the most part & has that big budget polish about it & at about $25,000,000 I should hope so. The only thing that I will say is that some of the puppet effects by Kevin Yagher are a little stiff & unconvincing, I can't remember any CGI scenes in Bride of Chucky either. Thankfully the film doesn't neglect the blood & gore with a cool slit throat, nails blasted into someone's face in presumably a Hellraiser (1987) homage, people impaled on shards of glass, someone being bloodily obliterated by a huge truck, a ripped off lip piercing & various stabbings & gunshots. The acting is pretty good & Dourif as Chucky is very funny as he spouts the one liners out. I also like the scenes with Tiffany at the beginning & find her very sexy when she's wearing all that fetish gear, I can't be the only one surely? I personally think Bride of Chucky is a fantastic film, total entertainment from start to finish, great humour & horror in equal measure & at only 85 minutes long it never becomes boring or dull. A personal favourite of mine, watch it as soon as you can!",Bride of Chucky
13,lastliberal,"I'll kill anybody, but I'll only sleep with someone I love.",6,3 November 2007,"This is the best so far of all the Chucky films. It isn't that it has more story going on, but the addition of Jennifer Tilly makes it worth watching even if you don't like Chucky.Tilly's best role is unarguably Bound with Gina Gershon, but she has been thrilling us for years in such films as The Getaway and Dancing at the Blue Iguana. She thrills us again in this film and we take due notice.The film also stars ""Grey's Anatomy""'s Katherine Heigl, who shows much better taste in men that she did on screen this year with Nick Stabile as her partner.Lots of laughs and a cool maniac in Chucky.",Bride of Chucky
14,Boba_Fett1138,"I don't mind it being silly, just make it good!",5,4 November 2011,"The entire premise of the Child's Play-series was a ridicules one to begin with, so I really don't mind the series also taking a more silly approach with the later movies. However silly doesn't simply equal good or fun as well unfortunately.I always thought that ""Bride of Chucky"" would be a fun one to watch. And I did had some fun with it but the movie is still being brought down by a bad story and approach to it.So the movie is more a comedy than anything else really this time but did that really had to mean that they needed to get rid of all the horror elements as well? I can't even call this one a slasher this time really, since Chucky really isn't on a killing rampage this time. I don't even know what he was doing in this movie. I mean, what was his motivation this time? It didn't seem like he was very busy trying to get his soul out of the good guy doll and same goes for the Jennifer Tilly character, who also got transfered into a doll and is the 'bride of Chucky' in this one.And then there are the Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile characters as well. Where they really needed for this movie? Couldn't they come up with a better idea or story for them? I seriously can say that I would had probably liked this movie better, hadn't they been in it at all. It would had caused less distraction and perhaps would had allowed Chucky and his new bride do some more evil and gruesome stuff.I'm not really sure what they were thinking. Seems to me they had no idea how to find or create a good balance between comedy and horror elements and therefore went for purely mostly just comedy instead. I still wouldn't had minded this if the movie did actually had a fun and clever story in it but as it turns out, the movie starts to run out of steam pretty fast, after a promising enough first 20 minutes or so. And I also still really liked the last 10 seconds of the movie. I won't spoil it but all I can say is that's the most awesome Child's Play movie ending I have seen, even though it pretty much came out of nowhere.It also remains awesome that Brad Dourif keeps coming back to do the voice of Chucky. You would think that it really doesn't matter much, since he's only just doing his voice but it makes all the difference in the world really. His voice is perfectly evil and insane and I especially also really like his evil laugh.Can't say that the effects have improved really much. Seems like the animatronic effects for the Chucky doll really haven't improved that much, ever since the first 1988 movie. Don't get me wrong, it looks pretty good all but it's not exactly the most convincing looking thing ever.Another disappointing sequel unfortunately, while I still really had good faith in the movie, before I started watching.5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Bride of Chucky
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Just when you thought Chucky had reached his lowest...,5,22 March 2005,"This film is so far my least favorite of the series... never mind the rating, I actually like Child's Play 3 more than this. I haven't seen Seed Of Chucky yet, but I'm fairly confident it's not as bad(or worse, if that's possible) than this... honestly, it can't possibly be. I really don't think so. The plot is the most nonsensical and poorly written P.O.S. I've heard of for a very, very long time. The pacing is even worse than the third film, and, believe me, that says a lot. I think I would find it more thrilling to watch paint dry than to see this poor excuse for a Chucky film again. The acting is not as bad as it was in the third film, but it's close. The characters are the most poorly written(so far) in a Chucky film, and by far the most underdeveloped. None of them are really likable, so you have to just go by which actors you like or who you find attractive. Going by that, I preferred the screen time where John Ritter or Jennifer Tilly is on-screen. Unfortunately, that's not a lot of time, and I was bored for just about every remaining second of the film. The film is kept going through a series of 'twists' which act like introducing a small amount of electricity to a dead body; you get a slight twitching and movement, but it doesn't last long. New pointless characters are introduced on a regular basis simply to be killed off. The whole idea with Chucky's ex-girlfriend just seems dumb, not to mention the teenage couple that are our main characters constantly mistrusting each other... I guess it was supposed to make us laugh, but I've never really found Chucky the character to be entertaining or funny, I really just liked Chucky the maniacal serial killer because he was so interesting, cruel and creative. I don't know... the whole idea of the film just doesn't work. If you kind of liked the first three films, but you kept wondering how a black comedy featuring Chucky looking like a bastardized monster of Frankenstein, maybe you'll enjoy this. I recommend this to... um... well, I don't really know. If you enjoy black comedy far more than horror, and you like Chucky the character more than Chucky the killer, maybe you should give the film a chance. Just don't expect anything from it. It's not even worth it to experience the great John Ritter or ogle at the beautiful Jennifer Tilly... and that's coming from a big fan of Ritter and someone who's found Tilly incredibly attractive for a long time. Most people really shouldn't bother with this film. 5/10",Bride of Chucky
16,view_and_review,Chucky Always Makes Me Laugh,6,3 December 2020,"The last time we saw Chucky it was 1991 and he was being chopped up into chucklets in an industrial fan. His old flame Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) was able to fetch him, sew him back together, and do another incantation to bring him back to life. He came back as blood thirsty, foul-mouthed, and funny as ever. Boy! I missed Chucky.After Tiffany brought the Chuckster (Brad Dourif) back to life she wasn't very nice to him. Ol' Charles Lee Ray got even by electrocuting her in her tub. But he did do her a solid by transferring her soul into a female doll, hence ""The Bride of Chucky.""Chuck's goals were the same as they've always been: transference into a live body. No matter how hard he tries he can never accomplish it. He and Tiffany kill and kill to get into live human bodies, but I'm sure you know how that goes. After a kill count of ten the two of them were killed. Tiffany was cooked in an oven and stabbed through the heart. Chucky was stabbed and shot several times (mild compared to the other times he was killed). Our protagonists who got away were a young, high school, newlywed couple--everything that makes you sick in a scary movie. I knew the girl would get away, it was just a matter of if her beau would survive as well. Unfortunately, he did. They both did. So Chucky loses again.",Bride of Chucky
17,anaconda-40658,Bride of the Original.,4,16 December 2015,"Bride of Chucky (1998): Dir: Ronny Yu / Cast: Jennifer Tilly, Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl, John Ritter / Voice: Brad Dourif: A strange and sick little horror. Possessed doll Chucky finally lands a bride who happens to be a witch. Viewers are subject to an assault of perversion including a love scene between both dolls. We witness the birth of baby Chucky, as if the sex scene wasn't enough. Directed by Ronny Yu with fine production effects. This is at least an improvement over his last effort, Warriors of Virtue. Jennifer Tilly is ideal for the role of Tiffany who uses voodoo to resurrect Chucky. Their warped relationship bares reference to Bonnie and Clyde and Natural Born Killers until betrayal and carnage set in. They hitchhike with an eloping couple who are blamed for a murder spree. Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigl play the couple who are on the run but get caught up in a string of murders they didn't commit. John Ritter appears as Heigl's tyrant uncle and the role is something different for him but more would have been great as oppose to a murder that occurs way too early. Brad Dourif provides the snarl of Chucky. Pointless puke fest where viewers cheered when a truck mashes some poor dote into the pavement. The honeymoon murders are also unnecessary. This is one wedding celebration that gushes in its own explicit mess. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Bride of Chucky
18,kannibalcorpsegrinder,The best of the series,10,23 August 2012,"Realizing he needs to turn back into human form, the killer doll and his former lover, now a doll as well, enlist a couple to accomplish the task but find their murderous personalities preventing it from happening.This here is one of the more impressive entries in the genre and one of the better ones in the series. One of the main issues is the fact that there's an utterly perfect balance between the horrific and the humorous, as this combines utterly perfect laugh-out-loud moments, from hilarious one-liners to sight gags and puns, mixed in with the horror- centered areas present here. It's the comedy here that wins out for the most part, from the failed ceremony, the continuous references to the other toy dolls she has laying around and the utterly hilarious running gag of everybody's reaction to Tiffany and Chucky dolls throughout the film, though the greatest material is their quips and jokes to each other. These are truly gut-busting as the dolls begin conversing about being out-of-touch in regards to movie-killer practices and trying to instill the need for variety in the kills to be committed or in their relationship woes which sound like real, actual relationship arguments but come off as hilarious due to the nature of being said by plastic dolls. As well with the comedy, the horror elements here are wholly impressive including the extravagant visual flair found in many of the scenes here that readily turns this into a comedy, from the initial attack in the trailer-park house that gets her into doll-form as the distraction from the movie allows for the trap to be deployed which is just suitably perfect here. The road-trip nature here allows for the great traveling scenes as well, with the diner attack coming off nicely with the explosive reaction and general panic or the utterly insane kill at the motel which is really impressive here and gives this a spectacular centerpiece sequence. Even the finale at the graveyard is fun with the numerous stalking to get the upper-hand, the confrontation over the grave is fun and there's a lot to like with the great action in the big brawl here to finally end this. All of this means the pace is perfect with tons of outstanding encounters to keep the pace going strong with tons of high-energy action and plentiful gore provided by the outstanding kills here. As well, the film gets an absolute ton of positives from the stellar special effects work for the dolls, as this is an absolutely amazing part of the film. Given that this one spends as much time as it does here showcasing them on-screen, they need to come off flawlessly and they manage to come across as realistic dolls and puppets throughout here due to these perfectly conceived creations. Mixed along with a return to the more horror-centric side of Chucky, these manage to create an overall winning film. While there's a ton to love here, there are a few small, near-inconsequential flaws to this. One of the biggest is that it does tend to homage too many other films at times and feel more like it's actively trying to be funny or clever without doing anything important to the film trying to awkwardly shove the reference into the scene. This also bleeds somewhat into the other flaw, that the comedic one-liners are a bit much to get over and wear themselves out somewhat. However, since this one doesn't have too many real flaws there's so much to like here it becomes quite impressive.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, a shadowy puppet sex scene and some drug use.",Bride of Chucky
19,FlashCallahan,Chucky sort of got lucky.....,6,28 March 2017,"Charles Lee Ray is back because his girlfriend Tiffany revived him, once again in the form of Chuck. Shortly after the couple's reunion, Chucky kills her and brings her back in the form of a girl's bridal doll. The two then embark on a killing spree en route to dig up Ray's corpse, which was buried with a Satanic voodoo charm capable of bringing back the dead......I'm assuming that this was only made because of Scream making horror movies cool again, and also because of the success of Halloween H2O. The Child's Play franchise wasn't the best trilogy in the world, but Chucky was so iconic, it was inevitable that he would 'come out to play' once again, because like all cinematic ghouls, you just can't keep a good villain down.And like Part's two and three, it's all played for laughs, and if your looking for something scary, look elsewhere, because this, like Scream is all about referencing different horror films, and seeing how far they can push the gore factor.The concept of Chucky finally getting a 'mate' is a foolproof concept, plus, the follow on almost writes itself because of the films plot.So the film's narrative is basically a road trip, the dolls kidnap a teen couple, so they can take them to the site of the resurrection, and along the way, carnage ensues Mickey and Mallory style.The horror references can often be quite subtle, and in some instances, literally in your face, but it's fun to spot them.When the writers realise that the concept wears thin after the middle of the second act, their escape clause is to have the dolls swear a lot and and argue, and there is one particular scene that rivals Team America for sheer 'was there any need for that?' audacity of the narrative.Unfortunalty, it's not as clever as what it thinks it is, and runs out of steam during the third act, because you can only find a profane doll hilarious for so long.So all in all, it's perfectly fine, but should have been so much more.And a few scares wouldn't have gone a miss...",Bride of Chucky
20,The_Void,Chucky is back again! ...and it's not too bad,7,24 September 2006,"I've got to say that I never wanted to see this film, but sometimes you find yourself in front of a television showing 'Bride of Chucky', and have nothing better to do. I have to admit to not having seen the first two sequels, and I highly doubt that I'm missing much. As you might expect, Bride of Chucky is completely ridiculous; yet somehow, the overwhelming stupidity seen throughout the film is what makes it good; as after a while, it's much easier to simply not think about what you're seeing and enjoy the film for what it is. As I said, I never saw the first two sequels; but from what I've heard, they're not much good; and since there isn't too much that you can do with the idea of a mad serial killer in the body of a doll, spoofing classic films such as 'Bride of Frankenstein' isn't too bad an idea. The film focuses on Tiffany; a young woman that tracks down 'Chucky'. She was his girlfriend while he in human form, and she's looking to rekindle their relationship. However, things don't go to plan when it turns out he was never as keen on her as she was on him, and after punishing him; Tiffany gets hers...The film is directed by Ronny Yu; the same man responsible for such enjoyable trash as Freddy vs Jason and The 51st State. It has to be said that he certainly has his own style, and Bride of Chucky benefits from a superbly trashy atmosphere and a whole host of pumping rock music, which bodes well with the gory and silly plot line. The film is rather uneven, however, and while some of the jokes (the part involving Tiffany finding a wedding ring in particular), are very funny; while other parts of the film fall rather flat. Yu is keen to poke fun at the plot line and the entire Chucky series at every possible moment, although the 'in' jokes aren't often very funny. The doll 'sex' scene is bizarre, although Yu does make good by the end with a frenzied final half hour and a climax that leaves things wide open for a sequel, which the film got six years later. Brad Dourif returns to his trademark role, and once again does well at providing the voice for the maniacal doll at the centre. Even better than that, however, is the fact that he's joined by the extremely odd Jennifer Tilly, and listening to their banter is often lots of fun. Overall, this isn't a great film - but considering how bad it could have been, this third sequel ain't too bad.",Bride of Chucky
21,Sylviastel,Chucky's Back and this time he's not alone!,7,7 July 2008,"Jennifer Tilly plays Tiffany, the long lost love of the serial killer, who inspired Chucky, the doll only a mother can love who kills people. Tiffany is his soul-mate from hell. She finally becomes the doll and the two of them get together for mayhem and murder. The movie is quite hysterical and often bloody at times. Grey's Anatomy Katherine Heigl has a role here fighting with a bloody doll. Chucky and Tiffany have to get to New Jersey to the cemetery in order to retrieve something from his coffin. I only saw the half the film but it was more than enough. Evil dolls like Chucky and Tiffany go around killing people just to get to Hackensack. The people like the honeymoon couple at Niagara Falls and the senior elderly couple in the RV always looked shocked by being killed by two dolls. In the end, there is another surprise. I wonder if Heigl remembers this film or maybe she would rather forget. I would love to see a reporter ask her about it now that she's huge.",Bride of Chucky
22,christopher-underwood,I had fond memories of this. Or at least I thought I had,4,12 March 2018,"I had fond memories of this. Or at least I thought I had. Seems I only saw the first twenty minutes or even maybe only the trailer. Jennifer Tilly is great but she is only in this at the start and later is just the voice of the doll. Indeed for most of this film we get rather stiff performances from the humans and animated ones from a pair of dolls. Predictable, unfunny and loud, this would be just the thing for under fifteens but in UK has a 15 certificate so thats a bummer. I have seen rave reviews for this but then maybe those folk only saw the trailer. This is no thriller, nor a horror, simply a rather poor comedy. There is blood and violence but do dolls count?",Bride of Chucky
23,StevePulaski,A Bump in the Series' Slump,6,15 July 2010,"Horror franchises tend to be just crappy rehashes of the first film after the second film. That is not the case for Bride of Chucky, its a fresh start over after the last miserable mess. Its got great voice acting by the dolls once again and it revisits some scary moments that made the first two memorable. Though it still takes the dreaded Comedy factor in Horror a little too far, there are still enough jumps and catchy one liners that make the film good (the air bag scene and the Martha Stewart insult).The plot involves Tiffany (Tilly) a women interested in voodoo and talking to the dead, try to revive the old Chucky doll after, of course, being killed in CP3. She believe she failed, but sooner than later is killed by Chucky and puts her soul in a female doll. Now Chucky has a girlfriend, which then, like the title suggests, later becomes a beloved butchering bride. Chucky and his new bride begin going on a killing rampage traveling with two rebellious dating teens which leads to all sorts of slaughterings and gory fun. This film can be a little cliché, but its satisfying, scary, and hilarious to see two dolls run around killing people. What fun Bride of Chucky can be.Part of the prize that stems from this movie's greatness is the Honk Kong director Ronny Yu. He worked on several Honk Kong movies before starting working on American movies in 1991 with Rapid Fire. He would later become famous for directing the ultimate Horror match-up between Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees in the iconic Freddy vs. Jason, direct a Jet Li film three years later, and even do an episode for the NBC series Fear Itself which is definitely a must see. He is a great, underrated director, but it seems that the movies he does gets more recognition than himself. Bride of Chucky is one of my favorite movies to mix the Satire/Horror but use it in a limited form, so we're not just saying ""c'mon gimmie come scares"". Still being succeeded in the best department by the first two, its hard not to call Bride of Chucky a fun Horror film and the best of it's kind.Starring: Jennifer Tilly, Katherine Heigl, Nick Stabile, John Ritter, Alexis Arquette, and Brad Dourif. Directed by: Ronny Yu.",Bride of Chucky
24,Smells_Like_Cheese,Ahh! You mean there can actually be a good Chucky movie?,7,31 July 2006,"Again, I'm not sure why, but I wanted to complete the Child's Play series. I was kind of looking forward to Bride of Chucky because it has a better rating that the last two Chucky movies. The thing I loved about this movie is finally that it doesn't take itself so seriously any more. Because Chucky, you have to admit, is a very lame villain. He's only 2 feet tall and not that intimidating. Jennifer Tily brought so much to the series, her and chucky were just so adorable and like a comedic Bonnie and Clyde. I mean, besides the killings, they were so much like a real couple that could break your heart and make you want to kiss your crush. LOL! Bride of Chucky is very entertaining and is an actual good horror movie.7/10",Bride of Chucky
25,KineticSeoul,Mischievous duo,7,6 June 2014,"With the boring entry when it came to the 3rd installment that Don Mancini didn't want to do because of the lack of ideas. This is a refreshing start to another level. Although this is not a serious suspenseful horror like the first one it's still a fresh entry that does have entertainment value. Especially with the Marilyn Mason massacre scene I could tell this is going to be a different style of entry. Actually the beginning scene where you shows Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger items. This is a balls to the wall kinda entry to this franchise (although the doll sex scene is uncomfortable to watch even if it's off-screen. It sort of reminded me of ""Team America: World Police""). Which doesn't make any sense since Chucky doesn't have a penis, well at least when shown down their in the second installment. The plot keeps contradicting the rules of the previous movies in this franchise to bring Chucky back and the direction to go with it. Yes, I am talking about the revival of Chucky and the amulet/medallion thing (well they always have to think of creative ways to bring Chucky back). This time Chucky has a more sinister look with scars, stitches and all. While the previous movies dealt with the chemistry with Andy, this one deals with Chucky's chemistry with a seductive and psychotic woman named Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly). Jennifer Tilly is just fine and reminded me of a real life Harley Quinn. The chemistry between the two is far from a normal generic relationship, kinda reminded me of Bonnie and Clyde on adrenaline. Sure some horror franchises with a iconic goes in a very silly direction after the 3rd or 4th installment this one actually does work. Also Chucky's mischivious, foul mouth and evil bad boy persona with a mean attitude goes up another notch with this one. Even the kills this time is in another creative level and includes memorable segments to go with the whole package. Even the ending brings something new instead of sticking with the previous ""Child's Play"" formula. Watching this was like watching a cool horror slasher comedic road trip movie.7.8/10",Bride of Chucky
26,OllieSuave-007,Another entertainingly bad horror sequel.,7,4 October 2017,"The murderous child's doll, Chucky, comes back to life after his human girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) brings him back to life, only finding herself becoming a doll as well.

The acting was pretty good for the most part. Chucky and Tiffany just acted so bad in the film that you can't help but chuckle once in a while.

27,thesar-2,"So, Chucky's Buried where Miss Teschmacher grew up?",8,18 October 2009,"I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a ""return to greatness"" but the series was never really great. Very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle/tagline: ""Chucky Gets Lucky."" So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky. And as much as I liked her in the feature, she can't get all the credit: the props (watch the first 1-2 minutes for horror-homages), the writing, the inside jokes (again, the opening + Pinhead) and Chucky lines were great (""In fact, if (this) were a movie, it would take 3-4 sequels just to do it justice,"" among others.) Mercifully, Chucky and the series has given up on Andy the ""Hide the Soul"" quest, and just settled for a new way out of his body. He teams up with his ex (Tilly) whom he transfers into a ""Bride"" doll and a couple of Bonnie & Clyde teens (Really, Heigl?) to regain this pendant buried with Chucky's human corpse. This is for any Chucky fan, 1980s slasher-horror fans or even to those who's never seen any of the previous 'Child's Play' films. It's funny, dark, harmless, gory – but not over the top and despite Tilly's literal 20 minutes of screen time, it's always great to see her. After all, you barely see her play poker anymore.

By a strange coincidence her soul becomes trapped inside another doll. The pair set off cross-country to retrieve an amulet buried with the serial killer that will allow them to regain their human form.Maybe I'm not part of the target audience, but there's not much in this movie that works for me. Some of the humor is mildly amusing, but for the most part, it's ridiculous. And the whole notion that these two small dolls are able to take down and kill anything larger than a puppy or engage in sex and procreate is really stretching it. In short, I've never understood the appeal of Chucky and Bride of Chucky does nothing to change that.The ""highlight"" (for the lack of a better word) of the movie has to be Jennifer Tilly. I've always enjoyed seeing her in other movies. She has a style and look about her that I find unique. And Bride of Chucky gives her a chance to show off herwellacting abilities.",Bride of Chucky
29,bowmanblue,Quite good (if you don't mind the change in genre),7,21 August 2014,"There was quite a lot of fuss made by 'Child's Play' die-hard fans when the fourth instalment (aka 'Bride of Chucky') was released. Not only did it drop the 'Child's Play' title, but it also changed genres.The first three films played it dead straight every time. They were horror movies through and through. However, Bride of Chucky could almost be considered a reboot, as it uses very little of the 'mythology' from its predecessors and introduces a whole new concept to the franchise, i.e. humour.This is very much a 'black comedy.' Personally, I was never that scared of the original films and thought that a story about a possessed killer doll was hardly 'serious' subject matter to begin with, so I was okay with the change. However, Child's Play 'purists' disagreed.So, if you only see the Child's Play franchise as straight horror, I'd leave the series at Part III. However, if you're okay with some campy humour added into the mix, or are just a fan of black comedies in general, I'd give this one a try.Special kudos to Jennifer Tilly, who's brilliant as the 'bride' of Chucky in both human and doll form.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Bride of Chucky
30,ericstevenson,"Well, I guess it tried",6,13 May 2018,"The last ""Child's Play"" movie was regarded by some as the worst in the series, so in this film they took the story into a completely different direction. They made it all more comedic, in contrast to some of the earlier films, where it was unintentionally comedic. I admit to giving the writers some props for at least trying something different. It's probably the best sequel of its time, not that that means much. The best part may be at the very end. Chucky dies as usual like every other movie, but knows that he'll be back eventually. Surely enough, he is. I actually do like Jennifer Tilly in this and think she can be a talented actor. At least Chucky doesn't get all the kills this time. It's still nothing a non fan would really enjoy, but there's some effort. I thought this film had Jason Ritter from ""Gravity Falls"" in it. Turns out it was actually John Ritter, his father. **1/2",Bride of Chucky
31,CuriosityKilledShawn,Well hello Dolly!,8,7 March 1999,"After being stuck in an evidence locker since he was diced in a giant fan at the end of Child's Play 3, Chucky is freed by corrupt cop Bailey, sent by his girlfriend Tiffany. Officer Bailey is quickly offed and Chucky is taken home in multiple broken pieces. Using bits off her massive doll collection Tiffany manages to bring Chucky back to life using another chant to the mighty Damballa.As soon as he's on his feet Chucky does yet another killing to get the circulation going. Tiffany is excited and can't wait to get Chucky into a human body so they can get hitched. But Chuck is dead against marriage and laughs in her face. Dejected, Tiffany locks him in a play pen while she blows off some steam. Not taking kindly to being locked up, Chucky breaks out and kills her by knocking a TV into her bathtub.Another chant to Damballa brings her back in the form of one of her many dolls. Angry with the loss of her nice, fleshy body and being stuck in a short, plastic one, Tiffany starts researching ways to help herself without Chucky's aid. Tough luck, the only way out is with the help of an amulet that was buried with Chucky's human body years ago.Conning a couple of local lovebirds, hick Jesse and well-to-do Jade, into driving them to the graveyard in New Jersey, Chuck and Tiff begin a cross-country killing spree, leaving a pile of dead bodies in their wake that the cops assume are the work of Jesse and Jade. Marital disputes between couples both flesh and plastic follow. Don't laugh, it's good! The formula of Child's Play was wearing mighty thin by the end of the 3rd film and really needed a fresh new spin to keep it alive. Don Mancini struck the nail right on the head when he turned it into a post-modern horror. Remember, this was back in the days when post-modern horror was all the rage so it might seem just the tiniest bit dated now. But compared to the endless Urban Legend, Scream and I Know yadda yadda films of that era Bride of Chucky seems to have the sharpest wit, the slickest direction and strongest production values.Director Ronny Yu gives us plenty of eye-candy and shoots the film with lots of darkness and deep blacks. A horror series like this needs technical superiority and imagination when it comes to direction and Ronny Yu soars over Jack Bender's mundane approach to Child's Play 3.Composer Graeme Revell returns and delivers a more sophisticated, if slightly generic, score to those awful death-metal guitar/synthesizer cues to Child's Play 3. His main theme from Child's Play 2 comes and goes briefly and he forgets the huge orchestral mayhem he did before. But he does introduce a very cool Twin Peaks-style love theme for Chuck and Tiff. An alright score overall that really should get a release on CD.Katherine Heigl is very easy on the eye as is Jennifer Tilly (as a human). Plus it also features one of my favorite actors, the late John Ritter, who died in 2003. Margot Kidder's gorgeous niece Janet also has a small role and Kathy Najimy (that's Peggy Hill for you King of the Hill fans) cameos as a distressed Motel Maid.My only problem is that the film should have been longer, with a more satisfying ending. Chucky has done the Damballa chant so many times now that I just want to see it work for a change. In the DVD commentary Don Mancini said that the film originally had Jesse possessed by Chucky and that the final showdown had more to it. I would have liked to have seen this instead of the weak ending that wound up in the film. For such an elaborate and imaginative horror movie, Bride of Chucky goes out with a whimper instead of a bang.That said, it was still the best of the post-Scream horror films that surfaced in the late-90s and the best of the Chucky series. The subsequent Seed of Chucky was still pretty damn good, but felt like it belonged in a different genre.",Bride of Chucky

This part is devoid of the scare n tension as the concept of a child in peril is totally removed. One of the kills may remind viewers of the Cenobite.

37,insomniac_rod,May only work for fans of the genre.,8,26 September 2004,"From the beginning of the movie you can say it's all about a horror comedy with Chucky's style. The movie got fresh air after ignoring the whole Andy Barclay story (it got pretty old in part 3) and adding new characters to the series. The humor in this sequel is brilliant and works perfect for a movie with a doubtful premise. The title ""BRIDE OF CHUCKY"" may sound very cheesy for non fans of the genre but it's a great title for the movie (parody of ""Bride of Frankenstein"" in many aspects). In 1998 the horror genre was on a decline mainly because of many attempts to copy the style that ""Scream"" copied from the 80's slashers. Ronny Yu and Don Mancini created a great horror comedy that has nothing to do with the previous ""Child's PLay"" movies. The stylish direction and entertaining script are the best features of the movie. There's plenty of great gore! and great deaths. The Pinhead reference was hilarious. Also, the motel death scene was brilliant. The humor is great as I said, there are plenty of references to other horror movies that only fans of the genre could understand. The dolls sex scene may freak you out but it's damn funny. The acting is pretty good this time. You can't go wrong with Jennifer Tilly (she's extremely hot!) and Brad Dourif. Katherine Heigl also delivers a good performance and her beautiness helps a lot. The score is perfect for the movie (specially Rob Zombie's contributions). Chucky rocks again!""BRIDE OF CHUCKY"" isn't an easy watch for non fans of the genre, specially for the in-jokes and black humor. In the other hand, this movie is a delight for fans of the genre and of course, of the Chucky movies. Watch it with low expectations and don't be influenced by it's title because ""BRIDE OF CHUCKY"" is a great horror comedy. One of the bests from the 90's, seriously. It may not have the suspense and great script from the original ""Child's Play"" but it's interesting on it's own way. Chucky's return was very welcome.8/10",Bride of Chucky
38,Anonymous_Maxine,I'll be back. I always come back!,9,10 December 2004,"In the world of horror movie sequels, movie monsters having children is one of the biggest clichés in the book. But movie monsters having brides? THAT'S never been done before!! Oh, wait. Yes it has. Luckily, the Child's Play films reside on this odd plane of existence that separates them from other horror movies while still allowing horrible things to happen in them. It's that world between comedy and horror where the movies can be a little bit of both and, most paradoxically, the expectations for quality are low but, for fun, very high indeed. At the end of Child's Play 3, my least favorite in the entire series, Chucky suffers a fate that lands him in a police evidence locker in what is most accurately described as an extensive state of disrepair. But coming to the rescue is Tiffany, his true love in the human form and something of a knee-weakening sexpot. She bribes a cop at the beginning of the movie to steal Chucky from police lockup since, being a true romantic, she is still in love with her Charles, even if he is dead and plastic. This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie, because inside the evidence locker are items from various other unexplained multiple murders  Michael Meyers' and Jason's masks, Freddy's claws, and Texas' chainsaw. Being the first film in the series that heads in a genuinely misogynistic direction, it's not long after Tiff brings Chucky back to life that he kills her, although he still doesn't manage to get her to stop loving him. The love of the abused dies hard, I suppose. This does, however, lead to some of the best scenes in the movie, as Chucky transforms from the one-dimensional murderous doll that we know and love from the previous three films and into a murderous plastic husband. One of the movie's many highlights is when Jesse and Jade use stereotypical domestic expectations to turn Chucky and Tiff against each other and get them to fight. ('She's not much in the housecleaning department, is she Chucky?' 'You cooked, the least he could do is wash the dishes, right?'). I love how the movie starts off. Jesse and Jade are high school sweethearts conspiring to run away together, but matters are complicated by her uncle, who happens to be chief of police and no big fan of boys sniffing around his daughter. Chucky and Tiff, as seems to be common in horror movies that contain the number 4 or higher in their title, have a scene in which they discuss the originality of their methods of distributing death. John Ritter has a great scene where they lined up nails on the dashboard and then somehow set off the air bag, filling his face with nails. Chucky looks at him and says, 'Why does that look so familiar?' Looks like he wasn't so original after all!Charles Lee Ray's body was buried with an amulet around his neck that they now need in order to escape these wretched bodies. Tiff hires Jesse to bring them to her friend in New Jersey (over the phone he can't tell she's a doll), so they can get to his grave. Thus you have two murderous dolls being transported by two teenagers who themselves don't even know they're alive, and now the police are in hot pursuit because of the trail of bodies and missing police chiefs being left in their wake. As if Jade's nosy uncle wasn't enough(spoilers) At the end of the film we are left, as is generally the case, with an ending the leaves the door open for a sequel. That requires one, really. It is strange that a single detective ultimately catches up with Jesse and Jade once they finally get to Charles Lee Ray's grave in New Jersey, and stranger still that, as we learn in Part 5, a trashy British ventriloquist wanders onto the scene to remove the slimy, bloody baby before any more officers arrive, but the movie is so much fun that it's easy to overlook that. Bride of Chucky barely even sets out to be a horror movie as much as a curious, bloody comedy, so I think a little lapse of judgment is allowed here and there. Bride of Chucky is something of a deviation from the movies that came before it. The same main themes are there, but they have transcended the storyline that allows for all sorts of homages to be paid. Scariness is sacrificed, but quality and fun are not.",Bride of Chucky
39,gwnightscream,"Not Great, But Watchable!",5,4 November 2017,"This 1998 horror sequel stars Jennifer Tilly, Katherine Heigl, Nick Stabile, John Ritter and Brad Dourif. In this installment, we meet Chucky's girlfriend, Tiffany (Tilly) who is also a serial killer and she revives Chucky. Soon, Chucky makes her like him and plans to find an amulet that's buried with his corpse. They sneak a ride with 2 teen lovers, Jesse (Stabile) and Jade (Heigl) who plan to elope. Along the way, Chucky and Tiffany bring carnage and decide to get married too. The late, Ritter plays Jade's uncle, Warren who is a police chief and Dourif returns to voice Chucky. This isn't great, but watchable and Tilly and Dourif are the only good things about it in my opinion.",Bride of Chucky

Don Mancini's screenplay is hilarious, parodying both the series and the genre in general.

Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot!""Jesus, the music scene's gone to h3ll since I've been dead!"" ChuckyWe needed the levity, as the doll thing's getting old.

42,Captain_Couth,Films of Ronnie Yu: Chucky's back! This time with a bride.,8,31 July 2005,"Bride of Chucky (1998) marks the return of Chucky and the second Hollywood debut of Hong Kong film maker Ronnie Yu. Chucky is also back in form after a five year hiatus. Jennifer Tilly stars as the former girlfriend of Chucky (Brad Dourif). She wants to bring him back (via black magic) and keep him in check. But the revived Chucky isn't pleased with his ex-girlfriend's plans and decides to do something about it. Alexis Arquette, John Ritter and Katherine Heigel co-star as well.The real attraction of this film is the direction style of Ronnie Yu. If this was in the hands of some hack it would have been just like the first two sequels. But with his favorite cinematographer(Peter Pau) and editor (David Wu) in tow, Yu creates a visually appealing movie with a very modest budget. The movie will also appeal to horror fans (epspecially those of the first film). Ronnie Yu shows why he's one of the most underrated film makers in Hollywood today. We need to see the team of Pau, Wu and Yu in action. They make some of the most entertaining films when they're clicking on all cylinders.Highly recommended.",Bride of Chucky
43,kevin_robbins,I'd give this an 8/10 based on entertainment value,8,2 May 2021,"Bride of Chucky (1998) is another one in the series I recently watched off the Showtime App. The storyline focuses on Charles Lee Ray's girlfriend who wants to bring Chucky back to life to respark their original relationship. When she accomplishes her goal little does she know Chucky has his own idea on how they can be together forever. This movie is directed by Ronny Yu (Freddy vs Jason and The Bride with White Hair) and stars Jennifer Tilly (Bullets over Broadway), Katherine Heigl (Knocked Up), John Ritter (Sling Blade), Nick Stabile (The Beach Boys) and Alexis Arquette (Pulp Fiction). This movie is awesome and is probably my favorite Child's Play picture. The script is so fun and entertaining and so are all of the interactions, both by the dolls and people. The kill scenes are also very good, especially how they kill John Ritter (great first kill for the bride). I also thought the body in the box kill and moving the body scene was funny by Tilly. Overall I'd give this an 8/10 based on entertainment value.",Bride of Chucky

Using the same plot from the previous movies but adding another killer doll in the mix is the highlight of this lively silly sequel. This has good sharp funny dialogue and clever situations makes this enjoyable ride. Only around the end, where the movie actually falls flat and cold (Giving an homage to ""It's Alive"").DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD's extras are good, including two commentary tracks.

51,fertilecelluloid,"Chucky gets lucky, and so does the audience",7,17 February 2006,"I like it when one of my plastic friends gets lucky, especially if he gets lucky with a hottie doll voiced by Jennifer Tilly. ""Bride of Chucky"", from Ronny Yu, the director of ""The Bride With White Hair"", injects fresh blood into the series and, thanks to a sharp, black, hilarious script by Don Mancini, is immensely entertaining. Yu, who demonstrates a deep understanding of marital conflict amongst dolls, creates a moody, gory, audacious comedy-thriller that never lets up and never insults the franchise. Jennifer Tilly as deliciously wicked as the voice of Tiffany and Brad Dourif is delightfully vile and foul-mouthed as the voice of the killer in a doll's body. The talented Peter Pau, who shot Hong Kong classics such as ""A Fishy Story"" (see review) delivers stunning images that raise the bar for future entries. The much-discussed sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany is a ripper and has only been challenged once since by the marionette sex/scat sequence in the brilliant ""Team America"". The dolls are clearly making their mark, and not only does Chucky get lucky (bless his plastic heart!), but so does the audience. You can't beat that.",Bride of Chucky

Still, this movie is not at all good; it's essentially an excuse to watch pointlessly graphic and incredibly farfetched deaths play out on screen with a bit of meta-humor tossed in. For someone with a weird, slightly twisted sense of humor (like myself), I got enough enjoyment out of it to warrant my hour and a half spent watching it, but I can't say I'll ever go out of my way to recommend this movie.",Bride of Chucky
53,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An interesting way to start a new trilogy,6,31 August 2015,"Although he was late in the decade, the foul-mouthed serial killer Charles Lee Ray who transferred his soul into a ""Good Guy Doll"" still made a name for himself as a famous horror icon. After transferring his soul into the doll, Chucky (as he would later be addressed) gained quite a following for his disruptive antics and morbid enthusiasm. Upon his first appearance, Chucky had an imposing presence that made several viewers uncomfortable because of how creepy dolls are in general. However similar to other franchises, the scare factor and level of seriousness viewers began to accept was beginning to stretch too thin. By the time Child's Play 3 (1991) came out, fans and viewers a like became fed up with Chucky's goal of trying to transfer his soul into the body of Andy Barclay. For writer and creator Don Mancini, a small hiatus was in order after being pushed around to make sequel after sequel for his brainchild. A decade after the release of the original Child's Play (1988), Mancini returned and wrote for this feature that began Chucky's new trilogy.To some this was an improvement over Child's Play 3 (1991), while others were shocked the see the abrupt change. What Mancini had changed was the tone of the script. For the last three films Mancini wrote them as if they were literal; happening in the real world. The new intonation was that the story would be self aware in its execution but still continue from where the last film ended (roughly). An old lover of Charles named Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) acquires the shredded remains of Chucky (Brad Dourif) and resurrects him. After being brought back, Chucky decides in order to finally get out of his body, he needs the amulet he had from the time of Child's Play (1988) located in his casket where he was buried. Paralleling these events is troubled couple Jade (Katherine Heigl) and Jesse (Nick Stabile) who are constantly harassed by Jade's uncle Chief Warren Kincaid (John Ritter) for Jesse supposedly being a bad influence.As much as some viewers find the self-aware script jarringly different, having the series turn a comedic cheek to that of serious was a good move. Considering it became sillier as time went on, parodying it seems like an okay solution even with its flaws. For example the fact that it pays homage to its own films by clearly making a comment about it is funny for the fans to see. Even better, it references other horror icons directly and indirectly. It does bring up some clerical issues though. For example, other than Chucky how would another character know how Chucky killed people in the prior films? Also, is this now a universe where all the horror icons have been locked up or killed that their item that made them popular is now in storage? It doesn't make sense even if it is funny to see on screen. As for physical comedy, there are some ironic moments in the film involving Chucky's plastic body. Yet again, some bits are silly because of how physically impossible it works out.One other component to the writing that may make the plot feel predictable is because of how familiar viewers are with Chucky's nature. If you know how Chucky works, well then things may be more transparent than expected. The acting is adequate for what is asked though. Brad Dourif again succeeds at voicing his plastic counterpart with just the right amount of comedic and quotable lines. Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany matches Dourif's chemistry nicely by being just as foul-mouthed and violent. Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigl as the troubled couple feel authentic and end up demonstrating the power of teamwork later on. John Ritter as the annoying uncle plays his part like it should be too. There's even an appearance of Lawrence Dane from Darkman II: The Return of Durant (1995) playing a detective. Since this is a comedy now, there is no scare factor unless the viewer doesn't like stitched up Chucky. The violence though is just as bloody as were compared to its other sequels. The kill scenes just keep getting more and more inventive by the jigsaw doll.The cinematography shot by Peter Pau was decent too. Pau as director of photography has had more experience in the action genre and his skills are highlighted when the few action scenes in this feature show up. For every other frame, the scenes are well lit and conceal the illusion of the living dolls. Also an important side note; as time has gone on, Kevin Yagher's production of puppet effects designers / puppeteer coordinators has really gotten the knack for lifelike movement. The original Chucky was pretty convincing but now it looks great and perfected. The film score by returning composer Graeme Revell was unique. For this entry, Revell creates a new theme for Chucky and keeps some old ones from his score of Child's Play 2 (1990). He also has a theme for Chucky and Tiffany, which consists of solo guitar and chanting girl choir. The rest of his score has a mix of the classic horror cues and action related arpeggios. The soundtrack containing songs sung by Rob Zombie and others is an okay addition but not necessary per say. It does make it feel quite 90s.It still has its problems of unexplained loopholes, ridiculous concepts involving physical comedy and continuity errors but it's a nice self- twist. The self-aware referencing script, the violence, the musical score and acting help make it watchable fluff.",Bride of Chucky
54,Rob_Taylor,Good natured fun....in a sick and demented kind of way!,6,23 September 2003,"With a tag line like ""Chucky gets lucky"" you can expect a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and Bride... is certainly not a movie to be taken, or even attempt to be taken, in any way, shape or form, remotely seriously.Jokes and one-liners abound throughout the movie, and there are a number of visual gags that poke fun at other horror flicks (see the Pinhead scene, for example).The two dolls steal the entire film thoroughly and Brad Dourif (who has to rank as one of the world's most underrated bit-part actors) voices Chucky perfectly.If you like silly horror, then this one is a must-see. If, on the other hand, you think Scream is the height of the horror genre, I'd stay away. Though this movie has teens getting in trouble, they are almost completely unimportant next to watching to see what Chucky and his diminutive partner get up to.It's a real shame there aren't more of these kind of ""Don't take it seriously"" movies around. It's a sad reflection that the comedy horror genre, in recent years, has had to suffer the likes of ""Scary Movie"", which are, lets face it, completely crap. Hopefully, more films with real dark humour and not force-fed ""you must laugh at this"" crap will emerge in the near future. If not, then comedy horror is dead.One last thing to note about this movie.....the appearance of the late John Ritter. It's strange that it is often only after an actor has died that you begin to realise what a tremendous talent they were and how much they contributed to the industry over the years. RIP John.",Bride of Chucky
55,Sandcooler,"Gah, in-jokes",5,24 February 2008,"Horror comedies and why they barely ever work: the only funny thing about horror is how serious the people making it are being about it. Whenever you see a making-of to ""Wrong Turn 5: The Bloodening"" or whatever you always get the director having long rants about what exactly inspired him to make things so scary and what a great cast he could work with, ""hatless man in gas station"" played the role of his life, it has been such an experience etc. The audience then inevitably goes to the theater, TV said it was good, has a few laughs, and is able to walk out just happy enough. The filmmakers who are deliberately trying to make a bad movie are the worst of the bunch. Especially because ""Child's Play"" is one of the few horror milestones that is actually somewhat scary. When you see Chucky making the most awkward inside jokes outside of ""The Simpsons"" ever, you can't help but dying a little inside. He blatantly refers to Pinhead, says his story is so complicated it needs two or three sequels to do it justice, it just isn't that well written. The horror element is absent, it's only fun to see people get killed when it's played out like we actually should be scared. Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly do the best they can though,but the change in tone was most unwelcome.",Bride of Chucky
56,vengeance20,50/50,5,4 August 2018,"So with the series ending on a high note we get this less than mediocre sequel to the series.Bride of Chucky focuses more on the comedy side of the series & for all the wrong reasons too. The franchise takes place one month after the events of Child's Play 3, where Chucky's remains get stolen by a police officer who agrees to meet a woman named Tiffany, who agrees to give the officer who stole the evidence a hefty sum in exchange for the doll. But she kills the officer & then recites the voodoo chant, bringing Chucky back to life! But this time its not just Chucky whose stuck in a body, Tiffany does the same & gets her soul transferred to a dolls body, thereby the title you see, Bride of Chucky! Then as usual, like what Chucky did when he went solo, the 2 go off on a murderous rampage!The film was ok! But disappointing given the fact that the series from here (Except Curse of Chucky), began to take a stupid comedy turn! Comedy & Horror don't mix! Dark humour comes with the horror if you're hardcore fan, but haha sort of comedy simply doesn't work here. Death scenes which are unintentionally funny work, like with the previous 3 films, while films like this in general that are purposely designed & intended for laughs, try too hard & end up falling flat! The films deaths weren't all that bad, but compared to the previous films, they didn't have the same dark twisted humour. The deaths then were pretty decent (especially in 2 & 3). But here they seemed too comedy laced, unlike the others which were just pure, dark deaths! While here they were deaths, but more on a comical side with humour laced in. The story-line was on the dumb side & didn't follow the formula of the first 3 films. Child's Play is about a killer who transfers his soul into a doll so he can start a new life but re-transferring his soul from the doll to a child's body, simple. But since Child's Play 3 & beyond this film, that story-line seems lost & forgotten! But this film overall was a combination of both good & bad! 5/10",Bride of Chucky

58,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Bride of Chucky""- Chucky goes postmodern in a genuinely hilarious and well-made self-parody.",9,20 January 2017,"After pretty definitely dying off in the early 90's due to audience apathy and a string of borderline-flops, the slasher-film genre was revitalized thanks to master director Wes Craven's wonderful and subversive self-aware 1996 horror-comedy ""Scream."" Realizing that slasher horror could be ""hip"" and ""cool"" again with the postmodern twist that ""Scream"" added to spice-up its storyline, it quickly became in-vogue for studios and filmmakers to add a self-satirical meta angle to many new horror features released in its wake. And one of the most successful films to implement this new leaning towards comedy was certainly 1998's delightful and twisted ""Bride of Chucky""- the fourth film in the popular cult-series ""Child's Play.""Directed by the fantastic Ronny Yu from a script by ""Child's Play"" series creator Don Mancini, ""Bride of Chucky"" might just be the best film of the entire franchise. After the somewhat disastrous third entry made seven years prior, the series sort-of imploded and there was a time where there was doubt we'd ever even see Chucky on the big screen again. Thankfully, the wait was worth it. ""Bride of Chucky"" is fantastically entertaining, and the newfound self-aware humor adds a lot to the film. By that time, audiences had wised up to the formula of the series and another bland retread would have fallen flat. By giving us such a radical and humorous departure, Mancini and Yu injected some much-need fresh blood into the ""Chucky"" experience. It was hilarious. It was unexpected. And it was exactly what Chucky needed at the time to win back audiences who had grown tired of his old antics by the time the third film had rolled out.Jennifer Tilly stars as Tiffany, the former lover of the infamous ""Lakeshore Strangler"" Charles Lee Ray- who had transferred his soul into a children's doll known as Chucky. (Voiced by Brad Dourif) Longing to be reunited with her lost love, she manages to get her hands on the mangled corpse of Chucky and re-assembles him, bringing him back to life with a copy of ""Voodoo for Dummies."" While their reunion goes well at first, Tiffany finds herself crestfallen when she learns that Chucky never intended to marry her, and she betrays him by locking him in a playpen. Escaping, Chucky murders his former flame and transfers her soul into a female doll in a twisted bid for vengeance. Now, the angry couple must figure out a way to get their souls into new human hosts once and for all... and they have their eyes set on Tiffany's trailer-park neighbor Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his girlfriend Jade. (A pre-fame Katherine Heigl)The fun of the film really lays in the shockingly sweet (in a twisted way) romance of Chucky and Tiffany. It's almost a demented parody of romantic comedies, and they have absolutely remarkable chemistry together. Dourif as always is a blast as Chucky, and it's a ton of fun seeing him saddled with a romantic interest in Tilly's Tiffany, as they repeatedly get on each-other's nerves, but also do have some genuinely cute moments together. It adds a lot of flavor and character to the proceedings seeing them bonding over butchering innocent victims. Stabile and Heigl are also a lot of fun as our somewhat hapless protagonists (who find themselves blamed for the murders committed by the demonic dolls), and there's also a really fun supporting performance by the late and great John Ritter as Jade's strict police-chief uncle who raised her in an oppressive environment. The cast is just a blast.Mancini's script is tight, concise and never fails do deliver laughs with each scene. He also throws in the occasional shock and scare to keep horror fans happy. I've always admired how daring Mancini is with his characters, and he's never afraid to take a risk with the material, whether it works (as it does here) or not. (""Seed of Chucky"" being a good example of him going a bit too far.) Ronny Yu is a really great visual artist, and his completely insane sensibilities perfectly compliment the material, as he relishes in delivering gags and gore by the boat-load. I also really admired the musical score by the talented composer Graeme Revell, who had previously delivered a Gothic and operatic score in the series' second installment. Revell's music this time around is a bit more subdued, but works perfectly for the devilish romance between our murderous leads, and I think it's among his best work.There's really not much I can say to the detriment of ""Bride of Chucky"", besides some minor nitpicks I had with a few of the scares and kills. It's just a fun, entertaining and often strangely adorable film, and I think it still stands tall as one of the best of the series. It might not have been the film that fans were expecting when they found out Chucky was coming back for a fourth installment... but it was the film the series needed at the time to reinvigorate audience interest and evolve as a legitimate franchise.As a horror fan, I have to give ""Bride of Chucky"" a near-perfect 9 out of 10.",Bride of Chucky
59,Howlin Wolf,It sure is different to part 3... it's also just as bad. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS),1,15 January 2002,"Feeling that the ""Childs Play"" series had garnered itself a little too much adverse publicity since its inception, the makers of this one decided to change tack and approach the material with an almost exclusive comedy angle. Sure, it still has gore; but as far as I'm concerned, you CAN have a comedy that's gory. Maybe that's a worrying indication of exactly WHAT makes me laugh. Not to worry, though because nary a titter was to be raised from me whilst watching ""Bride of Chucky"". It's more one long giant in-joke than a film, and the joke sucks. Did we really need the series to get any sillier than it already was? I don't think so. It's honestly as if the makers got bored of doing horror and decided that they wanted to make an X rated episode of ""The Simpsons"" instead, only without ANY of the originality...A pal and I had rented this to veg out in front of with a few beers. In those circumstances, you WANT to like a film; but try as I might, I couldn't and still can't muster up any good feeling toward this.So it's a parody of sorts. Isn't a walking, talking and killing cherubic doll parody enough? Obviously not. The people behind this can't even stick to lampooning their own created universe, they've got to impinge on ones imagined by others as well. The snide reference to Freddy/Michael/Jason et al at the beginning only serves to illustrate how out of its league this film is. Comparing this film to any of them (Even ""Friday the Thirteenth Part 26: Jason Buys a Golfing Umbrella to Protect Him from a Shower of Nubile Teen Blood"" - coming to a cinema near you soon kids!) in a favourable light is surely asking to be laughed out onto the streets.The kids in the movie are just 'cool'. They can't be bothered to be witty (Musn't be seen to upstage the plastic props, must we?) As far as I can remember, not one of them displays a smidgen of talent between them. Don't fret, however, this even extends to the adults too. It's almost as bad as the lead character in part 3 (Justin, was he called?) But not quite.Thus, we are left to rely on the 'mutant Ken and Barbie' for our yucks. To be fair, it is neither the fault of Dourif or Tilly that things are this bad, but there is only so much they can do in such a haphazard production. Tilly even acquits herself quite well, enough to suggest that she is right for the part, and that the concept itself may have worked better in different hands. She deserved (and got) another shot at the role. Unfortunately, this necessitates a sequel. If it's as bad as this one, it may just be the last film I ever watch. Suicide being more preferable. It MUST be cackhanded treatment of the possible material by Yu and the writers; because as I said, Tilly is great. There is even ONE good moment (count it!) By the time we reach the ending though - 'Tiffany' the doll' going through the agonies of childbirth - I'd had about all I could take of such abject stupidness and blatant non-acting by most of the cast, doll pair excepted.The ""Childs Play"" series was tootling along fine until the needless aberrations that were parts 3 & 4. On the evidence of the latter, it can only get worse. Leave it alone now, eh? I would've said different, had this one actually been any good; but it wasn't, not by a long chalk. ... and don't even get me started on the dolls having sex...(EDIT: On 28th of June 2006 I got to see ""Seed of Chucky""... As expected, it makes the same mis-steps as its predecessor. There is no reason to recommend it if you find yourself agreeing with my dislike of this, because its problems are only exaggerated to worse effect. The distinguishing feature between the two is that what passes for 'satire' isn't even consistent anymore after the six-year wait... I took a raincheck on the idea of offing myself, but neither foray into the realm of send-ups is worth the time, by my estimation.)",Bride of Chucky

This is a fun flick to have seen, but I doubt if I'll ever try it again.Jennifer Tilly is always a joy to watch (though Brad Dourif, John Ritter and Katherine Heigl deserve a mention as well). The dolls were quite entertaining as well. The movie references to 'Bride of Frankenstein' and 'Hellraiser' were pretty funny. The scene with the mirror above the bed may or may not have inspired a similar scene in 'Un long dimanche fiancailles' (2004)... they're based on the same idea, in any case.All in all, just about doable. 6 out of 10.

62,gedikreverdi,I've just rewatched this after many years and it's still pure joy,8,26 August 2021,"Child's Play can be my favorite slasher franchise after Scream and Urban Legends and I'm not even so into horror movies with dollsbut there's something charming about this good guy. Tiffany should have had her own franchise as a human being. She's a romantic, gothic serial killer who lived in a trailer park. She's both naive and homicidal. She revived Chucky with the help of Voodoo for Dummies book because she was in love with Charles lee ray before he got killed in the toy store by the police. She had him kill his Marilyn Manson doppelgänger boyfriend and Chucky mocked her after hearing she wanted to marry him. Chucky killed her and revived her in the doll she bought for him. Tiffany made the next door guy Jesse take the two to the cemetery where Charles was buried. Jesse hit the road with jade who's living with his police officer uncle. The dolls killed the officer by turning him into Pinhead. They killed another officer and people were thinking the couple was murdering people. They got married (she's not 18 yet but who cares?) and stayed in a motel. The dolls killed the other couple on their water bed and it was so iconic. Their gay best friends came over and saw the dead body of the officer in the RV and got hit by a truck on the highway. The dolls took them to the cemetery. Someone had already been digging up the body and I didn't understand who that was but Chucky took the necklace from the rat infested corpse (cheesy and so good I know) and the dolls fought like most married couples (and Tiffany was charred because jade put her in the oven in the RV). They threw Chucky down in the open grave and the couple left. The officer who came over saw Tiffany give birth and the child attacked him right after he was born.",Bride of Chucky
63,DunnDeeDaGreat,The return of Chucky,8,2 September 2002,Bride of Chucky is a proper return to the oringial Chucky we all know and love. Don Mancini script is sharp and funny and the direction by Ronny Yu is equal to his Jap films. The film is a vast imporvement of Childs Play 3 and I can't wait for Seed Of Chucky.,Bride of Chucky
64,IonicBreezeMachine,Child's Play and Chucky are updated for the post Scream 90s to mostly successful effect.,6,20 October 2021,"After Chucky's (Brad Dourif), his remains are acquired by his former girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) who uses Voodoo to once again bring him back with the intention of marrying him, when Chucky derisively laughs off the idea, Tiffany angrily puts him in a cage with only a talking bridal doll for company. When Chucky escapes he kills Tiffany and places her soul inside the bridal doll out of spite but does tell her of an amulet that the two can use to transfer their souls into new vessels buried with Chucky's human corpse in Hackensack, New Jersey. In order to get to Hackensack, through a series of phone calls Tiffany enlists the help of her teenage neighbor, Jesse (Nick Stabile), by promising him $1,000 to deliver two dolls to the cemetery in Hackensack which the impoverished youth immediately jumps with $500 advance, and uses this as an opportunity to elope with his girlfriend, Jade (Katherine Heigl). With many people trying to stop Jade and Jesse's attempts at running off together, Chucky and Tiffany are forced to start up the murder spree yet again resulting in Jesse and Jade at the center of an interstate manhunt for them as spree killers with both Jesse and Jade assuming it's the other.Following the financial disappointment of Child's Play 3, as well as writer creator Don Mancini's creative burnout with the series, the Child's Play series was put in hibernation. The success of the mid 90s slasher films such as Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer prompted renewed interest in the series with Producer David Kirschner and writer Mancini playing up the humor, which had always been present in the series, to a level of self-referential parody and creating Tiffany as a foil for Chucky and an on the nose homage to Bride of Frankenstein. While taking an established franchise and playing up its camp factor is a risky move, for the most part Bride of Chucky pulls it off pretty well.When Bride of Chucky begins, it sets itself off on the right foot with both a recap via newspaper clippings of the series up to this point as well as some fun if rather obvious easter eggs in the police evidence locker where Chucky's remains are stored referencing other horror franchises. This opening pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the movie, where the series while still bloody and darkly comic is no longer actively trying to be scary and has instead transitioned to black comedy. The cinematography is also very evocative of Mark Irwin's work on Wes Craven's Scream emphasizing dark blue-ish night scenes and very polished day scenes and for the film's more comedic leanings it works well to its advantage. The doll effects are done once again by effects artist Kevin Yagher who's work is smoother and more convincing than ever with not one but two impressive effects with both Chucky and Tiffany feeling like tangible presences in the film.Jennifer Tilly is a fun addition to the series being both sexually appealing in the opening scenes where she's still human, subtlety threatening to emphasize the horror aspects, and of course exhibiting strong comic sensibilities and timing with her deadpan delivery serving as a good foil against Brad Dourif's established Chucky persona. Both Dourif and Tilly are great in their exchanges almost coming off as a demented dysfunctional couple. Both Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigl have good chemistry as the leads and their obliviousness to the killer dolls and their suspicion of each other leads to some really strong comic set pieces especially ones involving their mutually gay best friend David played by Gordon Michael Woolvett (who's much more subtle than most 90s versions) such as where both of them call at once to confide in them their suspicions of each other. On occasion Ronny Yu's direction can be a bit over stylized for my taste when it comes to this kind of movie (not surprising as he's typically an action director), but for the most part save for some dodgy CGI work that hasn't stood the test of time, Yu does reasonably well conveying the twisted comedy of the situation. While not every joke lands, just enough do and with a brisk running time it never lingers to long on any set piece.Bride of Chucky while taking a bold risk abandoning it's horror trappings, does so mostly successfully thanks to some strong performances and a twisted sense of humor. Dourif and Tilly are fun as the titular killer dolls and Stabile and Heigl make likable sympathetic protagonists and the film is solid enough to justify it's sillier direction.",Bride of Chucky
65,mattymatt4ever,"Please, please don't take this movie seriously!",7,13 January 2003,"As long as you don't, you should have tons of fun.  I haven't seen any of the previous Chucky films, but I know the basic gist of the original (a serial killer inhabits a doll) and didn't feel in any way lost.  First off, I must say any movie that plays ""Living Dead Girl"" by Rob Zombie in the opening credits is in my cool book.  You couldn't have picked a better song to open the film.  I made a student film in which I edited an opening montage set to Rob Zombie's ""Superbeast"" and that was the only part of the movie I was proud of.  The movie is packed with dark, tongue-in-cheek humor.  One thing you can't accuse this movie of is not being original.  Name another movie with a doll-on-doll sex scene!  The scene contains my favorite line in the movie. Chucky's bride asks him, ""Do you have a rubber?""  Chucky responds, ""I'm ALL rubber!""  Classic!  Absolutely classic!Jennifer Tilly has never looked sexier, and is incredibly seductive in the first 30-or-so minutes in which she is still human.  John Ritter has a totally offbeat role that made me laugh with delight. 
""Bride of Chucky"" probably won't scare you, but it never ceases to entertain and made me laugh throughout.  My score:  7 (out of 10)",Bride of Chucky
66,hnt_dnl,Give me the serious Child's Play movies,1,7 November 2021,"The first 3 Child's Play movies have a LOT of flaws, but overall, they all have something going for them that make them watchable. While I'm not averse to campy, I honestly don't like my horror being campy, thus why I'm not a fan of a movie like Friday the 13th Part 6 with all it's overly campy vibe and cheesy acting that completely takes me out of the story. I prefer the more serious Friday the 13th movies, low budget and all. I also think that the more gritty, low-budget 80s movies have a charm and re-watchability that the more clean and shiny 90s fail to pull off. The 90s have a lot of great movies, but many of them are of the A-list variety. The best low budget B movies exist in the 80s, thus why so many low-budget 80s horror slashers are still watchable today. But 90s horror had to go the route of homage/parody starting with Scream in '96 to be remotely watchable. And sometimes homages veer into being just ripoffs while parodies come across as ridiculous. People use the ""It's meant to be campy"" excuse way too much to explain away bad movies, whether the camp is intentional or not. And BRIDE OF CHUCKY is both intentionally campy AND a bad movie.It's odd to me how the bad acting in Bride of Chucky can be different from the bad acting in the original 3 Child's Play movies. For some reason, I prefer the genuine writing and earnest acting, however poor, from Child's Play 1-3, perhaps because those movies were made in the 80s (actually 3 came out in 1990, still a carryover from the late 80s) and like I said, a lot of 80s movies hold up to re-watchability. But Bride of Chucky is a late 90s horror and even though Scream revived the genre in '96 through homage, it was also a good movie. I don't think films ought to get a pass just because they came out during a revival period of horror. And Bride of Chucky is pretty terrible, despite the late 90s slasher revival.The dialogue and line delivery by the human characters in this movie is horrific I couldn't stop groaning in agony! Lol The characters were so forgettable that I literally forgot that the guy who lived in the trailer next to Tiffany was shown earlier in the movie and thought he was a new character. And I get it. It's CAMP, but that still doesn't mean it's actually good camp. Jennifer Tilly, who is not much of an actress at all, didn't become remotely interesting until her character was killed and transferred to the soul of the doll. That creaky, annoying voice is way more palatable coming out of the mouth of an inanimate object, although Tilly's acting could certainly be called lifeless. Believe it or not, there are actually a couple of EMMY winning actors in this in John Ritter and Katherine Heigl, but let's face it, neither of them were exactly A-listers at the time as Ritter was well past his 80s prime and Heigl was in pre-Grey's Anatomy/full of herself mode. Also, the look of this movie is so 90s clean and generic, while the earlier movies in the franchise had that gritty 80s quality that make look and feel more realistic, like there was real suspense and scares with the doll. I understand why people would laugh at the antics of Chucky and Tiffany, but why anyone would remotely want to watch the atrocious acting by the human characters is beyond me. I'm no film snob and I like many a low-budget flick with B-listers, but Bride of Chucky is most definitely not for me.",Bride of Chucky

71,ivo-cobra8,horrible movie a terrible sequel and a really sh**** awful movie,2,19 August 2017,"*SPOILERS* I don't like this movie Bride of Chucky is really bad awful movie I laughed my ass off. This movie wasn't scary, the acting from Jennifer Tilly specially her voice was terrible and this movie lost my respect for Chucky after that I quit with this series just because of this movie. Do I think this is the worst Chucky movie? Hell no, Seed of Chucky is the worst one. This is a terrible movie in my opinion I don't care about romance.There are not likable characters Katherine Heigl was the worst at acting and she wasn't likable hero. There are not likable characters. I don't like John Ritter's character how he treated his niece Jade and her boyfriend I didn't like the cops in this movie. I hated that cop treating those kids like s*** I am glad he blow up.There is not much to say from me, I don't like this movie Katherine Heigl you sucked in Under Siege 2: Dark Territory and you sucked in Gray's Anatomy so please retire already!!! I did not care about any of the characters or the deaths. Puppeteer design for Chucky was terrible it just wasn't a Chucky from the first three films. To me it comes more a dark comedy than a horror movie. I wanted this to be scary and it wasn't it failed at been a good horror movie in my opinion. I didn't care about Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigl for blaming each other for the murders. They are unlikable heroes and I hate them ugh.And this movie is better than Child's Play 3? Are you f***** kidding me?! This movie is far worst I am taking Child's Play 2 anytime over this stupid movie! I would rather watch Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives than this stupid movie! I would take A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master any time than this movie! I am taking every Friday the 13th and every A Nightmare on Elm Street movie over peace a crap.Director Ronny Yu I don't think or agree he did a bad job directing he didn't and it wasn't his fault that this movie was a failure it was Don Mancini's fault!. I enjoyed to death Freddy Vs. Jason that movie was MILES better than this I will rather watch that movie.The only think I did like was the end that was set on the graveyard I thought it was a great atmosphere I am glad director decide to make it dark. I liked the ending that Chucky and Tiffany fought and Chucky murdered Tiffany but Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigl throw Chucky in his grave and Katherine shoots his ass. Then on the end when Tiffany makes a birth and the child attacks the detective that was scary that is why I give 2 this movie just for that scary scene.The rest of the cast sucks a dick Jennifer Tilly and Brad Dourif where awful in this movie I hate the sex scene between those two stupid dolls!!! I hate this movie I don't want to watch ever again it I don't want to have it in my collection. I hate this film! Child's Play 3 is superior in every way. Nothing of any importance happens in Bride. The second Chucky killed Tiffany with the tub death, and didn't track down Andy immediately after...I lost interest. It's out of character to seek out some amulet that never existed until now ""because"". Just a bunch of schlock.Another thing this movie has plot holes and the script makes no sense and is s****! This is a peace of s*** movie. There is no way that Jennifer Tilly could have sewn Chucky back together when he got shredded to literally a million pieces in Child's Play 3. But really, the main problem I have is the amulet thing. He wasn't wearing it at the beginning of Child's Play , and he questioned John (his teacher) about how he can get out of the good guy doll body. Why would he have to ask him? Chucky would've known about the amulet by that point if he really was wearing it at the very beginning of the movie. And he would have needed it if he was going to transfer his soul into Andy.-E 2/10 this movie can f*** him self!",Bride of Chucky
72,fernandoschiavi,The trash horror leaves the scene and starts to give way to a comedy with horror elements... This is not good news to one of the greatest icons of horror,4,10 July 2021,"After the great stumbles and mishaps that occurred in Child's Play 3, the screenwriter and creator Don Mancini realized that it was a necessary and propitious time for the franchise to rest. We were, thus, a long time without seeing the killer puppet starring in another feature on the big screen. The screenwriter realized that there had to be a change in the story of the assassin doll, a change that would at least make the audience curious to see him in movie theaters. Something that caught the eye. In 1998, this man had created a script continuing the trajectory of the Good Guy doll, but this script had some ingredients that it didn't have in the other films in the franchise. Chucky would gain a new face, the public was already used to seeing the doll with its perfect face and typical of a simple innocent toy, the new change would certainly be a great impact to all fans. However, Chucky returns here with a new proposal, in a new guise and, above all, he does not return alone.The third film in the series no longer managed to scare like before. With that, the character was forgotten for years, until Don Macini decided to reinvent and bring Chucky back in ""Bride of Chucky"". The first and most obvious thing done was to assume the role that the doll had assumed in front of the audience and, for that, Andy had to be left aside. If up until the second film in the series there was still a more serious commitment to horror, this is lost in Bride of Chucky. The trash horror leaves the scene and starts to give way to a comedy with horror elements. There's killing, there's carnage, but none of that necessarily retains a concept of built-in terror. The bizarreness in Bride of Chucky is much more inscribed in the realm of comedy than anything else. Precisely for walking in this direction, the film introduces us to a romantic scene between rubber puppets and the intolerable scene in the final minutes.Unlike the first three films in the series, Bride of Chucky takes a remarkably humorous turn and in several of its scenes it is suggested that the production is a self-referential parody; the film does not continue with the concept of a child hunted for possession of the puppet, although the story still focuses primarily on Chucky. The first scenes of the film are set in a typical police space to store evidence of crimes. Right now, it is possible to see the directions that would be taken in the films that would follow. In the Evidence room, it is possible to identify well-known objects, such as Freddy's glove and Jason's mask, both famous icons of horror. The script also wastes no time in introducing the lead couple, containing an impressive dynamism without anything being run over until the journey begins around 40 minutes into the film. The motivation for the trip is the main one of the inconsistencies in relation to established mythology. The amulet thing might have been unattainable by Chucky in the past and Andy would have been more viable, but never having been mentioned is not acceptable. Also because in the first movie Chuck clearly didn't know a way to get out of the doll's body, so it didn't seem like he knew the amulet's usefulness.Never, in any movie, did Chucky need an amulet to try to transfer his soul to Andy (parts 1 and 2) and Tyler (part 3), and if Charles needed that amulet all along... Because he never went after it in Previous movies?... The truth is that Mancini had to give a goal for the puppets to act. Chucky making Tiff become a doll and the two of them go out killing trying to get the body of a couple is not a very good story, as we've seen it in previous movies. The film focuses on the route that Chucky and Tiff take to reach the cemetery where Chucky's remains are.In this part, Jade and Jesse are the puppets' targets. With the relationship disapproved by Jade's uncle, the two decide to run away. Tiffany hatches a plan where she gives Jesse 500 dollars to take the dolls to the cemetery and another 500 dollars when they reach their destination, so Jade and Jesse leave in the boy's van towards New Jesey. During the stops, Tiff and Chucky reverse in the kill. Yes, they are creative and interesting. One involves a strong reference to Pinhead, the villain of the 'Hellraiser' franchise. As the body count grows. Jade and Jesse become the main suspects of the massacres... And of course, not knowing who commits the murders, Jade distrusts Jesse and vice versa. In addition to the relationship between the romantic couple, we have a romantic relationship between the psychopathic dolls. After a double homicide involving a bottle and glass on the roof of a motel. Chucky asks Tiff to marry him, she accepts and together they have a beautiful and romantic night together in one of the most bizarre and embarrassing scenes in cinema.To direct this film, which was inspired by a Universal classic, the studio turned to director Ronny Yu, who in his native Hong Kong had directed Ye ban ge sheng (1995), which in turn is a love story inspired by The Phantom of the Opera (1943), another Universal classic. Yu moved to the US to launch his career, his first film in Hollywood was Warriors of Virtue (1997), a film that divides opinions and which few people know nowadays. Ronny Yu did well in resurrecting horror characters from the 80s, like Chucky in this movie, Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees in Freddy Vs. Jason (2003), Yu's career didn't take off after this one.If you stop to think about it, Bride of Chucky follows a romantic comedy structure: it's that old story of the couple who find themselves after years apart (he was dead), when they meet she's in a relationship with a guy who doesn't. He doesn't even like it (Damien), he just uses it to make the other suitor jealous. At first the couple hate each other, but they are forced to spend a long time together, united by some common goal (going to a cemetery in another city to dig up a grave and get an amulet), and as the film progresses they discover they have the same interests, realizing that they love each other. Added to that is the ""misunderstanding"" (a series of murders happen, Jesse suspects Jade and vice versa, and neither of them knows that the dolls they carry to and fro are alive and they are the ones who committed the murders). While the characters in the movie don't know what's really going on, the viewer knows everything.The development of the film is not a total waste, due to the relationship between the two human protagonists and their constant mistrust, but it ends up being a mere detail in the midst of a sea of bizarreness. In the end, everything is thrown away and the script hastily reaches its climax, conveniently on top of Chucky's grave. Here the film tries to take itself seriously and fails. Since childbirth doesn't even make sense because of time or anatomy, you can choose. Even the cop letting the two suspects go just because he saw Chucky alive. The shovel fight between Chucky and Tiffany is also forced. Chucky's quick sentence before his quick death, despite being a bit forced due to playing with the viewer's intelligence, makes even clearer the creator's intention to turn the franchise into nothing more than a sequence of films in which Chucky will always return with the same bloodlust.With this, the film makes its intention clear, starts very well with its proposal and goes down the level until the end, which seems to have been made based on the following thought: ""We can do whatever we want, if Chucky keeps killing, the guys will like it! "". But it's not like that, it was the perfect opportunity to make an assumed trash, shameless and with quality. However, unfortunately, it remained an average film, with numerous flaws. The humor (often flawed) far surpasses the trashy horror, we practically don't have any more suspense. There are those who like the new directions of the franchise and there are those who do not believe in the directions that the franchise had taken.",Bride of Chucky
73,TheNorthernMonkee,superb horror comedy with some memorable lines,7,21 October 2004,"SPOILERSIt feels like a distant memory since the original ""Child's Play"" movie was banned way back in 1988. The film and it's sequel, both banned for being encouraging to children to kill, were good films. It was this forth of the series ten years later that would really make the series however. Whilst never scary, ""Bride of Chucky"" was superb in that it was a wonderful mix of comedy and horror with an extra large chunk of gore.Set a while after the third film, ""Bride of Chucky"" focuses primarily on the relationship between Chucky (Brad Dourif) and his girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly). Convinced that Chucky planned to propose, Tiffany resurrects him, only for him to then deny her belief and to kill her. Bringing her back in a doll of her own, Chucky then works with his girlfriend to possess an amulet which will allow them to take the bodies of young lovers Jesse (Nick Stabile) and Jade (Katherine Heigl).The brilliance of ""Bride of Chucky"" is that it never takes itself seriously. Like so many other horror films in recent years, this film is devoted to the idea that deaths should be as gruesome, inventive and frequent as possible. Irrelevant of whether the plot is decent (a rare plus side for the Child's Play series), the essence of this film is simply to kill off countless members of the cast in extreme, sudden (if possible) ways.Acting wise, before becoming the doll, Tilly is superb as human Tiffany, in love with Chucky and feeling trapped dating the irritating Damien Baylock (Alexis Arquette). The acting though, Tilly included, feels slightly irrelevant when Chucky is around.All in all, there's relatively little which can be said about a film like this. With acting an irrelevancy (the only characters of any importance being puppets) and a script which is better than expected, the only real thing to focus in on is the gore and the horror. Whilst not in the slightest amount scary, ""Bride of Chucky"" does satisfy on the other count. This film features some superb moments of violence and some equally wonderful lines (a brief tribute to Pinhead from ""Hellraiser"" being one of many) and ultimately it's just good fun. It's the ultimate film to watch on a Friday night. Simple, easy going, fun.",Bride of Chucky
74,FilmOtaku,"Stupid, but not hard to watch",2,26 August 2003,"There wasn't a lot to like about this film, but I do have to say that not only were it's production values not too shabby, but it was actually not difficult to watch because the film didn't take itself seriously.  The goofy comments were stupid, but were made with tongue firmly in cheek, and the ending was completely lame, but again I suspect that the writers and filmmakers were completely aware of it.Besides, I can't fault Brad Dourif, and it had a killer Rob Zombie opening song.  As an added bonus, we get to see Jack Tripper get his due.  So while it was hardly even a C grade film, it wasn't completely painful to view.

75,AngelHonesty,A Wild Ride,7,20 January 2020,"This film is packed full of dark comedy making it a fun movie to watch. Out of all the chucky movies this one is my favorite! By adding in Tiffany it presented a whole new element of humor, and greater depth into Chucky's character. It was fun seeing familiar actors on the show, such as Katherine Heigl, Gordon Woolvett, John Ritter and Jennifer Tilly. The animatronics for the dolls was beyond superb; making it very real and fascinating to watch. The filming was very creative and clear in its display.",Bride of Chucky

77,deatman9,Very silly movie,5,26 October 2012,They are back with yet another film to add to the killer doll franchise Chucky. This one has got to be one of the silliest and thats saying a lot seeing how they have always been silly. The adding of jennifer Tilly does no good either seeing how she is terrible.Chucky is back once again and this time he discovers a perfect mate to kill and add to another doll. This doll he plans on being his bride and partner in crime.This movie is not very good. It is really not scary in the slightest and its just so silly at some points it nearly has you laughing although im pretty sure its intent is to scare you so Im baffled,Bride of Chucky
78,DarthVoorhees,"""You got your wish, you're mine now doll!""",8,3 December 2008,"Bride of Chucky is my ultimate guilty pleasure, the movie is in essence pretty stupid but I feel like I'm watching a comedian with so much energy that we don't necessarily care if he hits all the targets. Really though a comedy was the right place to take the never dying Chucky because the situation was all ready pretty comical to begin with. Child's Play could be considered one of the blackest comedies ever made. The humor there was dry and mixed with horror. Bride of Chucky knows what it is and is willing to indulge into self-parody and for that I most give it tremendous credit.Brad Dourif reprises his role as Chucky who is stitched up and brought back to life by his sadomasochist trailer trash love Tiffany. Tiffany wants a traditional marriage and think Chucky is the one for her despite his maniacal tendencies. We are led to think that her attraction to Chucky is largely based on sex and sex alone. The night Charles Lee Ray was gunned down he left a ring on the mantle. Tiffany finds it and thinks it is a proposal of marriage and spends the next ten years searching for the remains of the Good Guy. Chucky tells her the truth that she was ""****ing nuts"" Heartbroken Tiffany traps Chucky in a playpen and plans a grand revenge scheme for him by ridiculing him for being a doll. She gives him a ""present"" a bride his own size but Chucky is one step ahead of her and turns her into his ""bride"" I don't think anyone genuinely likes Chucky as a character but we love the scenario of a doll being possessed by vulgar sociopath. I was hard on Seed of Chucky because the humor didn't work but I like Bride of Chucky for the Tiffany character. She is a lot of fun and it makes Chucky all the more palatable. Child's Play was a film that worked because it created fear and because Chucky wasn't the central character of the story. Child's Play 2 and 3 were terrible movies because Chucky got the most screen time. Bride of Chucky realizes the scenario all though interesting is ridiculous and because it realizes this it is able to take more risk. Really though maybe Chucky needed a bride to vent all that homicidal rage. The interaction between the two playmates is the highlight of the film because their views of the world and marriage are so deranged and twisted that it makes for fine dark humor. Tiffany walks in with a plate of cookies that you all most think it is a 50's show where the loyal wife is at the husband's needs after a hard day's work. The highlight of the film is when Chucky and Tiffany are making love in doll form, I don't care what you think that scene was risky and hilarious.Don Mancini is not a comedian and he doesn't know what the movie going public will find funny. There are a few moments in Bride of Chucky were you look at the screen and wonder to yourself whether or not a joke was just told. I am forgiving to this however because Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly breath so much energy into their performances.The film is less interesting when our teens take center stage. With the iconic characters we don't care who they terrorize we just care that they get out and cause chaos. Mancini took the Drive-In book of horror clichés to create these side characters which includes an offensive homosexual stereotype written by an openly gay man.Bride of Chucky isn't a good film in the traditional meaning of the world but it is a hell of a good time for the horror fan who wants a good laugh. The little guy should have hung up his knife after this outing but his prophetic declaration applies to all horror villains.""Go ahead I'll be back, I all ways come back... but dying is such a B***h!""",Bride of Chucky
79,acidburn-10,The bride is a refreshing boost to the franchise,8,21 March 2009,"Chucky is brought back to life by his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Played wonderfully by Jennifer Tilly), but as we all know Chucky can't behave himself for long and winds up killing her and transfers her soul into another doll, so now Chucky has got a playmate. In order to get themselves back into human bodies they hitch a ride with 2 teenage lovers on the run to New Jersey where Chucky's human body is buried with the amulet that can posses they're souls into the 2 teenagers, and plus causing mayhem and carnage on the way.Chucky is back with finally a worthy sequel, after the disappointing part 3, ""Bride Of Chucky"" breathes new life into a franchise that was basically dead and heading into a whole new direction by giving Chucky a partner in crime Tiffany who is a well welcomed addition to the series.The death scenes are much more gorier and inventive this time round, even though it doesn't have the suspense the first one had, it's still the best one in the series, mixing slasher with humour especially the bantering between the 2 dolls and especially the sex scene which was hilarious.Jennifer Tilly is the star of this movie, playing yet another sex pot role with her human self and her doll self which was fantastic a welcome addition to the franchise Brad Dourif's Chucky voice will delight ""Good Guy"" fans again. Katherine Heigl (Jade) gives a very solid show Nick Stabile (Jessee) also does good, his chemistry with Heigl works and the ladies will dig his six pack and John Ritter (Warren) plays an evil ""Jack Tripper"" and dies a great death.All in all this film truly boosts the franchise It's witty, violent and looks great.",Bride of Chucky
80,Darkside-Reviewer,"""What would Martha Stewart say?""",6,28 October 2019,Bride of Chucky was the start of the Chucky movies becoming more horror comedy's than actual horror movies and was released 7 years after Childs Play 3 in 1998 after movies like Scream had created a new horror movie craze of comedy horror and introduced new slasher movie tropes that dominated horror movies in the late 90s and early 2000s Chucky joined in the craze by becoming more a parody of himself and getting a bride named Tiffany who is also a killer doll the two share their love of knifes death and of course Tiffanys idol Martha Stewart.The previous movies are acknowledged in this sequel but are only referenced during the opening credits as the series from this point onward creates new rules a background for Chucky that includes his Bride so now the storyline follows Chucky and Tiffany trying to find a way out of there doll bodys and into human ones without the pesky rules of the original trilogy.The blood and body count are still high just with more one liners and silly gags included with the kills the humour is definitely for a more adult audience as it includes sex references a somewhat disturbing sex scene involving puppets tons of swearing and dark humour.The movie also has a few easter eggs that references other horror movie icons such as Freddy Kreugers razor glove and Jason Vourhees mask which is always fun to see.I recommend this movie to any horror movie and Chucky fan while not the best Chucky movie it has it's moments with some fun and interesting kills a good opening song and dark humour that entertains well enough.,Bride of Chucky

82,Peach-2,Lucky for everyone.,8,29 March 1999,"Bride Of Chucky is a great B horror film. The kind of horror films they don't make anymore. The reason why I say this is, the film understands itself. No one went to see this movie expecting a great film. Alot of people however went to see Chucky kill innocent victims. The film makers knew they were making a fourth installment in a horror franchise and they had fun with it. Movies like this don't have to be good, they are just supposed to be fun. This film is very entertaining and I think horror fans will enjoy.",Bride of Chucky
83,TalesfromTheCryptfan,"Mediocre installment, but it tries.",6,12 November 2017,"A month after the events of Child's Play 3 after Chucky (voiced by Brad Douriff) was sliced in the fan at the amusement park at the end, it seems Chucky's old flame Tiffany (played by Jennifer Tilly) who finds his remains in a police station evidence room and takes his body back to her place to stitch him up back together. Now Chucky decides after being treated like dirt by her, he transfers her soul into a bridal doll's body as now both must try to be human again, Chucky's original human corpse is buried with an amulet that is called ""the heart of Dambella"" which they can be human again if they get some humans. Tiffany gets an idea to call her strong model- like male neighbor named Jesse (Nick Stabile) to go to Hackensack New Jersey to deliver dolls to a cemetery in exchange for 500 dollars. Jesse accepts the offer as he decides to take his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) to go with him to run away from her strict/bossy police officer of an uncle Chief Warren (John Ritter) and are on the road for Chucky is on the loose killing anyone that gets in his way with the help of Tiffany.A mediocre sequel from writer Don Mancini and Hong Kong director Ronny Yu and is the 4th installment of the popular Child's Play franchise. I saw this in theaters as a teen and thought it was OK, yet this was made after the success of Scream and Mancini who thought he ran out of ideas after part 3 thought that Scream was successful and would love to copy the formula that movie had. Ronny Yu who directed the Hong Kong fantasy cult film ""The Bride with White Hair"" was hired to direct this movie and later on went to make ""Freddy vs Jason"" in 2003, the film was an attempt to be scary and funny at the same time but falls flat. Jennifer Tilly sure is hot in the first half and did a great job voicing her doll counterpart yet there were some in-jokes like the Creepshow crate with the Freddy glove, a cheap looking Jason mask, a chainsaw that could be Leatherface's and Michael's mask in the evidence room. Then there's that dumb kill where John Ritter whom is one of my favorite actors by the way gets killed by nails that were latched on a powerful glove compartment that no way would actually work with the nails just flying and nailing through his face. Then Chucky cracks a one- liner saying ""Why does that face look so familiar"" which is suppose to be a funny reference to Hellraiser but isn't as some of the jokes fall flat.I did liked the one-liner where he murders done on Damien (Alexis Arquette) whom is basically a take on goths and Marylin Manson as Chucky says ""It ain't the size that counts a hole it's what you do with it"". Some of the kills are quite lame with some okay make-up and puppetry effects by Kevin Yagher but the script is mediocre as hell. Lawrence Dane the Canadian actor whom you remember from Scanners and Happy Birthday to Me plays Lt Danson yet some of the characters aren't likable like in Child's Play 2 but the main leads are strangely likable which is the dolls. The doll sex scene was quite far fetched when it was meant to be funny but totally not funny and Chucky's death was poor compared to the first 3 deaths of him but he did said a great line ""Go ahead and shoot, i'll be back! i always come back but dying is such a bitch"".Then we have the ending which made me go ""Oh no, son of chucky!"" which is sequel bait ending that leads to ""Seed of Chucky"" years later.",Bride of Chucky
84,asda-man,Murderously entertaining!,8,16 July 2011,"Please let's remember that we're talking about a pair of murderous dolls in love! Film snobs and critics just won't get it, the only way to actually enjoy this film is to watch it expecting the ridiculous and to absolutely NOT take it seriously in the slightest. I did that and guess what? I loved it! ""Bride of Chucky"" is a title, blatantly spoofing that other hilarious film, ""Bride of Frankenstein"" only here, Chucky's ""bride"" appears in it for basically the whole film. The ""Child's Play"" series are films not to be taken seriously with and so Ronny Yu runs with the idea and decides to take it to the limits of daftness and successfully creates a really funny guilty pleasure. Whoever said they didn't even giggle slightly at the sight of two dolls having sex has got to be the embodiment of ""Pinoccio"".The film starts like a completely fresh new start, if you haven't seen the other ""Child's Play"" films then you could actually just watch this one and you wouldn't know any different. The idea of Chucky getting into the little boys body (who isn't so little now anyway) has obviously been scrapped and a new plot of Chucky on the quest to getting some amulet has been added like ""The Little Vampire"". Do we care about this blatant plot shift? No. Well I didn't anyway, die hard fans might be a bit brassed off, but I just enjoy the series and I don't necessarily think they're my favourite films ever! So the basic formula of Chucky is there only this time he has a girlfriend who has an uncanny resemblance to Patsy off my favourite comedy series ""Absolutely Fabulous"". Even though they're meant to be the villains, you can't help but love them for their utter mischievousness towards the poor teenage couple. We as an audience egg them on to kill off any randomer!Although I did thoroughly enjoy ""Bride of Chucky"" I do feel that it didn't earn its ""18"" certificate. It could've afforded to be much bloodier, especially as the kills are so creative (thanks to Tiffany!)The screenplay is crazier than ever, the directing fills the film with the life it deserves and the puppets are really well made I could just imagine the puppeteers during the sex scene thinking, ""what s**t are we making here?"" But they really did look terrific and resembled a bit less of a midget in a costume, although obviously it was at times, it merely added to the complete nonsense filled fun the film possesses. This film just goes to show that not every film has to be all serious, sometimes its good to be as daft as you can be, just to lighten up a sometimes dull world.",Bride of Chucky
85,baileycrawly,The Good Comedy,8,26 October 2019,"Bride of Chucky marks the dramatic departure for the series, abandoning most elements of horror and instead embracing a darkly satirical take. Don and his team were aware enough of the demystifying effect that long horror franchises have on their characters and, instead of allowing Chucky to slip into the self-parody category, decided to consciously go headfirst into the territory of the bizarre comedy. A lot of the movie doesn't make much sense, but it's hilarious and that's why we love it.
Jennifer Tilly joins Brad Dourif for the female counterpart to Chucky, a doll just as menacing and lovable as the original, in an on-the-road comedy quite unlike anything we've ever seen before. It's formulaic, sure. It doesn't really have a rhyme or reason, but it's not supposed to. It's just a fantastic comedy with some slasher elements inserted.",Bride of Chucky
86,hellholehorror,Stunningly sultry,7,26 April 2018,"Brilliant comedy horror! At the time of writing I haven't seen the original Chucky but I have seen the two previous dire sequels. This sequel is original, comic and very entertaining with brilliant catchphrases and Jennifer Tilly looking and acting stunningly sultry. The violence is entertaining and the story good. Sometimes the computer effects take over too much and the film is not scary but other than that this is a solid, well-directed, highly entertaining film which is a sequel but could happily stand on its own with a bit more back-story explanation.",Bride of Chucky
87,nitzanhavoc,"Another comedy-horror posing as a Slasher, just like the first three. Yawn.",5,31 March 2016,"Please bear in mind that my harsh criticism is mostly due to my being 30 when I've first started watching the Chucky anthology. Had I been 20 years younger, I would have probably loved it. As an adult Horror enthusiast, each and every Chucky film up till now have been a remarkably unrewarding experience.While attempting to infiltrate the pantheon of slashers (and failing miserably), Chucky has made sure to let everyone know that logic is never a necessity. Freddie and Jason only get banished/defeated, so their return for each of the sequels is at least remotely comprehensible (which is all that's necessary considering mostly everything else about the slasher-monsters' supernatural strength and potency). Chucky, on the other hand, is constantly resurrected. How? How come? Who cares, Chucky's back and he's hilarious! Ha ha ha, right? Just what we want in a Horror film, to be half-entertained by a third rate comedian without a moment of actual fear.The good news is that the fourth sequel recognizes Chucky for what he is - a joke. That's why several scenes present a comic breaking of the 4th wall and some well deserved homages to those who actually succeeded where Chucky would forever fail (like Mike Mayers, Jason Voorhees and Hellraiser). In order to complete the comic effect, Chucky is this time accompanied by a female counterpart, the wonderful Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany, Chucky's Bride. Their interactions and dynamics are quite hilarious.Adjectives such as ""comic"" and ""hilarious"" have absolutely no place in a Horror film. True, Freddie has always been the ultimate morbid comedian, but the story-line and plot have been eerie and at times terrifying (words that in no manner can be used to describe anything about any of the Chucky films so far). Just like the first 3 films, Bride of Chucky is good for a few laughs with your friends on Halloween, or maybe even as a drinking game. However, as a Horror film? Another moderately entertaining let down.",Bride of Chucky

89,emperor_bender,New Direction for Chucky,8,7 March 2008,"Chucky has been transformed. 8 years after Child's Play 3, and after we all thought Chucky was dead for good, Bride of Chucky comes out. This movie is very very different than the Child's Play's. Chucky has a whole new, stitched up, more menacing look here; which I think makes him look cool, but many will disagree (or agree, many people have different opinions). Chucky is now more of a main character than an idle doll who is only shown alive during kill scenes. He has an actual personality and everything. We are also introduced to another living doll, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), who is actually an old girlfriend of Chucky's. Andy is no longer a part of this series it seems, which is probably a good thing. 3 movies starring Andy is enough. Here, we have a young couple as the main characters. Jade and Jesse. They decide to run away and start a new life together. And you'll never guess...CHUCKY comes along, and brings HIS girl as well. On the road, they leave a trail of death and destruction; leading them right to the exciting conclusion. This movie has gotten a lot of good recognition, which is well deserved. Catherine Heigl is very good here and; in my opinion much better than in Knocked Up. Nick Stabile is very good also for a small-time actor. Fans of Child's Play will either love or hate this. But its worth the time to watch and find out. 8/10.",Bride of Chucky
90,DigitalRevenantX7,Better than the first three.,5,12 January 2010,"After getting off to a very silly start with CHILD'S PLAY in 1988, the series got better by the time the second & third films came out, but the waning interest in Elm Street-style films saw an end to the series. That lasted for only seven years. Bride of Chucky was the rebirth of the Chucky saga, with series scribe Don Mancini returning to write the script & Chucky himself, Brad Dourif, making a comeback.Tiffany, the girlfriend of Charles Lee Ray, gets her hands on the remains of the killer doll from a police evidence locker (which has Jason Voorhees' hockey mask, Freddy Krueger's razor glove, Michael Myers' mask & Leatherface's chainsaw) & attempts to revive it using a copy of 'Voodoo for Dummies'. Chucky comes to life, kills her & resurrects her in the form of a female doll. The only way for them to regain human form is to get the 'Heart of Damballa', an amulet that was buried with Ray's body in New Jersey. Using a pair of teenage lovers, the duo undertake a road trip to New Jersey, with the police in hot pursuit.With Bride of Chucky, producer David Kirschner brings in Ronny Yu to direct, hoping that Yu would reinvigorate the series, which was already lagging creativity-wise. But the result is a film that seems nothing more than routine in almost every respect. The script is stuck with the same nonsense that mired the original trilogy, with the bizarre plot device of the dolls having to obtain an amulet in order to regain human form – I can see how Chucky became a doll, but how does he transfer Tiffany's soul into the doll without the amulet? Plus, Ray was killed in Chicago, yet his body is buried in New Jersey. How does that work? That said, what makes the film work (only slightly it seems) is Yu bringing in a sense of dark humour to the proceedings, with some cool deaths – a couple being impaled by glass shards; a guy being hit by a truck; the obnoxious deputy being killed as his car is blown up. The acting is adequate & the visual effects are better than the previous films. Besides the black humour, the film has plenty of in-jokes (the opening sequence has references to THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, HALLOWEEN, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET & Friday THE 13TH, which when you think about it doesn't make any sense since the locations for each franchise are spread all over the country) & hilarious sight gags (the scene where Chucky flips a stoner the bird before killing the cop is worth the price of admission alone).",Bride of Chucky

The movie doesn't take itself seriously for a second. Also there are a few gory murders thrown in to satisfy us horror fans and the film never stops moving.The acting was good. The direction was also good but could have been more better. The pacing was normal. What made this movie different from first three parts was that it was blend of horror, violence and humour.

There is plenty of gore and slapstick humor for a good horror fan. The next installment, Seed of Chucky, didn't work quite as well, but it was still a hilarious and over-the-top journey.

93,Donatien3,"good, silly fun",7,11 August 2013,"Considering the franchise is based around a killer doll, the Child's Play series isn't meant to be taken seriously.'Bride of Chucky' lives up to the silly premise. Nearly a decade after the disappointing 'Child's Play III', BOC reunites Chucky with his last human girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly, who straddles the line between sexy and annoying). After electrocuting Tiffany, he casts her soul into a female doll and goes on a quest to the grave of Charles Lee Ray to steal the amulet that will free Chucky's soul from the Good Guy doll. It's a ridiculous, twisted, horror-road movie, backed by a rock-metal soundtrack and a few horror movie references and injokes. At one point, Chucky says 'It's a long story...if it was a movie you'd need three or four sequels to do it justice', typical of the self-aware humour of horror films in the late nineties/early 2000s.You know what to expect: blood, lots of deaths, a few laughs, a few scares and plenty of silliness. BOC also features Katherine Heigel (now the queen of terrible rom-coms) in one of her earlier roles and one of the later roles of the late John Ritter.If you like the Child's Play series, or horror movies in general, then 'Bride of Chucky' is worth a look.",Bride of Chucky
94,kylehaines96,Who The (Beep) Is Martha Stewart?(**** Out Of ****).,10,13 December 2012,"Well my opinion has changed for this one because if you remember last time I gave this movie 3 1/2 out of 4, now it is up to the full 4. So just why is this one the one sequel that I like out of all the others? Well a lot of good reasons come into mind.The film picks up about a month after Child's Play 3, where Chucky's remains are stolen by Tiffany played by Jennifer Tilly and she takes them back to her house and sews them together. When her wannabe goth killer boyfriend comes over, Chucky comes alive and kills the boyfriend in a very bloody death. It is revealed that Tiffany and Chucky were dating before Charles Lee Ray was put inside the doll. They at first are happy but Tiffany locks Chucky in a playpen because Tiffany was under the false impression that Chucky was going to propose to her. Chucky, Now raging mad, Kills Tiffany and puts her inside of a doll body. They take a couple played by Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigel hostage and plan to posses their souls.The first good thing is the story. I really like how they don't really go after Andy here and instead go after new people. However They at least could have mentioned him more than they did, at least more than a newspaper article. Also I love the idea of giving Chucky a bride so he can have another doll to interact with.The next is the Bride Of Chucky. Her character is really well done here and I like how Jennifer Tilly does voice Tiffany. The look of the Bride is pretty cool with the doll starting out as a wedding doll and then transformed in this goth/biker chick look. Plus Chucky gets lucky, twice. The first is, obviously when he gets married but the second is when he really gets ""Lucky"" if you know what I mean.The next is the special effects which are better than the last two. Chucky is now all scarred up and this look is pretty frightening but to be completely honest I found his appearance in the first film more scary, But I do love the look they go with and this look does continue into Seed Of Chucky.The last is the acting. Stabile and Heigel do a really good job and are believable as a couple, John Ritter, yes he is in the movie, does a good job as a dirty cop. But I want to talk about the dolls. The voice acting by Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly are great. Plus Jennifer Tilly is hot. Both in and outside of the doll.The Final Verdict for Bride Of Chucky is 4 Out Of 4 Stars. Great acting, amazing special effects, also not to mention the movie is extremely funny. My favorite quote is from Chucky and it was used for the title of the review.

He was able to invent something completely new and surprise the fans, but with complete silliness.Brad Dourif is back as the now-boring Chucky, but Jennifer Tilly also joins him as a possessed bride-doll. The bride, both in human and doll character, is completely unfunny and unlikeable. What's worse is the human characters, who are just so unlikeable that the story is boring and unsatisfying when it depicts them. That's if you're kind enough to agree that there's some sort of plot in there.The only strength in Bride of Chucky is some of the fun moments. There's only a small amount of fun, which is forgotten by the end.

I can't express how glad I am that I was wrong.Bride Of Chucky re-imagines the killer doll saga as a pure black comedy, and the outcome of this metamorphosis makes it really easy to forgive the sins of the previous two films. While the entire series up to this point was liberally sprinkled with attempts at integrating humor into the horror, the sophomoric, cheeseball approach of the antics only served to undermine any potential for Child's Play 2 and 3 to match the deft balance struck by the potent original. Bride Of Chucky has no such pretensions, and the film doesn't even bother to suggest you should take it seriously. Instead, the emphasis here is solely on demented splat-stick, and the result is a truly witty and twisted gem.It's probably not all that important for our purposes here to delve into how Chucky's improbable resurrection comes to pass, and if you're the type to question the plausibility of a serial killer's former girlfriend tracking down the doll his soul was transferred into, reconstructing his dismembered frame, and performing a voodoo ceremony over the rubber carcass to successfully bring him back from the dead, it's a safe bet that you're not in the demographic for Bride Of Chucky. All the rest of us need to know is that Chucky does indeed return from the netherworld to stalk and slash once more, and this time out he gains a co-conspirator when he repeats the ceremony and channels Jennifer Tilly's essence into a companion doll who turns out to be a leather-clad, gothed out femme fatale with a serious mean streak. The film follows the pair as they embark on a road trip with an unsuspecting young couple to reclaim a mystical medallion that will allow them to permanently return to human form, leaving a trail of hijinks and bodies in their wake. Again, if any of this sounds ridiculous to you... Okay, well, it probably is, but Bride Of Chucky wears its camp elements like badges of honor, and going along on this ride proves to be an immensely entertaining experience.Well aware of its target audience, the film is loaded with in-jokes for horror fans, and just a cursory scan of the police evidence inventory during the prologue handily sets the tone for the extended knowing wink sustained throughout the film. On that note, Bride is also chock full of gore, something sorely lacking in the rest of the series, and even though most of the increasingly creative killings are played for laughs, the humor doesn't dilute the potency of stellar gruesome gags like the ""nails to the face"" bit or the fate that befalls an amorous couple who make the mistake of canoodling on a water bed with a mirror mounted on the ceiling above it.The casting is equally inspired, and Jennifer Tilly proves to be the absolute perfect choice to accompany Chucky on this journey. Her sparring with Brad Dourif is priceless more often than not, and their farcical domestic interplay provides the film with some of its wittiest moments. The presence of John Ritter is likewise a huge boon, and the late great funnyman shines here as always despite the brevity of his involvement in the proceedings.I'm sort of bummed that I didn't see this until after Seed Of Chucky had already been released, because the cliff-hanger denouement doesn't have quite as much of a punch when you know what's coming next. But even if you are aware of what's in store, the finale provides a fitting segue into the next installment and ends the film on a definite absurdist high note.If the notion of two homicidal, foul-mouthed dolls embarking on an interstate killing spree and having frenzied, plastic-bumping nookie doesn't sound appealing to you, then these clearly aren't the droids you're looking for. But if you have a skewed sense of humor and can spare 90 minutes to check your analytical mind at the door and giggle like a stoned hyena, then you'll have a hell of a good time embarking on Chucky and Tiffany's trek. I know I did.",Bride of Chucky
98,Toronto85,Bride of Chucky,5,2 March 2011,"Bride of Chucky is the fourth Child's Play film and this is where the series takes a whole new direction. Andy Barclay is absent in this one and Jennifer Tilly plays Chucky's girlfriend. The story goes that after Chucky was cut to pieces in the funhouse at the end CP3, his remains were stored at a police evidence locker. Chucky's girlfriend Tiffany takes his remains and stitches the doll back together before using the famous voodoo chant to bring him back to life. Tiffany ends up becoming a doll after Chucky kills her, but in order to become human again, they have to get a amulet which was buried with Charles Lee Ray (Chucky) years ago. We also meet two younger characters in love who end up driving the dolls to New Jersey where the body of Charles Lee Ray is buried.Several murders occur along the road trip with the two human characters unaware that the dolls are alive. Eventually the dolls reveal their true selves leading up to a rather ""interesting"" ending. The acting is very good in this one, and the voices by Dourif and Tilly are well done. Lots of comedy in this installment as well. That's really the difference between this one and the others. This is a horror comedy while the others were more horror thrillers. I personally liked the series the way it was, but there are some funny moments in Bride of Chucky.There are some gory death scenes which are done well. Much better than the third Child's Play. But it just doesn't feel like a Child's Play movie without the story of Chucky chasing Andy Barclay around trying to take over his body. The rules from the original story are changed. There was no mention of an amulet buried with the body in any of the first three. Overall, a decent entry to the series, but I enjoyed Chucky more when he wasn't a full on comedian.5/10",Bride of Chucky
99,rparham,Horror turned to humor,5,27 July 2013,"When a formerly straight, serious horror film franchise begins turning to camp, it is typically a sign that the creators are running out of gas. That would seem to be the case with the Child's Play series based on the fourth entry, Bride of Chucky. After 3 previously straightforward films, Bride of Chucky disposes of any pretense that you should find anything here, well, horrific. Instead, we are treated to black comedy, one that isn't without it's moments, but on the whole a sign that perhaps it's time, like toys we have outgrown, Chucky should be put away.Set years after the previous entry, Chucky's damaged remains are rescued from an evidence room by Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), who had been the girlfriend of Chucky's original human form, Charles Lee Ray. After performing a voodoo ritual, Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) returns to life, but Tiffany quickly realizes that her hopes of the two of them settling down seem iffy. Chucky doesn't take kindly to being treated like a plaything, so he offs Tiffany and transfers her soul into a female doll. Both then decide to return themselves to their human bodies, so they hitch a ride with eloping lovers Jesse (Nick Stabile) and Jade (a pre-Grey's Anatomy Katherine Heigl) who are headed to New Jersey, where Chucky and Tiffany have plans for the young couple.Bride of Chucky, written by series creator Don Mancini, realizes that Chucky as a typical horror icon has past his sell by date, so instead elects to, a la Freddy Kruger, transform him into something of an anti- hero here, giving him, and Tiffany, a cadre of one liners to make him the star attraction of this entry. It wouldn't really take much, the plot involving the human characters of Jesse and Jade is about as limp and tacked on as you can get. Their framing device, and the ongoing plot thread that the killings being perpetrated by Chucky and Tiffany are believed to be performed by Jesse and Jade, are here because the filmmakers felt that they needed some kind of normal protagonists to play off Chucky. Stabile and Heigl get the job done, but nothing about Jesse or Jade is interesting, involving or memorable. When the film chooses to focus on them, it more or less grinds to a halt. All the good stuff is reserved for Chucky and Tiffany.The film contains the usual material you would expect from a slasher film, with a host of gruesome, creative deaths that are fairly graphic. That doesn't translate to anything being scary, however. There isn't much in the way of suspense in Bride of Chucky, and because the lead human characters are so lifeless, we aren't really finding ourselves biting our nails as to what is going to happen to them next. The screenplay also surrounds the leads with some enormously goofy characters, from Jade's overprotective police officer uncle, played by John Ritter as if he was in one of his many sitcom roles, to a Marilyn Manson look-a-like with the rather tongue-in-cheek moniker Damien (Alexis Arquette) who lusts after Tiffany.Bride of Chucky isn't exactly unenjoyable. Many of the moments involving Chucky and Tiffany are funny, and the film pokes fun both at itself and other horror films more than once. Mancini obviously knew what he was doing when he wrote Bride of Chucky, nothing here seems unintentional, so on the one hand I have to give him a degree of credit for going for the gusto with some of the humorous elements of Bride of Chucky. That doesn't translate to good movie, horror, comedy, or otherwise, perhaps a passable one, but nothing I would see myself revisiting in the future. While Hollywood is always good at continuously mining properties, Chucky is one that, this time, should probably stay buried.",Bride of Chucky
100,kingofdanerds,I have a soft spot for this one...,7,21 September 2021,"The Child's Play series was dormant for seven years after the critical failure of Child's Play 3. But in 1998, Chucky was back and this marked a new generation of Chucky films. Bride of Chucky was directed by Ronny Yu and stars Jennifer Tilly, Brad Dourif, Katherine Heigl, Nick Stabile, and John Ritter. The film was a financial success but received mixed reviews upon release but hey, better than what Child's Play 3 got. The series would lay dormant for six more years until 2004 where Seed of Chucky would be released.Tiffany Valentine (Jennifer Tilly) is Charles Lee Ray's girlfriend before he died in the first film and she manages to get the remains of the doll and fix it up and resurrect Chucky via voodoo. Tiffany is then killed by Chucky and her soul is placed in a doll where she is forced to be. But, there is a way..... There is an amulet that is on the corpse of Charles Lee Ray that must be found and used so the souls of both Tiffany and Chucky can be put into human bodies. The only way is to hitch a ride with a young couple......Bride of Chucky has a special place in my heart. You see, this was the first Chucky film I ever watched as a young kid, which is odd considering the content that is present in the film. But nonetheless, I remember thinking this film was scary and disturbing. Now I come to release that it is not quite scary and that is not a bad thing because the film does not strive to be. It certainly tries to be it's own thing. The series surely would not have done better had it continued on with the Andy Barclay storyline, the series would most likely be garbage. This film, and the film's that come after it, are all about Chucky. Not only is the film about Chucky, but his wife Tiffany. Now, do remember that I was a little kid (perhaps too young). So, yes, Jennifer Tilly was my first celebrity crush ever. Aside from that, she is what makes this film a good film. She has great physique, and has a lot of charm and charisma. As the character, she rivals Chucky in more ways than one (for example: who is the more sadistic killer?) It is a shame that most of the film is her voicing Tiffany as the doll but she still does fine there. Brad Dourif returns (obviously) and does a fairly decent job here as well. Again, I prefer his balanced performance/portrayal in Child's Play 2, but the film was going for a more dark and comedic vibe here and Brad Dourif handles that all fairly nicely. Giving some good one liners. Even the comedy is handled fairly well. I do find myself laughing at a lot of the lines here in this film. Sure, a lot of it is self referential humor and it should come as no surprise that Scream came out only two years before this film. But even here, it is handled to a fairly good degree. I mean sure, it can get almost too meta at times for my taste but it still is a joy to watch. The film does call back to Bride of Frankenstein and I really dig the dark and gothic feel in the first twenty or so minutes. Sure, a bit silly at times, but not overly ridiculous. I mean it is a late 90s horror film that is a dark comedy so, of course it is gonna feel a bit silly. As stated, the film is mainly about Chucky and Tiffany. To me, the writers were well aware of this and did very little to make the supporting cast interesting. Probably the most forgettable characters of the whole franchise. Boring and dull and not even that well acted/portrayed. Not even written well either. Granted, the majority of the film is Chucky and Tiffany. But even the minor presence that these poorly written characters have in the film is too much. Now, I am being a bit too harsh here because they are far from being the worst characters in any film, but Chucky and Tiffany are great together on screen that when the film switches to the poorly written characters, I would much rather skip past the scenes than actually watch them. This film does bring us some of the most creative and best kills that this franchise has to offer and we get an increased body count here as well. The special effects are not that great and at this point are probably the weakest in the franchise. The animatronics for the dolls look fine, but there is use of CGI that might have been good back in '98, but has not aged well since. While I consider the previous two films to have good practical effects, there is nothing to ooh and ahh about in this film. If you thought this film was a little too late 90's, then wait till you hear the film's soundtrack. It mostly consists of metal songs and while I do not consider myself a metalhead, metalheads will not be disappointed whatsoever. You have Rob Zombie, Judas Priest, Type O Negative, Slayer. All just to name a few.Bride of Chucky is unique in it's own right and I got to give the film that much credit for being unique. Sure, it is a bit too self referential and at times cartoonish, but I still find it too be a decent sequel.",Bride of Chucky
101,pumaye,Genius at work,8,3 April 2002,"Magistral fourth entry in the Chucky's saga, with a great cast and dozens of citations from other horror masterpieces, from Psyco to Hellraiser ending with It's Alive. Chucky becomes a married man and has also a child! One of the greatest horror movie of the last decade, a delight for the real movie buff, who likes his movie with a lot of internal trivia. Ironic gags, blood running free, politically incorrect: a great, great movie",Bride of Chucky
102,FKDZ,Funny ...sometimes,4,29 September 2020,"Where do I start with this movie.. first off compared to the three that came before this movie really leans into the comedy aspect of it all. I'd hardly call it a scary movie. The kills aren't all that interesting, nothing really memorable. But the only thing this movie does well is some comedic writing and acting for the dolls Chucky and Tiffany.Now I rated this movie the same 4/10 as Childs Play 3. Whereas 3 was bland but still had some good moments. BOC has a incredibly throwaway story and it really seemed like they wanted to make a movie with just the dolls but didn't do it. So the whole main character ''side plot'' is very unengaging. Whereas I could still kinda care for Andy, he's completely out of the picture.The puppeteering and animatronics have gotten another step up, but not by a immense amount, there were still a few sloppy/funny looking scenes. But it's a lot tighter than CP3. The facial animations are fantastic though.Now this movie also opens up a bit more regarding the more ''naughty'' aspects of the dolls, as the main ''theme'' of this movie is relationships/marriage and well... there's a scene between chucky and tiffany and you just think ''they really went there huh..''. Honestly, it's a hilarious mix between funny, gross, disturbing and why...Now also a reason why the rating is this low is the writing for chucky, I enjoyed so much of his lines in the previous films, even a few in CP3. But here it's filled with clichés and it just doesn't really work out for me. I found myself laughing less at Chucky and more at other things.Another low of this movie is the finale, it's the most boring and lackluster of them all. For no reasons the girl gives back chucky's knife, and the final kill is her simply shooting him and dying. I mean at least CP3 had him fall into a huge fan that shred him up spectacular.. No crazy effects here, no molten plastic or anything. It's really basic sadly. Though the very last scene was pretty great and gruesome with the newborn baby doll, though it doesn't make up for it.4/10 good for a couple laughs and less bland than CP3 but lacks in writing, the finale and good/creative kills. Wouldn't really watch this movie again.",Bride of Chucky

Now does this plot really make sense? Hell no! Why the hell does chucky need to kill tiff to put her into a female doll to then go and get the amulet so they can then go back into human bodies? Thats the plot and it doesn't make sense, why not just keep her alive so she can go drive to get the amulet, yet there's the fact that chuck is a possessed doll in the first place...Anyway, it keeps you entertained the whole way through without bad stupid slow parts or any padding, this is a bad movie, there are worse movies, but if you like bad horror movies, and the chucky films, (I don't really like the first ones) you'll like this.",Bride of Chucky
104,tequila101,"Falls away from the Trilogy, but makes up with the Comedy",7,22 June 2012,"According to fans, after the ""Fall"" (not) of Child's Play 3 and it's indirect controversy, the creators of the Chucky franchise decided to give the film series a rest until 1998, since they thought that CP3 was a big fail. I don't think its true but I wonder and ask myself this question. Not only about budget and Don Manici's disappointment for the film (saying it was his least favorite), but was it the harsh, indirect controversy towards the film that they decided to stop and then take Chucky away from his Horror roots, introducing him into Comedy??? Now don't get me wrong. I liked Bride of Chucky for what it was. I personally think it is a totally different viewing experience to the previous three which were darker, scarier and more suspenseful. This fourth entry in the series does a sort of rehash, mixing the horror, turning the film in a black comedic side, splitting time waster. I also don't think its a waste of time, but I do think that the film is not as intriguing as the first three. Like the two previous sequels however, I do think this film suffers from a few problems. Maybe even a few more than Child's Play 2 & 3.I will go through some positives and negatives. There aren't many, but there are a few more than the other films.Pros: The film's turn to black humor wasn't such a bad idea. Because of its campy style, Brad Dourif's excellent voice and the rest of the acting working well, as well as the use of campy songs and the composer (who did CP2) to come back and take on the job with the music score. All these little elements with some tense kills, catchy moments and quirky language made for a fun Chucky film. I found it to be a very different viewing experience from Child's Play 3, because that one was just totally dark. I like the scarier Chucky films better, but having Comedy and keeping some of that intense stuff occurring was a great achievement, which I thought would have fell apart by now.Negatives: Despite the film being on an excellent level with Horror and Comedy, having great actors and excellent, and more bloodier kills, I think the film (like Child's Play 2 & 3) have a few problems. The transferring the soul concept is way out of hand, and it becomes much more messier. Using an amulet, silly, just silly! I thought that the climax of the graveyard scene was shot well, but I thought that at times it just dragged on for too long. I felt as if it just lagged too much. Lastly, (I know its a comedy/horror, and by this stage it wasn't going to be realistic!) I think that Chucky just isn't scary. Back in the first film, we didn't see him, so it built up the tension and suspense. It was better when he wasn't seen. Oh well, maybe I was just nitpicking there, but Chucky doesn't have as much charm I think like the original.Still liking the film today, I think it is a good time water if you're feeling bored, and you are watching it alone or with friends. The plot is good enough for what its worth as the acting is paced well. The scenes are paced well (Unlike Seed of Chucky, which was a major blow). It is a good sequel, just not the greatest one.7 Stitched Dolls outta 10.",Bride of Chucky
105,Fudge-3,Formula horror spoof. 6/10,6,29 June 1999,"I admit it, I have seen all the Chucky films. They are all the same; enough red splatter to make an 18 cert and enough humour to entertain. Do producers remember how to make a proper horror movie? It might be nice to be scared again.To have a bride for Chucky was a nice idea but there are precious few others. The acting is appropriately hammy. The dolls are well animated.

Well he finds it. But the thing is he also finds love. He marrys another doll (Tiffany) who use to be his girlfriend. He and her go on a killing spree in the back of a van on the way to New Jersey.Along with the language (I must say there's too much of it in this series) and the gore there's also a sex scene between the two dolls.

There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre. This made the movie better like comedy does do with many horror movies.

That's pretty stupid by itself, but you had to take it a step further and include some boring relationship drama that no one really cares about! Nobody wants to see Chucky argue with his wife! Nobody wanted that! Anyway, even if this huge blunder wasn't in the movie, it still would have been pretty bad. The characters are annoying and expendable and the acting is as laughable as ever.

But as the movie reached its high point, it started getting lazier and more superficial. I was expecting a lot more people to get killed and more hell to break loose.

118,DJ_Shilo,Barbie! Eat your Heart out,6,18 June 2020,"""Child's Play"" was a great thriller, and the sequels that followed were less than impressive. Now, Chucky's back with what should have been ""Child's Play 2,"" and he is heading out on a road trip with someone, and she is equally sadistic. This time, it's a bit different, and surprisingly, it works as ""Bride of Chucky"" is a full-on violent horror-comedy and fun. What makes this installment better than the other films is that it somewhat dives into Chucky's past and introduces a girlfriend we never knew. There's not much of a story developed, but Chucky is more comical, yet still has his violent moments. This film is by no means perfect, and it's a lot more gruesome than before, but I enjoyed the movie and chuckled at the humour.It's about Chucky's old flame, Tiffany Valentine (Jennifer Tilly), who recovers his battered dolls parts from a police evidence lock-up. Believing that his soul still inhabits the doll, Tiffany hopes to pick up where they left off. Things don't go according to plan. Meanwhile, teenage, Jade (Katherine Heigl) is trying to escape from her abusive Uncle, Police Chief Kincaid (John Ritter) with her boyfriend, Jessie (Nick Stabile). Chucky realizes that too become human again, he needs something that's buried in a Hackensack, New Jersey, cemetery. With Jade in tow, Jessie gets tricked into a violent road trip that the two teenagers will never forget.So if you saw the poster for the film, you have seen that Chucky has a new look complete with stitches running through his face, and it gives him a more creepy and evil look. This element is one of the things I liked about the movie is that they went the distance to make Chucky look better than the previous films, and they managed to pull it off accordingly. His new look adds to the tone of the film, and it's most pleasing. It opens with a cop stealing Chucky's parts from the evidence locker before Tiffany appears, kills him and takes Chucky home to the tune of Living Dead Girl by Heavy Metal legend Rob Zombie. It's taken her ten years to find Chucky, and she is the one who crudely stitches his face and brings him back to life.Chucky has always been a humorous villain because of his mouth, and he is no different here, but it got redundant in the two sequels because he is supposed to be scary and not a joker. The humour for this film works with Chucky because the writing is better for him, but it also works because of the film's absurdity. Tiffany attempts to rebuild her relationship with Chucky, and it doesn't go according to plan with comical results. Tiffany is a serial killer, and she winds up with fake nails, bushy blonde hair and a leather jacket when Chucky preforms the voodoo spell on her much to her chagrin. She lights up a smoke and says, ""Barbie! Eat your heart out."" The doll version of Tiffany is modelled after her actor Jennifer Tilly right down to the heart tattoo, and you can see that Tilly invested herself into the character.Most of the story consists of the two teenagers who decide to run away, and Chucky and Tiffany stow away in the back of their van. My only question is that what Chucky needs to get has never been seen before, and it serves as the films McGuffin, but it never explains why he needs it now. It has to do with him becoming human again, which is a tired old plot at this point. It worked in the original when he was after Andy, but after two repeats and now a third time, it's stale. When people start dropping dead, Jade and Jessie get the blame. Jade's uncle, played by the legendary John Ritter, is a pain in the ass, and what happens to him is quite surprising and brutal, but the character is expendable, and he goes out too soon.Now there is one sequence, and it comes right out of nowhere, but I must say it made me laugh because it runs with the comedy aspect of the movie. Jessie and Jade stop at a motel where Tiffany executes revenge on two thieving idiots in a gruesome way involving a mirror. Chucky attempts to pull a ring off a severed finger that results in, are you ready? A sex scene. I had to laugh when Tiffany asks Chucky, ""Have you got a rubber?"" and Chucky says, ""Tiff, ""I'm all rubber."" This sequence shows how much of a comedy aspect they were going for, which does take away from Chucky being scary like he was in ""Child's Play."" Some may like Chucky being comical, but he still has a vicious, mean streak to him.I was expecting the film's ending to be like the other movies because this is a horror movie sequel and usually imagination goes out the window with these films. Well, not for this movie. It sort of ends how you expect with Chucky, but there is more thought put into it. Chucky also returns to his scary state in the cemetery, and I found this disappointing because he is a comical voice box throughout most of the film, and just to see his original vicious self for the last fifteen minutes was unbalanced. Anyway, we finally see what Chucky was trying to retrieve. I won't spoil it, but it asks that question again of why he never needed it before, so why now? I did enjoy the movie, and it's a fun one to see this Halloween. It has a very different tone than before, and Chucky stitches add to the film's menace. That being said, the film's final moments are beyond absurd, and you will leave the theatre wondering what I did, and that is, ""What the hell?""

119,Jesse-45,Chucky rules!,9,7 September 1999,"This is a great installment in the Child's Play series. It brought back some bang to the series. Great comedy, boy this movie is funny. Also there are awesome homages to other horror celebs. Beautiful cinematography. Great ending! Bring on Seed Of Chucky!",Bride of Chucky
120,Jesse-45,Spectacularly entertaining!,9,18 May 2000,"I've commented once on this Chucky great, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. The film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because I cherish Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS!!! And the gore was shockingly great! The scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful! That was a great gore scene!!!!! And the ending was so bizarre and shocking it made me s*%@ my pants. The idea of having the Seed of Chucky was very, very bizarre and shocking! When I left the theater I just loved it and I could'nt believe it was real. The bizarre and different qualities of this Child's Play installment for some reason made me mark it as the Jason Goes To Hell of the Child's Play series. It just had that intensely shocking, bizarre and different quality that reminded me of Jason Goes To Hell. A sure ***** out of *****. Here's how I rank the series : 1,4,2,3. I loved it but not quite as much as Tom Holland's original Child's Play classic. I can't wait for Seed of Chucky! Bring it on!",Bride of Chucky
121,Sorpse,a childs play comedy,7,16 December 2013,I liked in the first 2 movies how chucky was actually scary. He was scary first and then would shout out some ridiculous one-liner. Now in the 4th Chucky movie they have removed anything scary from the movie and gone completely dark comedy. Fortunatly for the Chucky legacy this isn't exactly a bad thing. It's still fun to watch chucky go around murdering people even when the horror is removed. He's that great of a character. Now in Bride of Chucky we meet Tiffany who is played by Jennifer Tilly acting hotter than she actually is by showing as much cleavage as possible. She becomes the bride and they go on a killing spree together. Genius idea giving the fans the ridiculousness they crave. Even though bride of chucky feels like a parody of the originals it is still a fun time and ends with a great send up to another sequel!,Bride of Chucky

Tiffany and Chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk!!Don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. It is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!My rating : 9/10.",Bride of Chucky
123,jmhammerstein-980-842586,Wonderful movie,10,8 April 2019,"Bride of Chucky is a wonderful movie. In it, Tiffany, who was Chucky's girlfriend, finds the pieces of the doll. The doll is in pieces because of having been chopped up after falling into a fan in Child's Play 3. She stitches it back together, then does a voodoo ritual which wakes up Chucky's soul. Chucky laughs at Tiffany and asks if she's nuts when he finds out she thought he was gonna ask her to marry him. Tiffany locks him in a crib as a result. Chucky gets out and kills Tiffany and transfers her soul into a doll. The two set it up where they are driven to where Chucky's human body was buried so they can get the heart of dembala, or something, from around his neck. There's great kills in this movie. The movie also has self aware type humor in it. It's very violent and isn't okay for children.",Bride of Chucky

After the third that was awful, it's incredible how they could have an unexpected sequel with new ideas. Chuck is the same nasty doll of the previous movies. Interesting the final that lets know that a fifth can be done....",Bride of Chucky
125,Hellrazr360,A Step In The Right Direction,7,10 March 2006,"To tell the truth, not much can be said about Child's Play 1, 2 and 3. All three of the movies proved to be disappointed horror movies with comedy and no thrills or scares, at best. Of course, anyone could say the series died with Child's Play 3, but this is a horror franchise we're talking about, so of course they're going to make more. Bride of Chucky goes for a more modern horror movie feeling, and this actually works to its advantage to sticking out as the best Chucky movie yet.For those that don't know, Bride of Chucky has left Andy Barcley behind, so he's long gone. But Chucky still has some victims to fool around with, and this time he's gotten a ""facelift"" gone wrong. Chucky goes and finds the pleasure in making the lives of two lovers more miserable, as they're for some reason ""forbiden"" to meet each other. As if Chucky wasn't enough for these two, an old ""girlfriend"" of his is turned into a Good Guy look-alike. Conflicts also brew between between Chucky and Tiffany, but it also has the film act like it can't decide whether Chucky and Tiffany love each other or not.With some fresh faces and a more modern feel, Bride of Chucky also goes to making a bit of fun towards the series history and to other horror movie genres. There are also some teen-aged party, drug and alcohol scenes, but the movie keeps this more-or-less on the down low. The acting is somewhat cheesy, but not as horrible as say Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 bad. The best performer of the movie is once again Chucky, his personality just doesn't seem to get old.Now, while this movie is a great step in the right direction for the Child's Play movies, it isn't without noticeable flaws. Again, the performances are pretty cheesy with the exception of Chucky, it's more a comedy than a horror and the movie itself does drag on with awkward parts. Other than that, Bride of Chucky a step in the right direction for Chucky's movie series and indicates good possibilities for future Chucky movies.",Bride of Chucky
126,Zod-2,nice attempt at bettering lame 80's horror flick,5,16 October 1999,"I have never been a big fan of the Child's Play series.  While the first one had a few good moments in it I just don't find a possessed child's toy that scary.  It's the same way I feel about the first Puppet Master movie (the only one I've seen), I find it hard to be afraid of something I can pick up and throw away from me.  That combined with the fact that 80's horror film directors don't know suspense from Adam doesn't help matters much. Needless to say I was a bit hesitant to rent Bride of Chucky but it's getting close to Halloween so I said why not.For the most part I enjoyed the movie.  I liked the addition of Tiffany and found most of Chucky's and Tiffany's banter quite amusing.  Unfortunately the rest of the movie is really lame!  The surrounding story is boring, it usually is but in this case the characterization for the human characters makes the cruise taken in Jason Takes Manhattan look like genius scripting.It was also nice to see the filmakers concede that Chucky just isn't scary, never was, never will be, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't attempt to create some tension people!Overall the film was okay, the comedy made up for the lack of anything else. Some other highlites include a tribute to Freddy, Jason, Michael and Pinhead and a couple of inventive deaths, but nothing much to really shout about.  After seeing this film I now realize how bad a year Universal had with this being their top grossing film of the year.Hopefully the creators will take a hint from other three long running horrors series and end this one with the next film, Son of Chucky.Bride of Chucky rates 5 out of 10, it is pretty funny.",Bride of Chucky
127,tylerrosin,Too campy and not scary enough for my taste.,5,7 August 2021,This movie was a big letdown. While I appreciate the more comedic take on Chucky it didn't really work for me. The kills were generic and the whole plot felt ridiculous. The leads were terrible and lacked personality and believability with zero chemistry. I did chuckle a few times and there was some decent jumps but the whole movie did nothing for me. Pass on this one.,Bride of Chucky

Its a hilarious and inventive horror comedy packed with some great scares, despite being played for laughs .Childs play creator don Mancini seemed to be aware of how ridiculous the concept of a killer doll was - which explains the postmodern , self mocking approach to the film.Its an approach that works- the way the film decides not to take it self seriously like its predecessors allows you to sit back and enjoy the ride.And a fun ride it is too.Adding to the morbid fun is the highly watchable pairing of chucky and tilly (played with gusto by a super sexy jennifer tilly ).Any one trying to reinvent a flagging horror franchise should use this highly entertaining childs play entry as a blue print.Tons of self effacing fun .",Bride of Chucky

I've rarely laughed during a movie as much as I did for this one.  Brad Dourif is back with his wacked-out laugh and the script is a gem, poking fun at itself and the horror genre and pop culture like Martha Stewart.  Now I just have to go out and buy a copy for myself so I can enjoy it over and over. The doll FX are pretty good and cheesy all at the same time, which was the intention. Jennifer Tilly and Dourif make such a bizarrely charming couple.10/10",Bride of Chucky
130,talarisw,"After ten years a deranged woman brings back to life Chucky, the toy doll possessed by the soul of mad serial killer, Charles Lee Ray.",8,24 July 2012,"I'm a big fan of horror movies, but this movie will always be controversial because some will never like the much more humorous approach this film takes over the previous three films that were straight horror films. But this is a really good movie if you're willing to except two things.. that this is a dark comedy not a horror film per say and that some of the major continuity from the previous films are disregarded. So if you're willing to except those two things, you can enjoy this film. Let's start with the story, Don Mancini wrote the story for all three films and wanted to reinvent the franchise, so while this film takes place where the last one left off and this film acknowledges the events of the last three. It also disregards certain things for the plot of this one. If anything this film is more of a sequel to the first film then the third one. This film is made on the 10th anniversary of the original horror classic ""Child's Play"" where a Chicago serial killer named Charles Lee Ray aka ""Lakesore Strangaler"" is gunned down by the police in a toy store and he uses a voodoo spell to transfer his wicked soul into a toy doll. Now ten years later Ray's old girlfriend and possible serial killing accomplice, Tiffany steals his doll parts from a police station and uses the same voodoo spell to resurrect Ray's soul in the doll. But in anger Chucky kills Tiffany and puts her soul into a doll. The two then go on a Mickey & Mallory like road trip to possess some human bodies. Now as a hardcore fan I have to point out how some things fit with the other films. Through out the series there always been inconstancy's with the voodoo spell, the words are the same but depending on the plot the spell can be very long or very short, the same here. The major plot for the first three films is that Chucky could only transfer his soul into the body of the first person who found out he was alive in the doll, which happens to be six years old Andy Barcley and if he didn't do so in a few days his soul would be trapped forever in the doll and in the process he would become more human on the inside of the doll, developing organs and what not. All of this is disregarded in this film. Here Chucky says he and Tiffany have to go to Hackensack New Jearsy to get an amulet called the heart of Dambella(the voodoo god) that was buried with Chucky's body as he wore it as a neck-less the night he was killed, this has nothing to do with the plots of the first three and not logical if you go by the first three but it would be very hard to continue that story with the introduction of Tiffany, also there's no worry from Chucky about having only a few days to find a body to transfer his soul into before it becomes trapped in the doll, so Mancini decided just keep the broad sense of the story arch of a good guy doll possessed by a voodoo worshiping killer. Another major difference is the change in tone, this film is very much a comedy with characters almost breaking the fourth wall and parodying the slasher genre much like the movie Scream did around this time and in the process Chucky's personality changes a bit. He's more mellow here, the first three portrayed him as a innocent looking toy doll with the mind of a foul mouth killer with a bad temper and the murders were shocking but here the murders are done with dark gallows humor. Neverless the film does a great job with what they wanted to do, a lot of the humor here was funny and to be honest even in the first three Chucky showed some dark humor. Ronny Yu did a great job with directing, the visual look, pace and camera shots were great. The best part of the movie is the opening, revealing Tiffany retrieving the Chucky doll and Rob Zombie's Living dead girl song playing in the opening credits. Don Mancini did a great job with creating the twisted relationship between Chucky's and Tiffany. Tiffany is in love/obsessed with Chucky while he likes her but doesn't need her in his life. The plot unfolds nicely you don't really know where it's going to go and the protagonists Jesse and Jade works well as a contrast to the evil Chucky & Tiffany. But the real stars are the sexy Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany and Brad Dourif returning for the fourth time as Chucky. The two have great chemistry together. Tilly was the perfect fit to be Chucky's ""bride"" and she looks really sexy especially when she wears that tight leather outfit in the opening. Dourif has perfected his Chucky laugh here it really sounds psychotic. John Ritter is fun as a jerky cop and Jade's dad. The film pays homage to Freddy Kruger and other slasher icons, Mickey& Mallory and The bride of Frankenstein. So while some including me would like to see a less comedic Chucky, and despite plot holes this is a great film for what it is, a horror comedy.",Bride of Chucky

132,jpasols,Corny comedy Horror at its Finest!!,9,24 April 2019,"Bride of Chucky (Child's Play 4) is obviously where Chucky teams up with his perfect match and longtime bride, Tiffany Valentine, played by Jennifer Tilly. After the events of Childs Play 3 when Chucky is shredded to pieces by that giant fan at the carnival, Tiffany finds Chucky's remains in an evidence depository where she then stitches the demonic doll back together and resurrects him. Later, after a few days of Chucky being back to life still trapped in his now scarred good guy doll container, kills Tiffany and transfers her soul into a cute bride doll. From there the now two killer doll couple goes on a hellish roadtrip with two human teenagers who must now escape Chucky and Tiffany's sinister wrath.
For a fourth installment in a slasher horror franchise, Bride of Chucky, is a pretty solid slasher flick. However this is the film where Chucky becomes stripped of his fear factors. He's definitely more comedic in this film and not in the twisted and creepy way like he was in the first 3 films (specifically more like the first 2 films). This movie is actually SO funny that it's actually legitimately categorized as a Comedy Horror film. But that being said I'm not saying this was a bad movie, it was still very entertaining and fun and gory and brutal. Just like how we all know Chucky to be, only this time he's helped by his equally crazy wife. Some of the death scenes in this film were awesome too! So that's another plus for this film such as the honeymoon hotel death scene (that was awesome!) And John Ritter getting a load of nails to his face making him look like Pinhead! Two of my favorite death scenes from Bride of Chucky. Another cool plus to this movie is Kathy Najimy has a small part in this movie and I love Kathy Najimy!! So it was awesome seeing her for 30 seconds in this movie!. Katherine Higel isnt one of my favorite actresses I think they could have found someone better for that role of Jade. So I do take a point away for casting Katherine Higel. Just my personal opinion. Jennifer Tilly however was an amazing choice to cast in this film. Thinking of it now I cant see anyone else playing the role of Tiffany. The casting for Tiffany must have been difficult to find, and thankfully they came across Jennifer Tilly! She played the part perfectly!!!. Like I mentioned in the Childs Play 3 review about how bad the acting was, Bride of Chucky improves with the acting. It's much better in this film, minus Katherine Higel.
Also just like I said about Childs Play 3 and how amazing the intro scene was! I feel the same way about the opening intro for Bride of Chucky!!! Watching Jennifer Tilly stitch Chucky back together while Rob Zombie's Living Dead girl is playing was fantastic!!! Childs Play 3 and Bride of Chucky hands down have the BEST opening credit intros!!!.
Not gonna dive into a whole lot more of this film, not a bad film at all, I truly think that Bride of Chucky is corny comedy horror at it's very FINEST!!! solid 9 out of 10 for me!. I recommend.",Bride of Chucky

Chucky is back (again) and he finds his old love, so he kills her and puts her soul into a body of a doll like he did to himself back in 1988. They go on a rampage, and look for Chucky's amulet/locket thing that he was wearing when he was shot down in 1988. Sounds like a really nice mystery kind of thing, right? Wrong. It is more like a comedy-thriller. If you cannot gain access to seeing this one, don't bother. It really is not that great, and that is coming from a die-hard Chucky fan.6/10",Bride of Chucky

I didn't like the fact that chucky and tiffany(in doll form) were trying to get the amulet to turn themselves human again(they could have used the voodoo magic spell to possess bodies) and try to possess a young couple who wanted to get married and run off together. I do think that Tiffany was right for chucky because they were both killers and studied voodoo magic in different ways and that Tiffany would kill people similar to the way that chucky kills people(tiffany slits throat of police officer+ chucky(second film)had tied a woman to a chair and slit her throat) and they think in different ways and they are both similar to one another. I suggest to any young couple to not watch this unless you both agree to do the same thing. If I had offended anyone let me know, if I did , Sorry! But I don't suggest this film to anyone younger than 12 yrs. or younger. But the film was great and I love this film a lot, but beware Chucky may come back for more victims!",Bride of Chucky
141,Hinopio,My second favorite in the series,10,26 July 1999,"This is what fans of the series were waiting for, a sequel that focused more on Chucky than it did on Andy, who became more and more of a wuss as he got older.  Brad Dourif seems to have lots of fun voicing Chucky, and will always make his lines memorable.  My favorite conversation in the movie is when Chucky first talks to Tiffany, and she asks how he's been and he replies ""Peachy!""  I don't know why, but it seemed so cool to hear Chucky say that.  Now onto some of the series' famous plot holes.  In this one, Tiffany had to chant Chucky's incantation to bring him back to life, but in the other two sequels he came to life once he was rebuilt.  I have no theory for this one.  The other was the previously unmentioned medallion.  Chucky could have transferred his soul into Andy before without it, but now to transfer his soul he needs this medallion.  (In the first movie, it was said that Chucky needed to transfer his soul into the first person who found out who he really was.)  My theory for this is as follows:  Chucky was still the same doll as he was at the end of part 3, so he'd have to find that little kid that he told his real name to in that, but it would be too much trouble to find him when he could just get his medallion and transfer his soul into whomever he wanted.  Tiffany needed it because the first person who knew who she really was is Chucky, and neither of them would want that, so they need to find the medallion.  Like the Evil Dead series, the first ones were both almost strictly horror, the middle ones added some dark comedy, and the last ones were both almost all comedy.  Bride of Chucky is loads of fun to watch, it is more entertaining than all of the other three, but the first one is still the best.  The girl who plays Jade is very pretty, but Jennifer Tilly is gorgeous as always.  While the ends of the first three left you wondering whether or not there would be a sequel, this one leaves almost no doubt.  If the next movie, which as of now is called Son of Chucky, is half as entertaining as this one, I'll be one of the first people in line to see it.",Bride of Chucky

One film earlier that wasn't possible and his victim had to be a child. At the same time this 90s teen horror is the best episode of the Chucky-franchise up to this point. Actually that's quite depressing for this franchise.",Bride of Chucky

I found it hard to watch most of it, so I'm seriously shocked by some of these ratings. It's not scary, it's not funny, it's not clever or witty - just stop. The starting was O.K., but the way it stretched out, I was very displeased. Avoid this movie if you can.",Bride of Chucky
147,Movieman-133,Surprisingly Wonderful,9,27 May 1999,"The movie was surprisingly wonderful especially considering the last sequel.  The third was dark,  and semi-interesting but it wasn't nearly as fun or enjoyable as this.   It is filled with comedic lines about Martha Stuart,  doll's anatomy,  masturbation, and it was actually done effectively during gruesome and disturbing images.    The movie wasn't scary or suspenseful and I'm sure that it wasn't the director's intention.  It was fun because of the silliness,    Jennifer Tilly's over the top and sexy performance.   The puppetry of the dolls were so well handled,  the movement of mouth,  lips,   tears in eyes,   knife in chest,  and the costumes. The dolls were just marvelous and it made the gruesome deaths more enoyable considering the fact that they were done by wonderful dolls.   The new Chucky look was great and Tiffany was very cute.   A few scenes with Chucky hugging the human Tiffany even made my father smile.  Jesse and Jade were surprisingly well- very attractive and the special effects were cool.  The ending was so unsuspected and the fact that they could make another as good is quite unlikely.    It may not be as suspenseful as movies like Halloween H2O or Urban Legend,  but it is certainly more fun!!!!",Bride of Chucky

However, I am the type of movie goer just like many others that change their minds upon multiple viewings.  I rented it again remembering all of the good parts and ended up loving the whole thing.The style and energy it carries is the best thing in the movie.  Dark scenes, high-bass Rob Zombie tunes, and a brilliant Jennifer Tilly in skimpy outfits!  If you look past the bad acting in this film, there isn't much not to like.  I mean, looking at it from a serious critic's point of view, the film can't climb up very high on the star scale, but the film is so fun and lovable, what the hell?  You'll love it, Chucky fans.

In the third one, Chucky is thrown into the fan, where his body explodes into many tiny pieces. But when Tiffany picks him up in the fourth one, he is missing a few parts, but still mostly together. He also had half his face sliced off in the third one, but its all there in the fourth one. Anyone else notice this? And under the parents guide for the film the say a couple fall through a glass floor which is not true. The mirror above their bed was broken by doll Tiffany and shattered over them.",Bride of Chucky
150,Isau,"Better than the other Child's Plays, but not great.",7,11 February 1999,"This ridiculous flick is one of those high budget movies that seems like it should have been a low one.  In some ways this can be amusing, but it also makes the film pretty predicitable in terms of who is going to die... The movie also tries to go for some weird kind of touchy/feely stuff that really doesn't belong there.  Everywhere you look in this thing there is somebody commited to some kind of relationship that seems impossible- the two lead characters, Tilly's character, and there's even a gay boy (the lead actress' best friend) tossed into the mix, taking over the much famed roll of the stereotypical black character in this type of movie.",Bride of Chucky
151,C.S.Wood,Funniest 'horror' movie I've ever seen,8,22 April 1999,"It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past.The plot wasn't great, but I really didn't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other. And the ending leaves it wide open for a 5th sequel (which I hear is in the works). Idle Hands premiers next week and looks to be another horror/comedy, but I doubt it'll top this one.",Bride of Chucky
152,sjhollen,Great movie,8,9 June 2020,"I think this movie is really funny. It took Chucky away from the horror elements of the child's play movies and made it a comedy, which I think the chucky movies should've been anyway. It has a lot of funny jokes and introduces Tiffany as a character. I always have a lot of fun with this one",Bride of Chucky
153,KillerRomance,Chucky's wife Ewww !,4,11 May 2017,"This is set shortly after the end of Child's play 3 when trailer park red woman, Tiffany Valentine (Tilly), claims the remains of her former Paramour Charles Lee Ray whom she thought he was going to propose to her by finding a very expensive chunky diamond ring which was one of his Trophies from a murder scene back in 1988. She raised him from the slumber and learnt the hurtful truth and imprisoned him, but Chucky escapes to kill her and placed her soul in a doll, then they kidnap a young good looking couple (Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile) and They have to get the Heart of Damballah magic amulet to be successful in soul transfusion.This film is short on scares and is more on the comedy side of the scenes and script. I like Jennifer Tilly but I am not fond of the Tiffany Doll, with torn pantyhose and Zelda from Terrahawks make up, looks like cross between Cameroon Diaz and a human frog hybrid - I don't think she matches up to Chucky. Or maybe I am being jealous because Brad Dourif said behind the scenes as he is working with Jennifer Tilly ""why didn't I get a girlfriend earlier?"" Ha! Am I bothered. And a scene where two dolls are having it off, how is that possible?I do miss the scary Chucky and I did not like the reinvented movie being just comedy, and I didn't like the Tiffany Doll.

155,bettyconway,My Favorite Chucky,9,12 May 2019,"Filled to the brim with style and laughs, Bride of Chucky is a highlight of the Child's Play franchise. The addition of Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany, Chucky's bride, adds a delicious layer of camp to the film which makes it endlessly watchable. Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile are great and likable as the teen lovers and Alexis Aquette gets a fun cameo as a Marilyn Manson-esque weirdo.Director Ronny Yu keeps the pace moving and a lot of his shot compositions are quite striking. For the 4th entry in a well worn franchise, it's nice to see there's still a little spark and creativity left.",Bride of Chucky
156,presence,Unexpectedly Hilarious,8,11 November 1998,"I walked into Bride of Chucky expecting to see a badly acted cheesy movie that would produce a few scares.  It delivered all of that and more.  And that was a good thing for me.  This cheesy flick is induced with sophisticated humor with themes such as marriage and domestic conflicts. What really made me hit the floor was the scene where Chucky and his doll wife made love.  This is by far the most original sex scene in Hollywood history.  There are many things in this movie, you probably won't see anywhere else and that's why I liked it so much.  Take a trip to the theater and treat yourself to some vulgar humor.",Bride of Chucky
157,DerSongsurfer,This was a strange experience...,5,18 January 2007,"It was accidentally that I came to watch this movie as I just couldn't fall asleep and, thus, decided to turn on the TV. Well, I thought it quite funny in the beginning but after a short while it just became creepy. I know, that this was the intention of the movie - but I thought it would happen in a different kind of way! It is really not the action or the characters or these nasty little puppets I was worried about, I can tell, because this was rather funny, I have to admit.... But watching PUPPETS having sex with each other... that is just too disgusting, even for my taste (And I can handle a lot!) It was not until the end, however, that I was completely shocked! A burnt puppet bearing a blood-thirsty child on a grave-yard, while her (the mother-puppet's) blood splatters all over the ground...That was horrible! I was really scared in the end, not by the film, but by the strange and absolutely sick minds of the writers and producers of the film, so I think it achieved what it was inteted to....",Bride of Chucky
158,Lunchbox-3,Chucky finally gets down to business,10,5 April 1999,"The Child's Play movies were pretty lame, I admit.  The first was fun, almost a parody of slasher flicks by making the villain a little plastic doll ... but Chucky's ""take no s**t"" attitude made him a memorable movie monster.  Parts 2 and 3 gave us little Chucky and lots of cookie-cutter characters, leaving their best asset untapped.  Well Child's Play is rechristened Bride of Chucky ... and now things really get rolling.  Don Mancini and Ronny Yu take the best of Chucky and build a brand-new kick-ass movie around him.  Sure, we all thought that bringing in a new ""bride"" for him would be cheesy ... and OK, it was, but it was an inspired origin as Tiffany joins Chucky to create one the greatest crime couples the cinema has ever seen.  Over the top action and some terrific black humor make this one a winner.  ""Don't F*** With Chuck!""",Bride of Chucky

160,sackleywhistle,Deadly dolls for the Scream generation,7,23 October 2003,"Before i write anymore, I must make a confession. I have never seen Child's Play 1 through 3. However, I am well aware of the history of the series, thanks in large part to the British ban of Child's Play 3 as a knee-jerk reaction to the Jamie Bulger killing. I came to Bride of Chucky expecting very little. A friend of mine said i should watch it and lent me the tape, so watch it i did. And i had a derned good time.This film wastes no time in letting you know where its coming from. In the opening shots, we see a police evidence lockup containing Jason's mask (of Friday the 13th fame) and Freddy's finger knives (of Nightmare on Elm Street infamy). From a locker, a cop pulls a bag containing the shredded remains of Chucky, the once goodguy doll who was possessed by the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray. It is obvious that Chucky will be resurrected, as were Jason and Freddy many times (most recently by Bride's director Ronny Yu, in the crossover Freddy vs Jason), and the setting is one of post-modern horror, as was fashionable at the time of the film's release, thanks to Scream and its disciples.The basic plot is this: Chucky's former girlfriend, Tiffany, resurrects Chucky via some needlework and voodoo, who then kills her (whilst she is watching Bride of Frankenstein, geddit?) and pours her soul into a female doll of Chucky's stature. Tiffany manages to convince her hunky neighbour - who is running away with the girlfriend whose Chief of Police uncle has banned him from seeing - to transport the two dolls to Hackensack, New Jersey, where the body of Charles Lee Ray is buried. Once there, the two dolls will exhume the body, claim back the voodoo amulet which will allow them to repossess human bodies, kill the two teens and take over their forms. Its pretty weak at best, but lets face it, you're only here for three things - the dolls, some laughs and some grisly murders. And that's what you get. The Tiffany doll is brilliant and Jennifer Tilly - though i did miss her voluptuous form filling the screen - brings her to life wonderfully. Brad Dourif gives Chucky - now horribly disfigured, thanks to Tiffany's stitch-up job - appropriate levels of menace and sick humour. And the deaths are pleasingly grisly and imaginative.What is good about this is that it never really pretends to be anything other than ridiculous. There are constant references to horror movie staples, such as Pinhead etc., and the script consistently pokes fun at the state of affairs. And the whole thing rattles along at a brisk old pace. At just over 80 minutes, there isn't much screentime when some absurd situation or some blood-letting isn't in the works. It just sets up the plot and the set-pieces and gets on with letting them play out much as you would expect.
All the people you dont really warm to get offed pretty quickly. Alexis Arquette, doing his best Marilyn Manson is the first to go, and while Chucky certainly puts him through some pain, the deaths get more elaborate as the film progresses. One of the best scenes sees Chucky blow up a cop car after getting stoned in the back of the teens' truck, and the reaction of a stoned spectator teen to Chucky crawling away and giving him the finger is priceless, and for me the biggest laugh of the film. It also has one of the films two impressive explosions, a minor note, but its always nice to see some good pyrotechnics in a b-movie.Some of the structuring is actually quite neat as well, with the two unaware teens gradually suspecting each other of the string of murders that seem to dog their roadtrip. And anytime someone new enters the fray, you can guarantee they'll get theirs. Perhaps the best death is a tie between the 'honeymoon sweets' murder and the resultant Final Destination-style splattering of one of the film's main characters. There's also a suitably perverse sex scene which was crying out to happen, topped off with a nice punchline, which sets up the film's final twist.And what a twist. Hardly unpredictable, but neat none the less, it tops off a sick and entertaining hour and a half effectively enough to warrant a further sequel. A date movie for horror fans, unless your woman is a) scared of murderous dolls, b) far too lofty for this sort of thing, or c)not into a bit of dark silliness. Otherwise, its a good little film, stylish and pacy enough to rise above Direct to Video horror and spineless dirge like I Know What You Did Last Summer. Give it a go - just don't expect The Silence of the Lambs. There's no Oscars here, and all the better for it.7/10",Bride of Chucky
161,rumblinglove,Simply Entertaining,9,31 July 2009,"The Child's Play film franchise was going downhill until this movie showed up. Bride Of Chucky was a very enjoyable movie. It's funny, much violent then the previous movies. This movie was also new in the series to have sex which wasn't even mentioned in the previous films. The story is better in teleplay then lines.What was also new and eccentric in this movie, a sex scene between two dolls.I just can't get enough from this movie. I rented it and owned it for a week back in 2001 in VHS and just watched it about 24 times. I also had a familiar history with this movie towards my fox.

163,gold712,"good, but not the best",6,30 January 2000,"I thought Bride of Chucky was a good film, but it lacks the thrills and excitment which made the other three so popular. Andy's name doesn't even get mentioned. The scenario in which the whole movie takes place in is weird. The music is good, but doesn't mix in. However, this movie is hilarious! It's extremely funny with massive foul-mouthed humor! It shouldn't even fall under the horror genre. It's completely a comedy. I recommend this film to people who enjoy bloody comedies.Rating: 6 out of 10",Bride of Chucky
164,abb13,Awesome!,10,23 June 2002,GREAT MOVIE! Chucky is by far the funniest character in a movie. Jennifer Tilly (Tiffany) makes this movie even better! Well before Chucky died Tiffany and him were together. But like ten years later Tiffany gets Chucky back (as a doll) and brings him back to life. It was a great movie!Scary and definetly funny (only because Chucky!)10/10,Bride of Chucky
165,BobforTrish,Chucky's Chimeric Chuckles,9,9 February 2014,"Normally by the time a franchise has reached the fourth instalment most people involved from the (paid) scriptwriters through to the (paying) public are beginning to lose heart. This is an excellent exception to that rule.The premise of the film is that the soul of the late Charles Lee Ray is trapped inside Chucky the doll. Charles' former girlfriend Tiffany plans to retrieve the doll and by use of magic, bring it back to life. If only life (and death in this case) could be so simple! Once revived, Chucky would much rather occupy Mr Ray's body, which was buried with the amulet required to complete this transformation. By this time of course, due to the treacherous machinations of both Tiffany and Chucky, they are now both dolls. What follows is a road movie as the pair kill time and people whilst implicating two naïve star-struck lovers Jesse and Jade who finally piece together what is happening.From the opening scene as corrupt cop Bailey makes his way through an evidence room to the Grand Guignol finale played out in a graveyard there are nods to various kindred films and characters from Michael Myers to The Exorcist, from Friday the 13th to Pinhead, throwing in clips from 'Bride of Frankenstein' and 'Murder, She Wrote' and an hilarious reference to Martha Stewart.The entertainment value comes largely from the relationship between two deadly dolls, their snappy one-liners, love-hate relationship and competitiveness in murderous invention.Director Ronny Yu and writer Don Mancini keep both action and dialogue pacey and ensure an excellent balance of comic moments and sanguinary shocks. At an hour and a half good editing ensures no outstaying of welcome and the accompanying music tracks from Rob Zombie, Slayer, et al is suitably heavy. Special and visual effects are extremely well done and almost seamless. Of the acting, most of the cast do what is necessary despite being upstaged by the deadly dolls. Special mention should go to Jennifer Tilly for her dangerously beguiling femme fatale.Interestingly, with only minimal references to previous films in this series, it is quite possible to treat this as a stand-alone item and derive just as much entertainment value from it.",Bride of Chucky
166,Joe 25,This movie is cool!,10,18 October 1998,"I love this movie!  Chucky is his old self again, and this time has a female partner in crime named Tiffany.  They make a cool team.

And so does the soundtrack",Bride of Chucky
167,ecto216,"weakest of the series, but better than the average horror movie",5,28 October 2002,"Yikes! What happened here!? Actually, there is a good explanation for this mediocre addition to the Child's Play legacy, if I may be so bold to call it a legacy. While BOC isn't the worst horror film ever to come along, it certainly is not the best. Here's how it breaks down.First of all, there are some good things with this film. It pays homage to other great horror films in hilarious ways, much to the effect of Batman Forever actually, if you remember the scene in the prison where all of the prisoner's personal belongings are being stored. Second of all, I love the way chucky keeps getting reinvented. The great thing about the Child's Play series is how they keep up with the overall story. Unlike Friday the 13th, which just gave up on how they should keep bringing Jason back to life, Child's Play always offers a reasonable and somewhat believable explanation why the good guy doll comes back to murder. Plus, Chucky looks really wicked in this film. I felt that with #3, he looked too much like an animated puppet, and with this one, he was completely fixed. There are also some cool death scenes, which are always welcome. But I'm afraid humor and death, while being key to a horror movies success, is not always the answer. A little thing arises called `plot' which this movie completely ignores.
Follow the timeline back to the original Child's Play. Serial Killer Charles `Chucky' Lee Ray was aged in his late thirties early forties I'd say. And since no exact date was ever given in the film, for arguments sake, since the movie was made in 1988, lets say the events in the movie were also taking place in 1988. Lets also assume that Charles was 40 years old. As we all know, Andy Barkley is 6. Now fast-forward to Child's Play 2. Andy is about the same age, so Chucky is as well, so he's still 40 years old. Then in Child's Play 3, Andy is 16. so add 10 years on to Chucky's life and that makes him 50. Bride of Chucky takes place 10 years after Child's Play 3 so now Chucky is 60. Tiffany, Chucky's girlfriend, has been waiting to get her hands on the doll because back in Child's Play 1, even though we never saw her, she was Chuck's main squeeze. But Tiffany is only in her late 20's! So let's say she's about 28. Subtract her current age, 28, from the timeline years of events , 20, and presto! That would mean while she was going out with Chucky back in Childs Play, she was only 8 years old!!! Can you say `makes no sense'?As one could see, flaws galore! There's a scene where Chucky and his doll bride are sitting together in the mobile home talking, and this is really where it hit me that the series was dying. Between the aging Chucky doll and the new Tiffany doll, which looks like a Puppet Master reject, it became obvious how silly it looked! Aside from that, this movie suffers mainly from 90's pop/goth culture; Heavy Metal music with Chucky head banging? Come on! And further more, while there are some cool new death scenes, Chucky is an 80's character. I wouldn't want to see Pinhead put up a gun and kill people!! I want to see his signature chains! I don't want Michael Myers to all of a sudden use a flamethrower, I want to see his trademark knife. Chucky is supposed to stab, strangle, and shoot his way to victory, not blow up cars and set booby traps with nails! Child's Play belongs in the 80's and should never have been modernized to fit current day culture.
Overall, it's better than some of the stuff that comes direct to video and gets shoved in the horror section at the video rental store. But it does happen to be the weakest of the series. Overall, on the horror movie scale, 5 out of 10.",Bride of Chucky

It's nothing like the other Childs' Play movies which were good in their own right, but this one is different.  Different in a positively excellent way. I saw this movie expecting to be bored but was amazed at how funny it was. It is not a horror film.  In fact, I don't think it's an accident that it turned out to be a comedy, I firmly believe that they intended this to be a comedy/horror film (with emphasis on the comedy) right from the start.  I am also a Jennifer Tilly fan, and getting an eyeful of her was nice but she also really made the perfect ""bride of chucky"".

176,movieman-74,One of the best films in the series and one of the best horror films of this year!,10,28 December 1998,"The honeymoon is gonna be killer...Child's Play 4: Bride Of Chucky was the fourth movie in the series of Child's Play or Chucky films that started back in '88. This is the one film out of the series which takes it a little, well, not so series and makes what I call a fun film. I've always been a fan and I even have a site and know of a ton of sites. Although Bride Of Chucky is a fun film it still has its suspense and scares, not as many as the previous 3 movies but still some. This is a great movie, even if you don't like the series you will either scream or laugh at this movie garunted. The movie was rated ""R"" for it's gore and violence mainly but also for it's content, language, and showing a doll's butt. Lot's of guilty fun here...an all American kinda movie. Be on the lookout for a sequel next year called Child's Play 5: Son of Chucky which a deal has been made but production has yet to start as of today (Dec. 28, 1998) You may read this at a very later date though so just telling you. Bride of Chucky gets ***!!",Bride of Chucky
177,meydianarizki,Who says it's fun and funny?,1,29 October 2020,"Funny how?
There are people who laughed their head off with this and the makers of this movie are really proud of it. Even the actors are excited if you watch them in interviews talking about the movie. But I didn't feel the excitement. It's not really horror, it's not really comedy, it's a mix of both.A mix that doesn't entirely work out for me, but maybe it's something for you. If you're a fan of the series, you'll obviously gonna like it a bit more than I do.It's no necessary to know the other parts to understand the movie, but if you do, you might get a few more laughs out of it!",Bride of Chucky
178,antonioeku2,Refreshing entry in the Chucky series,7,9 October 2007,"Director Ronnie Yu has entered the building. Seven Years after Chucky was sent spiraling into a huge fan and chopped to bits we get Childs Play 4...or Bride of Chucky. We open with a former girlfriend of Charles LeRay named Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly). She gets word of her former love's whereabouts in the body of the doll and rescues the dolls remains from the police depository. After a Satanic voodoo ritual she resurrects Chucky and it's on again! Chucky reveals to Tiffany that he had never planned on marrying her and this nerves her which leads to her demise at the hands of Chucky who also transfers her soul into a Bride Doll. So the two are now on the same level.Chucky reveals to her that they need the ""Heart of Demballa"", which Charles was wearing the night he was gunned down, in order to transfer their bodies back into human form once and for all. So it's off to the races as Tiffany tricks her neighbor Jesse (Nick Stabile) into taking the dolls to New Jersey. Jesse uses this as an opportunity for his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) and himself to make a run from her over protective police chief uncle (John Ritter). So the two are off with the two murderous dolls tearing up the country all the while...and all the while the police are hot on the trail of Jesse and Jade thinking the committed the murder. Definitely fresh to see Chucky doing something besides tormenting Andy Barclay. Definitely the most original of the series. Definitely a wow of an ending that sets up the follow up ""Seed of Chucky"" in a great way.",Bride of Chucky

Take it from me, I did not want to like this movie, but it was, as another reviewer put it, just a guilty pleasure. To me, the plot of this movie sounded ridiculous, and the title even more so, but I recommend giving it a shot. No movie about a killer doll and his killer doll girlfriend is going to be a masterpiece, but the people who made this film actually did about as good a job as anyone could have with it, and the end product wasn't too shabby. This movie is more of a comedy than anything, and as far as B-horror movies go, it actually has one of the better scripts out there, I kid you not. There were a few moments when I caught myself laughing out loud and rewinding scenes. Now don't go me wrong, some parts are silly, some stupid. However, in the end, I feel confident you will be surprised with how much effort went into this movie to actually make it entertaining and not a complete, retarded mess. Sometimes movies with low expectations that end up being a fun ride are the best rides of all.",Bride of Chucky

I've got nothing against Chucky or horror movies, I loved the first Child's Play and appreciate a good horror flick now and then, but this was just pathetic.  Even the so-called ""funny"" scenes in this movie were so atrociously bad that I couldn't even laugh in pity!  I would have walked out except I saw it with about 5 other people and I didn't drive.

Yeah, no one's going to confuse it with ""Citizen Kane"", but its constant humor and utter disregard for convention make ""Bride Of Chucky"" a treat.  It's almost as good as either of the ""Scream""s, and is much better than any of the ""Scream"" wannabes (""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""Disturbing Behavior"", ""Halloween: H20"", ""Urban Legend"".)

Naturally, I didn't want to miss Chucky-films, either, so I rented ""Bride of Chucky"". It definitely was NOT worth my time.Why? First of all, the beginning of the film was like from a low-budget, awfully made ""I want everyone to see my tits!""-film. The end of the film was better, but I found it funny instead of terrifying. Chucky couldn't scare me a bit.I haven't seen other Chucky-movies yet, but I really, REALLY hope they are much better than this piece of ****. I can only recommend ""Bride of Chucky"" for those of you who like to see breasts, that's the only thing this movie had ""enough"" of (actually way too much of it, this really spoils this film). This movie doesn't know anything about horror, it's more like a black comedy to me. A really BAD one too!",Bride of Chucky

This movie had different qualities than the originals of course, and that is comedy. Bride of chucky was barely scary, but was extremely funny. Many people said that this destroyed Chuckys scary edge but he still looks as scary as ever. Even though This movie was not scary doesn't mean that the movie was bad, not at all this movie was great. Chucky was sort of laughing matter to begin with anyway; man is dying he transfers his soul into a doll, then as the doll gets back at old enemys and kills anyone in his way, sounds like a funny story. This movie sort of shows the real side of chucky, a complete laughing matter. Still though the movie was great and should be rented at least twice a year.",Bride of Chucky

I've never had so much fun in the theater before. The crowd and my friends and I cheered for our little hero Chucky and his new bride Tiffany who slash their way to the top in this hilarious movie. Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly make an awesome pair and must have had fun making this film together. Watch for Martha Stewart jokes and one hell of a funny sex scene between Chucky and his bride. Chucky definitely gets lucky with this fun little romp in the theater. Run to go see this movie today!!! I'm going again next week!!!!!,Bride of Chucky
190,Andy-391,very stupid and ridiculous-I loved it.,7,28 August 1999,"This new installment to the Child's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing Chucky giveing him the finger and saying ""rude f--king doll"" and lots of references to the series: ""you can kill me but I'll come back.  I always come back"".  The movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it.  This is totally different from all other films in the series.  It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones.  Chucky seems to interfere with characters from another movie, a soap opera about two teens running off together to get married.  There is one cool elaborate death scene involving broken glass and water spilling everywhere.  The movie is very gory, very funny, and has pop culture references from Martha Stewert to Jerry Springer.  DO NOT SEE THIS ONE BEFORE YOU SEE THE OTHER THREE,.  It will really ruin the effect since the first one is truly scary.  Lots of guilty pleasure fun and silliness.",Bride of Chucky

192,malefor0001,"Chucky Gets Lucky, and we Get Luckier!",10,14 October 2010,"By far, the film was the most superior in the Child's Play Series. It was amazingly hilarious and refreshing. Unlike Child's Play 3, we didn't repeat the boring process of Chucky ""Goes after Andy for revenge and his body"". We had a fresh array of characters, a brilliant Cliffhanger and a new Killer Doll. The film really displays well how Chucky, like the rest of us, can have an relationship, and how he is still Human, despite being a Doll. Good examples of his Humanity are when he listens to music in the car, treats Tiffany like a House-Slave and has Sexual Intercourse with Tiff. These display that Chucky is a Human being, and while some fans disliked this, I say the film was pure comic genius, comedic and horrifying. Inventive new murders were used such as the Champange Bottle and Celing Mirror, the Nasils in the Car and the Bus hitting that poor fellow. The film ended amazingly as Glen appeared to burst out of Tiffany's womb, leaving a good idea for a sequel. That is until Seed came along.",Bride of Chucky

Bride of Chucky is a funny addition to the series and a whole lot better than it's 1991 predecessor it's great to see Chucky for a fourth round and coming back, after a few years of silence. We have Jesse and Jade as the newest people, a cop named Neddlenose, a nosy uncle cop, and with moments of calming down and other moments with scary stuff.8 out of 10Bride of Chucky is a great addition to the Child's Play series! - John Bartus",Bride of Chucky
194,gunrising2,Who thought this was a good idea?!?!?!?!,1,27 July 2013,"I absolutely, positively, hated this movie. I look at Child's Play 3(My favorite of the 5) and then i look at this. Bride of Chucky has to be the definition of bad, horrible, scat, and every swear word you can think of. First off, how could Chucky possibly, and i mean possibly, come back?!?!? In the end of Child's Play 3, we see him literally get shredded to bits and pieces. Just imagine a bomb going off on an allied soldier during the Invasion of Normandy. Although it may not get the point across, in short, parts of Chucky here, there and everywhere(bravo to those who caught the song reference). I also didn't quite enjoy the scar look. Chucky was just fine the way he looked in the first three movies so, why even change it. He was a lot more scarier as an innocent looking doll, and was able to get around. The way he looked in this movie just made me laugh. However, i did enjoy the kill scenes in this movie, particularly, the scene where they kill the cop. This is not the worst movie in series thats a fact because, an even more horrid movie awaits 7 years later.....",Bride of Chucky

Good Job, writers! I was entertained most of the two or some hours watching this. The acting was good enough as well. All in all this movie deserved my 8 out of 10 stars, it was just that, 8 out of 10, very good!

197,Hobbes01,The Second Best,7,1 November 1998,"Bride of Chucky was the second best Child's Play movie. I say second because the first one was the best. The Chucky and Tiffany puppets look so real! Chucky doesn't even look like a doll. He looks more like an operated on two year old toddler who escaped the hospital. Chucky looks more realistic too. Not exactly like a doll, because real dolls don't have tongues or the likes, but like a human like I said before. Of course, Chucky is turning human through the doll like he was doing in the third movie. The only thing I would have loved to see is either A) Andy or B) some refrence to Andy. When Chucky talks about needing to get into a body, he doesn't mention Andy at all. Oh, well. It's a very good movie!

I was expecting a boring dull 4th part too the series, but i was surprised. This movie was surprisingly good, and i found it to be quite funny. There was a lot of dark humor, and the idea to have two dolls was a good way to spice things up. The two dolls worked well together and added a bonnie and clyde type fell to the movie. Overall it was very good for a 4th movie in the series, with some gruesome death scenes (just watch the marilyn manson type get killed at the beginning, not to mention john ritter getting a face full of nails). Applauds to the writers for spicing things up, and the ending although i found it a bit strange leaves room for yet ANOTHER sequel...maybe ""son of chucky""!!!",Bride of Chucky

203,thomasedwardlawrence,Always a Bridesmaid...,7,17 April 2019,"If you're going to review this picture, you have to understand what it is - and it's not a horror film. It's a twisted romance about two deeply troubled individuals, who happen to be evil dolls. Which is the point - it's a meta-analysis of the slasher genre, deconstructing its parts and putting in its place a genuinely romantic ideological alternative to the otherwise basic and fundamentally limited slasher genre - self-aware romance and comedy. It totally works as a funny, genre-conscious (deliberately aping moments of Bride of Dracula, for instance) take on what the characters would be and feel like in this bizzaro-alternate universe. Most importantly, it's funny and you care about the characters. It isn't scary, but each kill is creative and original. Horror enthusiasts will embrace with open arms, but the average consumer will have trouble adjusting to what the film is actually attempting to do. 7/10 - funny, sporadically creative but ultimately dependant on knowledge of genre tropes to sustain itself.",Bride of Chucky

I've always been a fan of both the Child's Play movies, Bride, seed, etc... and that of the Problem Child trilogy. I always thought there was something similar about the movies, but guaranteed my theory when I saw Child's Play 2. In that, Andy is seeing this ""foster parents"" home for the first time. His views on the home, the coloring, even down to the clowns they put in his bedroom were ripped and spoofed into Problem Child. Even the situation where Andy's ""foster"" father thinks he's been killing and wants to get rid of him, mirrors John Ritter's response. The only difference is, John Ritter has an actual sociopath for a kid, rather than a doll. Too bad, lol. Makes for humorour spoofing, though.Am I totally off on this?

First there is the artwork of the very good director Ronny Yu, who we still have in mind from A chinese ghost story. His visual style is in a wired kinda way comparable to Francis Ford Coppola. Also the voices of Chucky an Tiff are very impressive. I´ve also liked the screenplay very much, especially the scene in which Tiff throws the Champaignbottle in the ceilingmirror.I give it a 9.0 vote for funny, gory and progressive entertainment.

Who does a fine job portraying the doll and giving it her sense of charisma and style. The plot may sound stupid to many but oddly enough: it works. Every detail falls right into place making the films plot seem somewhat legible. The human characters are interesting sometimes even funny.

It has some very gory pieces in the film, but not bad enough to make you sick.  In this one he has a female doll companion, hence the name.  If you liked the first three then you'll love this, go watch it!",Bride of Chucky
223,Casablanca700,For the easily frightened dweeb in your life,1,12 September 2006,On a regular basis I flush things that are more frightening than Bride of Chucky. I don't know what kind of timid geek you have to be to be frightened of anything in this stupid and over-hyped film. If you're scared by this movie make sure you never watch Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer or that abominable snowman will give you nightmares for weeks. There's not even any stylishly dark humor in this film unless you count the fact that those dorky dolls are more likely to make you laugh than have any other impact on you. Movies like this are for people who like to pretend they're watching something scary but really aren't.There is absolutely nothing in this movie that would frighten or creep out anyone who doesn't still sleep with a light on!,Bride of Chucky

225,Myoglobin,Revival of Chucky SPOILER!!,10,27 October 2004,"I have been an avid fan of Child's Play since its start. The first movie was truly a classic. After that it just sort of got boring...pretty quick.Bride of Chucky was responsible not only for reviving Chucky's status, but it also took the character on a better path. Bride of Chucky took the total horror basis for its three predecessors, and became more of a horror/comedy.From start to finish this movie is enjoyable by fans of Chucky and anyone who enjoys funny movies where people die horrible deaths at the hands of a homicidal doll couple.The movie introduces Tiffany, the romantist who revives Chucky after 7 years, with hope of marriage, but instead, Chucky breaks her heart. After breaking out of his planpen prison, Chucky kills Tiffany, puts her soul in a doll, and the two take advantage of a young couple to get to Jersey.After some fun on the road, a love scene..., and some gruesome deaths, the movie climaxes in a graveyard, where both Chucky and Tiffany die.This movie is truly a great flick to watch anytime...9.9/10",Bride of Chucky
226,Karen0662-1,I really like this movie lol!!!,8,23 September 2005,"I just want to say I've been a Barbie doll collector in my life and I really loved the ""Barbiesque"" transformation sequence of the Jennifer Tilly character doll lol!!! This is definitely more of a comedy/horror. Lot's of fun!!! I just bought this DVD, I've wanted it for some time now, just in time for Halloween coming lol. I still have to see Seed of Chucky. My son's name is Chuckie, he is 22 now, and when he was small the first of these movies came out and I had to put my hands over his eyes in a hurry one day in a video store and rush him outside so as not to scar him for life from the hideous Chucky did it movie poster with a knife! So, its come along way for me to say I like this movie in the series lol! Though I still would not want a small child to see it, of course. Enjoy!",Bride of Chucky
227,RhysDickenson,Funny Addition to the Series,6,25 August 2013,"After 8 long years of the Child's Play series left untouched, Bride Of Chucky was released. The spirit of Charles Lee Ray lies dormant in the Good Guys Doll, Chucky, which he had possessed and murdered numerous people in the form of Chucky the Doll in the previous Child's Play films. A woman named Tiffany (ex girlfriend) finds the Chucky Doll and is driven to resurrect one of the most feared and legendary serial killers in the US using a voodoo spell. Charles Lee Rays' spirit is awakened and he manipulates Tiffany with his cheeky charm, leaving her vulnerable for him to strike. Chucky escapes captivation and transfers Tiffany's soul into another Doll. Chucky then mentions that there is an amulet in existence that can return them to human form, but it is buried in New Jersey. The pair set on a psychotic, murderous journey in doll form and mutilate any human being who comes in their path. Overall, the story-line is dark, crude and humorous, and Chucky seems to be as cheeky as he was in the originals. If you are a fan of the Child's Play series, it is definitely worth a watch. Personally, the movie soundtrack for this film was my favourite out of the whole series, but it lacks the TRUE horror that the other Child's Play films create as the script and acting is a lot more light-hearted. Overall, I give this film a 6 out of 10.",Bride of Chucky

230,holodoc,They brought him back in grand style...,10,25 October 1998,"I am a child of the 80's, so I grew up being scared out of my wits by classics like Chucky, Jason, and Freddy.  I think the makers of this film went all the way!  It was the perfect re-introduction of the Chuckster into this decade, and to him, I say, welcome!",Bride of Chucky
231,Evan-13,Is this a comedy?,9,17 October 1998,"Bride of Chucky, now can you think up a name that's going to turn off movie goers to see a movie? Well let me tell you this, the title doesn't mean everything. Being a fan of the Childs Play series, I was highly anticipating this movie. I didn't know what to expect, what I got was a hilarious romp with my favorite movie villain Chucky that left me saying, is this a comedy? sure there was a few killings here and there but nothing very scary. I would call this an Action/Comedy/Horror. This movie took what made the Childs Play series so poular, Chucky's foul mouth and dirty jokes, and turned it into a movie for Chucky fans everywhere. If you're a fan of the series or you like a movie with a lot of dark humor see Bride of Chucky.",Bride of Chucky
232,Master-20,Great Horror/Action Flick,9,19 October 1998,Excellent ending to this best sequel in the Chucky series.,Bride of Chucky
233,shocker-2,A great 4th edition to Child's Play...,10,19 October 1998,"Bride of Chucky is a great sequel to the Child's Play series.  It's been awhile since Chucky's been on the big screen, but now that he's finally back, it seems that the series couldn't have gotten any better!  The plot was great and the story-line definitely hyped in a lot of 90's like content.  Great job and can't wait for Chucky 5!",Bride of Chucky
234,movieman-81,A great new dimension to the child's play series,10,25 January 1999,"Seeing this movie I was suspecting a typical slasher with no plot but Ronny Yu's new perspective on chucky brought back a whole new experience to the chucky saga. With the animatronic effects improved and the use of Tiffiny Chuck's sidekick This film puts in something to this film that was never there in previous sequels: personality. Apart from focusing on Andy the victim from the first film, this film portrays great chemistry between chucky and tiffany and with its stylish filming, clever humour and shocking death sequences this is the best of chucky yet.",Bride of Chucky
235,pope-6,one of the dumbest and laughable movies of the year,2,25 March 1999,"This is my first comment for this site but I felt a movie this bad needed a warning for people to stay away. Yes my friends it's a typical carry on of a movie series that should listen to itself (""Chucky, he's so 80's""). It thinks it's scary, but it's not. It thinks it's funny, but oh boy is it not. As long as Horrors continue on its downwards spiral we will have to put up with crap like this. Limp directing a poor poor poor script serve to make this in contention, along with ""I still don't care what you did last summer"" as the worst of the next generation horrors.",Bride of Chucky
236,whocares-4,What a load of garbage!!!!,3,6 August 1999,I have never in my life gotten so much less than i expected from a movie. I thought it would be at least a little scary... I was wrong. I thought it might be a little bit funny... I was wrong. This movie was a waste of a fraction of my life!,Bride of Chucky
237,Meg13,My Absolute FAVORITE!!!,10,7 June 1999,"I know this movie isn't for everyone, and I won't push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...It was the best I have ever seen!!!  It was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't know what was gonna happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!",Bride of Chucky
238,chris-799,better than expected,9,31 December 1999,"I was expecting this to be just like the others, tries to be scary- ends up looking silly. Somewhere along the line the writers must have realised this and so took the film in a totally different direction basically ignoring the other films. This feels like a different film rather than the fourth entry in the Child's Play series. The new idea works making this the best in the series by far.",Bride of Chucky
239,Fatness-is-rampant,This movie is about a pair of murderous dolls who take a road trip.,10,14 August 2006,"I love this movie. It strangely appeals to me. I think its hilarious. Well it has told me I have to write 10 lines so I will continue. I think It's better directed than its sequel, Seed of Chucky. Ronny Yu directed this one and the writer Don Mancini directed the seed of Chucky. No offense to Don Mancini but I think that Ronny Yu did a better job of the Bride Of Chucky. Brad Dourif is the best choice for the voice. He has the right voice for a manic doll. Likewise with Jennifer Tilly- She is the only choice for the voice of a murderous doll. Also I prefer this one to the first 3 movies. Child's Play,Child's Play 2 and 3. I think Chucky is an ingenious character also who has evolved over the course of the movies. In this movie he has developed a sense of humour which is slightly chauvinistic but good.",Bride of Chucky
240,adamggosse,Chucky gets lucky!,10,6 October 2020,This is my favourite horror movie of all time. Chucky and Tiffany entertain like no other making this a classic slasher/comedy. I really think it deserves a higher rating.,Bride of Chucky
241,xakeryb,Refreshing,8,7 October 2021,This is such a refreshing watch after the tired and repetitive third chapter.,Bride of Chucky
242,parame-77105,Maybe the best one,10,26 October 2021,"This might be the best film in the franchise, after 2 sequels that was just slightly altered versions of the first one, this brings somethings completely different and new. Very refreshing.",Bride of Chucky
243,leticialegria77,prepare yourself for the most romantic scene ever...,7,2 August 2002,"This 3rd sequel has nothing to do with the other movies of ""Child´s Play."" After the first one, inspiration was hard to find. We could bare part 2, but 3 was just 2 bad. Don Mancini (now preparing part 5 with Chucky's son) didn't think he would continue after ""Child's Play 3"" in 1991, but because of the success of the interesting ""Scream"" and the terrible ""I know what you did last summer"", he decided to bring the Good Guy back to life. ""Bride of Chucky"" is a very funny movie. Brad Dourif, who will be in ""The Lord Of The Rings-The Two Towers"" as Grima Wormtongue, does a excellent job and invents some hilarious one-liners. The black humour is just a chiller. The best part is when Chucky sees himself in the grave. But we must not forget Jennifer Tilly, who turns out to be an fine partner for Dourif, and who will be back in ""Child's Play 5"" (2003). The story is not so important (what story?), but to see Chucky and Tiffany making love is the best thing that could ever happen to us in a horror movie, right? It's just the most romantic scene I have ever seen. I am curious about what Chucky Jr. will look like... Anyway, he has some wonderful parents. I can recommend ""Bride of Chucky"", because besides all the humour the ""bloodfans"" will not be disappointed.",Bride of Chucky
244,AhDeDuoui_Damballa,My comment on Bride of Chucky,1,17 August 2004,"I have been a huge fan of the CP movies since the first one came to Theaters. I can honestly say that I have seen the first 3 films more than 480 times. I can even translate chucky's chant to English, as It is a combination of Jamaican,Old-world Latin,and Old-world French.As a true fan of these films, I must say that TBOC was without a doubt the worst film ever created. It was a joke! The only thing that made the movie remotely tolerable was hearing Brad Dourif's voice. How could anyone like this horrible, plot-less movie? It's like having George Clooney play Batman....kinda ruins the series. does anyone agree with me on this?",Bride of Chucky
245,ismailisinsane,Okay movie with some very funny moments along with blood and entertainment.,6,29 August 2016,"At this point in the Chucky franchise i don't think any one cares if Chucky achieves his goal in the end we're drawn in by the black comedy and how enjoyable the character is. The plot may not be the best nor is it meant to be taken seriously. I personally prefer this movie over the first Childs play as in that film Chucky was nowhere near as comedic, instead we were meant to take him seriously. What they did with the sequels was great and makes the rest of the films enjoyable and at the same time sticking to the horror genre with some intense scenes. This is especially the case in this film.I would recommend it.",Bride of Chucky
246,mch-43811,"Slightly funny, not the least bit scary",4,27 October 2016,"Up until around 20 minutes into the movie, I thought that this could be something interesting and enjoyable; then comes a major twist that is unbelievably predictable, followed by some of the worst acting performances I have ever seen in a ""horror"" movie. The animatronics on the puppets does not look bad for the most part, the ending is original and, after having to hear a bunch of arguments that come out as repetitive, is the biggest relief I got during watching. Some of the death scenes are pretty boring and don't make sense whatsoever, and the characters being killed are either the most unlikeable ones or the ones that you hardly get to know. Could be interesting for someone who is a wicked fan of the franchise, but not worth it if you are looking for a good horror comedy movie.",Bride of Chucky
