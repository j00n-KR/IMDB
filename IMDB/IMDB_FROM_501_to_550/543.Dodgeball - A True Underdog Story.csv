0,TheLittleSongbird,"Silly but hugely enjoyable, much better than I thought it would be",7,26 April 2010,"Well what can I say? Hugely enjoyable, silly yes but manages to be enjoyable. Yes with a predictable story that occasionally loses its lustre and some flimsy gags and a number of clichés. But what makes it watchable is the hilarious script, the good-natured spirit of the film, likable and relateable characters and fun performances from Vince Vaughan(really cool in one of his better movies- and performances as well), Ben Stiller, Rip Torn and Hank Azaria with an amusing cameo from David Hasselhoff. The direction is also good, and the film is nice to look at with a cool soundtrack. Overall, not perfect but watchable and funny. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
1,SnoopyStyle,Funny Physical Comedy,8,3 November 2013,"White Goodman (Ben Stiller) is a raging douche and owner of Globo Gym. Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn) is a slob and the owner of Average Joe's Gymnasium. Peter LaFleur needs $50,000 or else he'll lose his gym to Goodman. LaFleur and the slackers at his gym figure on winning a dodgeball tournament. Goodman forms his own team to stop LaFleur.This is a stupid comedy. It's the good kind of stupid. We're allowed to laugh at the stupidity. That's a gift in the comedy world. Ben Stiller goes way out there as the amped up physical fitness guru. He has a good scene pawing his real life wife Christine Taylor. Even the dodgeball scenes are great. This is great slapsticks.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
2,gavin6942,One of the Best Comedies of the Last Decade,9,13 August 2010,"A local gym is going under, largely because the owner refuses to collect fees from his clients. But when a larger rival gym threatens to take him over, it becomes personal... and unorthodox methods of raising money are used. The one decided on: dodgeball.Who is Rawson Marshall Thurber? That is the real question here. You have probably never heard of him, and other than ""Dodgeball"" his projects are not well known. Yet, he wrote and directed this film -- flawlessly -- and cast some of the best actors in the business. Plenty of big names here, and some great character actors. How did he do that?I have no idea. But what I do know is that this film is genuinely hilarious. The jokes are well-written, and well-delivered by the cast. Some of the best parts come from the cameos of some pop culture icons, and Jason Bateman's sports commentator role, Pepper Brooks, is his best role to date (even better than ""Arrested Development""). This is a must-see film for all fans of comedy.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
3,lee_eisenberg,There was an article about Joel David Moore in The Oregonian two days ago.,10,21 December 2005,"""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is just plain old goof-ball-ism, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. It has the Average Joes gym going up against Globo Gym in a tournament. The Average Joes gym is clearly a working class gym, while Globo Gym's slogan is ""We're better than you, and we know it!"" Maybe for the most part, this is a recycled triumph of the underdog story - where against all odds the ragtag team defeats the big guys with all the money - but the performances carry it to excellence. Ben Stiller, as Globo Gym owner White Goodman, makes a really funny slime-ball. Vince Vaughn, as Average Joes gym owner Peter La Fleur, creates a very commendable character. Christine Taylor, as reporter Kate Veatch, is what a reporter should be. Rip Torn, as trainer Patches O'Houlihan, is one acerbic SOB (Hank Azaria plays his younger self). And I now realize that Fran Stalinofskivich (from Ramanovia) was played by Missi Pyle, who also starred in ""Bringing Down the House"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"".Oh yeah, and about that article. Joel David Moore is here in his native Portland shooting the indie flick ""Spiral"" with Amber Tamblyn (of TV's ""Joan of Arcadia"").",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
4,jboothmillard,Dodgeball,6,13 July 2005,"Quite a good film with a bit of a silly idea, but still very funny in places. Ben Stiller plays White Goodman, he owns a big and successful multi gym. Vince Vaughn plays Peter La Fleur, his gym next door does not do good business and Whitte wants to buy it. Unless Peter can get $50,000 he cannot keep his gym. Luckily Peter and the gang notice a competition to win $50,000 in a dodge ball game. Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan trains them for a while and they are ready. They beat many teams, but the final game is against White and his team. A very good story with a very good end, Stiller is pretty funny. Also starring Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate. Good!",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
5,ccthemovieman-1,'Patches' Mends This Tired Formulamatic Comedy,6,20 March 2006,"Well, here is yet another sleazy PG-13 modern-day comedy that also has genuinely funny characters and scenes. For those of us who care it's a shame we have have to put up with the bad stuff if you want laughs out of about any comedy made in the last 30 years....and this is a prime example. By the way, this is an ""R"" all the way, if any concerned parents are reading this. You need a computer to add up all the sex jokes in here and the last 30 minutes are really, really stupid. Both of those are typical, too. Yet, most of my friends said this was hilarious and to check the film out. Prior to the typically-dumb ending are some very funny moments, mostly provided by Ben Stiller's over-the-top fitness guru, ""White Goodman,"" a man who runs an ultra high-tech fitness center. Vince Vaughan plays the likable good guy small-gym owner who is in competition with Stiller, sort of like David against Goliath, the nerds against the jocks.....another formula that is so often used these days in comedies because it's always fun to see the little guy knock off the arrogant big jerk. Christine Taylor is the token young ""hottie"" that you also see in these kind of pictures: skinny, pretty, but not exactly the wholesome type.Rip Torn almost steals the show as ""Patches O'Houlihan,"" the old man who helps coach the underdog volleyball team using some unorthodox methods. I laugh every time I think of him. In fact, ""Patches"" puts the added edge in this film to elevate it slightly above a ""fair"" rating.A lot of the humor in here is the improbableness of the whole story. Of course, it's an insult to anyone's intelligence but that's part of the charm and one does get a decent amount of laughs for an hour-and-half, so it's not all bad.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
6,BA_Harrison,You'll have a ball.,8,28 December 2016,"An archetypal (and purportedly true) underdog story, Dodgeball sees Vince Vaughn as lovable but apathetic gym owner Peter La Fleur, who, with his band of misfit customers, enters a national dodgeball tournament to try and win the $50,000 he needs to prevent his business from being acquired by corporate fitness freak White Goodman (Ben Stiller).The order of the day here is low-brow humour, with laughs derived from abject silliness, vulgarity and slapstick; thankfully, nearly all of the gags hit their target square in the face, meaning that even the most joyless of viewers will struggle to remain composed. Whether its the simple pleasure of seeing a person being hit in the knackers by a fast moving ball, the sight of an overweight cheerleader wearing no underwear falling ass down onto someone's face, or ridiculous lines of dialogue such as 'I've even seen a grown man satisfy a camel', Dodgeball is simply too daft not to enjoy.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
7,Quinoa1984,"Funniest Sports Comedy since BASEketball (and, luckily, in that comedic tradition)",7,20 June 2004,"One of the things that debut filmmaker Rawson Marshall Thurber gets right at the start of Dodgeball, and runs with for the whole length of the film, is that if you're making a film out of this story (that includes the a-typical story and characters, in a comedy genre or otherwise) there's got to be a laugh a minute, literally.  And, amazingly, Thurbert pulls it off, along with a great ensemble cast headed by Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn.  Because there is also a constant urge to make fun of anything, that nothing is out of bounds, disbelief is completely suspended, and Thurber reaches (credible) ZAZ comedy territory.Main baseline: Stiller and Vaughn trade places from March's Starsky and Hutch, as Stiller plays the tyrannical, egocentric head of Globo-Gym, which has been the monopolizer of physical fitness in the town.  Vaughn runs Average Joe's, a gym where the only people who work out are the ones who work there.  When Stiller bids to take over Vaughn's place, they fight back with a Dodgeball tournament with a prize enough to save Average Joe's. 
The story's just an excuse, anyway, as was the story for BASEketball or Airplane.  It's an excuse, so to speak, to let Stiller run wild with the persona he creates for White Goodman.  It's an original performance, even if one wonders if he played a character with these kind of qualities before on his show.  And Vaughn, as well as the assortment of supporting actors (Christine Taylor, Alan Tudyk, Stephen Root, Justin Long, Joel Moore, and especially Rip Torn), contribute a lot to the success of the laughs. They're relying on certain cliches, but they're the kind of cliches you can't take a bit seriously.  There are also a good deal of (surprise) cameos by the likes of William Shatner, Hank Azaria, Chuck Norris, and Lance Armstrong that sneak up and bring some of the funniest parts of the film. It's a good time, unless this just isn't your kind of movie.  Between A- and B+",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
8,wes-connors,I Just Threw Up in My Mouth a Little Bit,2,20 December 2009,"Couch-potatoed Vince Vaughn (as Peter La Fleur) and buff ""Happy Days"" fan Ben Stiller (as White Goodman) run rival workout clubs. Mr. Stiller, the more successful gym-runner, aims to take over the property run by Mr. Vaughn, which has somehow avoided foreclosure. To settle their disputes, club members from each play in a Las Vegas ""Dodgeball"" tournament, for a $50,000 cash prize. Beautiful blonde banker babe Christine Taylor (as Kate Veatch) attracts both Vaughn and Stiller.Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, ""Dodgeball"" lost its singular ""Razzie Award"" nomination - although Stiller may get a ""Lifetime Achievement"" consolation prize, one of these years. This film's joke is, basically people get hit by balls which also happens to be how you describe something in a man's pants Gary Cole and Jason Bateman are good announcers. Rip Torn plays a raunchy urine-drinking coach. Some familiar-faced cameos liven things up a little.

9,Coventry,Go Team Slapstick!,7,27 September 2004,"Once every few years, you're presented to a slapstick comedy so hilarious you instantly forget how LOW this form of entertainment actually is. I can't give a scientific explanation to state how come it's funny to see someone (preferably wearing glasses) getting hit in the face by a ballit just is. Dodgeball is vulgar, crude and without substancebut your stomach will hurt from laughing and don't we all need that from time to time? In case you really want to defend this film, you can always say it features tons of unsubtle criticism towards modern American image of exaggerated health-obsession. Ben Stiller's character is the personification of the obnoxious fitness guru: 'We're better than you, and we know it'. Opposed to him, there's Vince Vaughn as the chilled-minded, lovable guy who owns a fitness center for the underdeveloped wimps. Due to his financial situation, he risks losing his gym to Stiller except if he and his teams of misfits manage to win the world-famous dodgeball tournament. The film is a series of cheap chuckles, eccentric characters and outrageous one-liners. It's pretty funny to hear Stiller yell out lines like: 'You're a skid mark on the underpants of society'. Or the always-amusing Rip Torn encouraging his team with the words: 'you're as useful as a cock-flavored lollipop'. The acting is great as it can be with Ben Stiller and Rip Torn who go delightfully over the top and lots of enthusiast cameos (Chuck Norris, David Hasselhof, William Shatner and even Lance Armstrong). It sure isn't Schindler's List but Dodgball is great entertainment and stress releasing.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
10,michaelRokeefe,Grab life by the ball!,2,15 October 2005,"Misfits and half-wits play with their balls. Dodgeball is silly and parallels stupidity. Silly does not necessarily correlate with funny. Peter LaFluer(Vince Vaughn)runs a worn out gym called Average Joe's. Faltering and antiquated equipment and with mostly non-paying clients the gym is forced to undergo foreclosure by a sharp looking accountant, Kate(Christine Taylor). The gym's biggest competition comes from GloboGym owned by White Goodman(Ben Stiller). The need for big bucks fast...Average Joe's enters a Las Vegas dodgeball tournament, where predictably they meet opposition from the perfectly coiffed Goodman and his team. There is just something about the sound of a hard thrown dodgeball meeting flesh.I kept waiting to hear some trademark profanity from Vaughn...no go. Stiller in no matter what role annoys me...more so this time. Announcer Jason Bateman and coach Rip Torn were almost show stealers. Also in the cast: Justin Long, Jamal Duff, Missi Pyle and Hank Azaria. This dodgeball nowhere resembles the sport you played in Junior High School.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
11,bevo-13678,It's a film about dodgeball,10,29 March 2020,I like the bits where they throw balls at each other. Especially when they hit people in the face. Sometimes they throw wrenches too,Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
12,hitchcockthelegend,Not just a film for average Joe's.,8,1 August 2009,"Peter LaFleur {Vince Vaughn} is the owner of Average Joe's Gym, barely making any cash, LaFleur looks like losing his Gym to corporate big hitters, Globo Gym. Globo Gym, run by sleazy White Goodman {Ben Stiller}, is the complete opposite to Joe's, big money, big clientèle and big ego's. So when the few hardy members of Joe's decide to enter the Vegas Dodgeball Tournament, in the vain hope of winning the cash prize to save the gym, it's no surprise that Goodman enters his own team to hopefully thwart their plan.A joyous, crude and eminently quotable underdog story that demands repeat viewings to fully catch all that is going on. Dismissd on release as being a throw away comedy from the Stiller/Vaughn frat pack brigade, Dodgeball has since gone on to surpass expectations and rise towards the top of the sports comedy table. A true ensemble piece {tho Stiller's preening Goodman takes the honours}, few films of its type have fused a character based heart with such dumb shenanigans and gotten away with it. These are odd and even sad people, but unity is a fine thing, even when wrenches are bouncing off their heads and balls are thudding into the groin! Yes it's that type of film, and we are all the better for the experience. Boasting smart use of cameos from such luminaries like William Shatner and Chuck Norris, Dodgeball is a testament to how good physical comedy can be, and of course it's always great to shout for the underdog. No matter how bizarre they may be. 8/10",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
13,jotix100,Let's play Dodgeball!,7,25 July 2004,"Rawson Marshall Thurber has come out with one of the funniest summer films of the year. Frankly, not even knowing what to expect, we had hesitated about seeing it, but what a pleasant surprise this movie turned out to be! If one goes with an open mind, it will entertain anyone in any age group.The film is insane. Ben Stiller does probably his best work in a while. He's been in lots of films lately that don't do anything for him, let alone show him at his goofiest self. Mr. Thurber must have seen a possibility casting him, and it paid handsomely. Vince Vaughn, plays with a straight face, but he is quite good and holds his own playing opposite to Mr. Stiller.The scenes in Las Vegas, during the finals of the Dodgeball tournament are absolutely insane.

While I think he's fine as a regular actor I find any and all of his attempts at comedic acting unbearable. I have to say that this was a major loss on my part because this is a funny funny movie.This is the typical outcasts against bullies stories but with gyms and dodgeballs.

15,Boba_Fett1138,This movie hits hard!,8,7 July 2005,"What a totally ridicules and stupid movie this was...I LOVE IT! This movie is like the biggest load of nonsense you'll ever see. I mean an entire movie focused on the game dodgeball? What movie has a more ridicules concept than that? Fans of silly humor, this is a must see for you! The movie has several strong aspects. One and maybe the biggest are the characters. They are all extremely stereotyped and over-the-top but my goss I love them. Ben Stiller is especially hilarious as the 'villain' with his crazy hair and silly outfits.The dodgeball games are definitely the highlights of the movie. I don't really care much about what happens in the movie outside of the dodgeball games to be frank. Nothing beats seeing some silly characters like members of team kamikaze and team blitzkrieg, who are coached by David Hasselhoff, being hit hard in the face or a more sensitive body location, by some balls.The humor is totally wrong but you can't help loving it. The movie is filled with some truly hilarious moments and some well written dialog.If you enjoy silly humor, this is simply a must see!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
16,anaconda-40658,Don't Dodge It. Embrace It.,7,9 July 2015,"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004): Dir: Rawson Marshall Thurber / Cast: Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, Rip Torn, Hank Azaria: Amusing and somewhat unique sports comedy about life's curve balls. It stars Vince Vaughn who owns a fitness gym called Average Joe's that is threatened to be demolished into a parking lot by fitness instructor Ben Stiller of Globo- Gym. Vaughn must come up with $50, 000 and the method of payment becomes a dodgeball competition, which Globo-Gym also enters. Dodgeball becomes the deciding factor. Effective premise exploits fitness clubs and the image pressure to look good. There are the expected clichés such as the stereotype players made up of characters more or less from better movies. Directed with comic insight by Rawson Marshall Thurber with many great sight jokes. Vaughn fares well as Average Joe's front man out to win this competition and gain predicted respect. Stiller steals scenes with his outlandish behaviour that will ultimately lead to his downfall. Christine Taylor plays an attorney in what can only be described as a romantic prop. Rip Torn plays an aged dodgeball trainer whose sudden dismiss seems too cliché. Then there are a slew of effective actors in comic form playing the standard dimwits who play types over personalities. Theme suggests we dodge images thrown by fitness club egos. Score: 7 / 10",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
17,movieman_kev,"at least better then Rollerball, just not as funny",4,12 January 2005,"Vince Vaughn leads a group of assorted misfits into a dodgeball tournament to save his gym from being bought by Ben Stiller's gym franchise. Well leads is to strong a word, as Vince just seems to go with the flow throughout the film. Are we that needy for good comedies that we elevate a below-average one into the status of 'mordern day classic'?? Apparently so as many of the people I know sung it's high praises when this came out. The truth is, this is nowhere near as funny as either ""Old School"" OR ""Bad Santa"" and the only laughs to be had come from not Stiller nor Vaughn, but from Rip Torn who steals every single scene he has in the movie as wheelchair-bound Patrick O'houlihan. Without him ""Dodgeball"" would have been out in the preliminaries.My Grade: C- DVD Extras: Commentary with Rawson Thurber, Ben Stiller, and Vince Vaughn; 7 deleted scenes; Training for Dodgeball featurette; Anatomy of a hit featurette; Justin Long: A study in ham and chess featurette; go for the gold featurette; gag reel; 2 theatrical trailers; Trailers for season 1 of ""Arrested Development"" and ""the Ringer",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
18,Aaron1375,Review writing...now on espn 9.,8,21 June 2004,"This was a funny comedy once again featuring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn...the other being Starsky and Hutch released the same year.  This one though basically has their roles reversed as Vaughn plays an every man gym owner and Stiller plays a fitness and appearence obsessed gym owner. Stiller's character wants Vaughns gym and Vaughn needs money so this is where dodgeball comes in.  This movie is also kind of a spoof of those old 80's comedy where in the end it comes down to a tournament or race to save the day.  Lots of goofball antics ensue, with a lot of hits to the crotch, but hey it works here.  Dodgeball was always a bit of a cruel game so might as well show how it is.  Vaughn is great as are the rest of his team of misfits, and Stiller is kind of bizarre in his role, but it works.  Lots of strange cameos in this one as well, and what was up with the pirate?

19,The_Void,Makes for an entertaining hour and a half,6,6 December 2005,"Films starring Ben Stiller tend to be funny, and that's what this is. You cant go into a film like Dodgeball expecting much more than a good time and a few laughs - so the fact that it's no masterpiece won't disappoint, and the fact that it delivers exactly what you want it to ensures this further. Dodgeball is at least somewhat original because it follows a sport that (to my knowledge) hasn't been done before, or at least not recently. Prior to seeing this movie, I had seen Dodgeball being played 'professionally', and it's easy to see why the filmmakers here decided to base this comedy on that sport. It isn't quite as ridiculous in real life as it's portrayed as being here, but seriously - it's not all that far off. The film follows two rival gyms - the huge Globo Gym, and the small-scale local gym - Average Joe's. Joe's is owned by Vince Vaughn, who finds himself in trouble with the bank when it turns out he hasn't been paying his bills. He owes $50,000, and after his friends' idea to wash cars fails miserably, they find that the only way to pay off the bank and keep the gym open is to enter a dodgeball competition, which has a first prize of $50,000 (mere coincidence). However, the owner of Globotech wants Average Joe's for himself...and enters the competition to make sure that happens.I'm not exactly Ben Stiller's biggest fan, but it's impossible to deny that he has a talent for comedy. He's shown in his recent films that he has a great range - from the very straight Starsky, to his average kind of role in Meet the Parents; all the way to his role here, which sees him as the maniacal fitness freak turned dodgeball player. He stars along with Vince Vaughn and wife, Christine Taylor. Vaughn has shown his comedy talent a lot recently, and even though his role here is merely as an average kind of guy; he does it well. Stiller's wife definitely is hot - I don't like blonde's as a rule, but every man who doesn't would have to make an exception here. She steals all of her scenes. Many of the jokes come as a result of Stiller's over the top character, and the general silliness of the game; dodgeball. It doesn't take a highly trained eye to notice that this is Ben Stiller's film - and it's him that you're going to remember most after seeing this film, and that is testament to his comical abilities. Some of the humour is a bit grating and doesn't really work (like the awkward romance between some ugly woman and a dorky kid), but on the whole - this is suitably silly, and is sure to sufficiently entertain most people.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
20,mm-39,Very 80's,7,20 June 2004,"This film is very 80's the writers must have growen up in the 80's. Music,  Ben's style, and the jym is very much 80's.

Alotof knee in the midsection jokes, and jokes about American pop culter.  I like the ESPN 8 idea, and the Jim McMahonanchor.  This film is all right.  I hope it last the test of time, but itcould be another comedy that is forgoten in 2 years.  I give it a 7out of 10.  Worth going to the movie theartier.

22,=G=,Still more Stiller,6,15 December 2004,"""Dodgeball"" is another Stiller formula comedy which packs wacky characters and silly stereotypes into a story about a glitzy state-of-the-art health club owner (Stiller) who wants to add a failing garage gym, owned and operated by Vaughn, to his empire. Unwilling to give up his small time but nerd-friendly operation, Vaughn challenges Stiller to settle the dispute over a champion dodgeball tournament in Vegas. Factor in a babe and the usual good vs evil elements with the underdog issue and a screenplay which is hyperkinetic and kaleidoscopic and the result is an enjoyable comedy romp worth a look by anyone who enjoyed similar Stiller fare such as ""Zoolander"" or ""Duplex"" or ""Starsky & Hutch"" or ""Envy"", etc. (B)",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
23,MovieAddict2016,"A good silly movie that is everything ""Anchorman"" should have been.",8,9 May 2005,"When I heard of ""Anchorman,"" I thought the premise was inspired, and with its cast I was sure it would be a great stupid, silly comedy. Unfortunately it turned out to be a major disappointment and the companion piece of the year -- ""Dodgeball"" (another hopelessly silly comedy) -- turned out to be the better of the two and brought in some $30 million on opening weekend; quite a feat for a film featuring an actor accused of starring in too many films (Ben Stiller) and an actor whose career has been reduced to shambles recently (Vince Vaughn).""Dodgeball"" is by no means a great comedy or an important piece of work but it doesn't have any pretensions to be. It follows in the path of slacker underdog movies like ""Animal House"" and just about any sports movie you can think of but it doesn't try to be anything more than what it is: an entertaining piece of trash. This is not out to win an Oscar, its purpose is to make us laugh and I did so quite a bit.Vaughn is perfectly cast as an average Joe who owns a gym called Average Joes (ah, irony). Stiller is the owner of the competing ""Globo-Gym,"" a super-slick company with a $4 million price tag and an interesting company slogan: ""We're better than you, and we know it!"" When Peter (Vaughn) fails to pay off debts his gym faces foreclosure and he must raise fifty thousand dollars or else Stiller will buy his land and turn it into a huge parking lot for Globo-Gym.So in order to raise the cash Peter and his die-hard gym members (a pack of idiots, losers and a wannabe-pirate [?]) compete in the American Dodgeball Association of America (I didn't get the joke the first time I heard it!) against Globo-Gym's Purple Cobras team.Ben Stiller's been getting on my nerves a bit lately, wearing his put-upon-nice-guy shtick into the ground. He's reached a point -- along with Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell and Luke Wilson -- where they all just goof off in their movies, performing cameos or appearing in starring roles, and at first it's pretty amusing but after a while the whole Troup Stiller/Wilson routine gets old... ""Anchorman"" had Ferrell, Wilson, Stiller and Vaughn, and ""Starsky and Hutch"" had the other Wilson, Stiller, Vaughn, Ferrell etc... not to mention the fact that Duplex, Meet the Fockers and Along Came Polly all featured performances by Stiller that were eerily similar.Anyway suffice to say Stiller gives his best 2004 performance in ""Dodgeball,"" creating an over-the-top character who's very similar to the obsessive weight loss instructor in one of his earliest comedies, ""Heavy Weights,"" which might be a sequel of sorts to this since ""Dodgeball"" supposedly takes place in 1993 and that movie took place in 1994...Overall ""Dodgeball"" is just good silly fun. Stiller is doing another one of his usual routines but he's a great deal funnier than he has been in many other films last year, and I like him better as the angry freak rather than the put-upon shmuck, which he's simply done way too much lately.The movie delivers laughs and doesn't attempt to do anything else...

25,OllieSuave-007,"Sometimes, underdogs win.",8,24 November 2013,"This is a pretty funny movie about a group of underdogs and misfits, who enter a Las Vegas dodge-ball tournament in order to save their local gym from a much larger Global Gym run by muscular and athletic men.At 92 minutes, this movie is pretty intriguing from start to finish, nothing too drawn out that would render the movie boring and unremarkable. The story goes straight to the point of pitting the average joes against the athletes, telling us that even if you do seem like an underdog or are outnumbered, your perseverance will triumph over your adversaries. There are some corny moments, but this movie isn't meant to be taken as a serious drama.Vince Vaughn does a pretty good job in his role leading the underdogs, and Ben Stiller does a devilish job in portraying the leader of the Global Gym, trying to buy off Vaugh's local and struggling gym. And, it is a real treat to see some cameos from big stars such as Chuck Norris, Gary Cole, William Shatner and David Hasselhoff.Overall, a pretty fun film good for some laughs and surprises.Grade B+",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
26,Buddy-51,endearing slapstick comedy,6,16 August 2005,"""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" provides just enough good-natured low brow humor to make up for the fact that the film is not always as funny as it intends to be.Vince Vaughn takes on the role of straight man as Peter La Fleur, the owner of a third rate gym called ""Average Joe's"" that caters to the.umhow shall we say it? less athletically inclined, less single-mindedly health-conscious consumer. Pete's patrons are all ""losers"" and social outcasts who find Average Joe's the one place where they can find camaraderie and be accepted for who they really are. The problem is that, through poor business management, Peter has virtually bankrupted the establishment to the tune of $50,000 that needs to be paid off pronto if he is to maintain ownership of the place. Enter White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the self-made, egomaniacal owner of a top-of-the-line gym across the street who is determined to force Peter out of business and make it part of his own franchise. To raise the money, Pete and his comrades form a ragtag dodge ball team and head to Las Vegas to compete in the national championships. When Goodman gets wind of the plan, he forms his own team to take on Average Joe's less-than-average players in a David and Goliath showdown broadcast on nationwide TV.Most of the humor in ""Dodgeball"" is of the Three Stooges/hit-one-another-in-the-groin variety that works pretty well for the most part, even if it does tend to become a bit strained and repetitious after awhile. Vaughn and Stiller have a fun time playing off one another, with the former carefully low balling his performance while the latter bursts forth in a no-holds-barred display of manic energy. Christine Taylor is also lovely and fine as the bank accountant who starts off rummaging through Peter's financial records and winds up as a star player on his team. The other cast members are all entertaining as well, and the film features a host of effective cameo performances from the likes of William Shatner, David Hasselhoff, Jason Bateman, Chuck Norris, and Lance Armstrong who really makes a mark in his short, but pivotal and well written scene near the end of the film. But the real acting honors go to Rip Torn as a crazy, wheelchair-bound coach who uses some mighty unorthodox methods to whip the boys into shape. Torn is the undisputed comic force at the center of the film.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

This was in theaters last year the same time Anchorman was and many said this was better than Anchorman. I totally disagree. Anchorman actually had laughs.As the title suggests, this is your typically Hollywood Underdog story involving a sport. In this case, it's dodgeball. Maybe the producers thought, dodgeball: now that's funny and entertaining, but they sure missed the boat. Sure, you played dodgeball in grade school and it's fun, but it is not funny just because some misfits are playing it. The only good part was Ben Stiller's over the top character.

Every single joke, gag or pun in Dodgeball is blatantly and openly stolen from another movie. And this really, really bugs me. However I did laugh constantly and it was enjoyable.Though I must confess my hatred of Ben Stiller and his insistence to crank out 200 unfunny films a year (a schedule typically reserved for porn stars). Initially, I hated Vince Vaughn and liked Stiller. But now that's kind of flip-flopped. After Vaughn's funny performance in Old School I warmed to him but Stiller is under the impression that everything he does is funny. He certainly is not; anyone can act like a jerk.The plot is old hat. But Vaughn's ragtag group of losers and their determination to win the Dodgeball tournament is the real laugh machine. Though I was constantly thinking about how they worked much better in Baseketball or Kingpin.Asides from Vaughn and the so-not-funny anymore Stiller the cast is good. Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan is amusing (though he did the exact same role in Summer Rental), Stephen Root (that's Bill Dauterive for all you King of the Hill fans) was my fave and there's plenty of cameos from the likes of Hank Azaria, Jason Bateman, William Shatner, David Hasselhoff and Chuck Norris.Funny it may well be but expect practically every laugh to come with a heavy sense of Déjà vu. I wouldn't bother buying the DVD when it comes out. Just watch Baseketball and Kingpin side by side on 2 TVs and you'll end up watching this.And trust me, if ESPN 8-The Ocho, was a real channel, I'd be watching it every day.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

35,zkonedog,"How Many Jokes About ""Balls"" Can Be Made In 90 Minutes?",3,12 March 2017,"Basically, my thoughts about this movie can be summed up in the title of this review. A family member of mine got this movie as a gift last Christmas, and just recently I was in a ""comedy"" mood and gave it a viewing. By the end of the film, though, the only person I was laughing at was myself for sitting through the whole thing.The problems with this film are numerous: The jokes rely way too much on crude humor, they often aren't even funny in that area, and the goal of the film (to combine comedy with an even somewhat compelling storyline) is not even close to realized. About the only positive impact this movie had on society was to get people playing the game of dodgeball once again. Yet, it was no thanks to the jokes in this movie...just the base subject matter.Thus, if you are looking for 90 minutes of laughter, please look elsewhere. Only a couple of decently funny scenarios kept this movie away from a bottom-of-the-barrel one star rating, and a ""1.5 stars"" would have been the optimal rating. Fans of Ben Stiller will find Zoolander to offer more genuine laughs, while others may want to steer clear of this entire comedy genre altogether.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

37,filipemanuelneto,Just another sports comedy...,5,4 September 2019,"This film is a slapstick-like comedy that brings us a little-known ""sport"": dodgeball, a game that, for us in Europe, is more connoted with childhood and school than with the world of professional and federated sports. Here in Portugal it is called ""Queimada"" or ""Jogo do Mata"".The script is based on the boundless rivalry between Peter La Fleur, the owner of a small gym, and White Goodman, the owner of a gym corporation, who opens yet another establishment, right outside the door of La Fleur's gym. Things get worse when La Fleur is truly in danger of losing its small gym to its direct competitor. To pay what they owe, they decide to participate in the National Dodgeball Championship, where Goodman is already registered.This movie is nothing new or original. The exposed plot is similar in everything to dozens of other sports-themed films, where the good ones try to beat the bad guys within four lines, while the bad guys try to use all means, including cheating, to win. It's a markedly humorous movie, with jokes all the time ... some of which are really funny while others not so much. It is a style of humor that does not appeal to everyone, but it will appeal to those who already like this genre.Ben Stiller is an actor with a lot of experience in this type of comedy, where he fits perfectly, and he is responsible for most of the jokes, with a strongly cartoon character and with touches of social criticism. I liked the work of the actor, he really steals attention for himself and not always (almost never) had anyone to shoulder with him. Vince Vaughn was up to the character and gave him a touch of honesty and sincerity, but is too serious to make him laugh. Christine Taylor is the girl in the movie, but it doesn't do much more than be a presumed future romantic pair of Vaughn's character. The rest of the cast gives the essential support and is funny when it has to be. In addition, we have small cameos from Lance Armstrong (it was not yet known how he truly won the Tour), Chuck Norris, David Hasselhoff and other well-known names.This movie is funny ... it doesn't make us laugh until it hurts, because many of the jokes used are not particularly elegant, but entertain the weather quite well and do not disappoint us.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

39,Anonymous_Maxine,"Some funny parts, more stupid parts.",6,23 April 2005,"It should be noted that stupid parts are often funny, too, I still haven't figured out what it is exactly that makes one stupid scene funny and another one just stupid and vulgar. The mashed potato scene in Scary Movie 2, for example, was not funny by any stretch of the imagination. If you really liked that, you should try hanging out in a mental hospital or a physical therapy ward or something, you will be in absolute hysterics. Then again, I loved the Ace Ventura films, and stupidity is the foundation for most of the successful comedy in it, at least to me. Now, when I watch a comedy like Dodgeball, clearly I am looking at the ratio to stupid scenes that don't work and stupid scenes that work. Dodgeball had more of the former. The story is about a regular guy who owns a gym and an obscenely rich and snobby guy who owns a massive gym across the street from him and who spends not a little bit of time trying to run the average guy out of business. Thhe initial problem that I had was that Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller are very different actors, not the least reason for which is that Vaughn can play characters as different as the characters he played in Clay Pigeons and The Cell, whereas Stiller plays exactly the same character in every movie, he only seems to alter how irritating his characters are (think Meet the Parents vs. his character here). Then again, he capitalizes on his weaknesses, kind of like David Spade. But in the movie, Vaughn reminds me of a guy dealing with some drunken jerk at a party, trying to shrug off his ridiculous and embarrassing behavior but eventually giving in and knocking the guy on his ass. Stiller is so over the top that there is no way to take him any more seriously than as a comic book villain. He is tiring to watch before the first third of the movie is over. There are effective gags in the movie, it is not all bad. The plot is fun to watch, because not only is White Goodman (Stiller) annoying to watch, but he is also a complete jerk, so you really want to root for the underdogs, and the movie makes very sure that you see them as underdogs in every way imaginable. But it should be noted that the best scene in the movie involves Vince Vaughn at the airport, having given up on his team, when he runs into someone that I won't reveal. They have a normal conversation, no over-the-top antics, and it's the funniest thing in the movie.Then again, maybe I just thought so because I enjoy ridiculously long bike rides.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

Only this time the roles are reversed. In ""Starsky & Hutch"" Vaughn was the villain and Stiller was the hero. In Dodgeball, it's the other way around. Vaughn plays Peter Lafleur, a gym owner who's down on his luck, and Stiller plays White Goodman a gym owner who rules his with an iron fist. Both gyms will compete in a dodgeball competition, when Average Joe's Gy gets a lesson in attitude, Global Gym puts the 'p"" in Pain! With all the cameos in this movie, no wonders it's a riot. William Shatner, Chuck Norris giving Average Joe's the nod, David Hasselhoff speaking German. He has spent time there being a singing sensation there.

Acting was definitely up to par for each of the actors. Christine Taylor (Ben Stiller's wife in real life) was very good and looked the same. Rip Torn was good, not great, but Hank Azaria (who is also on the Simpsons and brilliant there to) who plays Patches when he was younger gives an outstanding cameo. Vince Vaughn did every thing possible with a not exceptional role. Certainly would have really helped his comedy career though without a doubt. Alan Tudyk was alright, but of course the star as in all his movie (literally) was Ben Stiller who was just so entertaining throughout the whole film. Whenever he was on screen you were excited because you knew it wasn't going to be boring. He seems to play dumb people very well in all his roles. What amazes me is how someone who can act with that much energy and enthusiasm in his role can change himself so much that he's able to play a role like his one in Along Came Polly which is basically the exact opposite.

I have never heard of dodgeball as a competitive sport,I thought it had been invented purely for the movie,rather like ""Rollerball"",but it appears not to be the case.That being so,all I can say is ""Only in America""...... The game appears to revolve around two teams throwing a ball as hard as possible at each other with the object of hitting an opponent with it. We may have to wait some time for the Joe DiMaggio of dodgeball to emerge I would imagine. Whatever its merits or otherwise as a game per se,whether it is a worthy subject for a feature film is certainly to say the least debatable. What is beyond debate is that ""Dodgeball"" is a movie that has been allowed to sprawl,start and stutter with no sign of a controlling hand until it peters out rather like a Monty Python sketch nobody could be bothered to think of an end for.

44,dee.reid,"""Dodgeball"" - A true underdog story?",8,31 August 2005,"""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is hardly true in the sense that its plot line is based on an actual event or time in history. ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is only ""true"" in that dodgeball is slowly rising to the top of the ""almost sports"" world (presumably through the underground avenue of word-of-mouth) and what's more, a movie is made about dodgeball and it's directed by first-timer Rawson Marshall Thurber.My own experiences in gymnasium dodgeball were all short-lived in the annals of elementary school, as like most others surprised by the massive success of this picture last summer, dodgeball, or Extreme Dodgeball as it's called on sports channel ESPN, is close to earning a place in the most-watched sports arena on television. Whoa.But in the movie ""Dogdeball: A True Underdog Story,"" hapless, borderline bankrupt Average Joe's Gym owner Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) comes up with a scheme to win $50,000 in order to save his fledgling business. Actually, he doesn't come up with the plan himself; one of his equally hapless, bizarr-o but loyal gym regulars reads about dodgeball in ""Obscure Sports Quarterly.""The catch is, they have all heard of and know how to play dodgeball, but they don't know how to play (play is italicized) dodgeball. As with any sport, officially sanctioned or not, there are rules and any advice that Peter and his cohorts come across is therefore invaluable if they are to get anywhere in the upcoming dodgeball tournaments being held in Las Vegas. And so with much pondering, a loose team is formed out of true societal misfits including a pirate, a wannabe cheerleader, and a guy who's never been on a date.One of them borrows a documentary sports video from 1938, and it features legendary titan of the game Patches O'Houlihan (played by Hank Azaria in the video, a wheelchair-bound Rip Torn in the present). Soon enough, Patches rolls into Average Joe's and shows these 'dogs how to play some dodgeball in some very effective if not totally kosher techniques. Peter realizes that lawyer Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor), who has served him with the bank's foreclosure warnings and also gets wind of some of his lackadaisical business practices including letting his clients pay their own way, has a mutual disliking of White Goodman (a delightfully obnoxious, egomaniacal, and scene-chewing Ben Stiller), the owner of Globo Gym, and eventually asks her to join their team.Of course, she's at first reluctant but after White gets her fired from her job with the bank, she is left with little choice but to join at least in part to get revenge on White. White Goodman is another one of those deliciously manic, comic villains that Stiller specializes in, chewing up scenery nearly every second the camera's focused on him. He forms his own dodgeball team, the Purple Cobras (who all look like action movie rejects, even though one of them is from an obscure place in the former Soviet Union), and with the sports winnings, he aims to buy out Peter's gym and then demolish it (with them still in it) but they're obviously not going away without a fight.This is a movie that finally acknowledges its place as a wild, out-of-place, and self-referential sports comedy. No phony theatrics here, ladies and gentlemen, just a bunch of actors who know the material inside-out and look to make one hell of an entertaining picture. Vince Vaughn does his best to keep the plot on track with a cool game face and succeeds but Ben Stiller is a total maniac as White Goodman. Like the corporate fitness monster he played in ""Heavyweights"" (1995), he's totally insane but goes a step further into playing a character who if it weren't for a shred of brains in that thick melon on top of his shoulders, would be a poster child for self-absorbed fitness gurus everywhere.Most entertaining are the actual dodgeball sequences, which eat up most of the film's second half. These are fast, brutal, and unflinching in showing various team members getting annihilated on the court with zingers to the face, to the crotch or any exposed area. It almost makes you want to sign up and form your own team and compete in Vegas.""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is an eager film from an equally ambitious team of filmmakers. It put a smile on my face, as any other sports film of similar theme would not have been able to do that. Sure it's silly, but the laughs are such that you won't be kicking yourself afterward for doing so.""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" - Don't dodge it. Oh, wait, catch it.

47,alindsay-al,A fantastic comedy that is one of my favourites,9,8 June 2017,"For a while now I have truly loved this film but I haven't watched it in a while so last night I decided to and in my opinion this is one of the best comedies I have seen and one of my personally favourites. The premise of the film sees a down on its luck gym in danger of being destroyed by its richer competition. So in order to save there gym they enter a dodgeball tournament to raise the money. I have been critical of Vince Vaughan before for being the same character in pretty much all of his comedies but this is the one where it really works. He totally encapsulates his charismatic but underachieving character really well and you do truly root for his character and the situation that he is put in. The supporting cast is also really good, starting with the obvious, Ben stiller absolutely kills it as white Goodman probably giving my favourite performance of his. He is so obnoxious but totally owns it in a way that it really does make it fun to watch his character and truly makes it a memorable performance. Christine Taylor plays Vaughan's love interest in this film but she is a great character in her own right and I thought she gave a fun performance. Rip torn plays patches o hoolihan there coach and he gives such an over the top performance but it works as you watch this crazy old guy drilling these grown men. Justin long and Alan tudyk also give really funny performances in this film, also this film contains one of my favourite Jason Bateman performances. The story is as described in the title an underdog story and I always remain heavily invested in the story of this film as these highly likable people fight against the evil corporation it is good stuff. However, my one issue with this film is its first act isn't that funny and it feels a bit sluggish as they introduce all of these characters one at a time, also yes the story is pretty cliché as well. The script has some gutbusting dialogue in it that always makes me laugh out loud, but it also does a really good job with its more dramatic scenes that as mentioned before makes you care about the characters. The style of the film is pretty raunchy and that could put some people off but I really enjoy it about this film and think it adds top the film. All the dodgeball matches are really well planned and all feel different and unique which is credit to the filmmakers to make that possible.

48,Chris_Docker,"superior slapstick comedy - tightly scripted, it gets immense mileage out of the flimsiest of gags",7,3 October 2004,"Go and see it. It's one of the best comedies of the year and a lot funnier than it should be given the flimsy premise. Ben Stiller has a big 'Globo' health club worth millions (it even includes cosmetic surgery facilities - they know that 'fatness is genetic, like baldness or necrophilia'). The lovely Christine Taylor is his lawyer, charged with getting rid of the 'Average Joe' gym across the road so they can build a parking lot for Globo customers. She takes a liking to the 'underdog' owner of the Average Joe gym though, and helps them in their plan to win a Dodgeball contest in order to get the money they owe. Dodgeball is an 'obscure' sport that mostly consists of throwing a ball to hit your opponent (look it up on the Net - Dodgeball fans take it quite seriously!) Even when I describe the film, I think 'it sounds awful' - I probably would have avoided it if it hadn't been recommended so highly - and I recommend you stay till the *very end* of the credits for one of the best scenes (which also takes a swipe at the US film-making industry!)",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

The movie starts off with Vaughn and Stiller as fitness gym owners in close proximity to each other. Vaughn's gym is pretty run-down and in deep financial debt and about to be taken over by Stiller's more ""high-class"" gym. He has to come up with $50,000 to pay him off. Fortunately, Vaughn has a devoted group of regulars, and one of them finds a dodgeball tournament in Vegas, and one guess how much the big prize is worth? Of course they enter it! So does Stiller and his gym of devotees.My favorite scenes were the ones with the girl scouts, the uniform mixup, and the final showdown and the final scenes.

50,jimbo-53-186511,Starts and ends well but there simply aren't enough laughs in between,4,6 February 2016,"Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughan) is the owner of Average Joe's Gym which is located next to Globo Gym which is a much larger multi-chain gym owned by obnoxious and self-obsessed White Goodman (Ben Stiller). When LaFleur discovers that he has 30 days to pay off $50,000 he panics and his first attempt at raising some quick cash fails. One of the members of his gym sees an advert in a magazine advertising a Dodgeball competition and the prize for winning the competition is $50,000. Seeing this as being their only option to earn that amount of cash in the time frame required, LaFleur and his gym members form a team and get trained by former Dodgeball champion Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn). However, when Goodman gets wind that LaFleur is entering into the Dodgeball championship he assembles his own crack team and enters the competition himself to win the money and put an end to LaFleur's hopes of saving his gymnasium.The start of the film is quite impressive with Stiller's monologue being a parody of the sort of thing that you'd expect to see on Teleshopping or QVC. This aspect is funny as I myself don't take a lot of what these channels say seriously and I can see that this was the effect that was trying to be achieved here. The film then shifts focus on to Vaughan and it's clear to see that he's a pleasant enough person, but clearly has no idea how to run a business. The problems for me started when the film started to establish the actual plot....Once the plot kicks in then it becomes fairly obvious that writer and director Rawson Marshall Thurber has gone for very easy targets in order to generate laughs (most of the 'laughs' on offer here stem from seeing people being hit with a ball). OK you may argue that it's a film about Dodgeball and that's the point. Fair enough... I would expect some of the laughs to stem from this, but surely a better scripted film would have us laughing at the characters for what they say as well as what they do. I'm not a fan of comedies that seem to just rely on physical humour as I think it's lazy and sadly this really is a lazy film. The characters all fall into the usual clichés with Thurber deciding that one of them should act like a pirate all the time which was never funny and grew more annoying as time passed.The performances from Stiller and Vaughan weren't brilliant if we're honest; the former overacts most of the time and crosses the line between being funny and being annoying on almost every occasion. Vaughan fares slightly better as his performance feels more natural, but I still felt that he underplayed his role slightly meaning that I couldn't engage with him as a character quite as much as I should have done.The final sequence of events seems to thrown in every single cliché in the book and all of these events lead to a fairly safe and predictable ending - barring one surprise that LaFleur has for Goodman which I'll admit was pretty funny (I liked that as I do like the idea of the little people getting the better of the big people).All in all then Dodgeball is a fairly forgettable film with a fairly standard story which aims for cheap laughs far too often. For me, an underdog story will always have some merit, but the truth is that Dodgeball is too basic and just simply isn't funny enough.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

But La Fleur and his friends are not really good at this sport. One day, an old ""Dodgeball"" player Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) thinks he could help La Fleur's team to get in shape. While Kate gets fired from her job, since Goodman lied about her not doing her job well and others. Since Goodman thinks she would go with Goodman after she lost her job.

Now it's about, who's the best team wins the tournament and the grand prize.Written and Directed by Eawson Marshall Thurder (The Mysterious of Pittsburgh) made an amusing silly comedy with a game cast that seems to have a great time. This film was a surprise big hit, when it was release in the summer of 2004 and the reviews were surprisingly good as well. The premise might be familiar to ""BASEketball"" to some degree. But this movie plays it much more realistic and players to get to play more than the three lead players in ""BASEketball"". Which, of course both movies have different sports. Perphas the problem with the picture, it's the script. Which the humour at times never hits the bull's eye. But it has enough funny moments to be viewed as a fairly good entertainment comedy flick.

Only very few odd customers visit Average Joe gym and business is extremely bad. In fact, LaFleur is short $50000 and Goodman is about to finally take over the business. The Average Joe crew has only one chance to save their gym, to enter a Dodgeball tournament with $50000 in prize money.The story is not great, but the little mishaps and adventures the crew experiences, along with odd characters and great cameos, make this a hilarious movie. Ben Stiller is great as Goodman (I have a hard time imaging anyone else that could make that role better). Vaughn and the other are also good, and especially Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate is really good. Otherwise, it is the little things that make this a good movie, as mentioned the story is not great, and unfortunately it is a little too predictable to merit a higher grade.

53,aimless-46,Oddly Uneven,5,10 April 2005,"Dude this movie was HILARIOUS!!! its about this dude, and he couldn't find his car.""Dodgeball is a sport of violence, exclusion, and degradation"". I can personally relate to this movie. Growing up in the midwest we were forced to play it often, as early as age six. Hopefully its involuntary school version is just a Midwestern thing (Ohio, Michigan, Illinois) because it is truly a sport of ""violence, exclusion, and degradation""; which I can now look back on and laugh about (at least a little).I think Stiller got the concept from his Michigan friends who made it a great sequence in the ""Freaks and Geeks"" pilot episode.But it would be hard to come up with another movie that is as uneven (hit and miss) in its humor.Pretty much everything involving Patches works extremely well; and works for both the Hank Azaria and the Rip Torn versions of the character. In fact these are some of the greatest comedy and dialogue bits ever. ""No, but I do it anyway because it's sterile and I like the taste"".There are also a lot of funny animations and graphics, some great stuff that comes totally out-of-the-blue; like ""thank you Chuck Norris"" said with sincerity and the Lance Armstrong bit at the casino bar.The good stuff is almost entirely at the middle of the film. There is absolutely nothing in the first 20 minutes of interest but stay with it because it gets better. Likewise the last 20 minutes is a letdown although the tournament announcers/commentators (Jason Bateman and Gary Cole) do a pretty good parody of too slick sports broadcasting. And it was a nice touch to have David Hasselhoff as the abusive German coach.They reach for some cheap lesbian laughs which culminates with the tired draw of girls kissing.Vince Vaughn is likable and relaxed but it would be a stretch to call his stuff 'acting'.Ben Stiller is the main source of the misses. His 70's fitness freak never really works and the more you see the less funny it gets. Only the scenes with his ""real-life wife"" Christine Taylor are worth watching. Stiller just doesn't have the talent for exaggerated humor and the writer gave all the good lines to the other characters.The supporting cast that I have not yet mentioned are lame and unimaginative. Since it is a comedy I assume that ""Steve the Pirate"" is supposed to be funny but you can't tell that by how he looks or what he says. Julie Gonzalo plays her same cheerleader character from ""A Cinderella Story""; since the films were produced at the same time she may have just walked back and forth between the sets without having to do a costume change.The big mystery is why the creative talent behind ""Dodgeball produced so much great stuff and then did nothing worthwhile with the rest of the movie.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
54,rosscinema,Harmless comedy is just too predictable,4,12 February 2005,"I'm not trying to convince anyone who saw this that they viewed a bad film because nothing is more subjective than comedy and I do believe that there are some solid laughs found here but many of the subplots in this story are just so obvious and predictable. Story is about Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) who manages a small and rundown gym called ""Average Joe's"" but with his pathetic group of members he doesn't make much money and now the bank needs $50,000 or they're going to take it away from him.*****SPOILER ALERT***** White Goodman (Ben Stiller) runs a very successful gym also and he won't stop at anything to get his hands on Peter's and he even agree's to give him more than $50,000 but that doesn't convince Peter to sell. Peter is convinced by his members that they should join the Dodgeball League and try and win the championship prize in Las Vegas but what finally spurns him on to the idea is the help from Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) who is a dodgeball teacher and Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) who works for the bank.This film is directed by newcomer Rawson Marshall Thurber who benefits from the opportunity to work with a cast that has been in several goofy comedies reminiscent of this and they together make this film work on several levels. The story is slapstick with so many jokes and humorous situations tossed in that you can make a case that it resembles the ""Airplane"" films but the main problem I had with this is the predictability of most of the situations and it's characters. Was is really surprising to see the one nerdy character who wanted to be a cheerleader end up with the hot chick from his school? Did anyone believe Taylor's character would be attracted to Vaughn and that she would even get involved with dodgeball? Sure, I'm nit-picking but these were such glaring aspects of the story that it's shocking to me that the makers of this film don't realize how cheesy they are and just change it. If you love Stiller and his over the top comedies than you'll no doubt enjoy this effort but for me I found too many parts of the film cartoonish to allow myself to admit this as a guilty pleasure.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

(To date, that would only count *Mystery Men*, *Zoolander*, and cameos in *Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy* and *The Cable Guy* - add *Dodgeball* to that short list.) His early 90s comedy series, *The Ben Stiller Show*, though a fine showcase for his frenetic talents, was so underrated and misunderstood that it was actually cancelled first time outa the gate, only to be reinstated on Comedy Central at varying intervals. Unfortunately, in his gradual assimilation into feature film pap, his chunky monkey breadwinner is his Woody Allen Lite nebbish (*Your Friends and Neighbors, Along Came Polly, Meet The Parents, et al*; hell! - he even turned David Starsky into a neb!).*Dodgeball* is Stiller's welcome return to artery-busting form, as the corporate gym owner, White Goodman - entrepreneurial, avaricious, bombastic Bad Guy to Vince Vaughn's somnolent Pete La Fleur, who mismanages his own failing gym across the way. White has designs on merging Pete's fringe-dweller gym with his own commercial monster conglomerate and will go to any sweat-tainted lengths to corporately consume it.In this film fantasy where an independent, successful, sexy woman (Christine Taylor, Stiller's real-life wife, playing Kate the auditor, whom everybody wants to examine ""under the counter""), can fall for a shiftless itinerant like Pete La Fleur, it is no stretch to discover that the only way La Fleur can raise money to save his gym is to enter a Dodgeball tournament with a cadre of his willing (though untrained) gym patrons. Due to the movie taking itself about as seriously as the inflated bulge in White Goodman's jockstrap, we go along for the ride.Hank Azaria and Rip Torn camp it up as young and old versions of legendary Dodgeballer, Patches O'Houlihan, whose methods of training La Fleur's dysfunctional, ubergeek squad would give any man pause for scrotal reflection.The tournament itself action-packs the last half hour of film, and climaxes with Pete and White facing off (- how'd you guess? You must be psychic!). During the game-play, director and writer, Rawson Marshall Thurber cannily transfers the volley of humor, which rested upon the main cast  who has now taken to the Dodgeball court  to the broadcast commentators, Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks (Gary Cole and Jason Bateman, hamming their roles with a vengeance and a copy of the Insensate Drivel Handbook).Any movie artful enough to tweak audiences into investing their alliance in a misfit dodgeball team has more going for it than just hot chicks and scrotum jokes. Who outside of the sixth grade even knew this sport still existed in mankind's repertoire? Anxiety churns my blood, for the internet can so easily resolve this mystery, yet I dare not make the connection, for I fear I will either discover a horror so demeaning that it will debase my already staggering lack of faith in humanity's intelligence quotient, or  L. Ron Hubbard have mercy! - I may suddenly embrace the urge to squoze my scrote into a purple unitard and take one on the face for the team  and if that image doesn't get your carotid artery throbbing, it's already burst(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

First, it's a movie about a group of non-competitive and somewhat eccentric adults playing dodgeball to save a not-very-impressive gym from the clutches of a competitive monopolistic chain gym. Second - Ben Stiller. Stiller is over-the-top and hilarious as the evil nemesis of average Joe Vince Vaughn. Vaughn - playing the slightly less than average Joe owner of Average Joe's gym, plays the perennial hard luck loser to the hilt. The supporting cast is terrific. Alan Tudyk, Rip Torn, Christine Taylor and Stephen Root are a great ensemble.This is a rather extreme and rather Hollywood camp comedy. Although a lot of the humor is adult, the film is also refreshingly clean compared with the averaged 21st century comedy. Dodgeball also doubles as a spot-the-cameo film, since a whole host of odd celebrities pop up here and there throughout.The first time I saw this film, I was charmed and I laughed a lot. Although the film remained entertaining, like most comedies it lost a bit of its luster in its second viewing.Why only a 6 rating?

It was towards the end of my senior year of high school, in a class I was in all morning that semester. One day, for some reason, we didn't do any work, and instead spent the morning watching ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"". I recall not being very impressed with much of the film, but liking some of it. Three years and a few months later, having not seen it since then, I rented it yesterday. Now that I've seen it a second time, it's definitely clearer in my mind, but I don't think my second viewing was much different than the first at all.Peter La Fleur owns an unpopular, rundown gym called Average Joe's, which does have a few loyal members, all with their eccentric qualities. Across the road is Globo Gym, a glamorous fitness centre run by the arrogant White Goodman, who wants to buy Average Joe's, so he can have it demolished and have a parking structure for his gym's members built in its place! In order to stop this from happening, La Fleur must come up with $50,000 within the next thirty days! He and his gym's loyal members attempt to make enough money in various ways, but unfortunately, all their attempts fail. Finally, it is discovered that they can get enough money to save Average Joe's if they win a big dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas. So, they begin to train for this tournament, but after Goodman finds out about this by spying on them, he gets together a team of extremely powerful athletes to participate in the dodgeball tournament as well, so it doesn't look like there's much hope for the Average Joes! Like probably so many other modern comedies, some of the gags in this one are pretty lame, such as the obese cheerleader flashback, and the steroid user on the Girl Scout team. I would say the humour is pretty much mediocre for the most part, but it has its moments, such as White Goodman getting an electric shock when he touches a doughnut. One part which definitely made me laugh more than the vast majority of the movie was Goodman at the door of the house of attorney Kate Veatch, telling her about an absurd thing he just did, which was not his first pathetic attempt to win her over! The rest of that front porch sequence can be amusing as well, including Kate getting violent with White, and White's reaction. Occasionally, there are some more minor laughs. However, this is not the reason why I'm rating this movie any more than a 5/10. The reason for that is the fact that both times I've seen it, I've found the big dodgeball tournament rather suspenseful.I've seen a number of Hollywood comedies made at some point during this decade, and I've definitely seen better than ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"", but have also seen much worse. Yes, this particular comedy can be quite juvenile at times, with certain gags it could have done without, and like I said, overall, the humour is mediocre in my opinion, but at least it's not atrocious, like some modern comedies certainly can be, and the story seemed to leave me reasonably satisfied in the end. Many people clearly like this film better than I do, and while it's certainly not one of the most popular comedies ever made, it seems to have gotten more positive feedback than negative, though I'll probably never be able to fully understand it.

This film doesn't try to be anything other than what it clearly is, a complete dumbass of a film with in your face laugh out loud moments. Nothing here is clever or particularly original its just childish toilet humour utilising every trick in the book to get a giggle, no stone left unturned.The cast is a mixture of some Frat pack members and good character actors who all take the opportunity to let loose and just play it to the extreme. Good old Ben Stiller has to be the main attraction here as the narcissistic gym owner with a Vidal Sassoon hair style. I did also enjoy the satirical take on flashy modern day gyms filled with overly tanned models who merely like to look at themselves whilst getting fit.Stephen Root rehashes his 'Office Space' character to great effect, Alan Tudyk is a pirate, why? no idea but its amusing and Vince Vaughn simply plays the same regular Joe character he always does but he does it well doesn't he. There are many other funny performances here and quite a lot of cameos, too many to mention but none of them ever undermine the films comedy. Kinda funny seeing Lance Armstrong going on about his Tour De France victories though, ouch!The whole idea here is so basic its amazing they got it off the ground really. Chock full of cheap laughs, naughty visual gags, lots of crotch slapstick, cheesy lines, weight jokes and pratfalls, the film does feel very infantile at times but at others it can be very funny indeed. Its not really about the plot for all intense and purposes, you just watch to see Vaughn, Stiller and co act the fool and crack hokey lines. Its all about the hammy acting and rude visual tomfoolery but the bonus is its a good little feel good flick too.Yeah you know what will happen, you know the slimy slow witted Stiller will get his comeuppance in the end, there aren't any surprises here. You know exactly what you're paying for with this and you get it, like I say the film doesn't pretend to be anything else other than a stupid comedy much like 'Dumb and Dumber' or other frat pack flicks.Upped to the max deliberately with daft spoof-like moments for optimal belly laughs and finishing off with the all too common parody of the classic coming from behind victory. Its admittedly a bit of a one joke flick for sure but you don't need to look into it that much, its just an easy going fun entertaining hour and a half.7.5/10",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
69,jon.h.ochiai,Funny on the Fringe,8,12 August 2004,"Making, much less seeing ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is bizarre, beyond the fringe of the most remote element in popular culture. The fact that the movie title includes a clarification that distinguishes it from perhaps the ""other"" Dodgeball movie is both ridiculous and unsettling. That being said, Writer and Director Rawson Marshall Thurber's ""Dodgeball"" is very stupid, and extremely funny. Vince Vaughn as Average Joe's Gym owner, Peter La Fleur, emerges as today's most talented comic straight man. This year Vaughn has appeared in smaller comic roles in such movies as ""Starsky and Hutch"" and ""Anchorman"". Vaughn has a cool and ease about him, always playing insightful in the midst of brain dead chaos. Dodgeball's world class stupidity is embodied in Peter's crew. Its paragon of stupid is White Goodman, owner of the rival Globo Gym. As played by Ben Stiller, White Goodman is dumber than a post. On a certain level, one has to admire Stiller's bold performance which is so over the top, that you can virtually hear the brain cells dying in White Goodman's head. Not only is White beyond the realm of stupid, he is also arrogant and completely self-absorbed. Yes, he is perhaps the most annoyingly funny character in all of movie-dom. In a clueless White attempt to seduce, Kate Veatch (cute and smart Christine Taylor), he asks her if she is okay. She responds, ""I just threw up in my mouth... a little."" Whoa. Kate is the bank auditor assigned to review Average Joe's Gym's financials. The gym is in foreclosure. White makes a hostile takeover attempt for Average Joe's, and for Kate. Kate, however is sympathetic to Peter, though everyone in Average Joe's think she is a lesbian. Go figure. Where White's Globo Gym is for the ""beautiful"" people, Peter's Average Joe's Gym is not. Not at all. Peter asks high school member Justin (charming and geeky Justin Long), ""Wait, so you want to join the cheer leading squad so people don't think you're a loser?"" Peter's members are not an athletically inspired group. Okay, they are a bunch of pathetic losers-- athletically and socially. It is so absurd, that one of the guys thinks he's a pirate which goes unnoticed by most of the group. Peter must raise $50,000 or lose his gym to foreclosure, and eventually to Globo Gym. Fortunately, one of the guys, Gordon (very funny Stephen Root from ""Office Space""), discovers in his issue of ""Obscure Sports Journal"" that they could earn the money by winning the Dodgeball Tournament in Las Vegas. After gaining a tournament seeding following a scandalous Girl Scouts match, the boys enroll legendary Dodgeball coach Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn). Patches is apparently this Dodgeball Yoda in a wheelchair, uttering such sage advice as ""If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball."" Kate (Taylor) demonstrates a special talent, and joins the team in their quest for Dodgeball glory. My only familiarity with Dodgeball: The Game was as a grade schooler during recess and P.E. Then I saw Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn promoting ""Dodgeball"" on MTV providing color commentary at a Dodgeball Tournament. I was unaware of this whole sports culture. So when Thurber adds the winning combination of Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as Dodgeball color commentators, Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks, on ESPN8 (the Ocho) the effect is no longer absurd. It becomes surreal. ""Dodgeball"" unexpectedly has the most funny inspiring speech I can remember from a movie. At the emotional arc of the movie, Lance Armstrong playing himself shares with Peter (Vaughn) that being diagnosed with brain, lung and testicular cancer drove him to win 5 Tour de Frances (at that time). He then asks Peter, ""So what are you dying of...?"" Classic. Then again Thurber's ""Dodgeball"" is full of surprises. The biggest one is that this stupid story is truly funny, for the most part clever, and has a unique charm. Even amidst the sometimes bottom of the barrel scraping humor, the movie has a genuine fondness for it's cast of lovable losers. We all pull for Peter and his team to reclaim the greatness deep inside themselves... buried very, very deep inside.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
70,Hollywood_Yoda,Warning: Do NOT Dodge This Movie!!!!!,8,12 January 2005,"When you get a chance, sit down, dodge a wrench, and watch DODGEBALL. This is a very funny movie. One of the ten best of '04 on my list. i wouldn't and I couldn't dodge this movie, even if my life depended on it.The only thing missing from the STILLER-Wilson-VAUGHN-FERRELL movie was a few of the guys. It would have been much better if they had, and would have made more money. The other films that I am talking about are Starsky & Hutch, Old School, and Anchorman.All three of those movies had all guys in them, so it made them more amusing, and more people probably expected, but missed the guys in this one.Over all, i did love this movie anyway, and you will too, as long as your in to stupid movies, that are funny. I gave it 8 of 10. So would you, wouldn't you?",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
71,gregsrants,I laughed...and that says a lot,7,22 June 2004,"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story StarsLet's get one thing perfectly clear before we even start. I had no intentions of seeing Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. None. Forking over a double-digit cash sum to be reminded of the welts I used to get in junior high playing the ridiculous game was of absolutely no appeal. Couple that with Ben Stiller playing yet another character that is so over the top that I won't know whether to laugh or to feel sorry for the guy, and I had a recipe for a long sit through.However, my trains all lined up perfectly and it was too nice of a day to waste it outside on a patio somewhere, so there I was, standing at an automated ticket counter, scanning my bank card to purchase a ticket for a movie that that I was surprised to see Ebert & Roper give two thumbs up. (By scanning, I don't have to say the title out loud and embarrass myself in a crowd).Dodgeball has the most simplistic of stories to understand. Man needs money to save gym. Man enters team into tournament. Man wins tournament and gets the woman. In short, I guess the premises of the film could have been written on cave walls some 7000 years ago, and based on its brand of humor..it just may have.The 'man' is Peter LeFleur played by Vince Vaughn, he of Starsky & Hutch, Zoolander and any other film that a Stiller or an Owen brother is attached. Peter owns a local gym that has caught the eye of White Goodman (Stiller) the driving force behind a state of the art gym facility that is franchised across the street. Due to accounting ignorance, Peter's gym, Average Joe's, is in financial woe and Goodman buys the second mortgage leaving Pete with the only option of amassing $50,000 in 30-days to save the establishment. So determined to be the David to the Goodman's Goliath, Peter and his friends come up with the hair-brained idea of entering a Dodgeball contest in Las Vegas in hopes of brandishing the prize money to thwart the bank's foreclosure. But things are not as easy as it would seem, and dodgeball is not like the game you and I might remember from the day. The rules are pretty much the same. Six balls, five players per team. Hit the person on the other side of the court and they are out. Catch a ball and you can get one of your members back in. But that is where the similarities end. Teams now consist of rugged, fierce characters with each team having a theme (girl scouts, kamikazes etc). Dodgeball is now a spectator sport with qualifying rounds and a 32-team tournament that even has ESPN 8 interested with coverage. In short, it's come a long way, baby.So the stage was set for what was an inevitable set up pitting team Average Joe against the team fielded by Gobo Gym's, Goodman. Bring on the balls!Dodgeball made me laugh. Plain and simple. Stupid? Yes. But funny? Definitely. If it wasn't chuckling to myself when instructor Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) is training the young group by having them dodge wrenches, I was laughing out loud at the best commentary during a sporting event (courtesy of Gary Cole and Jason Bateman) since Bob Uecker in Major League. From Stiller's ridiculous Goodman to Vaughn's straight man Peter, there is a perfect mix of characters and comedy that might just make this film a bigger hit this summer than the studio anticipated.Still not convinced? Well how about cameos by William Shatner, Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong and even German adored David Hasselhoff. Each of these bit parts were non-gratuitous and damn down funny. To watch Lance give a speech on how he was diagnosed with four areas of cancer at the same time and yet still managed to win the Tour de France for five straight years is self-depreciating acting at its finest without degrading the actual person.To recommend Dodgeball at the office water cooler is to guarantee yourself a reputation as someone who's opinions ought to be questioned. But if you strip the movie down to just its essentials (that is, take the love story out, cause you know how that is going to end. Take the suspense of what decision Pete is going to make, cause you know how that is going to end), then the movie is a great way to spend a day during the summer with some friends. For trust me, in about 6 months time, everyone will be talking about how they rented this movie and laughed alongside their friends and loved ones at the same carnage that brought me sympathy in Junior High. Besides, what other sport could have a team motto as fun as 'Aim Low'?",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
72,Ruskington,"If you can dodge a wrench, you can spare 90 minutes for this screwball goodness",7,13 April 2020,Dodgeball is a well-crafted jocks vs nerds comedy that gently mocks the sports movie genre and ruthlessly mocks the fitness industry. It's not subtle or original and nor does it need to be.Ben Stiller is excellent as the massively over-the-top villain and Vince Vaughn plays off him perfectly. The supporting cast is well constructed and the cameos from Lance Armstrong and Jason Bateman are brilliant. The humour is cutting and relentless without ever becoming coarse or grotesque like a lot of modern comedies.,Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
73,agmoldham,Nothing new here,4,12 September 2004,"Dodgeball is a fairly standard noughties comedy. For what it's worth Peter La Fleur (Vaughn) runs (in the loose sense of the word) a struggling gym. White Goodman (Stiller) is extremely successful and wants to buy La Fleur's gym to turn it into a car park for his own empire. La Fleur tries desperately to raise the cash to save his gym, but eventually bands together with the gym regulars to win the money they need via a Dodgeball competition.Most of the jokes are visual with the script offering few outstanding moments. The best bits are when the coach Patches O'Houlihan puts the team through their paces. It's a pleasant enough way to spend an hour and a half, but you'll probably not be able to remember too much about it after a couple of months. 6/10",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
74,TheNorthernMonkee,spoof of every Hollywood scenario in the book. hilarious,7,5 February 2005,"SPOILERS Every year there are specific situations in Hollywood films which smack of unoriginality. Whether the underdog coming out on top, the romantic aspect or the geek hero turning good in the end, Hollywood grabs these stories by the horns and exploits them beyond a joke. So it's no surprise that major spoofs arrive on the scene. ""Dodgeball"", like other films over the last ten years has exploited the catalogue to provide a hilarious little film.Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) runs Average Joes Gym. A nice guy by all standards, La Fleur spends his time with a bunch of regular losers who work out at his gym. All things look set to change however when White Goodman (Ben Stiller), owner of a major corporate gym, threatens to buy the gym unless La Fleur can earn $50,000. Now La Fleur, his friends and lawyer Kate (Christine Taylor) will work together to try to become a successful team in one of the most dangerous sports of all. Yes, they're going to play Dodgeball.The beautiful thing about ""Dodgeball"" is just how daft it really can be. With some superb little jokes, it ridicules and pokes fun at every Hollywood situation in the book.With brilliant performances by Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, the film might never be a world best, but it remains hilarious and entertaining.It's hard to know what more to say about ""Dodgeball"" really. It's a daft, funny, little film with superb casting and some magical little moments. It ridicules Hollywood and it does it with style. Well worth a watch, but it's perhaps better if you appreciate how predictable Hollywood can be.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

There is an actual story here and an actual comedic theme here. The humor is more than just exploitative sexual gags or simple vulgar humor. White Goodman is one of the most hilariously absurd and bizarre villains who by himself is a send up of many things - from the cutthroat businessman to to an arch-villain in an action movie. Then there is the game of Dodgeball; most people remember it from elementary school gym classes and seeing is as a nationwide spectacle is... well odd.

76,jpschapira,Ben Stiller movies...,6,27 November 2005,"There are some things we've (I) got to admit and others I've got to accept. I've got to admit that Ben Stiller keeps reinventing himself, always succeeding; but someone needs to tell him he's still giving us the same thing. He might change the tone of voice and the hair, but he still invites Hank Azaria to do the same stupid accents (no disrespect with Azaria), if you know what I mean.I've got to accept that Rawson Marshall Thurber's first full-length feature has its great moments. I've got to accept that although Christine Taylor keeps working with her husband, she is a talented and charming actress, not mentioning a strangely beautiful woman. And last I've got to accept that Ben Stiller is not the only reason to watch a Ben Stiller movie.In ""Duplex"" other reason to watch his movie was one of the loves of my life, Drew Barrymore; in ""Along Came Polly"" it was the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman: in ""Dodgeball"" it's Vince Vaughn. Arguably the most natural comedic actor of his generation (and also a good dramatic performer if you want to watch), he leaves Stiller painted in the wall. And this is not a comparison; I just wanted to make clear that Vaughn never seems to be making any effort.Effortless is as much as this film accomplishes too, due to the fact that it has the most predictable script I've witnessed in a long time (well ""Honey""). In addition, the writer/director relies on his cast presence to make us laugh, without realizing his lines are funny but not the way he places them in his picture. We know we could laugh, but it just doesn't come out.What surely gave Thurber the confidence in his project was his main factor: the sport. Yes, ""dodgeball"" or that kind of game we were watching Rip Torn training the characters. The man knew that with this, he would keep the audience until the end, no matter what; this is something everyone was going to stay tuned for. It was widely original, and that's the reward.Maybe it is just about bringing the audience in, like Robert Rodriguez did, when he gave two short appearances to a second-billed Salma Hayek. My point is that Hollywood these days is extremely dependable, and there's a scene in the credits that talks about it; stay so you can watch it.So what I mean is that the stars move a lot inside a movie, and I just wanna know what Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn's projects are. The second one will make a romantic comedy with Jennifer Anniston, and the first one will do ""Madagascar 2"" or something?? Anyway, you have to choose because they're both big stars and I'm not sure they'll be pairing up for you; again. I'd go see Vaughn; I bet he'll surprise me The underdog story, always seems to be true, but somehow this is ""the true"" underdog story. I'm just joking because it is the same resolution with an always interesting road. So I met the characters, the situations, the tournament transmitted by a once Brady (it's sad) and the final and most fundamental decision taken byChuck Norris (yes, Norris) leading to two different opinions: ""Thank you, Chuck Norris""""F***ing Chuck Norris!""",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
77,EijnarAmadeus,Dodge Stiller! Dodge!,7,24 January 2005,"Ben Stiller is without doubt one of the most popular and finest actors on the comedy side these days; together with Owen Wilson, Will Ferrel and Vince Caughn they seem to have a brought a small revolution into typical Hollywood laughs.DODGEBALL features neither Ferrel or Wilson; but it's got Stiller in his ace and Vaughn with his clothes on, not revealing his body for sure. This is a comedy, it's very simple. The laughs come tight and in fine spirit they're filled with irony, childish comments and stupidity, and DODGEBALL makes it all very viewable. Stiller playing the top-trained White Goodman who's goal is to be the best, and he will do everything to bring the next-door training house Average Joe's down.David Hasselhoof has a great cameo, same with Chuck Norris (although he ain't that a laugh), DODGEBALL is packed with the perfect twist between true and pure pathetic comedy and smart belly laughs, and that keeps the movie rolling although it's storyline is surely not that good of a script. Dozens of fine dialogs and entertainment. But; the movie stumbles when it gets to the part of being hilarious. It never really scores that much points on the ""laughing out loud"" part, maybe because it's a bit too busy about keeping it all so glossy stupid and ridiculous that it doesn't make time for such.DODGEBALL is a very worthy Stiller movie, and does almost everything right on it's scale.

They enter a dodgeball competition to get the needed 50 grand, but of course Globo Gym enter their own team. So, who's gonna make it to the final and who will ultimately become Dodgeball heroes? We all know the answers, but that's OK, 'cause Dodgeball has so many fun to offer we don't even care. As I said, Stiller's hilarious, as are Joel Moore and Stephen Root, but the true star is Rip Torn. His characterization of coach Patches O'Houlihan, once the best Dodgeball player around, should deserve him an Oscar. And I mean it.One more notable appearance: Christine Taylor again is a nice surprise (as in Zoolander), I noticed she's not really doing anything now: how come?

And like all good comedies, this one has many layers of subtlety (well, sort of), permitting appreciation at many levels. Some Brits may not get all the North American references and jokes, probably. Such cross-cultural differences are unavoidable, and were illustrated recently in the London newspapers' reviews of the wonderful ""Shrek 2,"" for example. But they all will nonetheless have a great time.Will Brits know that dodgeball is a common children's game, and its quasi-violent theme makes it somewhat of a rite of passage in many American's memories of primary school? Dunno... but they should be told that dodgeball, portrayed as a ""sport"" in this movie is a total gag, joke, folly, etc. Reminding us of the male modeling world in the under-rated ""Zoolander."" It makes a wonderfully sardonic backdrop for the sheer silliness and deep humor of Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, and the ever-great and immensely talented Rip Torn.This isn't a masterpiece, and may not even be ""great,"" per se, but it is very good, and well worth making the trip out to see.

Dodgeball achieves what it sets out to do, has some very funny jokes and scenes. There are some oddball comedy moments that are truly hilarious. Vince Vaughn is good in the lead role, pretty convincing as a local gym owner who is somehow faced with a dodgeball tournament to save his gym from becoming part of a franchise of gyms owned by White Goodman (Stiller). Stiller has some hilarious moments, but his acting in general is not the best, its a bit similar to a role i saw him in, in Zoolander. I liked Christine Taylor and Rip Torn were funny as heck and so was Stephen Root (Office Space). The films cast is great, Hank Azaria is hilarious in his cameo like role.

That's Vince Vaughn. Stiller's wife in real life, Christine Taylor, shows up-she's a bank attorney checking out Joe's messed up or really non-existent financial records.Average Joe's will be seized for non-payment of a mortgage and snarling, pumped up, hyper Stiller wants the place for a parking lot. $50,000 will save the day and just by coincidence that's the prize purse at the national dodgeball championship to be held in Las Vegas.You know the rest. Average Joe puts together a team of first-class nudnicks to win the prize money while the Global Gym creep confidently plans to snag the championship with his menacing crew. Of course Kate the lawyer winds up on Average Joe's team having rejected the slimy advances of his rival. It's a nice role for Taylor who has appeared mostly in B- minus films despite her highly respected and too little known breakthrough performance in 1996's ""Cat Swallows Parakeet and Speaks.""The best role is that of wheelchair-bound once great dodgeball champ Patches O'Houlihan, played with vulgar gusto by the aging but still fine Rip Torn.Director Rawson Marshall Tucker knew how to make a box office hit-whether he can do anything seriously engrossing is another question.

82,movieguy1021,Dodgeball: 7/10,7,18 June 2004,"There's nothing greater in comedies than people being hit in the groin. Expand that into 90 minutes and you've got the basic plot of Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. No, strike that. It's 90 minutes of groin hits, Ben Stiller being stupid (it's what he does best), and wrench throwing. But in silly, uncomplicated comedies like this, anything slapstick works, and most of the movie does. Sure, it's no slapstick classic, but from a rookie writer/director (Rawson Marshall Thurber, who also did the successful ""Terry Tate: Office Linebacker"" ad during the Super Bowl), it's far from bad.Peter (Vince Vaughn) owns ""Average Joe's"" gym, a rundown shack of a place which is unfortunate enough to be next to corporate Globo Gym, run by White Goodman (Ben Stiller). Average Joe's is in danger of closing unless it gets $50,000. The ragtag gym regulars decide to start a dodgeball team and go to Vegas for a dodgeball tournament, where the winners get (surprise, surprise) $50,000. But White makes his own team as they go head-to-head. Kate (Christine Taylor, Stiller's real life wife) is thrown into the mix and eventually joins the Average Joe's.Unlike most movies now, most of Dodgeball's jokes were not in the trailers. The funniest character has to be Patches (Rip Torn) as a paraplegic former Dodgeball champion who trains the Average Joes. Every line he says is insulting and derogatory, but he's really very funny. Second is Steve the Pirate (Alan Tudyk), a guy on the team who, well, thinks he's a pirate. That's about all I'll spoil, because most of it is new and clever. Sure, like all comedies, it drags towards the end (and becomes drawn out and dramatic), but in general, the second half had more laughs than the first. Most of them were either from Stiller (his best role since...uh...Starsky and Hutch?) or being hit by balls. Sure, it got old, and the sound effect they always used was annoying, but it was still quite funny.Thurber seems to know how to balance the characters (such as which characters are the most important so those characters get development), and it really shows. It's hard to really explain, but you'll see if you go to the movie. Yet he can't keep away from the typical romance. Kate and White/Peter have such throwaway romances that they aren't even worth talking about. In fact, this whole movie is a throwaway movie. It's very funny, but you probably won't remember that you even saw it soon after. Except for Stiller's ""Joanie loves Chachi!"" It's seen in the trailers and it's probably the funniest line in the movie due to the context. Overall, Dodgeball is not a memorable movie, but quite a funny one, and it's worth seeing.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for rude and sexual humor, and language.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
83,ThurstonHunger,"Dodgeball hits target but just bounces off, leaves no sting",5,31 December 2004,"Not sure where this film failed to be a gut-buster. On paper with the actors, and even some of the movies quotes listed at IMDb, it seems like it should have rated higher on the mirth meter. In retrospect, I think one problem is the film hangs so much upon Stiller's inflated lampooning of the White Goodman character. It's done somewhat cleverly and no doubt aggressively enough, but you never get the sense that behind it all Stiller feels anything remotely resembling a connection to his character. It's more of a class clown tour-de- force that just wears thin over the course of a full-length film.All ""those beautiful people are really ugly and vapid"" moments are kind of undercut by a culture that has already seen celebrities at their worst volumes one, two, ad nauseum.In addition, Stiller's character sort of obliterates Vince Vaughan whom I was looking to seeing more from. Vaughan's humor tends to be more subtly acerbic, and typically you're not so sure who's in on the joke. He's too cool to be cool, too dorky to be dorky?It's got to be so hard to write, rehearse, re-shoot and edit a comedy...and keep some sort of truly improvisational zip to it. I think that's why we hunger so much for the bloopers and outtakes. A big part of comedy is the juxtaposition of two really unexpected forces...but many of us have already seen too many ""everything-and-the- kitchen-sink"" comedies. Even the principals in the voice-over commented on this when talking about the dodge wrenches scene.More interesting was the alternate ending suggested with the DVD and again discussed in the voice-over. We are to believe the studios wrenched a happy ending for these Bad News Nerd Bears.That coupled with the end-of-the-credits lard of the Milkshake dance by Stiller, hint at a darker, stronger comedy. Plated with latex, Stiller taunts America with the payoff that they wanted... and says ""You happy? Fatty make a funny?""The dance and play on the already too often parodied pop song are no big deal. However that one line was arrestingly funny for me.That left a mark for me. The other barrage of humor is a mix of hits and misses that will probably depend more on when and who you see the film with.

Vince Vaughn plays the good guy, Peter LaFleur, who assembles a ragtag dodgeball team to save his little gym from being taken over by Goodman.  There is lots of physical comedy, and some clever cameos.  The writing spoofs sports madness, with ideas like yet another ESPN.  And be sure to stick around for Stiller's scene at the end!",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

The scenes follow on each other seamlessly in a very fluid way, making it almost impossible to get bored or to find that time passes slowly.The gags aren't hilarious but it is pretty fun overall, like the crazy character of Ben Stiller, who, by the way, does very well compared to a monotonous and relatively transparent Vince Vaughn.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

Dont go expecting a strong story - it is the predictable underdog sports movie but they also have great fun lampooning all that. The great Rip Torn (Larry Sanders Show) chews up the scenery and everyone does strong work. I do feel, however, that the only reason Christine Taylor is in the movie is because she IS Stiller's wife. She did dead-on funny work as Marcia Brady in the Brady Bunch Movies, but since then I always find her kinda drab and one-note. Stiller and Vaughn play off of each other quite well and the cameos by B-Level actors are hilarious! Some really funny bits and I hate to admit it - but it IS really funny to see people absolutely whammed with a ball.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

A wonderful script has been written with everyone can deliver with, including Rip Torn. Rip Torn is hilarious in this movie, and delivers most of the best lines. The physical comedy doesn't always work, but it often does in this film, with many objects hitting the different actors.

94,Magow-Intermean,Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story Review,9,30 March 2019,"Faced with losing his gym to a corporate chain, Peter La Fleur (Vaughn) enters his ragtag clientele in the Vegas Dodgeball Tournament. But Globo Gym's White Goodman (Stiller) is hip to their plan, entering his Purple Cobras to stop them.
Dodgeball's subtitle - 'A True Underdog Story' - couldn't be more apt. When the film first appeared, it was a true underdog indeed, written off as a lesser offering from Ben Stiller's Frat Pack. Once it hit, though, it was clear that this was arguably the most quotable - and funniest - dumb comedy since The Naked Gun.On release, all the plaudits went to Stiller's preening villain White Goodman, but this is, in truth, an ensemble movie, with the likes of Rip Torn's foul-mouthed Patches O'Houlihan ably supporting him. The movie's secret weapon, though, is Vince Vaughn's sardonic protagonist Peter LaFleur, who keeps the craziness grounded in a manner reminiscent of a young Bill Murray.So many ideas and gags crash into each other that some are bound to miss, and there are one or two patchy spells, but it's in the melding of styles that Dodgeball works, as director Rawson Marshall Thurber blends character-based comedy with gross-out and an excellent deployment of cameos (Norris! Shatner! Hasselhoff!). Most of all, it's a tribute to the joys of physical comedy - watching people being hit in the balls has never been so much fun.Snappy, shameless and silly, it never once drops the ball. Catch it now.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
95,christian123,Not Stillers worst film but he has better work out there,4,28 December 2004,"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is as stupid as the title sounds its also a not very funny movie. In order to save their favorite local gym, a slacker (Vince Vaughn) assembles a motley group of friends into a strong enough dodgeball team to enter into an intensive competition in Vegas against the superstar team assembled by the corporation taking over the gym, led by White Goodman (Ben Stiller). The story is kind of new at least the dodgeball part but the underdog part has been used a lot. The trailer was really funny but as it always happens all of the jokes are used in the trailer and that there were no new funny jokes in the movie. The movie is only 92 minutes but it feels like its two hours especially when the theme is dodgeball and all they do is throw balls at each other. After awhile, watching someone get hit in the face with a dodgeball loses it appeal. The cast doesn't really save this movie either, first there's Vince Vaughn who is mildly funny in the movie but he should have been a lot funnier. This is Christine Taylor's first role since the hilarious Zoolander and she doesn't really add anything to the film nor does she take anything away. This is Ben Stiller's fourth film in six months and is the third best out of the four. His character is really annoying and is not very but hopefully he can rebound with Meet the Fockers. What saves this movie is the supporting cast as they bring in the laughs the best being Rip Torn and Missi Pyle. Director is Rawson Marshall Thurber, this is his first mainstream movie and he did a decent job. Rating 5/10, not a very funny film even with the talent involved.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

His character is not that well written in the first place, but his delivery of every line is certainly in character! A guy that doesn't really seem to care about anything, in the most average of ways. But he is a lady killer, for some reason.
The rest of the cast is as dumb as he is (except for Christine Taylor, the only real human being in it), and Ben Stiller is the only one trying his hard to be memorable.. sadly, it's not the good kind of memorable.The story goes by rather quickly, as nothing much happens in it. It feels small, as the world they are in.

In charge of Global Gym is health freak White Goodman (Ben Stiller) who has sought only to buy Average Gym. Along with Peter are his good friends Gordon, Owen, Justin, Dwight, and Steve the Pirate who are all determined to save the gym.Seeing it as there last option, they enter a dodge ball tournament in Las Vegas. The dodge ball scenes are all hilarious from Pack 417 to the Break Dancing Dodgeball team I was crying it was so funny. Vince Vaughn is funny and is able to bring the sense of a man being down on his luck while being funny at the same time. However, Ben Stiller takes the movie into the hilarious film it is. Being so determined to one-up Peter, Ben Stiller makes no sense in what he says and what he does, I fell out of my seat laughing watching the bar scene. Rip Torn, as there coach is probably the second best only to Stiller. With such great scenes as the wrench dodging scene, you'll find it impossible not to laugh.Christine Taylor is also in the film as the only female dodge ball player on Average Joe's. She isn't exactly funny but she does bring some quality acting. What was so surprising to me, though, was the way the writer was able to write so much simple comedy and make it absolutely hilarious. The cameos are over the top with appearances by Lance Armstrong, Chuck Norris, David Hasselhof, and William Shatner and make the movie even more silly. But no matter how silly, how stupid it got it continued to be funny and passed a good hour and a half.Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.

98,Okonh0wp,Riveting and Sharp Comedy,8,25 June 2005,"Dodgeball is a riveting and sharp comedy about a sport we all stopped taking seriously after our last elementary school gym class.Vince Vaughn plays Peter LaFluer, owner of a rundown gym called Average Joe's. His membership total consists of just five, but nevertheless, the personable LaFluer is happy to be of service to his clients, even if they are all pathetically out of shape and a little off the norm. His gym is in financial trouble, however, and LaFluer is notified at the start of the film that he has thirty days to pay off its loan or it will be shut down. LaFluer's gym will be bought out by Globo, owned by the villainous White Goodman. Stiller pulls out the stops as Goodman, taking every opportunity to make himself dislike-able so that his demise at the film's end will be all the more sweeter.In need of a desperate solution, LaFluer and his clients sit down in his office and brainstorm. The solution comes from Gordon (Root) who reads in his magazine Obscure Sports Quarterly about an upcoming dodgeball tournament in which they could win the required money, so the ragtag bunch sets out to learn the sport and win the tournament. Their biggest obstacle is that in order to ensure Average Joe's shutdown, Goodman fields a team of bodybuilders to win the tournament and deny LaFluer the money, setting the stage for a David vs Goliath match up in the upcoming tournament.If there's one thing, aside from the satire, that there is to love about this movie, it's the quirky group of guys who comprise LaFluer's team. With the exception of Dwight (Williams), whose quirkiest attribute is his hatred of his previous job at the airport, the group is a very creative assemblage of underdogs. Vaughn plays the straight man, next to Stiller, his own team, and pretty much everyone else in the movie. You'd think that the love interest Christine Taylor as the lawyer, initially hired by Goodman to shut down Average Joe's but ends up joining the team out of disgust for the villain, but she turns out to have her own weird attributes.In a sense, Dodgeball is sort of a quasi-sports film because it centers around a sport that doesn't actually exist in terms of a spectator base, and uses that to poke fun at some of the sillier aspects of our present-day athletic culture. Be warned, this film is merciless, attacking everything from bodybuilders to ESPN to team uniforms. I particularly found it hilarious that the tournament was broadcast on ESPN 8, which probably is only a couple years away at this rate, and that one of the sports commentators (Arrested Development's Jason Bateman) knew absolutely nothing of what he was talking about.The movie gets caught up in all the satire, however, and towards the end drifts off into an absurd ending that really left a bad taste in my mouth. The ending threw so much of reality out the window, that it felt like a Mel Brooks film, which is a shame because up until the last couple minutes, the film did a terrific job at cracking out hilarious jokes within the context of a story. Looking back, though, the first couple of hours more than make up for the last couple of minutes, and I would have rather the movie aimed high and missed a couple notes, rather than being safe and not being as funny.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

Also another one of my favorite sport movies too. This movie is about a guy named Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn) who is a charismatic underachiever and proprietor of a rundown gym called Average Joe's. The facility's eclectic client of decidedly less-than-average Joes is comprised of: a self-styled pirate; a scrawny nerd who dreams of impressing an unattainable cheerleader; an obsessive aficionado of obscure sports; a dim-witted young man; and a cocky know-it-all who, of course, really knows nothing. Peter's humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the power-mullet-sporting, Fu-Manchu-d, ego maniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. White intends to take over Average Joe's, and Peter's non-existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy for him. A foreclosing bank has stationed attorney Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) inside Average Joe's to finalize Globo's takeover of the gym. But Peter's boyish charms win her over and Kate joins his team of social rejects to beat the odds and save the Average Joes gym from going out of business and winning the $50 million dollars in a winner take all dodge-ball tournament in Las Vegas with the help from a senior dodge-ball player Patches O'Houlihan (older version played by Rip Torn and the younger version played by Hank Azaria). After this movie came out in theaters back in June 2004, adult dodge-ball leagues began to play all across the country and Gary Cole was even invited to a pro dodge-ball tournament in Chicago, IL.

Check out my review to find out!",10,7 June 2021,"""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" (2004), a lot of you all probably know this already. I'm not all that into sports, I actually enjoy playing sports more than I do watching them on TV! Out of all the sports I played during gym class, my all-time favorite was, and still is dodgeball. Whenever I knew we were going to play dodgeball, I would really get pumped up! So, when I heard of this movie, I got excited and wanted to go check it out. Unfortunately, I was too young to see it in a theater during the time it came out, as I was only 12. I didn't get the chance to watch it until I was 15. But, it was 100% worth the wait! This film has also found a spot on my top 10 all-time favorite sports movies. ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together. The story is, a group of people enter the Las Vegas dodgeball tournament in order to save their local gym after it has been purchased by a global corporate fitness chain. Now, to some people it may sound a little too generic. However, as I've mentioned before, the simpler the plot, the better. With a simple story, it allows extra room for character development and comedic moments. This film has a perfect balance of excitement and comedy. Aside from that, it has a lot of heart and soul in it as well, which a lot of these newer sports films don't have that much of anymore. When there's good heart behind the story of a film, it conveys a stronger impact. I won't go into anymore details about the plot, but it's a storyline that you'll remember for the rest of your life. As far as the acting goes, it's perfect from all the actors and actresses. Their performances really help bring the movie to life! The chemistry between the characters is nothing short of impeccable. All of the sets/locations are perfect and give the film a great atmosphere. The special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. Which is no surprise, seeing that this movie was made back in 2004! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Theodore Shapiro is fantastic and it sets the perfect tone for the storyline. That's the mark of a great film score! ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is one of the top ten greatest sports films of all-time, in my opinion. Whenever I watch it, I find myself thoroughly invested and laughing all the way through. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars.

106,Gideon24,Funny movie with likable characters,7,10 April 2015,"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is a fast-paced and very funny sports comedy that scores points for being centered around a sport that hasn't been the subject of too many movies.The movie stars Vince Vaughn playing one of his most likable characters, Peter LaFleur, the owner of a gym that is about to go under who puts together a rag-tag team of misfits to participate in a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas in order to win the large cash prize.Prior to this movie, I had no idea that dodgeball was a team sport that has Olympic-like rules, displayed here In a hilarious training film that Peter shows his team. This premise sets up a classic Revenge of the Nerds-esque confrontation between Peter's team and a team from a rival gym that wants to buy Peter out, owned by the arrogant White Goodman (Ben Stiller).A romantic triangle is also set up with the presence of an accountant who has been hired to help Peter, but White ends up trying to pursue her as well. Ironically, this role is played by Ben Stiller's real-life spouse, Christine Taylor, who first caught our eye as Marcia in the two Brady Bunch movies.Vaughn is actually the straight man here to Stiller, who is hysterically funny here, as are Stephen Root, Chris Williams, and Alan Tudyk as members of Peter's team, Missi Pyle as a beast from White's team, Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as color commentators at the tournament, and especially Rip Torn as Patches Houlihan, the alleged Dodgeball legend who agrees to help coach Peter's team.Funny dialogue, music video-paced direction and cast that aims to please help to make this comedy worth checking out.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

I thought I was getting tired of Ben Stiller, but he's great here as playing a send-up of the typical villain in those types of movies. It's a lot of fun to watch him with puffed-up blondish hair, a Leather-Man-from-the-Village-People mustache, and an affected ""tough"" speaking tone play the kind of idiotic bad guy we all love to hate.

108,Benjamin_Cox,Patchy effort lit up by show-stealing Rip Torn - 65%,6,19 May 2006,"I always felt that this was one of those films that looked funny in the trailers but was actually a load of rubbish. Sport-based films tend to follow a very strict plot line and structure and this is their fatal flaw - an actual game where the underdogs win is genuinely exciting whereas the opposite is true if shown in movies. Increasingly, sport movies rely on comedy to help them through and ""Dodgeball"" is yet another of these tactless, in-yer-face comedies that are about as PC as Bernard Manning at a Women's Institute meeting. But sadly, it isn't as funny as it wants to be and is saved from total ignorance by a blistering performance from a veteran actor in a supporting role.Vince Vaughn plays Peter La Fleur, a regular everyman running a dilapidated gym called Average Joes opposite the corporate mega-structure of White Goodman's (Ben Stiller) Globo Gym. When Globo Gym threaten to take Average Joes over, Peter and his plucky group of losers find themselves entering a dodgeball competition in order to secure the prize money needed to keep them in business. But ego-maniacal fitness freak White is determined to get his way and enters his own team in the tournament. And given that both guys are chasing corporate lawyer Kate (Stiller's wife Christine Taylor), the clash is given an extra edge.Given that this is the basic plot, you can probably see the movie's ending from here. In fact, the film very nearly falls apart midway through as it just gets sillier and sillier the longer it goes on and it's not that clever to begin with. ""Dodgeball"" is, at times, an idiotic incoherent mess that does nothing new or remarkable at all, despite a few glimpses of genuine laughs. So why isn't it a total failure, I hear you cry. Well, it's all down to Rip Torn's hilarious appearance as wheelchair-bound veteran dodgeball coach Patches O'Houlihan who has all the best lines, the best put-downs (""You're about as useful as a c***-flavoured lollipop"") and all the best scenes. He easily steals the film and when he's not there, the film really suffers although Stiller is also good as the obnoxious Goodman.With a tighter script and more consistent laughs, this could have been fabulous. But being kept firmly on the sports-plot railroad merely adds to the film's problems. It's daft and only sporadically funny, relying on Rip Torn to carry it through. Like ""Anchorman"", it can't maintain the humour right the way through and by the time the film ends, the whole thing feels cobbled together rather amateurishly. It's a great pity because Rip Torn is simply brilliant in ""Dodgeball"" and probably deserves his own show. But nothing else can keep up with him. Even if you're familiar with the ""sport"" of dodgeball (which we aren't in the UK), this film won't completely bowl you over. ""Dodgeball"" - you're out!",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

NOBODY"", White Goodman (Ben Stiller) in Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.This ridiculous quote (don't bother searching for inner logic within it, you won't find any) is taken from one of the most zany, crude and remarkably dumb movies that were made for the silver screen in recent years. Guess what? The formula, absurd as it is, actually works. With the right cast, inexplicable cameos (Chuck Norris, Lans Armstrong and William Shatner all in one), and just the right amount of grown-up actors who are willing to embarrass themselves at any cost  Dodgeball is the best sports comedy made in the 2000's (miles better than Will Ferrell's overrated Talladega Nights).Dodgeball tells the ludicrous story of a bunch of losers (A high school student with aspirations of becoming a male cheerleader, a man who thinks he's a pirate, a spineless nerd married to a male-ordered Asian wife and more) who work out together in a gym conveniently named ""Average Joes"". The manager of the gym is Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn, in his last pre-Wedding Crashers days), who has an ongoing dispute with one White Goodman (Stiller), the owner of a mega-successful chain of gyms who looks to take over La Fleur's gym as well. La Fleur, who is also in deep financial debts, has to come up with 50 grand as soon as possible, in order to prevent Goodman from executing his devilish scheme. When he and his brethren of losers learn about an obscure Dodgeball competition with a 50,000$ award tag attached, they must learn to play the game fast, and overcome Goodman's competing team in the finals.The movie is very short, and very accelerating (I knew nothing about Dodgeball upon my first view, but hooked up with the rules of the game as the film went along), and pumps you up towards its adrenaline packed finale. The main course, however, is Ben Stiller's character, Goodman. Stiller gives out his best performance to date by portraying Goodman as the dumbest bad guy you'll ever see. The narcissistic head of the competitive chain of gyms is a goofy character, who speaks illogical sentences, often contradicting himself; greases himself up and masturbates with a Pizza slice (don't ask me how this works). Stiller gives Goodman the most outrageous gestures and one-liners I've seen in a while, especially when confronting Vaughn's character on screen; and comes out as a complete arrogant jerk. Stiller's real life wife, Christine Taylor, is the bisexual bank accountant who comes to La Fleur's aid and eventually falls for him (more or less). Taylor and Vaughn's chemistry with Stiller is a definite advantage that helps carry the movie throughout its comedic sequences, setting an extremely high bar for future nonsense comedies.If you love sports and comedies, and you don't get offended easily, Dodgeball is the place to be for relaxation and guilty pleasures.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
111,Pavel-8,The degeneration of Ben Stiller continues.,4,21 June 2004,"**Warning! Minor Spoilers Ahead!**Imagine you're a world famous chef (Bear with me, this is going somewhere...honest.) preparing a pasta dish for a big competition. You've rounded up the best possible ingredients, and whipped up a picture perfect meal. The homemade pasta is perfect; the chicken appears to be seasoned ideally; and the cream sauce is to die for. It all looks great on the table, except for one thing: you unintentionally used sugar instead of salt in the marinade, literally leaving the judges with an unpleasant taste in their mouths. The sauce and pasta are still good, but the dissonant taste of the chicken ruins the entire dish. That's ""Dodgeball"". The concept drips with comic potential: an underdog dodgeball team, led by Vince Vaughn, faces off against the Goliath of the sport, a squad captained by Ben Stiller (in his fourth and perhaps worst movie of 2004). That's a typical sports movie storyline, infused with Stiller's usually stellar humor. The cast, primarily Vaughn and Stiller, are top comedic actors who have proven their talents multiple times. But the flavoring provided by two-thirds of the script dooms the entire film to mediocrity at best. Maybe Stiller needs Owen Wilson back to write him a passable script. The title and hilarious trailer present the premise of the movie, but don't warn of the sixty minutes of filler that surround the games themselves. The basic setup of competing gyms is funny, and once finally reached thirty minutes in, the dodgeball scenes are comic gold. It's dodgeball for crying out loud. Just typing that makes me laugh. Televised on ESPN8, The Ocho, the championship tournament and its ethnically diverse teams provide the movie's best laughs. But in the meantime the movie struggles in ways that many sports movies do, as pointless, often crass, story arcs futilely attempt to inject romance and purpose into the games. I realize that the movie has to be longer than half an hour, but the quality comedy of dodgeball deserves better than bad SNL support. Stiller inadvertently explains the problem with his movie in the worst credits sequence I've ever seen. He mockingly complains that audiences are looking for mindless entertainment, ironically having just sated that very group of people. Instead of producing razor-sharp satire like ""Zoolander"", Stiller and his crew have degenerated into substandard crude comedy (and I use the term loosely) reminiscent of (gasp) ""BASEsketball"". The last ten minutes are a prime example. After the inevitable climax, not a single line or scene is necessary. It's nothing but crude and lazy fluff, stretching the running time to a palatable 90 minutes. The cast and crew have proven they can produce good to great comedy without resorting to puerile tactics and endless joke repetition. Better is expected here, especially of Stiller, who also co-produced ""Dodgeball"". He has churned out comedic hits like ""Keeping the Faith"", ""Meet the Parents"", and ""Zoolander"", all of which were often roll-on-the-floor funny without waaaay over-the-top violence and innuendo. On the minimal plus side, Stiller and Vaughn are still their usual solid selves, although most of the stale jokes seem to be recycled from their other work. Perhaps because Stiller seems to be working so hard to earn laughs, Vaughn shines as the straight man. Nothing he does is inherently humorous, in fact I don't think he even performed all that well, but within the context of such an overblown movie, his subdued everyman actions occasionally strike a comedic chord. Christine Taylor is again adequate, playing almost the same character she did in ""Zoolander"", a role that demands little. Rip Torn is the right man for his part as a crotchety old ex-dodgeball star, but his excessive crudeness and violence doesn't play right, although his departure from the movie does provide one of its funnier moments. As a standard assortment of misfits and musclemen, no one else does much of anything worth mentioning, except for a few strong cameo appearances that leave you wishing for more. Technically, there's not much to say. Comedies such as this, even the good ones, are rarely notable (in a good or bad manner) for editing or score, and form holds here. The only noteworthy accomplishment is the horrific use of Chris De Burgh's classic ballad ""Lady in Red"". The movie raised various unanswerable questions. What's the deal with the pirate? How many times am I supposed to laugh at a guy getting hit in the groin? Do the financial aspects at the end actually make sense? Why did I pay money to see this garbage? These queries are unanswerable because by the time the movie stumbles to a halt, your brain will be numb, and you won't care enough to try a logical response. With the subtitle of ""A True Underdog Story"", perhaps ""Dodgeball"" was hoping to spawn a sequel. I hope that it does. Perhaps that one will find the missing two-thirds of this movie and live up to the potential promised by the premise and talent. Bottom Line: Less than half of a great movie gets less than half of a great rating.  4 of 10, and that might be generous.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
112,guyfromjerzee,Hi-larious!,8,8 July 2004,"No other word can describe this movie. I was laughing from start to finish!This is the kind of wacky sports comedy that ""Baseketball"" aspired to be, but failed miserably. It helps that the cast is first-rate. Ben Stiller gives what quite possibly may be his funniest performance yet! He's a genuinely versatile comedic actor, yet he seems to be stuck playing the shy, bumbling boyfriend in his most recent work. Just his look alone in this movie, with the handlebar moustache, will make you crack up. And Vince Vaughn is an underrated actor whose straight, deadpan delivery makes the jokes even funnier. There are plenty of hilarious gags that are still making me laugh just thinking about them. For example, the one where Rip Torn (who wonderfully plays a veteran of the dodge ball game) talks about drinking his own urine. You can classify a multitude of cameos as a cheap shot, but who cares? It's still entertaining. The cameos include everyone from David Hasselhoff to William Shatner to Chuck Norris. Since their names appear in the cast list, there's no use keeping their cameos a secret, but I won't give away where they appear. There's a gratuitous car wash montage involving beautiful girls in bikinis, and a dance number with bikini-clad dodge ball cheerleaders. So the movie is entertaining in all regards. If you're in the mood to laugh and laugh hard, ""Dodgeball"" is the movie to see.There's some pretty low-brow stuff, yet it's not so low-brow that you feel like your intelligence is insulted.

This overexposed Stiller has some few new turkeys on his resume. Fortunately, Dodgeball is making up for them.This is the funniest movie I've seen since ""Something About Mary"".

115,scarletminded,Rips of BASEbasketball and dodges any type of humor! It's like a 10 minute SNL sketch stretched into a 90 minute frame!,1,3 January 2005,"I rented this film because the trailer looked very funny. The producers must have taken all the funny bits and put them into 60 seconds. After that, there was no fun to be had.The funniest parts of this film were the ESPN graphics and jokes and Obscure Sports Quarterly, also a visual gag. The rest of the funny parts were stolen right from BASEbasketball-- the team names, the girls dancing in extreme costumes, the obscure sports idea-- but BASEbasket did it more original and more funny to watch. I highly recommend that over Dodgeball.The movie feels like it was a SNL sketch that should have lasted 10 minutes yet was stretched to fit an hour and a half. The actors look like they were given a couple lines and then told to go for it. They look blank at times like they don't have anything funny to say. Basically if you like comedies where the characters and situations are just supposed to be hilarious and they are, like The Royal Tenenbaums, devoid of any jokes or humor beyond that. Maybe this has something to do with Ben Stiller, since he was in both films. That might be the case, since I did like Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. I was brought up with the idea of comedies to either be satires or had a joke a minute thrown at you, like Airplane, the Naked Gun and South Park. A movie like Dodgeball moves slow because the characters, after they come into the scene and give you that one laugh, like the gym owner or the pirate guy, don't seem to have any more steam and the viewer is suppose to enjoy it for what it is. It seems to be the new wave of comedy film making and it isn't funny nor makes any sense. The jokes fall flat, like everything was improved and nothing was written down. Movies cannot live by improv alone. Take Timecode and movies like that....please. Then, if you get the DVD, there is an alternate ending that made me laugh, not because it was funny, because it was so bad. I don't think the director knows how to make a movie. Rawson Marshall Thurber should go back to his day job!I give this a 1, which is the lowest rating I have given any movie. If there was a 0, I would give it for my time wasted.

Everything else tends to be films where everyone says ""you've gotta see it... it's so funny"" and then when you actually sit through it, you either can't wait for it to end or you turn it off. Dodgeball was no exception to the rule.The screenwriters must have burst a blood vessel in their brain coming up with the misfit underdog formula and once they had put the finishing touches on this trite, they handed it over to the casting agent who looked no further than the dreadful Ben Stiller to fly across the screen as the moronic and ultimately unfunny adversary. The fact that this crap made so much money is a sad indictment on the general public's taste in comedy.And I'm still waiting for a Ben Stiller film that I actually like.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

119,flickershows,A Funny Bit Of Comic Stupidity,7,8 July 2004,"I have no awful memories of dodgeball and I will have no awful memories of 'Dodgeball'. I had fun playing this simplest of school games and had fun breezing through this goof-fest of a movie. As the cliche goes, it's good for a laugh. Actually, it's good for plenty of laughs and that's far more than I can say for most joke-free comedies. It's five sticks of foolish fun. I don't know how they pulled it off, though, because this ridiculous material has no right to be as enjoyable as it is, especially since you know where it's heading from the opening credits. Cliches or not, the filmmakers make it work.Slacker Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) owns a dive of a gym called Average Joe's. Muscle-twit White Goodman (Ben Stiller) owns the massive Globo Gym and intends to buy up La Fleur's business. To raise the $50,000 needed to pay the mortgage, a handful of members at Average Joe's enter a dodgeball tournament in Vegas. The jealous Goodman gathers super-jocks together to enter the same tourney. The lovely Christine Taylor (Kate Veach) is the third point of a humourous love triangle, who also proves to be a whiz playing the title game. Apart from a few twists and turns, the story follows the well-worn 'Rocky' path. It even takes some gentle jabs at the formula.This flick proves once again that pratfalls are funny. Watching La Fleur's clumsy chums get pegged with red balls during Rip Torn's brutal training sessions, writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber treks to the well...but never goes there once too often. Stiller's insecure character hammers the same note, but he's still pretty funny in a very obnoxious role. Vaughn is about as relaxed as a piece of lunch meat, which goes against his usual high-strung style. The supporting cast members (including Stephen Root, who will always be Bill from ""King Of The Hill"" to me) don't leap past the stars, even though they all get to shine with lots of nerdy moments of comic stupidity.What I found surprising is that many of the laughs hit you in the face a beat or two later. I expected that a movie with such obvious intentions would play all its cards right in front of you, but many of the jokes work best as rebounders and asides. Stiller and Vaughn must have called in some favours to get all the guest stars to do a cameo---some of them are great and some are unnecessary. In any case, 'Dodgeball' is a hoot without being a manic ""throw everything at the wall"" type comedy. There's nothing wrong with that, unless you hated the game as a kid. Then again, considering this is a ""true underdog story"", maybe inept dodgeballers can enjoy it too.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

That and Ben Stiller's character who is essentially Ben Stiller if he snorted a little too much cocaine.The characters have humorous backstories, apart from the token black guy who is just left to wisecrack half the time.

Christine Taylor was good too :)I'd watch this movie again anytime, one of the best comedy movies I've seen in a long time :) ****1/2 out of ***** (the half point taken away by David Hasselhoof's came, I have no idea what he was doing or why he was there, but it was stupid and not fun).",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

There really was no story to talk about.The gags and jokes I thought were unoriginal and pretty lame. I'm not really a fan of Ben Stiller as I do not really agree with him in terms of what is funny and what is not. This movie just reminded me too much of BASEkeball which I really did not enjoy.

137,segratz,"Great Fun, if you like movies like Zoolander",7,21 June 2004,"I have always hated the game of dodgeball - I find degrading, horrifying, and of course, I was always a little girl in those coed gym classes who got smacked in the head. So I thought I would really hate this movie - but when others are getting hit in the head with a ball I could truly appreciate how funny it is as the bully. I did feel their pain though. This is no high brow humor movie - there is little brain work needed to watch, so I would say drop your maturity down a few notches and you will appreciate the art of slapstick. There are some brief celebrity appearances that are fun to watch too, and this is the first Stiller movie I laughed out loud the whole time since Zoolander. Warning: If you are not a fan of that movie, then you'll probably hate this one because it is the same crazy humor. The characters are so outrageous, the story so ridiculous, that I loved the whole thing.

There was barely a minute that passed when there wasn't any laughs. I won't go into the plot because you probably know it but let me tell you if you don't laugh at this there is not much else you will laugh at. The last time I laughed so hard at the cinema was when I saw Austin Powers Goldmember. Anyway Ben Stiller was superb in this movie along with the rest of the cast, but Stiller really did steal it for me. He was brilliant as the villain and the last scene in the movie had me laughing all the way home.Go and check this movie out right now and have yourself some big laughs!",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

I at least expected it to be funny like Old School. This was no Old School. Not even close. All the jokes were cheap and crude. Sometimes that works for me but it didn't in this movie. Endless jokes about sexual orientation and stereotypes that I found rather offensive. Stiller is once again playing a doufus and is not funny. I used to be one of his biggest fans but he hasn't been in a decent movie since Keeping the Faith. Vaughn is the only bright spot in this. Some people lap this kinda comedy up.

140,eternalsea,2004's funniest film,8,29 March 2006,"Dodgeball is simply Ben Stiller operating at his peak. Sure he was good in There's something about Mary and Meet the Parents saw a good comic performance but Dodgeball is surely were his best role lies. The film tells the story of two competing gyms. One is run by a bunch of misfits and has serious financial difficulties. The other is a multi million outfit run by Stiller and his cronies. As the poor gym desperately trys to earn money the mega gym attempts to thwart it in every way until the poor gym come across the game of dodgeball. A championship is to be held this year and if the gym win they will have enough to continue their business. However the mega gym also enters in an attempt to put an end to their business once and for all. The cast are all awesome. Vince Vaughn is the likable hero and in Justin Long pain has never been so funny. Ben Stiller as I mentioned above is the star performance however and in many respects the man carries the movie. The film has good pacing even if certain comical scenes and jokes are stretched at times, plus the Dodgeball sequences themselves are very entertaining. The jokes do come thick and fast and 90% of them work perfectly. The other 10% do stick out a bit though. Some of these jokes also suffer from to much bad taste , such as the pizza down the pants sequence. All in all Dogeball is a great film for laughs and is certainly the funniest film 2004 offered us.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
141,sublime501,Surprisingly hilarious.,8,10 July 2004,"DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY is the surprising comedy about the owner of Average Joe's Gym, Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn), who finds his gym wanting to be bought out by fitness mogul White Goodman (Ben Stiller) to add to the monolith that is his GloboGym. The only way to prevent his gym from being bought out is to somehow turn up with $50,000--which, needless to say, is quite a stretch. In a moment of genius, one of the gym's attendants, Gordon (Stephen Root), suggests they go to the Dodgeball Championships in Las Vegas and try to win the grand prize of (coincidentally) $50,000. The Average Joe's team assembles and, though they are lousy at first, win the required regional match and are in. With the help of retired dodgeball champ Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn), the team improves and goes on to the Championships--where Goodman and his bunch of goons are also playing to try to stop Average Joe's from winning the prize.Why is DODGEBALL a surprising comedy? Because it's actually hilarious. From the previews, I wouldn't have thought so. But they were misleading--this was an extremely funny film. The main credit should go to Ben Stiller, who was truly hilarious as Goodman. The facial expressions he makes in this movie are classic. Vince Vaughn is given what is, in my opinion, a boring role with few jokes, but he does great with it, as does the rest of the supporting cast with their roles. One of the best comedic ensembles I've seen in a while.As for the comedy itself... the majority of the physical stuff is stupid. That's what made me think that it looked stupid from the previews--all that they showed was physical stunts. The getting-hit-in-the-balls gag is completely overdone, and used at least 10 times in this movie. The training scenes and the dodgeball games don't strike me as very funny; instead, it's the jokes and particularly Ben Stiller's character that made me crack up. My particular favorite scene involved the painting of the bull--the way it was painted made me almost fall out of my seat with laughter.The story is overworked, but charming and cute. The outcome of the final dodgeball game is entirely predictable, but still manages to pose as a happy and satisfying end to the movie. The hookup between Peter and his lawyer Kate (Christine Taylor) is completely predictable as well, but this movie adds a funny spin on it. It does well with its plot and doesn't make it boring or uninteresting.After seeing DODGEBALL, it may have just replaced MEAN GIRLS as the funniest movie I've seen recently. Surprisingly hilarious, minus the overdone and cluttering physical stunts. 8/10.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

While there are a few funny moments, I couldn't help thinking throughout the whole thing just how bad the characterizations were. Stiller, arguably the funniest, does a character that is basically a nastier version of his Derek Zoolander character, but far, far less funny. Vince Vaughn basically mopes throughout the whole movie, and for the life of me I can't understand why I should even know his name. The supporting characters should have arguably been the highlight of the movie - funny, memorable, lovable, etc. Instead, they are all barely memorable and scarecely believable hangers on, each actor hoping to coat tails of one of the others' successful characters. Even the pirate is just not funny, and for the life of me, I don't understand how they could have missed with a character like that, but they did. Badly.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller have a great chemistry, their stature difference was really funny.The movie has many classic comedic moments like the car wash or their first match with the girl scouts or the suitcase with a million dollars. Justin Long has one of the funniest slapstick moments. One of my favorite ones is the wrench thrown at him. It gets me every time. Hank Azaria as young Patches was perfect casting.

The film has very good programming, and also shows glimpses maybe of a secondcoming? Maybe.Good reasons why to see this film. Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor are brilliant together, Vince Vaughn really gave a solid performance, the suspense is great, and also some of the effects they used are pretty good.Good reasons why NOT to see this film.

Thurber, Vaughan, Stiller and all the rest of the outstanding team deserve lots of credit. The overall story is well presented, and the dialog sparkles. There are plenty of raunchy innuendos--and some not so innuendo! I viewed this movie also as a satire on big- money big-time sports in America and the do-or-die attitude of many of its stars who often play with injuries and in great pain in order to satisfy terms of their contracts with wealthy team owners.This all seems to be neatly summed up at the very end of the movie with Pete LeFleur's surprise--not to be revealed here.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

You have the ""if only we could win this tournament, we could...."" Yes, in that respect, this film is not creating anything too new. However, where this film succeeds, where so many others like it fail, is due to the great Ben Stiller. Stiller plays an outrageous, narcissistic, borderline homosexual, bad guy. When Stiller is on the screen, laughter abounds. Somewhat strangely, he is not on the screen as much as you think he would be. This movie is told around Vince Vaughn's character, who is trying to hold on to his sleepy little gym, which is being threatened for takeover by Stiller's ""Globo-Gym."" Vaughn reluctantly agrees to enter a dodgeball tourney to win the $50,000 Grand Prize. Of course, $50,000 is the exact amount him and his oddballs that call the gym home, need to keep it. Well, it is a summer Hollywood film, so you can guess what happens. There are some really nice cameos here and the film is entertaining. Is it as brilliant as ""Zoolander""?

You can see he was having a blast and so was I watching him.Call me simple but I also had a blast watching the players getting pounded by balls, wrenches or whatever is thrown at them.Finally, being German, I almost fell off my sofa laughing when David Hasselhoff appeared as the coach of the aryan German team.

153,euroman1970,Not as good as advertised,2,18 February 2006,"I feel cheated and ashamed at the same time that this country produces such crap. It was like watching SNL sketch with all the actors thrown in into the pile and told to do one liners. White Goodman is the owner of this high tech and very profitable gym while Peter La Fleur is his nemesis across the street who owns Average Joe's gym, which is, of course, on the brinks of bankruptcy. When White wants to take over Average Joe's gym, Peter and his club members need to come up with $50,000 in 30 days to keep the gym alive. What starts out as a promising film turns into an outrageous display of violence and stupidity. My issue with the movie is with the improper cast of roles. Vince Vaughn (Peter La Fleur) and Ben Stiller (White Goodman) would have made a better movie had they been in opposite roles. WHY? Because Vince is more convincing as a bad guy while Ben has always played positive characters. Vince has this evil look in his eyes even when he tries to be a nice guy. Most of the characters looked cartoonish? Nobody acts like that in real life. And what is with this sport Dogdeball? The only goal is to throw balls at each other? A couple of years ago there was a movie called Rollerball which I recall was way more entertaining that this one. At least, in that film they didn't try to make it funny. I think this is where Dodgeball suffers. Had they decided to make it a true Underdog Story without the stupid jokes and unbelievable characters, I think this film would have been much better. Think about this... can you imagine Rocky as a funny film? And what is with the throwing of wrenches. What the film tells is that it's OK to throw wrenches at each other? How insane. At the end of the film the underdogs win, of course. I didn't expect it to be any different. Anyway, to sum it all up, I don't recommend wasting your money on this movie.

The 'Frat Pack' consist of Ben Stiller, Will Farrell, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaugn, and some of their friends. These actors have their hold on Hollywood and they basically can do most comedy movies they want because they have can make a good amount of money doing these movies. Other Frat Pack movies include 'Anchor Man', 'Starsky and Hutch', and Old School'. I'm not saying these movies are terrible or i don't like the actors. It annoys me seeing the same actors playing the same comedic parts and the studio expects that just their presence should make us laugh.I'm not trying to insult fraternities. I call them the frat pack because they appeal more to those guys.I always enjoy a good comedy, but if the next 10 years is going to be comedy movies like this then i might just watch reruns of 'The Simpsons' or 'Family Guy' for comedy.The game of dodgeball is humorous but it doesn't mean you should make a movie out of it. If anything, you should only use this story within an episode of a t.v. show (ex: South Park) instead of dragging two hours of this nonsense.We are supposed to laugh whenever we see Ben Stiller while he plays one of his 'crazy' characters. He looks funny but his character gets real annoying real fast. I liked Stiller at one point but after 'Zoolander' and this movie, I'm starting to worry about his future (granted he's making more money now compared to when he was funny). We're also supposed to like Vince Vaugn but he plays the same 'takes no gruff' character. The pirate character was the most annoying of the cast. 'HA, HA, a man dressed up as a pirate in a gym. Excuse me while I change my pants'.This story plays out the same comedic formula as most mindless comedies. I guess when you do a movie about dodgeball then you can't really do too much with it. A lot of people apparently have seen this movie and liked it. So if you like pointless comedy that has no intelligence behind it then you will enjoy this movie. If you like a plot and some intelligence in a comedy movie then stay away from this one.I'll probably skip the possible sequel 'Kickball', but from how much money they made from this one, I'm sure they're planning the sequel right now.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

I realised something was amiss when I spent the first half hour not laughing. Though I anticipated the slurry of clichés, here they seemed more poorly executed than ever. Ben Stiller's performance was painful to endure - someone should tell him he's not untouchable. Jokes are rather sparse, but when they do appear, it is more often than not a woefully unfunny double entendre with the word 'ball(s)'. The stereotype of an East European woman is a joke that got old a long time ago, given that it was ever funny. I think the turning point (i.e. that which coerced me to turn the DVD off in place of getting my money's worth) was seeing Lance Armstrong's tastelessly misguided cameo.

I was expecting Zoolander...but crappy. I was pleasantly surprised.This movie is actually more intelligent then it lets onthere were more than a few clever references (Deus ex Machina for oneMaginot line [sp?] for another) and not a small amount of Nazi-bashing sub-text.That being said, this is not an overall intelligent movie. It's about dodge ball. People get hit in the groin. A lot. There's a guy named Steve the Pirate. It has a cameo by William Shatner. Do not, DO NOT look for cinematic genius. However, I still loved it. It was hilarious. The random sports they made upsquirrel water skiing, midget tossing...*snicker* And that they weren't afraid to go to the disturbing place...with pizza...it was really quite funny.Why am I raving? I had ultra-low expectations. It made me laugh solidly from opening to closing credits. Good times.And now, to rave about my reason for attending the movie: Alan Tudyk. Yes, he played a man who thought he was a pirate. He played a character that the writers were clearly high when they thought up, but (SPOILERS AHEAD)****** ...when he was hurt and made fun of...well I actually felt bad.

174,andyrichterismissing,Dodgeballtastic!,8,19 June 2004,"Sure, the very concept of making a movie about dodgeball, and one with a good chunk of it devoted to watching people play dodgeball, sounds like one of the most asinine ideas ever conceived for a movie, but then again movies have also been made about a duck from a parallel universe with a duck-themed version of the earth coming to the regular human-version of the earth and the ensuing culture clash, adaptations of terrible 60's cartoons about prehistoric blue-collar families or an idiotic group of teenagers, their rascally dog, and their fabulous van solving mysteries involving haunted amusement parks, as well as one about a guy and girl who have a tormented relationship and undergo a futuristic form of treatment to have each other erased from their memories, only to eventually get back together, and repeat the process over and over again. Alright, that last one was swell, as is Dodgeball, the little dodgeball movie that could. For a movie about what this movie is about, it couldn't possibly be any better. It's one of those rare comedies that maintains a strong level of laughs all the way through, many of them being of the best kind, the random, unexpected bizarro gags that always drive audiences wild! Why anyone would think the vastly inferior BASEKETBALL is better than this is beyond me. While both are spoofs of traditional sports movies, Dodgeball tells a real story with real characters we root for and in some cases, especially in the case of Steve the Pirate and Patches O'Houlihan, that we haven't seen before.BASEKETBALL, on the other hand, is just bits of pieces of other spoof movies, with no real creative pulse of its own, and a result, despite the sterling work of master actor Bob Costas, is wildly uneven, and after about ten minutes or so, pretty damn boring.Where Dodgeball flies by with its own goofy sense of itself, BASEKETBALL plods, taking us on a lame journey to nowhere particularly interesting. If you like your movies watered down and half-assed, (the game of BASEKETBALL, the basis of the movie, isn't particularly funny, and doesn't even make much sense), then BASEKETBALL is the one for you, or just watch MAJOR LEAGUE or any of its sequels, which are more or less the same movie, and are just about as uneven and not worth your time.

Next door is the pitiful competition: Average Joe's, a run-down, homely gym run by amiable slacker Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) who is always ready with a little advice and encouragement for his misfit gym members and who is quite prepared to let people pay their fees a little late.Unfortunately, Peter's lack of business acumen means that his gym is in foreclosure, and unless he comes up with £50,000 dollars in one month his gym will be bought by White Goodman and bulldozed to make way for a new car park. Determined to save Joe's, Peter and his friends enter a dodgeball tournament where first prize just so happens to be £50,000 dollars, and find themselves an efficient (but completely nutty) coach in the shape of former dodgeball champion Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn). But White discovers their intentions and the fun really starts when he puts together his own team of champion dodge-ballers to thwart Joe's ...I remember this movie being something of a sleeper hit, and can see why: there's something for everyone in terms of humour, from straightforward slapstick (usually with a wrench) to classic verbal sparring. Vaughn is the calm centre to the film, wisely playing it straight amongst his oddball team (Steve the Pirate is my particular favourite) Rip Torn is suitably OTT, but scenery-mastication honours must go to Stiller, easily delivering his funniest performance since Mystery Men. The plot is straightforward and you can see the end a mile off, but a number of fun cameos and a continual stream of jokes keep the laughs coming. Just plain fun.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

183,johnnybravo19852000,Grab your ball(s) and go see it! *** out of ****,7,25 July 2004,"I remember laughing good and hard at the previews for Dodgeball but was still skeptical about seeing it. I mean how many times have the studios shown all the funny parts but only for one to discover after watching the movie those were the parts that were only funny. Ok, you can all put your hands down now.Happily, there is a lot of funny stuff in Dodgeball to make you want to see it a second time. Nice guy Peter La Fleur (played by Vince Vaughn who has been on a roll the last 1 1/2)is the owner of a small gym that is on the verge of foreclosure unless he can come up with $50,000. Even if the mortgage payments were current, the club is so outdated that it looks more like a place where homeless people crash for the evening.
In a desperate attempt to save the gym Peter hires an accountant Kate Veatch (played by pretty lady Christine Taylor) to go over the books. The problem is that Peter hasn't looked at the books since Clinton was President so her help is to of no avail.Things have gotten even worse because a rich spoiled brat has built a beautiful gym right next door. The brat is played to absolute hilarity by Ben Stiller who has his own unique way of impressing the ladies.(Hint: puff puff the magic dragon).By sheer coincidence there is dodgeball tournament at Las Vegas that will pay-yep you got it, $50,000 to the 1st place team. Since Peter and his friends have virtually no talent, they bring in coach Patches O'Houlihan for training. His training includes tools of steel(literally)to ones face that will adjust them to the agony of being hit by a ball. (That part was included during the sneak preview but I laughed even harder the second time around).Two other characters also add to the fun. Gary Cole (Office Space) and Justin Bateman from Starsky And Hutch play the sport announcers and Bateman isn't exactly rowing the boat with both oars especially after he hopes that the outcome of the game won't be affected when Vaughn's team has to forfeit.
For the directing and writing of Dodgeball I was expecting to see the name Zucker or Wayan. Instead the credit was given to some guy by the name of Rawson Marshall Thurber. If I see that name for the upcoming Scary Movie 4, I'll take a chance and see that one too.P.S.

To be honest, I resisted watching DODGEBALL because I didn't care much for recent comedies. I also avoided anything with Ben Stiller after several of his unfunny stinkbombs. He really needs to be more picky with his scripts because he is a genuinely funny guy (check out ""The Ben Stiller Show"" to see that). But Stiller is very funny in DODGEBALL, along with everyone else. I wish there had been more Stephen Root and Rip Torn.

Underdog team needs to beat the big guys so they can save the bar/house/club etc. Dodgeball is referred to as A True Underdog Story. And so it is. It is a clichéd, over-the-top, exaggerated version of the same sporting movies that have been made every year for the past half-century. Peter Le Fleur (Vince Vaughn) and his regulars at his gym, Average Joe's take on the professional, elite team of rival White Goodman and his own gym in the standard sporting movie plot. However, the game they choose to play is dodgeball, perennial favourite of American PE teachers and my PE teacher in High School. The object of the game at the school level is for big, sporty kids to pelt unpopular geeks like myself with balls over and over again. The professional dodgeball circuit portrayed in the film is sleek, sophisticated and apparently quite popular. Of course, it's all a big joke. Peter's team are the usual bunch of misfits. There's the geeky former cheerleader Justin, sad, mild Gordon and The Dread Pirate Steve. He is joined by Kate Veatch, the banker hired by Goodman to acquire Peter's gym. They are all coached by former Dodgeball champion Patches O'Houlihan, now a wheelchair bound, sex-obsessed loony who trains them by throwing spanners at them. The movie is very silly, but it's still amusing. There are a number of good sight gags of the slapstick variety, and there are some good one-liners, particularly from Stiller and Vaughn. Stiller plays the bad guy in this film, but it's a similar character to that from Zoolander; dumb, shallow and self-centred. Stiller plays the egomaniac so well I can't help but wonder if there's an element of reality in his portrayal. The movie is filled with odd characters who do and say odd things, which is OK because I respond well to that kind of humour. Dodgeball is not a great film. It's possibly not even a good film. But it is an amusing film. That's really all one can ask from a comedy. Anti-sport movies are becoming more common these days; the Australian film Crackerjack springs to mind, which is basically the same old story but concerning lawn bowls. Dodgeball works as a satire, or a spoof, of these movies but mostly it works as a way of raising a smile, even if the jokes are dumb and the plot non-existent.

192,mr_movie_2004,Really funny low brow comedy,8,22 June 2004,"It's predictable, it's crass, it's hilarious.  First time director Rawson Marshall Thurber, the creator of one of greatest ad campaigns of all time with Terry Tate, Office Linebacker for Reebok, scores big at the box office and on the laugh charts in his feature debut.  The story is extremely simple, the gags are alternately crude and clever, and Ben Stiller turns in perhaps his greatest performance of all time.  There isn't a lot to say except that it is very funny from start to finish.  If you like comedies in the mold of the Farrelly Brothers, you will certainly like this.  If not, best to stay clear of it.  But if you like this sort of thing, it's the best comedy of its type in quite some time.  Let's hope that Thurber can build on this and create a real name for himself.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
193,howismyfish,"Eh, it had its moments",5,20 August 2004,"Not an overly funny movie but it has its moments, and almost all of them involved Ben Stiller.Unfortunately, most of the movie will have you shaking your head as you think of what could have been if they had only put a joke that was remotely entertaining in there.  Basically this movie has an onslaught of jokes, all of different caliber so everyone who sees it will laugh at something even if they find the rest of the movie simply idiotic.This movie is all over the place with its jokes and acting, but remains fairly watchable.

194,stuff2delete,Quality is inversely proportional to viewer IQ,2,30 August 2004,"I was actually amazed by this film. Going into the theater, my expectations were on an all time low, yet somehow the intellectual challenge that is ""Dodgeball the Movie"" still manages to disappoint.With movies of this genre, you expect bad acting, a barrage of cliches and stereotypes, and a lot of cheap slapstick humor. And that's OK. But nothing can adequately prepare you for the headache inducing performance  of Ben Stiller. Even to his own rock bottom standards, his acting (if we're going to use that word) is truly dismal. In fact, all the bad things about this type of film, the cliches, the predictability, it all seems to be just a bit worse in this 13-a-dozen Hollywood celluloid disposal.But of course the real test is this: Is it fun, does this movie entertain you? Sadly, the answer is no. The total amount of beer you would have to drink in order to make this movie enjoyable would kill all but the most experienced alcoholics. The characters just aren't funny, and most of the jokes are too simple, too predictable and too badly timed to work. Sure there's a couple of good laughs here and there, but don't hold your breath.If you are contemplating seeing this film, then here's my advise to you: don't. Use the money to buy ""There's something about Mary"", ""American Pie"" or ""Hey dude, where's my car"" on DVD and invite a couple of friends over. The movie will be better and the beer will be cheaper.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

He has a funny face, and it is an expected thing, all producers are trying to make some money on it. Actually Vince did a wonderful Job in here too, I personally laughed him a lot..Anyway, movie is good, but it is not that funny, compared to; There is something about Mary, Zoolander, Meet the parents, Came Along Polly, Stusky and Hutch.. First movie characters are so artificial, that you can't feel the humor. Fun stuff has been exaggerated a Little. And that takes the ""real"" fun-humor away. Zoolander has a similar situation but it has a much more clever story.I can barely say that, this movie has been built on two best jokes (which everyone laughed their a**es off) at the movies Meet the Fockers (the scene Ben hits the ball on his fiancée's sister in pool) and Starsky&Hutch (the Funny ""Do It"" character when Ben was undercover) So I think they came up with a character idea which should look alike at Stursky&Hutch (different voice, big ego etc.) and also thought that ""God, everyone laughs when we nail someone with a ball, so lets play dodge ball"".....Thus, movie is ready to served.Not bad, don't expect much, have fun...",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
196,dem1126,Spoilers for a FANTASTIC film,10,23 September 2004,"I realize that there is a lot of what some people would consider ""low brow"" humour in this film. But when you consider the entire premise of the film is a game where you people get hit in the nuts by rubber balls, it's not surprising there is an element of ""mindless humour"".But there is a lot of subtle comedy, a lot of amusing one liners and a joke in latin near the end. And I think it was the latin joke that made me really love the film. The plot is fairly obvious, and you can see it coming a mile off. But the thick and fast stream of comedy coming out of most of the characters is the reason for seeing the film (and learning more about dodgeball of course. I didn't know there were actual rules to the game!), not an intelligent plot that will keep you guessing.If you don't like bad language, slapstick violence, crude humour then this really won't be your type of film. But if you like a film with a really good sense of comedy of all types (subtle, in your face, slapstick, gentle) and a nice ""happy feeling"" then you will really like it and I advise it to anyone.And I really mean it about the latin joke!",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
197,seangd,Decent - definitely a matinee though,6,21 June 2004,"Okay, I laughed several times during this movie.  But lately there have been more comedies in the style of the Farrelly brothers, and I really think even those guys don't have it anymore.  Stuck on You was a huge disappointment. I mean, if you like this kind of ""unbelievable"" comedy, go check out Something About Mary, Kingpin, or even Dumb and Dumber if you're really desperate.  There have been one or two one-off successes like Tommy Boy, or Happy Gilmore.  I still have not laughed as hard at ANY movie as I did during those.  Vince Vaughn plays virtually the same character here in Dodgeball as he does in every movie (which is fine I guess), but Stiller plays a cross between his Zoolander character and Arnold Schwarzneggar.  He steals every scene he's in.  Overall, an enjoyable matinee.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
198,nimbleweevil,Dodgeball: A Truly Nauseating Story,1,23 January 2005,"Most films, even the most worthless ones, have something about them which is meritorious. O Brother, Where Art Thou? had a decent soundtrack. Walking Tall had a good moral. Elf had some cute moments. No viewer should see any of these movies immediately before or after eating. Dodgeball, however, is one of those thankful rarities which should not be seen if the viewer is ever planning to eat again.The plot deals with an apathetic local fitness center owner (Vince Vaughn) who is trying to save his cute little neighborhood gym from a major corporate takeover masterminded by an evil fitness guru (Ben Stiller) with an inflated ego and some other inflated things as well, if you get my drift. In order to raise the money he needs to pay off his debts and save his gym, Vaughn's character Peter LaFleur puts together a ragtag dodgeball team and enters it in a Las Vegas competition. Only problem is, Stiller & Co. have also entered a team. The Average Joe team includes a group of characters that I believe I was supposed to like: a sweet-faced lawyer who turns out to be an Amazon (Christine Taylor), a disillusioned male cheerleader (Justin Long), a man who thinks he is a pirate (Alan Tudyk), a pansy with bottled-up anger (Stephen Root), the Napoleon Dynamite style team manager (Joel David Moore), and another guy (Chris Williams) whom I don't remember anything about, even though I just saw the movie.Of course, no movie is devoid of the occasional shining moment. Rip Torn's former-dodgeball-champion-turned-coach was a likable fellow. I smiled a few times, and even had one or two weak chuckles. The presence of Lance Armstrong and Chuck Norris made me raise my eyebrows, but I had no issue with it. Any of this, however, was canceled out by the horror that was in store in the last ten minutes of the movie.A good ending can save an otherwise mediocre movie (a la Unbreakable or Queen of the Damned). A bad ending sticks in the viewer's memory like a butcher knife. ***SPOILER ALERT*** This was a bad ending. It began when Christine Taylor's character is revealed, for no reason whatsoever, to be a bisexual. It ended with our ten-second view of Ben Stiller's now-washed-up White Goodman, who now weighs about 925 pounds and has lost everything. I nearly threw up everything I had eaten that day when this image came on the screen. It reeked of pure antihumor - it was something one has to see to believe, and I hope for your sake that you never see it.In past movies I have been very impressed with performances by Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughan - they are talented actors. I suppose there was only so much they could do with this miserable screenplay, and frankly I'm shocked they accepted the roles. As for Armstrong and Norris, I usually expect better from them. I can only wonder what they saw in it that possessed them to agree to appear in this disgusting excuse for entertainment. Grade: F.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

201,Kempywood,Hate yourself enough for this spoiler,8,11 July 2004,"Where do you start with a Vince Vaughn/Ben Stiller movie? Well the only question to ask about this one is where was the clever use of Will Ferrel or Owen Wilson? Why would that be the only question you may ask, well because really there was no other fault that could be found. Dodgeball is a hilarious movie full of laughs, sports and the ever needed bondage equipment. So how do you add to two great comedy actors like Ben Still and Vince Vaughn? Well with a good cast to go alongside them, including Christine 'Zoolander' Taylor, Rip 'Men in Black' Torn, Justin 'Jeepers Creepers' Long, Stephen 'Blade Runner' Root, Joel 'I've not a famous movie but was once in Sabrina the Teenage Witch' Moore plus many others, Seriously though where else but in a Vaughn/Stiller movie could you find a dodge ball team consisting of a gym owner, high school wimp, fat guy who's bad at sport and a pirate? Add that good looking lady who just so happens to be married to Mr. Stiller and you've got it made.Anyways on with the movie Peter La Fleur (Vaughn) is a man with no worries, his bills maybe adding up and his electricity may be getting cut off but he's still got his gym. Average Joe's is the place to be for anyone who's not looking their best or is a little shall we say aloof, Unfortunately the bills are also adding up at the gym too and Mr. La Fleur is soon going to be losing everything he had, but to make things even worse in comes White Goodman to buy out the lot to add a multi-story parking lot for his gym next door, just part of the global wide Globo Gym where they're better than you and they know it. So how does a run of the mill gymnasium come up with the $50,000 that they need to save themselves from being leveled? Why dodge ball of course and so starts the hilarity, after all where else would you see four grown men and a woman losing to a group of girl scouts and still making it to Las Vegas for the dodge ball championships? Not in a Spielberg or Lucas movie that's for certain. That really is why these Stiller type movies do so well at the box office and more of it I say. So I have to say go ahead and watch this movie it really is a side splitting experience, go.go now because it's only your fault if you don't hate yourself enough to go watch Dodgeball.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

203,supergiantbugkiller,its just not funny,1,29 July 2004,"I saw this after seeing Anchorman. Anchorman was unique, bizarre, funny and satirical.Dodgeball tries to sell itself as somewhat of a parody of those typical underdog stories, and is full of talented people like Stiller, Stephen Root, Gary Cole and Vince Vaughn, among others.Its just not funny. There are so many potential situations that I dont knwo why it didnt score.  I even thinK i could have wrote it better.Rent BASEketball instead.  Its much more bizarre, makes more jokes from its token announce team, makes something more out of everything involving sports. the locker rooms, the uniforms, the mascots.  In Dodgeball other than a cheap S&M joke and how funny Ben Stiller looks in his Cobras uniform, these sort of things arent touched upon. As well, the Dodgeball games are so short, its difficult to tell any funny stories with its characters or create any sense of drama whatsoever that might help deliver a joke or make anything out of the b-characters on opposing teams.  BASEketball does all of this, and has some side stories that work as well.The only character in Dodgeball that got any laughs for me was the Pirate character, and even he was taken out to early.  Dodgeball is neither straight enough nor ridiculous enough. It is painfully mediocre and with the talent involved should have been much much better. Much better.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
204,ScotlandZeif,Socialism and Sagging Story,1,26 February 2005,"There were some very funny moments in this movie - but it was ultimately a one-trick pony. The fact that everyone is taking dodgeball so seriously is THE joke of the movie, and it wears thin. I also don't like the blatantly socialist message of this movie. The good guys are the ones who have a crappy gym, and who don't even charge their members to use the gym. The bad guys are the ones from Ben Stiller's gym. Stiller's character says that he built his gym from the ground up - starting from nothing. He built a successful gym with nice facilities. So what is so bad about that, and why does that make him the bad guy?

205,CapsNut,Regret Waiting So Long to Watch This Movie,8,30 July 2020,"Let me start out by saying I am not a fan of Ben Stiller. For whatever reason, I've never found him funny or even entertaining.That being said, I still very much enjoyed this movie and laughed quite a bit. Just not at any of Ben Stiller's antics which I thought were way to over-the-top to the point of detracting from the movie. I happen to think that his White Goodman character would be have been much better if he had just played it straight up like pretty much everybody else in the movie instead of trying to chew the scenery.Vince Vaughan and Christine Taylor do a really good job carrying the movie and the supporting cast wisely avoids the overacting that Stiller commits in spite of their characters easily allowing them to do it.Really, if Stiller had done this role like he did Mr. Furious in Mystery Men, I'd probably give this 10 stars, but because Stiller decided to do one of his ""funny characters"" it detracted from an otherwise great movie.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

Thought I'd check out the rating and was surprised how low (6.6) it was. Then checked out some of the ""Hated It"" comments to see why this could be I guess that a lot of people find this film offensive, with stereotypical attitudes - like how a bisexual woman could kiss both a man and a woman (an extraordinary observation). Or that it was unfair to poke fun at someone who spent all his waking hours dressed up as pirate. I think that comment came from a member of the Long John Silver Alliance.Lighten up! Comedy - like any other artistic endeavour is subjective - all I can say is that I laughed and found that at many points the jokes were coming faster than I could process them - always a good sign.A good combination of slapstick humour and smart-ass comments delivered at a rapid pace And an ever-popular theme: will the underdogs triumph?

It's a spoof.  It's making fun of every other sports movie ever made.  Why do you think they deliberately call it An Underdog Story, and why else would it be about dodgeball?  They took every piece of the formula (the financial dilemma, the goofy teammates, the greedy villain) and mercilessly shredded them.  And it's hilarious because it works.  Getting hit in the head with a wrench and numerous shots to the crotch can only take you so far.

But I enjoyed it a lot more! There were parts during the film when I was stuck on the back of the chair laughing! This movie is really EPIC! Well, in its own way of course. It's one of those sports movies where the good guys always win at the last crucial moment of the final match... well, kind of. This film works at times a lot like a great parody of these movies!

The world is modern and times have changed but i think that some behaviours could be showed in other sense. There are sexual moralities that can be acceptable but they are not normals. Oh, another thing, it's disappointing to see some old stars with just too little scenes, it's almost a shame.

""Escape to Victory""? or even ""The Karate Kid""?As much as I love these and countless other sport-related films, there is always a nagging problem - they take themselves far too seriously. From the initial defeat to the final, against-the-odds triumph, the reverence for competitive sports is carried like a religious icon.The antidote to all this, is this hilarious debut from writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber. Grounded in a smart and self-aware script, Dodgeball's gags come fast and frequent, as Vince Vaughn's band of losers are transformed into a team of ball-dodging allstars. Vaughn, as Peter LaFleur, at times shows touches of the 1980's Bill Murray-style wise-cracking everyman.Gary Cole and Jason Bateman too, put in a brilliantly accurate portrayal of the banality of sports commentary.A queue of cameos have varying levels of success. (Hasselhoff - good, Lance Armstrong - bad.)But it is Ben Stiller who steals the show. His narcissistic fitness fascist White Goodman with bouffant blonde hair and Village People 'tache has all the best lines.

But I thought that this movie was pretty good. I wouldn't say that it is anything special, but it is a good movie when you feel like turning off your brain for a while, and having a good laugh. So I say this to all considering Dodgeball, watch it, it is probably worth what you will spend on it. It is not an Oscar winning movie, but I think that is certainly worth the time spent watching it.

Rip Torn is great as usual. The ""commentary"" during the dodgeball tourney is fall on the floor hilarious! Excellent physical comedy, if violent, but hey, if you don't like it you don't get the joke. This is a film for people who actually understand how comedy is made.

The jokes aren't always consistent, but they are funny.

This movie didn't change my life, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I didn't laugh helplessly, but I did laugh out loud a number of times.The actors were good enough: Rip Torn is always fun, Ben Stiller reminded me of all the EST-addled people I knew back in the '70s and '80s.

221,StevenPlaymountain,Grab life by the dodgeball!,10,21 June 2005,"Dodgeball is one of the most stupid, retarded movies I ever saw, and I absolutely loved it. The jokes in this movie are so bad, they're actually good. The story is standard good versus evil. The good guys are the underdogs from Average Joe's Gym, the bad guys are the muscular show offs from Globo Gym. And of course there's the love interest in the middle of the two protagonists: Christine Taylor (aka ms. Stiller). From there on it's all about slap stick and absurd dialogues. Try picturing a bunch of losers getting hit by wrenches thrown by a lunatic in a weelchair. Picture Ben Stiller as a wacky mustached work out guy getting aroused by putting a slice of pizza in his pants. This is what Dodgeball has to offer. One of the sparkling high lights of this movie is Stillers overacting in contrast with Vince Vaughns easy going 'play'. You're in for some stupid dialogues, man o man. If you want sophisticated humour in the likes of Woody Allen, than you rang the wrong door bell mister. But if you're actually smart enough to see through this thick layer of stupidness, and you can picture with how much irony this pic was made by Stiller and company, then you'll be a Dodgballer for life!

I've never laughed as much in the theater as I did at this movie. There were only a few moments I wasn't laughing! It may offend some of the more ""uptight"" viewers out there, but if you don't mind a few cheap shots, you will laugh. There are several low intelligence laugh's and a few that you will have to listen to get, but all are just plain funny! I recommended if you want to laugh you want to go see this. This is one of the few movies where the funniest parts are not in the commercials. Even the team names are funny. I may even see this movie again just to catch all the little jokes that you have to look closely to see. I say go!",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
225,python-c,"Probably only fun if you're in middle school, high school",6,18 August 2008,"The 6 out of ten is well deserved.This movie is, in a word, juvenile. That doesn't make it bad, but that's what it is. What with countless dirty jokes and gross-out humour, this is a movie aimed towards pubescent teenage boys (make-out scenes, anyone?). If you like movies like Epic Movie or Scary Movie, chances are you'll love this.But that doesn't mean ""Dodgeball"" doesn't have it's moments. Ben Stiller as a psychopathic gym owner obsessed with his own beauty is absolutely hilarious. His character's pathetic nature is amusing, unlike many of his co-star's, which is just sad. Vince Vaughn doesn't necessarily flop as the protagonist, but I thought he wasn't the best choice--while somewhat likable, he was still devoid of acting talent.The other supporting stars are unremarkable. They're just there. They do what they're supposed to, and that's something, I guess. But they're definitely not going above-and-beyond here--it's almost like they know that ""Dodgeball"" isn't going to be a career-changer for them.In summary, watch this as long as you can get it cheap. It's a relatively enjoyable way to pass 90 minutes, and if you're a Ben Stiller fan, you won't be disappointed.

226,whiskeyann,Funny!,7,1 July 2004,I found Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story funny and entertaining. The best part is the referrals to The Karate Kid. Ben Stiller's character was a little over the top. The humor was very raunchy at times. The story had it's slow moments. I don't recommend taking anyone under the age of 10 to this movie. Not a total was of your time. It's better than some of the movies I have seen this summer. So if you just want to be entertained go see Dodgeball. I give this movie a 7 out of a 10.,Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
227,tomwww,Smarter than it needs to be ...,8,23 June 2004,"I was pleasantly surprised by Dodgeball. It's not a gut-busting laugh riot, but you'll spend a lot of time chuckling and smiling, and you'll root for these underdogs to win the big game. Great cast, too, particularly Vince and Christine Taylor in the leads. And any movie that quotes ""Bring It On"" is doing something right in my book.And while it's fairly low-brow, there's a surprising amount of intelligence in the screenplay. Plenty of jokes that don't bring down the house are worth chewing over later. By the time the movie reaches its big climax on ESPN 8 (""The Ocho""), you should be nicely won over.Overall, a solid sports comedy. Check it out!",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
228,t1n02112,"Pure, over the the top Stiller humor. Think of it as Jock-lander.",7,18 September 2006,"If you like Stiller, you'll love this. I've seen this several times on cable, and I'll watch it again if it is on. (I watch TV in the background while I work at my computer) To me it falls into the category of movies that you can watch piecemeal, pick it up anywhere and just enjoy it scene by scene. It's funny stuff. I don't understand how people try to compare this type of movie to a major drama, or mega action movie. This movie is neither, and those who judge this by those standards are probably the same people that drive a huge SUV by themselves everyday to work, or try to move a mattress by strapping it to the roof of a little compact car. This movie is a cheesy frat humor flic, and hits that target perfectly. By the way, it only cost 30 mil to make, but pulled in four times as much at the box office. That is a good return on investment. Yes, it may seem like an SNL skit, but a really good one, with very good execution, and perfect editing. It's got a good pace to it, and there's little sub-references here and there to keep it interesting. For example, there's a banner that says ""Go Balls Deep"" over the playing court. Another one is ""Deus ex Machina"", which is a reference to ancient dramas where something sweeps in and saves the day. In this movie it's a treasure chest full of cash. And of course, William Shatner as a game judge, doing a little 'Kirk' voice style in the locker room. And a cameo by Lance Armstrong giving Vince Vaughn the required ""You can do it"" speech, except instead, he give him a sarcastic 'I sure you won't regret this for the rest of your life"" line. =================Minor Spoiler Below======================The characters are well cast, and the do the best with what they've got. It goes without saying, that there is a showdown, and the underdog saves the day, get the girls, and the bad guy is sent packing. (That's never happened before...I can't believe I just labeled that as a spoiler)I liked this movie, I laughed many times, I still laugh when I see it, or remember certain scenes.This is the a 'Zoolander' for Jocks.

229,hellomynameishenry,A film that has no idea of what it is,3,4 June 2005,"This film turns into exactly what it is trying to satirise, a second rate sports movie. it has very little pacing, sharpness or wit primarily because it is trying to please everybody. Vince Vaughan is given an absolute shocker of a script to get through and Stiller's talentless wife succeeds, as she did in zoolander, to murder the film.the best moments come with the absurd slapstick humour, spanners being thrown, people being run over etc., but these seem to come out of no where. Stiller's character has the best moments, presumably because they came from him and not the dreadful writer director who squeezes the life out of most moments for potential humour.I felt that this movie would have been much better if it decided to be a gross-out - a la the farrellys - or an clever satire on American life - a la Christopher guest, it hints at both and ends up being a watery mess.it's a shame because as an idea it clearly has legs and includes hilarious cameos from lance armstrong and David hasslehof who were good sports for doing it.a no brainer for a hangover day...",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

The film seemed very, very short, probably because nothing really happened apart from the obvious, doorbell practise, then doorbell tournament, bit of rivalry, etc... absolutely nothing new or even close to any originality.

You'd never expect this or that coming, which makes you giggle at the stupidity of it.Anyways, I don't think I will own it on DVD, but it's still a very fun movie to watch.

This film is daft But it is very funny. White Goodman. What a legend. Ben Stiller created the perfect 'villian' in this. Villain i suppose is a strong word, as you end up falling for his stupid comments, and actually feel a little bit sorry for him at the end. Vince Vaughn is good as Peter La Fleur. However, towards the end, i actually prefer White Goodman. If 'Le Loser' didn't have a bunch of great and very lovable characters on his side, then id have been rooting on Stiller. Justin Long is great. The flashback to his cheer leading audition is one of the funniest things i have seen for a long time. However, the best part is the dodge balling itself. Half of this film is the tournament itself. And boy is it great. Patches O'Houlihan has the best lines in this section, and until his demise, was becoming as good as Goodman. A favourite quote being 'Your about as useful as a cock flavoured lollipop'. Great stuff. People talk about this film as being predictive and obvious. But who cares. Its not called 'a true underdogs story' for nothing, and no matter how many times i see a Dodgeball hitting someone, i still let out a little giggle.

This film uses homophobic slurs to get laughs again and again and again. It's embarrassing and insulting. And for those who say ""Get over it. Finally a film that is not politically correct"" I just ask how would you feel if instead of the homophobic slurs they would have used racial slurs for comic relief? Furthermore the female body is shown as ""desirable"" and ""sexy"" while the male body is - again - just used to get laughs and is ridiculed. A combination of the homophobia and anti-male attitude can be found in one scene where first we get to see girls in bikinis washing cars - obviously so the audience can drool over their bodies - and then we see a male redneck drooling over the body of a man who's washing his car in bathing gear - and it's supposed to be ""gross"" and ""wrong"" and ""funny"". The same double standard is used once more when first we get to see semi nude female cheerleaders - so very ""droolworthy"" - and then we get to see Vaughn's team having to play in rubber fetish gear - so very ""gross"" and ""funny"".

Granted, Ben Stiller acts the same way in this flick that he does in Zoolander, but Vince Vaughn was phenomenal, as was Christine Taylor, and Rip Torn, and just everything fit together perfectly. Hank Azaria FINALLY has a role in an actual HIT movie, which is even better.

240,hejbreovojemojmail,Dear god,1,12 December 2007,"This movie represents everything that is wrong with the modern day American cinema. After viewing it, i just felt compelled to create an IMDb account and write out of me this awful feeling this movie has left me with. Where do i start? Oh, how about the movie not being funny at all to someone that isn't an 'average Joe'? It really goes to the lowest of the low, like Vaughn's team motto 'Aim low'. Guys, they even made Rip Torn say things like 'Crotch stain' and made a dirty old bastard out of him.... Oh, there's also Chuck Norris, god knows why.. and Captain Kirk. God, i feel dumb after watching this insult to my idea of Ben Stiller. I can see this piece of excrement be entertaining only to those who do not care, or the brain dead. Even Stiller makes a remark about this, in the last minute of this 'movie'. To sum it up, Bad guy pathetically comical + his towering team of ethnically diverse henchmen on steroids, Good guy charming underachiever (so the target audience doesn't get offended, and can identify) + a group of oddballs that don't deserve life (but the movie makes their existence meaningful) + a token black dude (blaxploitating away) + a pirate (??) whose entire self-image is based on what Vaughn's character has to say during a self doubt now - hero redeem later scene. We also have that guy from the 'Excalibur' SF series, playing the role of the commentator, i liked Excalibur, so i can forgive. Oh, there's a girl, naturally, a tough one, naturally, that slams Stiller's character into a wall, in order to prove that women are tough. Women are really tough right? Yeah, i thought so. Oh, she's also not a lesbian, she's Bi. Is there a category on this site for the worst scene ever? The scene where the heroine kisses another woman and her comment 'I'm not lesbian. {pause} I'm bi-sexual' to quell the attention of Vaughn's character and that of the black token is sickeningly unimaginative.

If you see only one film this summer that involves Ben Stiller hitting someone in the balls with a Dodgeball, make it this one.Spoiler: the great part about the intellectual jokes in this film, is that i know I didn't get all of them, when I see this movie again, I know I'll laugh just as hard at all the new jokes I find; for example: the first time I watched it I was laughing too hard at the German team being called Team Blitzkrieg, that I didn't even hear the announcer say, ""here come to Germans, appeasement be damned!"".

And I don't mean the movie was horrible, I just mean it is the kind of comedy that has people saying stupid things that make you laugh. It is very much like Zoolander (comparing it to another Ben Stiller stupid comedy) with its humor, just with dodgeball and not models. For the most part, the dodge-ball plays out as believable except for *SPOILER WARNING* the final throw in the end, in which the Vince's character hits Ben's character while blindfolded after doing a matrix-esqe dodge. *END SPOILER*. The plot is likable but has places to be improved on.

246,mdfuk,"Ben Stiller steals the show, cuts loose and shows what a great comedy actor he is",8,8 June 2005,"Ben Stiller has made a successful film career from being a great comedy character actor. With films like ""Zoolander"" and ""Starsky and Hutch"" Stiller has formed memorably hilarious characters people will still be quoting in years to come. His character in Dodgeball is no different but not only does Stiller steal the limelight of this picture but in my opinion pulls off one of, if not the best comic performance of his career Stiller plays ""White Goodman"" an egotistical fitness maniac bent on domination of the complete health market. He is determined to destroy another local gym Average Joes by what ever means he can, and when he hears the Average Joe staff are entering a dodge-ball tournament to pay off their increasing debts Goodman cannot refuse heating up the competition by signing his own team up in direct competition. Goodman is portrayed as the pinnacle of self improvement in both gaining the ""perfect body"" from being a seriously obese man and acquiring a fortune from his self build corporation Globo-gym. Stiller makes this character so over the top in his appearance from sporting a supremely blow-dried mullet and Fu Manchu moustache to wearing garish leather outfits not seen since the late 70's. What makes Goodman such a superb parody of all fitness gurus everywhere is Stiller's never failing ability to bring embarrassing laughs and cringes from the audience and make a complete fool of himself at the same time. In one memorable scene in this film he tries to ""woo"" bank officer Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) by pumping up his crutch with an air pump and delivering supposedly witty lines (including some very bad punning on the word shackles) that was so cringe worthy and embarrassing it almost made me turn from watching it. I'm glad I didn't because every line Stiller delivers is perfectly timed and executed for its full comic value. Dodgeball without Stiller would have scored a very low mark on my rating as to be brutally honest as much as I love this film the story line is extremely corny. The Average Joes gym has serious debts and needs to pay them off before they lose the land the gym is built on. It so happens there is a Dodgeball tournament that will pay the winner the exact amount of money they needed to raise to save the gym. Of course with the addition of the Globo-gym team it was obvious from the start who was going to win the tournament and who the final would be contested between this predictability made the film seriously slow down in pace in the final third which is a little disappointing. The only thing else to really stand out from this film was the character of Patches O'Houlihan played by Rip Torn a wheelchair bound ex-dodge-ball all star who coaches the Average Joe's team with such methods and advice as ""if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball"" and ""your playing like a bunch of retards trying to hump a door knob"".

Yes it followed the traditional ""sports underdog"" formula but it made fun of the formula as it was going along, so you knew they were in on the joke too.This is probably not a date-movie, and I would probably suggest sneaking in a beer (if you can), but I was laughing from beginning to end, and it was good light-hearted summer entertainment without computer-generated super-heroes or villains.

251,Verix-1,A superbly simple comedy which delivers laugh after laugh,9,8 November 2006,"As far as slapstick comedies go there are few which manage as many laughs as Dodgeball. The film sees Vaughn play a lovable gym owner who is both friendly and lax with his bill payments. The latter of these characteristics gets him in trouble with the bank and fellow gym owner Stiller threatens to buy out his gym if he doesn't find $50,000 by the end of the month. OK so the story up to now is a bit weak, well it doesn't really improve, but as Vaughn and his band of 'Average Joe's' decide to enter a dodge-ball competition to get the money the laughs come thick and fast. The group is later joined by Rip Tom, an eccentric ex-player who believes that ""if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball"" and star thrower Christine Taylor. Many of the laughs maybe juvenile and slapstick but there something about a guy getting hit in the crotch with a wrench that never stops being funny.What's more every member of the cast seems to fit into there roles perfectly from Steve the Pirate (Alan Tudyk) to the 'out of it' commentator Pepper Brooks (Jason Bateman). In fairness the film won't appeal to everyone, it's got a simple story line with uncomplicated gags and it's fronted by Vaughen and Stiller who's names in a film nowadays promise one of 'those' sort of comedies.But for me the film is laugh out loud funny with superb characters.I'd recommend anyone who enjoyed Acchorman or The 40 Year Old Virgin to take a look.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
252,andy719,"Mostly mindless, but thoroughly entertaining",9,12 July 2004,"Not something I'd show young children, but the funniest movie I've seen in a long, long time. As mindless comedies go, this is destined to be a classic.I have to admit, I wasn't expecting much, thinking that after There's Something About Mary and Zoolander, among others, that this movie would be the inevitable mediocre one that I probably wouldn't watch again, but I was dead wrong. I think, overall, this is the funniest one yet. Ben Stiller is arguably better as an antagonist than he is as the protagonist, and Vince Vaughn fits his part perfectly with his nonchalant and dry manner and deadpan delivery. Furthermore, there are an awful lot of unexpected little things that elevate it from funny to hilarious. Jason Bateman's character, for example, provided some of the best (and most unexpected) laughs. I wasn't expecting much in the way of plot, either, but I found it mildly entertaining, after all. Of course, it never gets in the way of the laughs, which keep on coming.Obviously, this movie isn't for everyone - and some people might be quite offended or put off by it. For the rest of us, it's another great mindless comedy.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
253,DrPoi,Peter Sellers rolls in his grave,1,18 August 2005,"Peter Sellers was (and still is) probably the number 1 in comedy. If he was alive today he would probably die watching what comedy has become in Hollywood. I respected Ben Stiller when I first saw him. I loved his role in ""There's something about Mary"", even in ""The Royal Tenembaums"", buy what he's been doing lately seems outrageous for cinema to me. After ""Envy"" and this unfortunate ""Dodgeball"" I've lost my faith in Stiller as an actor. He's not funny, as the movie itself, a more than overcooked history about the fight between two guys, old enemies, owners of two gyms, the one in front of the other. Ben Stiller plays the bad guy, trying to take control of his opponents property. They finally decide everything in a Dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas. I hadn't ever seen somebody playing Dodgeball since I was 10. Apparently, after this movie - according to Hollywood's power of influence - it will become olympic in London 2012 (lol). I'm fed up, Ben, maybe you need to change, like Jim Carrey did, to show the actor you have (maybe) inside.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

256,lets_play_two,Surprisingly Entertaining,7,3 July 2004,"As I scanned the movie listings the other day perusing the newest titles, my selection seemed limited. Finally, my friend and I concluded that we would see Dodgeball in the tradition of a thought-free, relaxing evening. As we entered the movie theater, my expectations for this movie were nothing short of average. I supposed I would laugh occasionally, while easily following a basic, juvenilisitc comedy-driven plot.Only half of my hypothesis was accurate. While the basic innerworkings of the movie were no more complicated than those of Tommy Boy, I found myself laughing with such rigor at times that I had to tear my eyes from the screen in an effort to slow my laughter and gulp down some oxygen. Even while serious, intentionally unfunny scenes took place, I sat staring eagerly at the screen with that oblivious, airheaded expression you sometimes catch on a dog when you're scratching him behind the ears.I can say without hesitation that the funniest aspect of this movie is Ben Stiller's character, White Goodman. His mannerisms, gestures, and greatest of all, comebacks, are a marvel in themselves. His lines, while funny simply by nature, are expanded into humor bombshells as one line after the next hits you right in the funny bone.I recommend this movie not only to anyone under the age of 18, for obvious reasons, but to adults alike for its over-the-top style and in-your-face attitude. With more cameos than you can count, I guarantee a night filled with laughter and enjoyment. Be sure to stick around for the credits. Trust me.*** out of ****",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

The first time I heard the dodging the wrench line, I almost cried.

258,trint,Not just not funny.,2,21 February 2005,"I have said before that I like Ben Stiller's comedic style. I have to qualify that statement now. I like Ben Stiller's average guy that can't get a break style, made famous by ""Meet the Parents"". I really hate his ""Zoolander"" type comedy. It's dumb. Not ""Dumb and Dumber"" dumb. It's dumb like that guy in your office who thinks he's really funny and always does that same little joke, accent, or quip that wasn't really funny to anybody but him the first time but he keeps doing it anyway dumb. It's not funny and it's annoying that he thinks it is funny. ""Dodgeball"" is that guy.There were a handful of jokes that did get me to laugh out loud, simply because they were so far out in left field. (""If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball CLANG!"") But the minutes (which seemed like hours) in between those few jokes were not just not funny, they were border-line insulting. Am I really expected to laugh at a redneck lusting after a male cheerleader wannabe while he wash's the redneck's big IL' 4x4? That's not funny. That's disturbing. And please, please, please, someone tell Hollywood that there is nothing funny about a geriatric with a bondage fetish. Ick.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
259,imcginn,Amazing,3,1 February 2005,"I loved the movie. The reason it got a 3, though was the commentary on the DVD. Nothing has ever made me feel more depressed than Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller bitching and moaning about Rawson (The Director) and the techs working at the company where it was made. Rawson, as far as I could tell was trying to make a genuine commentary about his movie, and whether his first movie or not, the behaviour of those two spoilt stars has ruined my liking of either of them. Arrogant bastards. Great movie though, Rawson. Not your fault the two leads are dick heads. I loved the characters. They were funny and well acted. A gem, well done Rawson.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
260,Ryan-Shem,Absolutely Brilliant!,8,13 February 2005,"OK, I've never been one for films that deal with sports but this film has really changed my view on how super they can be. I think one of the best things in this film is the comedy value, not only does it mix comedy with seriousness of the film but it also has symbolism of ""Anything is possible, even if the odds are against you"" and I think films that symbolise things of great importance to us really convey a spectacular performance. The whole cast was very well chosen and Ben Stiller really takes his part well when he becomes what he used to become at the end, a lazy slob.Anyway, the title may seem boring but the film is exquisite, it's a film that might not spark your interest into watching it but you will succumb to the temptation of watching it for the first time or again as there is always something that you want answered or if you just want to listen to a particular line. This is one of those films that you must see, granted, that can be said for a lot of films though this really is a film you have to see to be able to come to a judgement.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
261,chucklesgreenwald,Big Ups to Ben Stiller.. Who put his career on the line and saved a movie by acting perfectly as a great idiot!,10,8 March 2006,"Dodgeball was one of my favorite movies. You know why it was? It was because I love my Ben Stiller in free-range mode, ready to do anything at any given time. Vince Vaughn, Christine Taylor, and Rip Torn were also very good. With backup roles like Hank Azaria, Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as co-hosts for the Dodgeball tournament, and Lance Armstrong making an appearance to inspire a character in the movie, you can't go wrong. The slapstick in this comedy is uproarious, completely showing all of the talents young actors and veterans can display with improvisational talent. The Dodgeball quarrell between Average Joe's and the Purple Cobras is a great scene because it really shows how Ben Stiller was the absolute perfect role as White Goodman. Ben has that charm that allows him to act perfectly arrogant, conceided disdainful as his character. He has that condescending look to him that gives movie viewers the note that he is the bad guy in the movie, without a doubt.Overall ""Dodgeball, A True Underdog Story"" is a great movie for anyone who is ready to laugh at a truly remarkable performance, alongside other brilliant but subtle performances. Dodgeball will make you laugh, cry, and pee in your pants every delirious step of the way.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
262,ccoshow-1,"Funny; stupid, but funny",8,8 August 2005,"Sometimes, a dumb, funny movie just totally hits the spot. And that's the case with this movie. Dodgeball is freakin' funny, but don't expect Noel Coward. To me, the funniest bit is watching Justin Long taking a wrench to the face, so that should tell you the kind of movie this is.But you have to be clever when you make a dumb movie, and this movie is full of cleverness. Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as the sports announcers were amazing; I never knew Gary Cole was so funny. And Justin Long has a real future doing physical comedy. As they say in the commentary, he is ""a study in ham and cheese."" MAN he's funny.Ben Stiller is awesome as White Goodman, the cartoonish bad guy. Some of his best humor comes from his screen time shared with Jamal Duff, who plays ""Me'Shell,"" White's 'fitness concigliere.' And Vince Vaughn sort of plays a standard Vince Vaughn role, but he's still great. Stephen Root adds another classic character role to his impressive repertoire. And Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate totally rocks! When I heard that he was in this movie playing a guy who thinks that he's a pirate, I thought, ""WOW, this movie must be stupid."" You have to see it to get it. If you don't mind broad physical comedy and references to obscure, gross sex acts, then this movie is great for a laugh.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

When i saw this first i laughed so much and i can watch it time and time again and still laugh that much at exactly the same thing the idea is quite weird but the characters are great they all are completely different than one another and each bring that little bit of brilliance to the film defiantly i think that EVERYONE in the world should have this in their collection. No matter what type of comedy you like you will like this, its got randomness, some clever bits, and some just ridiculously stupid parts. i think that if you are looking for a good laugh, that you can have over and over and over again you should rush out RIGHT NOW and buy this film. After watching it and putting it back on the shelf along side all your other DVDs it starts calling to you wanting to be watched over and over again and in the end you will start to wonder how you actually got along without this film in your life! seriously if you haven already closed this window do it NOW and go buy this film!",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

If only this ""Movie"" were about his Character ""Patches O'Houlihan"" then it would deserve its seemingly large success. But this is not the case. This movies suffers from what I call 'Neuvo-crap' syndrome, i.e. all ""comedies"" today are clichés of clichés of crap. You know the ending before it happens, hell, you even know most of the jokes and the dialog seems to have been written as a prequel to most of the comedies recently past. I know Hollywood ran out of ideas around the mid-Nineties and had to look to its successful past to get ""new"" ideas for the future, and it seems lately its a free-for-all on the old original stories, repackaged for an unassuming public....but the saddest fact of all isn't that most of the viewing public is ignorant to this fraud, it's the fact that they resign themselves to that fate by not investigating older movies and truly comedic films that deserve their money and attention.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

267,skettios,A wonderful performance by Ben Stiller and ensemble,10,19 June 2004,"After seeing the advertisement for Dodgeball, I waited with anticipation to see if it would be like one of my favorite Stiller movies Zoolander.I wasn't disappointed to discover that Stiller's White Goodman had a charming connection to Derek Zoolander. Stiller does a wonderful job of making over the top characters memorable and funny, where other actors might simply be annoying. He deserves a lot of credit for bringing the absurdly silly White Goodman to life.I was also excited to see extremely polished performances from Taylor, Vaughn, and Torn. Vaughn is completely believable as the laid back, clever, gym owner. Taylor has quite a few funny moments in the movie. Torn sometimes steals the show with his gruff style and dirty delivery.Notable appearances include Hank Azaria (who needs to work more), and Arrested Development's Jason Bateman, who left me laughing at every cut.Overall, I think fans of Zoolander will love Dodgeball. I would also encourage those who didn't like Zoolander to give Dodgeball a chance, in many ways, it is a superior movie.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

Ben Stiller carries the movie along in my opinion, with his stupidity and ignorance making me laugh in every scene he appeared in. Vince Vaughn also came through well in this film as the typical lazy-but-good guy. Justin Long also makes me smirk throughout this film as his weedy character tries to help and keep average Joes so he can practice to up his social standing by being in the cheer leading team. I prefer him in this by a long shot than his performance in die hard 4 or drag me to hell. without a doubt.

It had a perfect combination of goofy comedy (coming mostly from Ben Stiller, who was absolutely hilarious) mixed with that intense feeling of wanting the little guy to win.I say that this is the ultimate underdog story of our time because I can really relate this film's theme to our present sociological/political struggle.

If you like slapstick, sarcasm, weird, crude, nonsense, or even dark humor: this movie has it all! I've never seen a movie that works on so many different comedy levels as this. The main characters are pretty much ""homages"" to other films. Namely Vince Vaughn and Steven Root's characters being an homage to Peter Venknan and Louis Tully from ""GHOSTBUSTERS"", and Ben Stiller is sorta reprising this same type character he played in ""HEAVYWEIGHTS"" and ""HAPPY GILMORE"". If you love Vince Vaughn playing his typecast wise-ass roles, this movie is for you. If you loved stiller acting obscene and weird, this movie is for you. If you love straight out slapstick watching the actors obviously in real pain, this is for you. I haven't seen a comedy in a long, long time that everyone I know likes as much as this film.

Matt Stone and Trey Parker are better left to voice-overs and using scissors then actual comedic acting, especially when it comes to sarcasm; Vince Vaughn is the king of that, and he shines in that role as normal. If you can put up with Ben Stiller being a character that just makes you cringe, like him in Zoolander, then you can deal with his obnoxiousness in this movie. A lot of people liked Zoolander. I sure didn't, I think he was funnier in more traditional comedies like Something about Mary and Meet the Parents. Also, was he wearing a body suit? I never heard of someone putting on muscle for a comedic role. Anyway, obnoxious as he was he still made me laugh. The rest of the cast were funny also, Milton Waddams from Office Space was in there, I couldn't stop thinking about Swingline staplers when I saw him. Also, I always thought Marcia Brady might have been a carpet muncher. Sexy box licker though. The rest of the cast were all nobodies, kind of like me, so they were all right.10/10 in the slapstick comedy genre",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

277,mouse8181,"Good silly, summer comedy",7,15 June 2004,"I got to see a free preview screening of Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, and it did meet my expectations as a comedy. It had all the funny moments I was looking forward to in the previews (wrench-throwing, ""Joani loves Chachi"") plus a lot of great lines.Vince Vaughan plays his usual smooth, quick wit self like he does in movies like Old School, even though I found it a little weird that he'd be the leader of the ""underdogs"" at Average Joe's gym, aside from the fact that a) he owns the gym and b) he's a unorganized slacker who's in debt to basically every bill he's ever owed.Ben Stiller is over the top as the revolting White Goodman, and wife Christine Taylor adds some laughs with her repulsion towards him. As for the rest of the cast, Stephen Root does good as usual with the skittish man role, while Justin Long's character (aptly named Justin) is a clone to his role of Warren P. Cheswick on the now defunct TV show Ed. He gave me the most laughs of the cast anyway, but one wonders if he is going to be type cast in that role of the nerdy young man who makes you cringe when he talks to the most popular, prettiest cheerleader in school. (They might as well have named Amber ""Jessica,"" a reference any Ed fans will get)The two cast members that added a bit of silliness were Alan Tudyk as Steve the Pirate (the name says it all) and Rip Torn as the aged Patches O'Houlihan. Torn has some of the best lines of the whole movie, which makes me want to see it again just to catch them, because there were so many I can't remember them all.A key scene to catch is the Dodgeball film from Justin's PE Class, made by Uber-American Films. I don't want to give anything away, so just make sure you look at for that one.Overall I'd say go see this movie if you enjoy similar comedies like Old School.

However, I still recommend this movie to every comedy fan. The movie has the outright physical humor of people getting hit in the head and groin with rubber balls, but has the subtle humor as well. At first, Vaughn isn't very convincing as his character and seems like he's just there to deliver the punch-line. However, the quick one-liners by Vaughn matched up against the increasingly idiotic (but humorous) responses from Stiller combine for some memorable scenes. The actual plot is predictable, but this surprisingly does not take away from the comedy. The supporting cast may lack in acting skills, but builds a good foundation for the ongoing jokes in the movie.

I have no problem with so-dumb-it's-funny humor (love Steve Martin), and it's extremely rare that I find any joke at all offensive (love Sam Kinison). Somehow, I found this film beyond stupid (even after 3 beers) and often squirmingly offensive (the stereotypes of Asians and Asian-Americans - of which my date was one - were not only insulting, but committed the equal sin of not even being funny). Of course you go to a movie called ""Dodgeball"" with low expectations, but it managed to miss even the lowest. Have you ever been in a movie and wanted to scream, ""When is somebody going to do something funny?! Please?! Anyone?!"" Lots of talented actors and a goofily promising premise is wasted in an utterly, completely, totally dreadful script that could well have been written by a thirteen-year old of below-average intelligence. No offense intended to anyone who liked this film. And maybe it just caught me on the wrong night. But this is the one time that an IMDb rating (6.8) steered me completely wrong.

283,sweetwasabi,"Great Movie ... Thank you for not using the ""Alternative Ending""",10,4 April 2008,"I think this movie is great. Very funny from start to finish, and just goes on and on with the farce humour. There were a few things that I felt went a bit to far. I mean, it was just too gross for me. Like the masturbating with a pizza. I mean, come on! Was that really necessary?One thing that really really bugs me, is the so called ""alternative ending"" Where globo gym wins, and not ""Average Joes."" They wanted to do it that was because they wanted to tell us that you can try in life, but you don't always win.OK, here's the problem with that. We know already! We don't need multimillionaire Hollywood celebrates telling us average Joe's and Josephine's that! We freaken know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So mister director guy, who had a problem making an ending that didn't depress us, nor one that pointed out the obvious that the average person doesn't always win, go make an independent movie or something to make a more ""artistic"" or ""depressing"" or ""meaningful"" movie. Hey you would have less of a budget, and make less money, but that's not what's important right? Plus, the movie ends tightly. Brings in all lose ends. If you see it, you will know what I mean.And, on top of which, the ending brought in Chuck Norris. Chuck Norris! He's freaken awesome! See the movie! The whole one! And ignore what the director says in the ""alternative ending."" It's better with a good ending, and just flat out better to end with Chuck Noriss anyways.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
284,klakatz,Laugh out loud mindless fun,8,2 July 2005,"Ben Stiller manages to take silly humor and keep it funny. Playing a stereotypical ""bad guy"" with just a little bit of inadequacy coming in. Sure he's in shape now, but inside he's still the same fat guy. But Stiller keeps it fresh instead of cliché', or maybe he just makes the cliché' hilarious. The rest of the cast very good, it takes a while to figure out, where do I know ? them from. The storyline is there to showcase the humor, Vince Vaughan is the ""no goal"" (easier to attain that way) good guy. With his wacky crew of misfits, Alan Tudyk shines as the pirate. And every time Jason Bateman's Pepper opened his mouth, I was laughing. David Hasselhoff and William Shatner have very tongue in cheek cameos. And Chuck Norris was funny without saying a word.

Now, when I have melted the movie I'm not so sure... Was the acting good? Not really! Were there surprises? Nooo... Was it fun? Hell YEAH! This comedy relies on balls (and other objects that people can throw at each other). You can't help it! When a ball hits two other balls, it causes a physical reaction that can be seen in everyone involved! The guys know what I'm talking about: Your both hands instantly go for the nuts, you fall to the floor, your friends go ""OOOOOOOOH"" and reach for their own... stuff. Then everybody laughs!

Other movies weren't half as bad as this. This had very annoying characters like the leader of Globo gym. He just obsessed with sex it is so goddamn annoying.

The funny thing about this movie is that after I saw this I started digging around the TV channels to find out there is a real Dodgeball Tournament. To me I found that great. In high school thats all we played was dodge-ball. So when I started watching the movie I got into it even more. My Favorite Part in this move is when Ben Stiller jumps onto the back of Jamal Duff's little scooter and flips off Christine Taylor. And a strange out of left field thing was Steve the Pirate. I can't remember ever seeing a pirate play dodge-ball. If you are looking for an action packed movie I do not suggest this movie for you. If your looking to laugh hard than buy this movie.

I also loved his character in Swingers and Made playing alongside Jon Favreau. So I gave this movie a chance but was extremely disappointed. Not with Vaughn, but with the plot and with Ben Stiller. Stiller wasn't so bad in Something About Mary or in the two family movies (Meet the Parents/Meet the Fockers) but after Dodgeball I swear, I'm never watching another Stiller movie unless it's for free and I'm bored to tears.Stiller's character is so over-the-top it stops being funny after the first couple of scenes.

I have friends that say this was the dumbest movie ever, and i can't completely disagree with them. The humor is VERY low-brow, but also fairly creative (Anouncer saying that the dodgeball dancers were good, clean, family fun). And low-brow happens to be very funny. It's meant to be a satire of sports movies that take themselves and it does a great job of that. If you're looking for cinematic excellence, look elsewhere.

This hilarious movie is better seen unrated, but if you don't want children to see it, or you just don't want to see it, you aren't missing much. Which is wonderful, because you don't want to miss any of this hilarious comedy. Patches' training procedure is enough to make yourself roll on the floor laughing. How Ben Stiller, Rip Torn, and Vince Vaughn say all those hilarious things with a straight face is beyond me, but it's funny as all get out! Although...I must say that I really hope you aren't drinking any liquids or are tired from laughing already....I really do...because the ending credits are priceless!!! It's too funny! I'm still laughing!!!I also found something interesting during my visit to the Special Features. The first thing that you notice is that the layout of the section is Average Joes and the little scene off to the side is Justin's ever-hilarious attempt to catch Patches's dodge balls during training. However, look next to the balloon that says ""resume film"". You see a balloon that is Globo Gym's logo. Click it, and you are taken to a scene where the fat White Goodman says that every time he snaps his fingers in the movie, hit enter. It happens three times in the movie. 1. When White tries to seduce Kate in his office, 2. At the Dirty Sanchez, after White pushed the waitress onto the Average Joes's table, and lastly, 3. After Kate throws White against her door and he says ""nobody makes me bleed in my own blood. Nobody!"" After you press enter for the third time, you will be taken to the scene where White does his ""Patented 'Peek-a-Boo'"" dodge ball throw, then to the t.v in the Globo Gym building (the one where he says ""There's a good energy in the gym"". You, for quite some time, watch the little show on the screen before you are taken back to the scene where White gets on the Blue motor scooter driven by Me'Shell. The show is funny.

Also why did the director of Nacho Libre make the film like Napeoleon Dynamite???

This was, if not the worst, certainly one of the worst movies I have ever wasted money on (actually the theater reimbursed me). Let me begin by saying that Vince Vaughn is one of the more entertaining actors out there. While ""Made"" was pretty annoying, Swingers and Old School provided funny roles for him. This movie just didn't fit him for some reason. It appeared that his heart just wasn't in it. Maybe he was just there to pick up a check before he next decent role came along, I don't know. His character tried SO HARD to be a likable ""Joe-everybody,"" he was impossible to relate to. That being said, he was the best part of this piece of trash.I admit that Ben Stiller has talent. He draws audiences and has become quite popular. However, with the exception of ""Meet the Parents,"" he has never made me laugh. Owen Wilson had me rolling on the floor during Zoolander but Stiller just left me stone faced. So I have to admit that I had some Stiller-prejudice going in. He reached a new low. I have to apportion some blame to the writers, but I can't figure out how anyone could have found his character enjoyable. Perhaps this film was meant for children who aren't interested in pesky things like plot, character development, clever writing, etc..., but I don't think so. No, I believe that this movie was meant for 20-somethings who laughed as Old School, Zoolander and Office Space. Which brings me to the writers. I admit, I'm no Bill Shakespeare, but I'm not getting paid millions to write. This story just made no sense. BARELY SPOILERS HEREINWhy did these guys hang out at the gym all day? Why did they care about their gym so much? Why should we care whether the gym next door takes over Vince Vaughn's gym? None of this was explained. I found myself not caring about any of the characters. END OF SPOILERS (if those were really spoilers)I can get my money back, but no one can give me my time back. What a waste.AVOID THIS MOVIE. I'm rambling here but I really need to get the point across that you should spend your time, oh I don't know...counting ceiling tiles, clipping your finger nails or flicking bottle caps across the room at your cat.

It wasn't funny in Austin Powers. At least it was redeeming in Shallow Hal.

308,mjlarochelle,2004's Happy Gilmore,8,6 August 2004,"""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" was a goofy, but hilarious movie that had me laughing all the way through. It was truly a story of underdogs proving that are just as likely to succeed, even if it is only by luck. Those who enjoyed ""Happy Gilmore"" may or may not enjoy this film - it depends if you like movies that have striking similarities to one you've seen before.The main character in this film, White Goodman, is played by Ben Stiller, who was a nursing home orderly by the name of Hal in the 1996 film Happy Gilmore. In both films, he uses his power to his advantage, using every opportunity to make anyone feel bad. The striking similarities between the two films goes beyond this. The basic plot lines are essentially the same: the ownership of a large asset is threatened, the character takes up a sport they've never played before in order to win back that asset, and the champion of that sport, who is imminently to take over that asset, feels threatened and will do anything to stop them. In Happy Gilmore it was Grandma's house that was threatened; in this film it is a gym business. In the same sense, golf versus dodgeball.In addition, product placements are found in this film, and they are sometimes the same as what is found in Happy Gilmore. Pepsi was seen a number of times in both films. Also, some golf events in Happy Gilmore were covered by ESPN, and in this film, the dodgeball championships in Las Vegas are covered by ESPN - ESPN 8 ""The Ocho"", that is. Fortunately, we didn't see Peter LaFleur eating three Subway sandwiches a day.To put it another way, if you didn't like Johnny English, you won't like this film.

I say good effort, that why it was so hard to cut it. i think that Ben Stiller took a break from his love stories and weird model movies for a light, funny story. I think that he acted his part well but the whole movie just didn't turn out the way it could have. Hopefully his next movie will be better. I here the meet the parents sequel is coming, maybe that will be as funny as the first. But anyway i was disappointed with dodgeball but you cant be pleased with them all.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
314,rothdude916,i pissed my pants laughing,10,25 June 2004,this movie was one of the top movies in my opinion. i had my doubts at first but within the first 10 min. of the movie i forgot all about them. I think it is worth seeing again. the quotes were great. i almost suffocated from laughing so hard and just about p***ed myself. this was one of Ben stillers best movies. if you enjoyed starsky and hutch i think you would really like this movie. when someone in the movie was getting injured you could feel their pain. the spacing between jokes was perfect! it was just freak'n hilarious!!! its stupid humor but not to stupid so you won't feel like its a total waste of money. it had a little something for everybody.,Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
315,everclarified,What???,1,27 June 2004,"Wow. Now, I was 'forced' to see this for my best friend's kid brother's birthday. Several times, I tried to tear my hair out and screamed out in pain. This was the worst thing I've ever been through. It wasn't even funny in the 'it's so terrible it's almost amusing!' way. It was typical at every single turn. It was a factory-packaged movie, and it was disturbingly last-rate considering the budget they must have had for those amazing cameos (Chuck Norris, William Shatner, Lance Armstrong, whoever the hell else they mashed in...). And hey, the great characters! ""I know! In order to round up our strikingly 'average' group of underdogs, we can have one guy that thinks he's a pirate! Ha! Isn't that great?!?"" Just, no.

316,wasabe45,An average teen's review,8,30 June 2004,"This was a movie that most people who enjoy physical humor, or just straight comedy will probably love. I thought that it was hilarious. Humor wise, I thought that it was better than Starsky and Hutch. How ever, that story was much better. I want to see the unrated version. There were quite a few ""hidden"" jokes that you had to pick up during the commentating on ESPN 8, which a lot of people missed. However, the story was extremely lame and drab, so don't see it for that. It was way too predictable, and was basically a thing that would never happen. If you see it for the humor, you will leave the theater happy. Otherwise, don't bother seeing it. Also, if you like Ben Stiller, he was great as the arrogant and rich White. Also, Vince Vaughn was great as the average Joe.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
317,sky_guy,"Cool, Smooth, Unpretentious Entertainment",8,30 June 2004,"The trouble with slapstick comedy is that too often it aims too low, with loud obnoxious characters and shallow jokes. The neat thing about Dodgeball is that it aims for the middle and scores a direct hit.This is slapstick comedy that manages to be cool, modern and hip at the same time. There's a certain smoothness to the movie -- it never drags, never gets obnoxious, and has some fun little character development twists to keep it all interesting.It's hard to be critical about Dodgeball because it clearly was never meant to taken for anything except as entertainment. Want a well-paced summer drive-in movie? This is it.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
318,Sakel,Do not dodge this one!,8,7 July 2004,"This movie was one of the sleeper hits this year, at least it was for me. Plotwise, this movie is exactly the same as all the other sports movies, but it really is the excellent humour and some funny cameos that make this one different.The acting is not the greatest aspect in Dodgeball, but then again, this is not some shakespearian (is that a word?) drama, so it's okay, because the comedy bits are top notch and these guys do it very well.If you like this movie, I suggest you'd see Zoolander, or Not another teen movie! next. Very funny, go and see it now.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

We have met each and every character at some point in our lives, and can identify partially with at least one of this amazing group of misfits.The jokes are continual, often in your face (Ben Stiller with electrodes attached to his nipples fighting the evil of doughnuts (Donuts if you prefer) ), some subtle (comments about the Greek poetess Sapho and the Isle of Lesbos for example), Ben Stiller as the psychotic gym owner trying to take over the world, the inflatible codpiece, the pirate who ended wearing a patch for real, the nerds, cheerleaders, everything all gelled to make this a supremely funny film.Thank God (and the producers, director, cast, etc etc) for this film.""We're better than you, and you know it!"".",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

This movie was utterly uneventful for the most part, and I almost didn't watch the last ten minutes. Morbid curiosity, much like one that makes one slow down and look over at car crashes, elicited me to watch. Being bisexual, despite popular belief, does not mean one has two partners. I know, all of you in your corporate offices are probably shocked right now, thinking 'well, a bicycle has two wheels, doesn't that mean a bisexual has two partners?!' No, as a matter of fact, it doesn't. And as a bisexual in a loving manogamous relationship, I'm really starting to get p***ed off here.

Ben Stiller plays the wonderful role of the owner of Globo gym, White Goodman. In a battle against average Joe (Vince Vaughn) in the game of dodge-ball. however if u dot have good patience you will begin to wonder how is this story named dodge-ball, but after about 10 minutes u figure it out. Ohh and make sure you watch through the credits, i wont ruin the surprise but just don't forget the Kleenex you will laugh so hard u cry. it is hilarious and as of this moment is the best comedy of the 2004 year, until Anchorman the legend of Ron Burgundy comes out.

323,slhscb91,Decent movie,6,25 January 2005,"Dodge Ball is a fairly funny movie. It certainly has it's moments, and if you like Ben Stiller then you'll probably like this film. The exchanges between Stiller and Vaughn are classic. Stiller just has to get the last word in regardless and it's hilarious! Some of the scenes with Patches O'houlihan are great too. ""If you can dodge traffic, you can dodge a ball!"" Hilarious! The cast is so-so in my opinion. I do like Vince Vaughn, but some of the characters in the movie are just kinda..well... stupid. I mean, what business does Steve the Pirate have in this movie? Still have not figured that one out. I thought the chick from Romanovia was a little much as well, but that's just me.This movie reminds me a lot of some of Adam Sandler's earlier movies like Billy Madison. The movie has it's moments and uses some of the same retarded humor but it's not a great movie by far. If you like Sandler then you'll watch any of his flicks. The same can be said here with Ben Stiller. If you like him, then you'll like this movie.Bottom line for me when commenting on a movie is this; Did it entertain me? Yeah. It's a decent movie with hilarious spots. Not great, but a fairly entertaining film.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

What spoiled this movie for me was its shameless crude humor. I've seen movies with tasteless humor before (almost every Stiller flick), but this was especially disappointing because the movie would have been so uproariously funny without it! The last scene especially turned me off, leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth for the movie. If this happens to you, though, I would suggest watching the extra features which contain extra footage of the skinny kid getting pelted with dodge-balls.

327,biggy_mass,Classic slapstick,8,19 July 2005,"I saw this movie at the cinema, and thought it was hilarious. Being a film reviewer, I got free admission, but would have gladly paid the full fare with the advantage of hindsight. This movie was nonstop fun. Stiller is at his usual brilliant best, and Vaughn plays the laid back gym owner to perfection. Chuck Norris plays a small yet decisive cameo role. I cannot possibly fault this movie, other than to say the pirate character could have been better. A great comedy when you are not in the mood for concentrating to hard. Easy to watch, and completely enjoyable.Stiller plays the stereotypical American health freak brilliantly, and Rip Torn is ever so funny as the ex-champion dodgeballer, Patches Ohoolighan. It is amazing that it is still funny to see a grown man fall to his knees after being barraded by numerous balls. Torn's techniques as coach are tremendous. He says at one point ""If you can dodge a wrench,you can dodge a ball!"" And then goes on to hurl large amounts of various tools at an innocent team member. Classic comedy at its finest.MAssive. Big up.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
328,marc-soulsby,A classic tale of the underdog,10,19 July 2005,"I went to see this film because of Ben Stiller (who I think is fantastic). This film had me in stitches from the moment it started to the moment it ended. Ben Stiller is great as White Goodman (a neurotic gym owner on a power trip) and, for me, steals the show. Rip Torn plays the part of a former Dodgeball champion and, for those of you who like physical humour, had me in pain from laughing so hard.The story has been well thought out and put across to the audience in a way that everyone will relate to at least one of the characters. It is the type of movie that you can watch without really thinking about it. By that, I mean that you can watch it and laugh (and you will) without worrying whether or not you're gonna be too loud and miss vital plot points. The movie is sheer comedy. You watch the screen and you laugh... it's that simple. All the family can enjoy this. My son is also a very big fan. I know that when I sit down to watch this movie with my son that there are no times when I have to block the screen or shield him from any dirty or disgusting dialogue. Yes, this is one for the whole family... from children to the senior citizens.If you haven't seen this movie yet then I advise you to buy / rent it now.

329,built2spill,An insult to comedy,1,1 August 2005,"""Dodgeball"" is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. And I watch many movies, all kinds of genres.Comedies are supposed to make you laugh. ""Anchorman"" was very mediocre, but I at least had a few good laughs. Dodgeball was so unfunny, it was painful to watch. It was the first movie directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, and it showed. This won't look good on his short resumeThere's a reason Hollywood is struggling. When you watch Dodgeball, you can see why when they release this crap and expect people to pay $8-plus to suffer through it. I didn't think the movie would be great, but I was shocked how lousy, cliché and unoriginal it was.Ben Stiller's character is TOO over-the-top, if that's possible, and simply embarrassing for his overrated career. Vince Vaughn can be a funny guy, but the writing is so atrocious, he's a pretty invisible character.This review is a friendly warning so you don't waste 90 minutes of your time, which could be better spent picking up dog crap in the back yard.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story
330,sehhhl,mind-numbingly dull - be warned,1,15 February 2006,"this is a warning for all of you who thought that some of Ben Stiller's Comedies were kind of funny if a bit dumb - i liked 'meet the parents, i even liked Zoolander - yeah i understand this movie is not meant to be ""good"" or imaginative it's meant to be dumb fun. it's meant to be ""univentively unfunny and therefore funny"" - well it just isn't.here's the plot : sleep-inducingly dull plastic bodybuilder-gym-owners throw themselves and balls at each-other.Dodgeball is probably just as bad as ""duplex"", ""along came polly"" and ""Meet The Fockers"" which surely says quite something. it might even be worse, i just don't know, as it's hard to imagine anything even further down below in the ""harmless-but-vomit-inducing-family-comedy"" - genre. which sadly seems to be a $$$$$ - genre at the moment. though the ""harmless"" part is certainly debatable. i am convinced that utter mind-numbing dullness is in fact very closely linked to pure evil.well maybe you might enjoy this movie as a kind of dystopian horror-fantasy. most characters seem to be disturbing and incredibly dull latex creatures.the whole Gym -thing is horrible enough in itself - even in reality. Men - especially male actors - seem to be aspiring to become these horribly tanned plastic muscle-mutants i just hate that look. it's absolutely ugly and of course mind-bogglingly idiotic.the sets + costumes + makeup etc. are just as horribly lacking in any sense of imagination or style or comedy as the incredibly unfunny one-liners throughout the movie.as for the disgusting stuff, obviously they had to keep it lame-disgusting to get a PG-13 rating, having said that though, there are extremely idiotic brutal scenes - e.g. a mad coach throwing edged and pointed metal tools at kids to make them a more competitive dodgeball-team and them loving him for it.Of course we don't get to see one single drop of blood. and it's exactly that kind of absurd scenarios coupled with extremely reactionary ideas,prudishness and pseudo-funny clichéd non-jokes that makes this movie truly offensive.OK, enough. you have been warned.",Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story

Geez, what an original screen play.Not one funny line (unless you possess a single digit IQ), no funny visual humor (unless groin shots some how still strike you as humorous).Save yourself some time and give the clerk at Blockbuster four bucks and just leave without this piece of garbage.

From Vince Vaughn's laid back approach to Ben Stiller's entertaining over-the-top performance, the jokes just keep coming. The film is full of nice touches that will appeal to all ages, it is a sure-fire hit. Each cast member brings different humour to this film and each works perfectly well.

If this is the future of comedy, it is also one step closer to the end of civilization as we know it. Any movie that considers its main attraction as bombarding grown men with dodge balls over and over again humorous needs to get a reality check. The plot line was completely predictable, and nothing came as a surprise. All in all, this movie is an insult to those who watch it.I know some people found this to be humorous, and I could see that it might appeal to some preteens with an obnoxious sense of humor.

And with Rip Torn in it playing the great dodge ball legend, Patches O'Hoolihan, things get even funnier from dodging wrenches to dodging traffic and just dodging dodge balls. It's just one of the greatest movies I've seen in years. There's romance, drama, (maybe not much of either but they're still there!) comedy, action and maybe some more comedy. The acting is great in this movie and the fact that they have to raise $50,000 and they do an ""all male"" car wash to raise $50,000 on the same day where there is an all female car wash across the street is just plain hilarious. You can't really get a movie better than this one. It's just plain brilliant. Overall, this movie defiantly gets a 10/10.
