0,TheLittleSongbird,A mission to not fall out on,8,3 August 2018,"Found the first three films ones that had a lot to like (namely the action, the visuals, good casting on the whole and Philip Seymour Hoffmann's superb villain in the third) but also their faults (plot convolution in the first and third and the characters could have been written better in the second and third).'Ghost Protocool' to me was a great film and the best of the series since the original, and actually better than it, mainly because the story even though somewhat familiar seemed more focused and far less convoluted. 'Rogue Nation' was on 'Ghost Protocool's' very high level. Sure, there was a little bit of familiarity and the basic structure was somewhat formulaic, but 'Rogue Nation' had enough freshness and so much fast and furious excitement and thrills it doesn't feel like an issue.Contrary to the critical consensus that 'Mission Impossible-Fallout' is the best 'Mission Impossible' film, personally don't quite agree. It is definitely one of the best ones, and perhaps third place behind 'Ghost Protocool' and 'Rogue Nation' (my personal favourite).It does have a little too much going on in places and things get too complicated in spots. Ving Rhames is underused and doesn't seem to be enjoying himself in a basically nothing role.Some of the dialogue is also somewhat forced.Visually, 'Mission Impossible-Fallout' is even slicker and even more stylish than 'Ghost Protocool' and 'Rogue Nation', surpassing the latter as perhaps the most audacious of all six films put together. The locations, from sinister drabness to stunningly colourful, are a feast for the eye and the effect dazzle. The music doesn't overbear the action and such at all while making a pulsating impact thanks to the thrillingly authentic sound.The action is bigger, bolder and more dynamic than any other action scenes seen before in the previous four instalments. Many are breath-taking in their excitement and also nuances, hard to pick a favourite with such spectacular stunts and action scenes between the lightning storm, the motorcycle chase, the helicopter battle, the car chase, the London sprints and the toilet martial arts fight. Christopher McQuarrie's directing is again some of the best he's ever done, with a great sense of visual style and a real grasp of the storytelling.'Mission Impossible-Fallout' script is generally sharp, knowingly sophisticated with the humour (not cheesy or out of place) and intrigue superbly balanced. The story, the series' heaviest, darkest and most ambitious, is told at a breakneck pace without being rushed and grips one right in and never lets go, with the backstories providing some depth. There is, like with 'Rogue Nation' an appealing light-heartedness, tongue-in-cheek and suspense of superior tension and elegance (as far as the 'Mission Impossible' films go).Tom Cruise is very impressive, handling the stunts with effortless and enviable ease and acting with steely charisma. Rebecca Ferguson shows an even better and more confident knack for scene-stealing, with her in ersatz breath-of-fresh-air form. Sean Harris and Henry Cavill intimidate effectively, while Simon Pegg's comic relief in no way jars and is actually very funny and Jeremy Renner's presence is more than welcome. Vanessa Kirby, Alec Baldwin and Michelle Monaghan are also strong. It is a shame however that Ving Rhames is underused and lacking the charisma that he showed in 'Rogue Nation' despite being under-utilised in that too.On the whole, very good, just not amazing. One of the better 'Mission Impossible' films though and among the better films of the year, if not among the very best. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1,Leofwine_draca,Thoroughly thrilling,8,13 January 2019,"FALLOUT is the latest thrilling instalment of the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE franchise; I've been a fan of these since the third part which remains my favourite overall. FALLOUT comes just behind that, on par with the equally good GHOST PROTOCOL and ahead of the last one, ROGUE NATION. This time around, the scope is bigger, the budget is massive, and the endless action sequences make use of constant innovation to delight and offer the viewer stuff you've never seen before.Tom Cruise and his crew all return for an international twisty-turny tale. The writing isn't anything special and the constant twists and reveals are quite easy to guess throughout. I did enjoy seeing Henry Cavill in a hardman role and he gives as good as he gets with Cruise. The film's essentially one big action scene after another and they're mostly impressive and only occasionally cheesy. I would have liked a little more hand-to-hand combat, as there are only a couple of such scenes early on and they're really good, particularly the stand-out bathroom battle. The RAID films are a definite influence here. I'm not a big fan of CGI-assisted action but it does work a treat this time around and FALLOUT rivals the latest Marvel epics in terms of entertainment value. Bring on the next!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
2,SnoopyStyle,action Bond,8,25 September 2018,"Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) misses Julia (Michelle Monaghan) terribly. It's been two years since he captured British agent turned anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). The remnants of his Syndicate have spread chaos calling themselves the Apostles. Ethan is task with retrieving three stolen plutonium cores but loses them when he had to save Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames). CIA director Erika Sloane (Angela Bassett) distrusts IMF and assigns agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) on the team. They run into Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) who is on a mission of her own.This is action Bond. Cruise does his big boy running. In a world saturated with superhero green screen action, there is something to real world action even with some CGI work. It feels more visceral. The only thing missing is a Jackie Chan post credit stunt blooper. As for the plot, it remains convoluted like the rest of the franchise but at least, this one is comprehensible. The villains are good. The twists are fine. Cavill does good moustache work. As a franchise, this has overtaken its rival Bond in almost every way except for history.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
3,Prismark10,The Hunt Odyssey,6,25 July 2018,"Christopher McQuarrie returns as director as well as the writer for Mission Impossible - Fallout. He becomes the first director to come back for a sequel but that is because this film is a continuation of Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation that includes the return of the ruthless villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris.)Ethan Hunt is searching for the shadowy John Lark and a terrorist group known as the Apostles who have stolen three plutonium cores right under the IMF team and plan to launch a nuclear attack. Joining Hunt is August Walker (Henry Cavill) a CIA assassin as the Head of the CIA does not trust the IMF team after losing the plutonium in the first place.The action ranges from Paris, Berlin, London and Kashmir. The script has double and triple crosses and even Walker mentions the constant use of face masks like it is Halloween. In fact even the audience is ahead of the characters in the film by now when it comes to face mask deceptions.If you watch this in the cinema this is a thrilling action packed film. However it is too long clocking in at 2 hours and 30 minutes. McQuarrie is a good screenwriter and has the nuts and bolts down of an action movie. He makes sly references to previous MI films (The character of Max from the first film) and even other Cruise movies (the word 'crystal' is used when one character asks if they have made themselves clear.)However as a director he is a bit vanilla. This is a franchise that started with Brian De Palma and John Woo, directors who would being style and visual flourishes to each installment. McQuarrie as a director lacks any signature moves apart from competency.Some of the action sequences reminded me of the Bond films, some of the locations were a little uninspiring. London is used again for the third time in the film franchise.I expect the future films in the franchise to have a shake up including members of the IMF team. I think Benji has run his course and Luther is a bit long in the tooth as well as bit too porky for these kind of films.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
4,claudio_carvalho,Great Action Film,7,23 April 2019,"""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is maybe the best the best film of this franchise. The non-stop action story is engaging and funny, there are good plot points and it is worthwhile watching. The unbearable 56 year-old Tom Cruise convinces in the role of Ethan Hunt. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Missão: Impossível - Efeito Fallout"" (""Mission: Impossible - Fallout Effect"")",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
5,nogodnomasters,Grown Men Wearing Halloween Masks,10,8 August 2018,"The opening of the film was classic Mission Impossible. Of course they went to great lengths because the IMF doesn't have a 400 pound guy who can hack a cell phone. Cruise who was on the outs, is now back in. He must save the world from a nuclear attack, one that may be his fault because the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many...about one fourth of the planet. We get to see Cruise as the world's greatest BMW driver, motorcycle driver, roof top jumper, bullet dodger, helicopter pilot and rock climber....yes it is a cliff hanger, literally. Ethan must save the world from anarchist while also going up against the CIA and MI6. Guide: One F-word. No sex, or nudity.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
6,kosmasp,(Oops)He did it again,7,2 November 2018,"Whatever you may think of Cruise, be it his acting or his private life (and associations), you can't fault his charisma and his willingness to go all the way. The stunts he is willing to put himself through? The dedication to learn new things? Although I guess you may argue it's the best way to find an excuse for someone to pay for you to learn how to fly a helicopter or free climbing lessons or whatever is next.Action and stunts are really good, story wise you can guess what is going to happen. Then again, I reckon there are a few surprises you may not have seen all the way through. Unless you have seen the trailer, which make a few things kind of redundant. Or maybe more interesting because you may be looking for clues. Whatever the case, this may very well be a very good farewell ...",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
7,classicsoncall,"""What's done is done when we say it's done.""",9,6 December 2018,"I'd give this movie a '10' rating just for the sheer audacity of it all, what with the dramatic stunt work and over the top action sequences, but it seemed to get too clever for itself with the random plot twists thrown in to make the viewer go 'What'? Like the reveal that White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) was a CIA agent, or that Walker (Henry Cavill) was working for the bad guys. The whole John Lark plot line went through more changes in direction than any story had a right to have, and if you lost focus for even a second, the story might have flown right over your head. But on balance, the movie moves pretty quickly and I especially liked Simon Pegg in his role of Benji Dunn on the IMF team. I had him 'pegged' for a bit more humor but what the heck, he did a nice job with Ving Rhames backing up Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt. I don't know if it was such a good idea for Ethan to run into Julia (Michelle Monaghan) in the middle of nowhere, that was stretching a coincidence too far to my mind but at least it helped him reconcile with his past. If I were to go on and on like some of the other reviewers here I could possibly talk myself into disliking the picture, so for brevity I'll just say I went with the flow here and had a pretty good time. After all, there is that word 'Impossible' in the title.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
8,jboothmillard,Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7,4 August 2018,"The Mission: Impossible franchise has now had continued success for 22 years, I had heard about this sixth instalment months before its release. This is because of the Superman star growing a moustache which had to be digitally removed in Justice League, and because of the lead actor breaking his ankle jumping from onto the edge of a building whilst filming in the UK. I was very much looking forward to another movie in the series, from returning director Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation). Basically two years since Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) was captured, the remains of his organisation The Syndicate have reformed into terrorist group The Apostles. In Belfast, IMF (Impossible Missions Force) agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, also producing) receives details of a mission to intercept the sale of three plutonium cores, members of the group are acquiring them for a fundamentalist called John Lark. Ethan travels to Berlin and meets up with Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), but the mission fails when Luther's life is at risk and Ethan chooses to save him, and the Apostles take the plutonium. Nuclear weapons expert Nils Debruuk (Kristoffer Joner), who has been working with the group to build three portable nuclear weapons, has been captured and is interrogated, he is tricked into believing attacks have occurred on religious sites in Rome, Jerusalem and Mecca, to obtain information on the Apostles' next move. Newly appointed CIA Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) instructs Special Activities Division operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) to watch over Ethan, as he attempts to retrieve the plutonium. Ethan and Walker parachute into Paris, where they infiltrate a fundraiser party at the Grand Palais where John Lark will buy the cores from the Apostles, with the arms dealer called the White Widow acting as broker. Ethan and Walker track Lark to a bathroom, they get into a fight, Lark is killed by former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). To complete mission, Ethan impersonates John Lark and meets with White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), agents of the Apostles have been sent to kill John Lark and the White Widow, but they manage to escape. In order to secure the plutonium, Ethan (as Lark) is tasked with securing an asset, which turns out to be Soloman Lane, who is being transported in in an armoured convoy moving through Paris, Ethan is given one of the plutonium cores as payment to extract Lane. Ethan does not follow the original plan, as he knows it would have failed, he and his team attack the convoy and Lane is extracted, but Ethan's loyalties are tested, as Isla reveals that the MI6 want Lane dead, it is her mission to kill him. Ethan avoids the White Widow's forces, the police and Ilsa during a motorcycle and car chase that takes place across Paris, the mission is successful, whereupon the White Widow instructs the team to deliver Lane, as well as Ilsa, to London. At a safehouse in London, Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), Secretary of IMF, confronts Ethan about being John Lark, Ethan eventually convinces him that the mission that should continue. Walker unwittingly reveals himself to be the real John Lark, in association with Lane, after Benji disguises himself as Lane, Erica Sloane also notices and instructs a shadow CIA team to take Lane, Walker, and Ethan's team in. The CIA team have in fact been infiltrated by the Apostles, Walker orders them to attack the IMF, Hunley is stabbed and killed by Walker in the ensuing fight. Ethan tracks Walker across the rooftops, with the help of Benji, Luther and Ilsa, to the top of the Tate Modern, where Walker escapes in a helicopter with Lane, but not before threatening the life of Ethan's estranged wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan). Travelling to Kashmir, where the terrorists are heading, Benji reveals the two remaining nuclear weapons are synchronized with each other; if one is defused, the other will detonate, but both can be deactivated, as long as the countdown is started. To complete the defuse process, the key must also be pulled from the detonator before the countdown reaches zero, otherwise the weapon will detonate. Lane's plan for the weapons is to contaminate the water supply of Pakistan, India, and China, meaning a third of the world's population will be affected. At a medical camp, where the abundance of radiology equipment can disguise the radioactivity of the bombs, Walker has manipulated for Julia and her new husband, Patrick (Wes Bentley), to be onsite to raise the stakes for Ethan. Solomon Lane activates the weapons, giving the detonator to Walker, taking off in a helicopter, Ethan pursues in a second helicopter, leaving Benji, Luther, and Ilsa on the ground to find the weapons. Luther finds the first weapon and get help from Julia to defuse it, while Benji and Ilsa find the second weapon and fight with Lane, Benji is nearly hanged to death by Lane, but Ilsa subdues him and rescues Benji at the last minute. Ethan and Walker engage in an aerial helicopter chase, before Ethan rams Walker's aircraft out of the sky, crashing onto the edge of cliff, the two engage in a fight, until Walker is falls to his death. With just seconds to go before the blast, Ethan is able to get control of the detonator while Luther, Ilsa, and Benji deactivate the bombs, in the aftermath the remaining plutonium cores are safely recovered. Lane is handed over to the MI6 by Erica Sloane, through the White Widow, Ilsa is exonerated, Ethan recovers from his injuries with the help of Julia, the rest of the team join him following their victory. Also starring Frederick Schmidt as Zola, Liang Yang as Lark Decoy, journalist Wolf Blitzer as himself and Alix Bénézech as French Police Agent. Cruise as the lead hero and doing most of his own stunts still proves the great action man, Harris is good as the returning villain, Cavill is great as the suspicious shadow agent, and Pegg and Rhames add both comic relief and great support. As with most of the films before, it takes us all over the world for espionage, chases and fights, all bigger and better, there are a good number of fast-paced scenes and memorable stunts, including the noticeable one that went wrong, and the story also has some realistic terrorism themes, a satisfactory action spy thriller. Very good!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
9,Quinoa1984,"a blast of Hollywood spectacle, with McQuarrie coming out technical guns blazing",9,30 July 2018,"Henry Cavill didn't save his mustache for Justice League for a simple reason: he knew he would need it for the much much MUCH better movie (and if nothing else the one with a million and a half times less CGI, or at least the kind we can notice).This (the best of the series, though it's been a while since Ghost Protocol so recency abounds) is a glorious, breathless and wonderfully directed encapsulation of the series - and the finest slam-bang twisty-screwy plotty spy movie of its kind since Skyfall - while delivering a compelling plot and believable (while surely at times ridiculous) action set pieces. I mean, yeah, the hype is real as a heart attack. I, as well as the audience, did find ourselves laughing at times at how preposterous it gets (and don't front, it does), but it was how you are on the cliche of the HOLY WTF roller coaster.It also doesn't act like the audience are *idiots* or at least gets smug about the ridiculous feats, which is the key difference between this and the Fast & Furious movies, as though McQuarrie and Cruise and everyone are in on it, but they're elbowing us in our seats as we watch like, ""hehe aint this great! Or, to put it another way, as my mom put it afterwards, ""the cinematography was like I got to be there and see sights!""Something else no one else I think will point out: how cool is it when we get Ving Rhames being good in a movie that's also really good? I wish he got to do more than this series, but it's a pleasure to get Rhames when we can (that isn't just like straight to video).",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
10,tavm,Mission: Impossible - Fallout is perhaps the best one yet in the series!,10,9 August 2018,"With the exception of the second one, I've seen all the other previous Mission: Impossible movies when they were playing in theatres. This one seems even more awesome than those others especially since, for once, most of the cast from the previous one is in this one too! And the villain is played by one who's more known as a hero-Henry Cavill, who usually plays Superman currently. Tom Cruise does all his stunts and it obviously shows as there's no CGI at all when his action scenes appear. Me and my movie theatre-working friend really enjoyed this one so on that note, we both highly recommend Mission: Impossible - Fallout!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
11,michaelRokeefe,Hoplessly one of the better of the franchise.,9,26 July 2021,"How is it that Tom Cruise can look so ageless and make his predictable stunts seem so effortless? The action stays flowing enough to overlook in spite of some of the supporting cast. The Cold War style plot helps make this movie better than most of its competition. Incredible scenery makes for blockbuster entertainment.Rounding out the cast: Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, Alec Baldwin, Vanessa Kirby, Sean Harris and Angela Bassett.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
12,sunwarrior13,Does Finally Tom Cruise Makes A Comeback With 'Superhero' Ethan Hunt?,1,7 January 2019,"When I wrote a review of Tom Cruise's ""American Made"", a lot of people particularly solid Tom Cruise fans gave me a thumbs down when I stated that his cold streak continues after his last two films from ""Jack Reacher:Never Go Back"", ""The Mummy"" for ""American Made"" is a film that is not right for him. Now,does he finally make a comeback in ""Mission:Impossible - Fallout""?Before we discuss this issue, let's discuss the movie. The film stars Tom Cruise together with Alec Baldwin,Henry Cavill and Ving Rhames. The story revolves around the Mission Impossible team headed by Ethan Hunt that has to figure out how to race against time as one of their mission went wrong.Writer-director Christopher Quarrie tries his best to make a great and entertaining story to allow Cruise to shine once more especially as he is close to getting 60 years of age in 3 years as this review was being written. It had a user-friendly plot particularly for people who love action movies and CGI effects. Added to that,it had great unbelievable stunts with Ethan Hunt jumping all tall buildings and into a helicopter like Superman. It allowed Cruise to shine with the stunts and action sequences despite the fact that it lacks realism.The film made a nice movie for Tom Cruise fans to enjoy and to allow Cruise to shine once more by using his charisma that made him a Hollywood megastar. Added to that, it shows that he is still no pushover as an action star and we get to see a new Ethan Hunt as a confused agent and a superhero that made many viewers entertained. As I have always stated, Cruise has to be in the right material and the director must make full use of what made him the biggest star of Hollywood from when he became movie star in Risky Business in 1983 and finally a global star in Top Gun in 1986.So to answer the question,does Tom Cruise finally make a comeback in Mission Impossible - Fallout? I CAN FINALLY SAY THAT YES, TOM CRUISE IS BACK AFTER THE COLD STREAK HE HAS EXPERIENCED IN HIS LAST THREE MOVIES DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT WAS A POOR AND UNREALISTIC MOVIE. It was obvious that they have made a mess of Mission Impossible series.But if you want better Mission Impossible, watch the original series and the revival series for they are a lot better despite being outdated in technology for it promotes team work compared to Tom Cruise MI franchise that promotes primarily Ethan Hunt alone as a superhero.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
13,bevo-13678,Tommy,10,21 June 2020,The best mission impossible yet. And there must be about 30 of them,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
14,CinemaSerf,Best since the first...,7,15 July 2020,"Now this is a much better outing for our IMF pals - much sharper pace and direction than the meandering ""Ghost Protocol"". This one sees ""Ethan"" with ""Luther"" (Ving Rhames) and the still frequently irritating Simon Pegg ""Benji"" having to track down some plutonium balls, after an earlier mission went a bit awry, before lunatic ecologist Sean Harris (""Solomon Lane"") commits an atrocity to end all atrocities in the name of creating a new world order! The first twenty minutes are poor; predictable and formulaic and I will admit to having started to write it off, Once Cavill (""August Walker"") joins the gang, however, and they start to search for the missing cores it becomes fast-moving, action-packed and enjoyable - with plenty of crosses and double-crosses. Rebecca Ferguson still always comes across the same, whomever she plays, but that works for this one and the team spirit really comes across. Sure, it isn't going to win a Booker for the writing, but it travels the world showing off some fine locations (many of which are actually left intact, afterwards!!) before heading to an exciting denouement with helicopters and Cruise's favourite mountain-top pinnacle combat. All good stuff.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
15,writers_reign,Bruise Cruise,7,10 August 2018,I don't watch this type of film as a rule so this is the first of what appear to be six Mission Impossibles that I've seen. I'm guessing that Tom Cruise isn't the only person who recurs and I assumed that Style would triumph over Substance so I didn't spend too much time attempting to figure out the good guys from the bad or even what was going on again factoring in double and triple crosses as par for the course. This left more or less only the action and punters can hardly claim to be short-changed in either hand-to-hand or chase sequences. Although I went to an early - 9.50 - screening and it opened seven days ago I was surprised that there were only seven punters including myself. It passed the time adequately but I wouldn't want to see it again.,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
16,zardoz-13,"Tops ""Rogue Nation"" By A Hair!",10,16 August 2018,"Clocking in at an impressive 147 minutes, the fifth ""Mission Impossible"" sequel code-named ""Fallout"" seems like almost too much of a good thing. As director Christopher McQuarrie's second outing as helmer-he called the shots on ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation,"" ""Fallout"" boasts more exhilarating, white-knuckled stunts than its predecessor--""Mission impossible: Rogue Nation!"" The catch here is Tom Cruise has done virtually all his stunts for real. Reportedly, the actor spent an entire year preparing himself for the HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) parachute jump. Indeed, he performed this stunt as well as four others without the use of either CGI or stunt doubles. Cruise careened through the crowded streets of Paris astraddle a motorcycle riding against traffic without a helmet, sprinted across rooftops in London, and flew a helicopter. The rooftop leap of faith is what cost him; he fractured his ankle and production shut down for eight weeks while he recuperated. Clearly, Cruise is an adrenaline junkie obsessed with making things appear as genuine as possible under closely supervised conditions. Presumably, the people who insured the headstrong actor for all these stunts must have been sweating bullets. Mind you, the negotiations that ensued just for all the location work in Paris, France, must have constituted a nightmare for local authorities, with McQuarrie and his cast and crew racing around the City of Lights as well as photographing it from the air. Movies like ""Fallout"" inevitably turn into travelogues with spectacular cinematography of all its exotic locales, ranging from Paris to London to Norway to New Zealand. Sure, if you haven't seen its predecessor ""Rogue Nation,"" you might be at a loss to appreciate the appearances not only of actress Rebecca Ferguson's character Ilsa Faust but also actor Sean Harris' villainous Solomon Lane wearing a beard. For the record, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Michelle Monaghan, and Alec Baldwyn reprise their roles from earlier installments. Despite its length, however, ""Fallout"" surpasses even the slickly-made ""Rogue Nation.""""Fallout"" opens with a startled Ethan Hunt awakening from a nightmare after an anonymous courier comes knocking at his safe house with a copy of Homer's Odyssey. In his nightmare, Hunt had dreamed he was marrying his ex-wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) again in an island paradise when he noticed that the minister is none other than the murderous Solomon Lane. After the courier departs, Hunt cracks the book which has been hollowed out for a tape-recording device and a video camera. Although Hunt and his team devastated 'The Syndicate' in ""Rogue Nation,"" survivors of that terrorist organization have reconstituted themselves as 'The Apostles' to complicate our hero's life. During his time-honored briefing (a trope in all IMF films), Hunt learns the Apostles plan to supply John Lark, the ultimate boogeyman, with three plutonium cores that can be used in nuclear devices. Abandoning his safe house in Belfast, Hunt heads for Berlin where Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg of ""Hot Fuzz"") and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames of ""Pulp Fiction"") join him to buy those cores. Predictably, everything goes sideways at the last second, but Hunt saves Luther's life after the villains hold him at gunpoint in exchange for those three cores. Hunt and Benji rush to Luther's aid just moments after they obtain the cores. While they are removing the slugs from Luther's bulletproof vest, the villains snatch the cores, and everybody in Washington, D.C., hates Hunt. Hunt and company capture an expert in nukes, Nils Debruuk (Kristoffer Joner of ""The Revenant""), who had been collaborating with the Apostles to construct portable nuclear weapons for those cores. They trick Debruuk into revealing Lark's whereabouts. Lark is scheduled to meet with a go-between in Paris, the notorious White Widow (Vanessa Kirby of ""The Crown"") and walk off with the goods. Hunt is prepared to plunge out of a CIA transport plane and intercept him, when CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett of ""Black Panther"") threatens to cancel the mission unless the IMF team take Special Activities Division operative August Walker (Henry Cavill of ""Justice League"") along to make sure Hunt doesn't screw up again. Sloan slams Hunt for saving one of his IMF colleagues at the expense of losing the cores. The problem with Hunt's plan at this point is nobody, including the White Widow, knows John Lark by sight. Hunt and Walker plummet into Paris via HALO and find themselves in trouble from the get-go. They tangle with somebody they believe is Lark, and wind up renovating the men's restroom. You'd have to go back to ""Terminator 2"" for a comparable clash. Impetuously, Hunt poses as Lark, and then learns he must kidnap his old adversary Solomon Lane from the French police before he can acquire the two remaining cores. The White Widow gives him one as a down payment. Little does our hero know he will come face-to-face with rogue MI6 Agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson of ""Hercules"") who plans to kill Lane, so MI6 will forgive her. Indeed, double and triple-crosses multiply in this rip-snorting saga that virtually defies synopsis with a plot so Byzantine that you almost need to crib notes to keep track of all its larger-than-life shenanigans! ""Annihilation"" lenser Rob Hardy should land an Oscar for his spectacular, picture-postcard cinematography. Truly, the world is all a stage for ""Mission Impossible: Fallout"" and Paris looks better than ever.Writer & director Christopher McQuarrie doesn't dawdle with ""Fallout"" any more than he did with ""Rogue Nation."" Marathon qualifies as an apt description of all the time that flies by in ""Fallout,"" and it amounts to a rollercoaster of a ride that never lets up, with a finale involving two helicopters smashing into one another. While it doesn't look realistic, the Paris lavatory brawl is a stunner! These two IMF films borrow a lot from the James Bond franchise, from the HALO dive to gadgetry, but they ignore romance. Like its polished predecessor, ""Mission Impossible: Fallout"" packs just as much punch as it does plot.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The franchise crossover you didn't know you wanted,9,5 August 2018,"Following a botched mission, the potential catastrophic loss of life leads to the CIA forcing one of their own upon IMF. Walker(Cavill, using his massive frame to be highly intimidating, letting loose as his Superman never does) is sent to keep an eye on, and if necessary take action against, Ethan(Cruise, not showing his age, ably diving deeper into the character's mind, which we haven't seen before), Benji(still amusing, vital) and Luther(Rhames, bringing up the past). Ilsa(Ferguson, remaining an enigma, as she should. if they make a 7th film, what they could do with her would be one of the main reasons I'd be excited about it. Not the only one, mind you) resurfaces. What is her goal? Who is she working for? Can she be trusted? Lane(Harris, even more sinister) may not be a free man(for now...), but his cause lives on in his followers, The Apostles. The only way to stop them is to find out the secret identity of their leader: John Lark.This keeps to an incredibly high pace. It does so with many extended, though not too long, action scenes(with several new incredible stunts, performed by Tom), and major plot twists, sometimes in short succession. I've seen the argument presented that by the end it doesn't make sense, and is overly difficult to follow, and I'm not sure I disagree. That's the only thing that takes away a point from my otherwise perfect rating for this. This is the first real sequel of this series, and it uses the history really well. A big retcon adds to the significant development of Hunt as a person. Meanwhile, you can watch this without knowing the other entries, it just won't have the same impact. This touches upon very real and serious concerns. Does the physics-defying, "" survive what you couldn't"" events diminish that? I don't think so, others do. Max(Kirby, imitating Redgrave beautifully) is the daughter of her namesake from the first movie, and is even more compelling than her(no easy feat), as well as given more to do. There is very moderate violence and brief strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys spy fiction. 9/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

RainMan vs. Superman easily could've been the pitch to the latest chapter in the indefatigable action/espionage film franchise with the ever unflappable and gung-ho Cruise (in total control) reprising his Ethan Hunt to stop a global threat - missing plutonium in the hands of a former foe loose and recklessly hell-bent on destroying the world as we know it and only having his demons stopping him, and a monkey wrench in the works with Cavill (well-cast in a shrewd casting touch) as a duplicitous assassin in the fold. Filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie - who also wrote the lean, mean screenplay - signs up for his second outing in the series and excels in keeping things dangerously break-neck in so many sequences its hard to catch-up while holding your breath from a hella-good fist-fight in a nightclub's men's room to a daredevil car/motorcycle chase to its hair-raising chopper cat-and-mouse climax in a literal, hum-dinger of a cliffhanger that you'll be checking your pulse as the adrenaline flows (helps to see it in all its amazing awe in IMAX). Cruise is literally death-defying in doing all his own stunt-work (no CGI for the most part) and a strong supporting cast to boot. One of the best action films ever and one of the year's best. Buckle up!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
19,neil-476,Great escapist action nonsense,9,27 July 2018,"After Machiavellian baddie Solomon Lane is captured in the previous movie, a group called The Apostles moves into the terrorist vacuum. The IMF screws up and three plutonium cores come into The Apostles hands. Recovering them might be tricky, especially as they are forced to work with an unsubtle CIA enforcer.This is a direct sequel to the previous film, with weasel-faced, nasal-voiced Sean Harris reprising the brilliant villain Solomon Lane. Rebecca Ferguson features again as compromised MI5 agent Ilsa, Ving Rhames , Alex Baldwin and Simon Pegg are IMF support, and Michelle Monaghan is there to be in jeopardy. Angela Bassett and Henry Cavill represent the CIA (Cavill's facial hair necessitating expensive CGI removal in Justic League reshoots), and Vanessa Kirby plays a pleasingly questionable mercenary intermediary.The story is involved - not difficult to understand, but a bit on the serpentine side. But it does provide a vehicle for some, as always, excellent action sequences. A motorcycle chase through Paris and a rooftop chase in London are stunningly choregraphed and photographed, but I felt that the climactic action sequence was a bit overbaked. And they led me up the garden path briefly, but no.You know whether you like this sort of movie or not. And, if you do, you're in for a treat with this one.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
20,AlsExGal,Somewhat forgettable action film,6,22 December 2018,"Settling into the sixth Mission Impossible movie, it occurred to me that I had forgotten the subtitle (Fallout), as well as the subtitle to the previous movie (Rogue Nation), and had forgotten most of that movie except Tom Cruise hanging on to a flying plane, and an elaborate scene where he has to get somewhere or deactivate something while running the risk of drowning.As it turns out, this movie is a bit more memorable. There's an elaborate, and very threatening fight in a bathroom near the beginning. There's also an elaborate chase involving helicopters over the Himalayas as a climax, complicated by the fact that Cruise can't simply kill the villain since he has to take the detonator he's carrying. Also there is an interesting, somewhat over elaborate car chase in Paris for the middle which is OK if not brilliant.Once again, the plot involves Ethan Hunt being accused, or framed of involvement in a terrorist conspiracy, and the only way he can clear his name involves giving the terrorists what they want. This plan goes badly wrong, and Hunt has to find a way to solve it. I know variations of this happened in movies 1 and 4, and if I cared enough about the plots, it may have happened in 2, 3 and 5. At least this time the government officials who criticize Hunt are even more horribly compromised than usual.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
21,ferguson-6,the cliffs of Kashmir,7,25 July 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. Welcome back Ethan Hunt, and the other members of IMF. This is the 6th film in the franchise born (not Bourne) from the classic TV series (1966-73) created by Bruce Geller (credited in each film). Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie returns for this companion piece to his 2015 MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE ROGUE NATION, as of course does mega-star Tom Cruise as the aforementioned Ethan Hunt.Hunt's team of Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) returns, as does really really bad guy Solomon Lane (a glowering Sean Hayes), and MI6 agent Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). New to the scene is Agent August Walker (Henry Cavill, MAN OF STEEL), a hulking hunk of a man who doesn't share Ethan's belief in brainy strategy. Speaking of strategy, I was a bit tricky in inviting a friend to the screening who is in the midst of a years long boycott of Alec Baldwin movies. Although I felt a fleeting twinge of guilt, I believe the payoff was such that it lessened the impact of deception. Also appearing are Angela Bassett as a CIA toughie, Michelle Monaghan, Wes Bentley, and Vanessa Kirby (""The Crown"") as White Widow.Most fans of this franchise have likely accepted that the stories are overly intricate - this one is unnecessarily jumbled - and they just enjoy the clamorous ride to an ending that typically has something to do with a bomb and saving the world. It's the action and stunts that drive ticket sales, and this one has the most extreme and over-the-top action sequences we've seen yet. Even though there is a familiarity to some, the stunts are still quite impressive; and yes, Mr. Cruise, now in his mid-50's, still performs his own stunts. This includes the leap between buildings where he actually suffered a broken ankle, shutting down production for a few months. The jump where he was injured is included in the film. And fear not, the Cruise Sprint is in full force on numerous occasions. Sadly, there is also a quick shot of a Ving Rhames jog - nothing but painful to watch.The film opens with a wedding day nightmare, but quickly moves to what the fans want - globetrotting, chase scenes, slick advanced technology and wacky stunts. The streets, bridges and landmarks of Paris are on full and spectacular display, while the chase scenes occur on foot, on motorcycle, in cars, and in helicopters. Crazy stunts include HALO jumping, rock climbing and dangling from an elevator shaft. There is a relentless brawl scene in a men's room where Hunt gets face planted into a porcelain sink and thrown through a wall ... and thanks to the magic of Hollywood, five minutes later, he has nary a scratch and looks as debonair as James Bond ever has. However, it's the final helicopter sequence through the mountains and cliffs of Kashmir that provide the signature moments of the film. Even with the nod to JURASSIC PARK, it's a breathtaking scene.Running nearly 2 ½ hours, this is the longest of the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE films, and Ethan Hunt remains, along with Maverick in TOP GUN (sequel filming now), the best fit for Tom Cruise the actor and celebrity. Unfortunately the same can't be said for Henry Cavill. He's blessed with extraordinary genes - just not the thespian types. Filled with double and triple and quad crossings, whether you can follow the story or not, only the most stoic would claim you will find this anything less than an adrenaline rush ... should you decide to accept. Plus, it still features one of the best theme songs ever - especially powerful with today's phenomenal theatre sound systems. Thanks Lalo Schifrin.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
22,bombersflyup,Walker: Hope is not a strategy. Ilsa: Oh you're new!,3,25 February 2019,"Mission Impossible Fallout is a film without fun or feeling, just action sequences.Henry Cavill as Walker's decent, but overall it's just nothingness. Such underutilized beauty as well. Why's this franchise still going?",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
23,FlashCallahan,Mission Impossible: Far out.....,9,26 July 2018,"Ethan Hunt and his team join forces with CIA agent August Walker to prevent a disaster of epic proportions. Arms dealer John Lark and a group of terrorists known as the Apostles plan to use plutonium cores for a nuclear attack. When the cores go missing, Ethan and his team find themselves in a desperate race against time to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.....Even though it's said whenever a movie from this franchise is released (maybe not MI:2), this really is the best MI thus far. And its not just because of the pretty amazing narrative, or some of the best set pieces in any action film for a long time, it's down to the man himself, Tom Cruise.As usual, he's also producer, does his own stunts, and does his obligatory running sequence, but during production, and throughout the film, it feels like he's trying to prove something. maybe it's to show the world that he still has his star power, or showing that he can do all this at his age, but whatever he's doing, he's done it right.Right from the get go, the film doesn't let up, and the sinister tension of being vulnerable and wanted is rife throughout the film, and gives it a strange sense of it feeling like a conspiracy film from the seventies.Cruise is amazing, and this proves that he is the main man in Hollywood, and little blips like The Mummy, will never taint his stardom. And it's good to see the rest of the cast being a little more fleshed out than previous outings, just having them share a little banter with Cruise to gather a few laughs. Pegg in particular, has a much more bigger role in this, and he's as perfect as ever.Even though the film is quite dark in places, there are still plenty of laughs to be had, especially when Hunt is chasing Walker in London.And Cavill, what a part he plays. After you get over the fact he is wearing the most expensive moustache in movie history. He's almost autonomous like in his role, and is a great addition to the film.My only gripe is that the main plot arc is given away to easy, especially when you consider that there is a double cross in the second act that just threw me into a state of awe for the writing.It does reference the other films a lot, the opening scene reminded me of the first film, and kind of gave that away, but other than these minor gripes, it's one of the most intelligent summer films to be released in a while.With other MI films, there was always a media sensation when it came to Cruise doing a 'big stunt'. And the reason why the media coverage on this was basically an ankle injury, it's because every single set piece in this usurps anything from previous films. From the HALO jump, to the amazing chase scene in France (that reminded me of The French Connection), to the breathtaking final act, Cruise has done the impossible, he's made the film of the summer, and the best of the franchise.A must see.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
24,phd_travel,Some good action but the story isn't that great,7,13 August 2018,"The motorcycle chase in Paris is exciting and the helicopter sequence in the Himalayas is memorable but the story isn't that good. Initially the story mission was clearly stated. But half way through the twist that Superman is the villain is ludicrous. As if the CIA would have put such a bad guy there. 
Tom Cruise is well preserved and looks like he does some of his own stunts. And he is secure enough to share the screen with Superman. Vanessa Kirby from the Crown is interesting to watch as the broker. 
Don't get the reaction to this movie as being such a great action movie. It's not even the best MI movie.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
25,gradyharp,'What's done is done when we say it's done.',10,10 December 2018,"Yes, everyone knows and has probably seen at least one (if not all) of the MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE films and Tom Cruise remains in his signature role. This episode was written by Bruce Geller and director Christopher McQuarrie and not only is it the most interesting and well cast of the series, it also feels entirely fresh.A brief overview - Two years after Ethan Hunt Tom Cruise) had successfully captured Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the remnants of the Syndicate have reformed into another organization called the Apostles. Under the leadership of a mysterious fundamentalist known only as John Lark, the organization is planning on acquiring three plutonium cores. Ethan and his team (Luther - Ving Rhames, Benji - Simon Pegg) are sent to Berlin to intercept them, but the mission fails when Ethan saves Luther and the Apostles escape with the plutonium. With CIA agent August Walker (the very well cast Henry Cavill) joining the team, Ethan and his allies must now find the plutonium cores before it's too late. Along with these characters are the very important roles by Angela Bassett, Vanessa Kirby, Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan as well as Wes Bentley, Alex Baldwin, Kristoffer Joner, and even Wolf Blitzer playing himself.The tension is high, the scenery is spectacular, the stunts are breathtaking, the musical score by Lorne Balfe enhances every moment, and the cinematography by Rob Hard is spectacular.This is a long film that speeds by like lightening - and brightens up the current run of competitors with brilliance.

26,mm-39,Run of the mill!,6,31 July 2018,"Run of the mill for Mission Impossible. If you compare Fallout to the last Mission Impossible the newest installment pales to a great episode. Compare Fallout to the first Mission Impossible the series has improved from the original episode. Fallout falls somewhere in the middle. What worked: Well acted, and directed. Fallout's story has a fast pace which gives the viewer an adrenaline rush! Cruise, Baldwin, and Cavill have strong acting performances. There are sky diving, car chases, and a chopper chase which gives the audience action movie experience. What did not work: Rhames looked tired with the role; Unless that was Rhames goal. There was no Renner, which gave a missing dynamic to the Cruise/Renner clash of the last film. The switch-a roos I saw all of the plot twists coming. The two to three stories did not work out this time. The side love interest bogged down the main story, and the plot twist was too projected, which took the shock factor out of Fallout. If Fallout was the first episode I would say great movie, but expecting more Fallout slides into the middle. Fallout is six stars out of ten.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
27,deloudelouvain,"Certainly not the best one, by far not.",5,22 November 2018,"When I look at the ratings it seems this is the best movie from the Mission Impossible series, but after watching it I have to conclude the opposite. We all know the ""mission"" will be almost ""impossible"" in every of these movies, and that they always will solve the mission in the end, so we are familiar with the exaggeration and drama in Mission Impossible. It doesn't matter, because everybody watches this kind of movie for the action scenes and a bit of a credible story. And the problem with Fallout is that a big part of the story doesn't make any sense, and so it becomes more irritating than entertaining to watch. There are too much twists and turns, but not only are there too much of, but they are also very predictable so there is never really a surprise element. The action scenes were nothing special either, at least not for this kind of movies, and sometimes they even looked poor. To me this one was one of the worst Mission Impossible.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
28,Mr-Fusion,Series shows no signs of decline; thrills abound,8,22 August 2018,"A high point of the Summer, and I'm grateful to have seen this on the big screen. As an action movie, ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is downright savage. From the chase scenes to that brutal bathroom fight, right down to the ever-heightening stakes, it just seems to build and build. If it's not a tense dialogue scene, then it's probably Tom Cruise defying age yet again. The icing on this cake is that the movie never gets too big to forget the series' rubber-mask espionage. Christopher McQuarrie deserves credit for trying to humanize the character of Ethan Hunt in this film. For once, he's not just a skin for Tom Cruise to slip into and do stunts, but an actual person. There's an unexpected heart to this movie. But there's only so much room for touchy-feely before it's back to the endorphin rush. And Cruise deserves ample credit for this. Sure, Hunt's nigh-indestructible - more super than spy - but the star throws himself into this role. There he is, doing the majority of his stunts like a madman; out to prove he isn't too old for this sh**. Youthful appearance aside, he clearly bathes in the blood of the innocent. Regardless, this movie proves that Cruise is the consummate entertainer in Hollywood, delivering on his promise of thrills and death-defying lunacy. I think that's why this has become one of the more reliable franchises, and I can only hope he keeps it going. If only to outdo that helicopter fight scene. Sweet Jesus!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
29,siderite,Mission bore me to death,5,7 October 2018,"Why is Simon Pegg in this movie? He has 5 lines and they're not funny. Why is Angela Bassett in this? She has 5 lines and they are boring. Why is Alex Baldwin in this? He has 5 lines and then he dies. This is a paint by numbers film that makes no actual sense. The only good thing about is is Henry Cavill, and since he is having a sort of supporting role, this means the rest of the movie is crap. The action sequences are OK, but if you wanted action sequences only you would watch some Indonesian film. Poor Tom Cruise is probably going through his Alien phase ""Kill... me...!"" right now, because he probably has a lifetime contract to play this idiotic Ethan Hunt character. Vanessa Kirby is super cute and she has more than 5 lines... but that's about it. Poor movie, impossibly stupid script, good action sequences, wasted actors.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

No Kidding, this Action-Spy affair offers spectacular Action from the word go. Be it the hand-to-hand combat, or mesmeric car chases or even helicopters flying up and above, this film has it all. I was left awe-struck & felt richly rewarded all through the film. Clearly, 'Fallout' has taken the action level way up & hence, only the MI Series have to top themselves, here-on.Writer-Director Christopher McQuarrie's motive is simple: Leave the Action buffs overwhelmed. And he does! While his Screenplay moves on a fast-pace, despite its wafter-thin plot, its the action here that's the mainstay of the enterprise. McQuarrie's Direction is an Action-Packed dream, where its bad-ass leading-man races, chases, flies & bashes up the baddies, with much glory. A special mention & respect for the extraordinary Action-Sequences, that have been envisioned, choreographed & executed, astonishingly. Each & Every punch is effective to the core! Clearly, the stunts & the aggression are the soul of the film. Hats Off!The Cinematography by Rob Hardy captures all the action & carnage to stupendous effect. Eddie Hamilton's Editing is razor-crisp. Art & Costume Design are efficient. Lorne Balfe's Score is superb. Performance-Wise: Tom Cruise roars as Ethan Hunt! The 56-year old Superstar oozes energy & charisma from start to end. Its a delight to watch him take on the bad-guys once again & give them their desserts. Ving Rhames & Simon Pegg are lovable, yet again. Rebecca Ferguson does a stellar job. Sean Harris continues to be a strong, conniving villain. Henry Cavill is fair. Alec Baldwin & Angela Bassett make brief, but arresting appearances. Vanessa Kirby is first-rate. Michelle Monaghan is perfect. Others lend support.On the whole, 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' is an Action Extravaganza! It has Blockbuster written all over it! Grab a ticket now!

31,DKosty123,Cruise Impossible Hit Rocks And Breaks Leg,5,17 July 2020,"If all you want is action action action, this movie is for you. When Mission Impossible was created, that is not what it was about. The leader of IMF was the guy who put together a team of specialists to perform an impossible mission. There was a cerebral element to the plot.While Ethan (Cruise) has a team here, he is not the leader. He is the stunt executor whose in charge of getting the stuffings knocked out of everyone.
Alec Baldwin shows up as a sort of pseudo leader but he seems to have some lines that were from rejected Match Game scripts. Then the script has mercy and silences him. His escape works better than the rest of the script.It appears we have the nuke bombs with timers but despite having 3 women, none of them match up with Bond's Octopussy. This film is an action high, but it is not a concept high. It's kind of like giving the IMF force some Crystal Meth and then overdoses of action to boost Ethans ego so he can climb the next rope, stop the next fuse, make scrambled eggs by breaking the shell and throwing away the egg.I like action, and I like comic strips. That does not mean I want them put together without some kind of idea about how they go there. I guess if you like Cruise, you like this saga. Otherwise at almost 3 hours, yawns are in order. It's hard to connect with most of the characters in this, and the situations just seem contrived to make the mission look more impossible. Nothing like destroying the original concept and making the IMF look like any other action film whose leader is the opposite of the original cerebral Barney. Would you believe Ethan is now Barney Fife? Looks like it to me.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
32,lasttimeisaw,The franchise categorically lives and dies with Tom Cruise's star charisma and undimmed spirit of pushing the envelop,8,30 July 2018,"Hail to the return of the death-defying IMF (Impossible Missions Force) agent Ethan Hunt, and its ageism-defying star Tom Cruise in the sixth installment of this surprisingly long-running franchise, FALLOUT follows the aftermath of ROGUE NATION, both directed by Christopher McQuarrie, when three table-top plutonium cores are fallen into the evil hands of a terrorist group called the Apostles, reorganized by the remnants the Syndicate after their head Solomon Lane (Harris) is apprehended in the end of the fifth chapter, naturally, Hunt and co. must take it on to themselves to face their old nemesis and a mole shadowing Hunt at close range.The plot is customarily self-complicated and elliptical in elucidating the cloak-and-dagger development, for one thing, it is rather elusive about how and when Lane and his mustachioed accomplice lay their hands on the plutonium cores, or does Lane have a death wish to stay behind when the nuclear bombs are activated? Reading its synopsis on Wikipedia doesn't help, a compulsive second viewing? nice try! That said, FALLOUT unequivocally denotes the highest standard of the spy genre filmmaking, opposite to the limitless boundary of superhero fantasies, as the franchise has been pushing the envelope ever since its genesis. Here, starting with the much plugged HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) stunt performed by Cruise and the new recruit, Henry Cavill, man of steel himself (visibly relishes his not-so-well-kept villainous about-face and is equally mettlesome in tackling high-wire stunt work), FALLOUT cleverly downplays gizmo novelty and instead regales audience with invigorating physical fisticuffs, vehicle barreling thrills and chills, unthinkable airborne jeopardy and of course, Ethan running and leaping from building to building, a là James Bond, only more relentless and awe-inspiring. Indeed, FALLOUT does set up a formidable exemplar for the upcoming Bond 25, and throws down the heavy gauntlet to Daniel Craig, 6 years junior to Mr. Cruise, how can you top that Mr. Bond? Nevertheless, if MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE intends to elongate this money spinner's life span like its more esteemed British counterpart, there is a catch, because up to this point, the franchise categorically lives and dies with Cruise, whose star charisma and undimmed spirit is audience's main attraction and to achieve that, no matter how much materialistic incentive is behind the motive, is a miracle per se in this day and age. Also notably, McQuarrie wisely amps up Ethan's own characterization arc, as if for the first time, a viewer can limpidly see through him among those action-packed commotions, saliently, sacrificing innocent individual for the greater good is not above him, and he does care for his teammates and those who are close to him, tries his best to keep them out of harm's way, an unpremeditated reconnection with ex-wife Julia (Monaghan) transpires harmoniously in tandem with the tacit rapport between Ethan and fellow ass-kicker agent Ilsa Faust (Ferguson, slightly underutilized here than her jaw-dropping entrance in ROGUE NATION), there is chemistry flickering, but both dare not to make it personal, a love triangle seems to be in the pipeline and both women are sensible enough to detect that in their casual interaction, oops, the plot thickens... and needless to say we will pony up for the next adventure when it comes, as long as Ethan and his team can continue upping the ante.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

What adds suspense and unpredictability to the story is when Ethan and his team are put to the test as they fail to initially stop the Apostles from getting the plutonium, leaving the credibility of their team in doubt.

35,thesar-2,Fell Right into Line,9,29 July 2018,"Half way through Mission: Impossible - Fallout, I began envisioning my review beginning with: ""Just for continuity's sake, this is the best Mission yet.""Then, the movie continued and it DID end up being the best Mission yet and I was most pleased. I like to proclaim the Mission: Impossible series is the only movie franchise in history that gets progressively better with each installment and gosh-dang it, they DID IT AGAIN.And no, I'm not a child or adult who doesn't see many movies, so in both cases, their personal favorite is the one most recently in their mind. (i.e. ""Toy Story is my favorite movie!""...couple of years later...""Toy Story 2 is my favorite Toy Story movie!""...and...""Toy Story 3 is my favorite Toy Story movie ever!"") No, I actually mean it.I didn't even need to do the M:I 1-5 marathon I did this week beginning Monday with Mission: Impossible and through Friday with Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation to remember. I know they all got better every time. And this incredible movie, part 6: the best of the bunch.While most of the franchise was sometimes silly, sometimes just for show and stunts and laughs, this one seemed the most adult. The most realistic. Sure, there are still scenes that just couldn't happen, or probably the odds just would be astronomical, but for the most part, I felt this was by-far the most sincere spy/action film to date in the series.By now, you should have seen all the previous five movies to really enjoy this one, though not 100% a requirement. Events and a ton of characters from ALL of the first five films are brought up here, most specifically #s 3-5. So, before you see this, it's a great idea to see all adventures first. Can't hurt as they're all good to excellent anyways.Ethan Hunt, still haunted by some of his choices in his espionage career, makes a fairly big decision early on here and sets a chain of events off to an exciting and nail-biting, grab your partner's arm until it's black and blue, finale. Literally, I don't want to give away anything that happens as it's best to go in cold. Like that Klingon revenge proverb. (Don't even watch the trailer as it DOES give away too much.)I will say this: I loved the heart, the depth of the characters, the action, the acting, intrigue, settings, dialogue, jokes and most of all TWISTS. My father went with me and he guessed a few things, but not all. I only guessed one twist, but for the most part I was highly entertained on allowing the movie constantly surprise me. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in years.I'm just thoroughly impressed with how they can continue to improve on their product, and even make these movies in record time - compared to how far the first several were spread out - AND still make total quality and excellent entertainment. I CANNOT wait to see this again and buy it on blu to add it to the rest of my collection.Cannot recommend this movie (and the whole brand) enough. Watch the first five and then see this. Or just watch this. At least, then it'll make you scream for more.***Final thoughts: Here's how the first 5 faired for me during my Mission: Impossible marathon this week:I - was good and better with age, but not without so many flaws.
II - Better, but not where the series needed to be, yet. At least, Tom Cruise's hair looked great!
III - Fantastic and the absolute perfect blend of spy & action. Plus, had the series best villain.
Ghost Protocol: Definitely in my top 5 favorite action movies of all time and contained the very best action sequence/scene in history: from the Building climb to the end of the haboob. 
Rogue Nation: Unbelievably better than GP (IV) which seemed, well, IMPOSSIBLE to beat. Better cast, funnier lines, better villain, great action and high on intrigue. Loved the character depth and both Rebecca Ferguson and Sean Harris oh so much.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

37,Lejink,Impossibly good,8,26 August 2018,"I was glad to watch this summer blockbuster in the iMax format it deserves. Raising the bar not only for its own franchise but for action movies in general it's a real adrenaline rush as it sets its big, and I do mean big, set-pieces in firstly two familiar locations, Paris and London, before climaxing in an extended sequence in Kashmir where we basically witness a chicken run between two fully airborne helicopters.There are brief moments of scene-setting, plot progressing calm but don't dwell on these too much as before you can cogitate the motivations and machinations of the baddies, you're hurtled into the next white knuckle ride segment. So don't look for much in the way of character development or psychological insight, just strap in and watch the IMF team race to stop a planned nuclear explosion by the skin of the skin of their teeth.The same team as finished the last mission re-assemble here with Tom Cruise as leader Ethan Hunt, Simon Pegg's Benji and Ving Rhames' Luther fairly soon re-joined by Rebecca Ferguson's Black Widow Ilsa and forcibly augmented by Henry Cavill's CIA Inside operative Walker. Pegg and Rhames as before provide the light relief and pathos, Ferguson the female all-action counterpoint to Hunt's daredevil persona.The trick of course to making a film like this still work six movies in is to ramp up those amazing stunt sequences, from a near-fatal double sky-dive over Paris, a brutal punch-up in a toilet, car and motor cycle chase also in Paris, an extended pursuit across the London skyline, yes including that scene where Cruise breaks his ankle on one roof-leap too far and culminating in the duelling 'copters scene at the end and a to-the-death final fist-fight on a sheer rock face about a million feet up.I still appreciated the nods to the classic TV series from which it first sprang, most obviously the use of a not-too-different version of the classic theme tune, the pre-highlights reel and ""Your mission, should you decide to accept it"" prologue even as it's obvious that from there it's the original show on super-steroids.Anyway, it was a blast of a way to spend a Saturday afternoon and left you at the end wondering just how Cruise and his creative team could top this next time out.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
38,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Every prior entry in the series has raised the bar in terms of action. This might've just launched it into the stratosphere.,9,29 July 2018,"The story in 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018)' is messy, unfocused and, at times, even quite confusing. It isn't bad by any means, however, especially considering production began before a script was even written (just a thirty-three page outline). It does actually manage to pull the wool over your eyes successfully a couple of times, delighting in its ability to play its audience like a fiddle. Essentially, it only really serves as a vehicle for the cast and crew to up the ante in terms of stunt-driven action set-pieces. It provides a phenomenally entertaining, edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride that somehow features the absolute best fights, chases (car, bike, on-foot and otherwise) and sequences of general Tom Cruise craziness of the series, scenes which all also reach perhaps the highest heights in recent cinematic memory. While every prior 'Mission: Impossible' film has raised the bar in terms of action, this one might just have catapulted it into the stratosphere, setting a precedent not just for its own franchise but for its whole genre. The sheer excitement of it all is difficult to express. You'll leave with a genuine buzz, the kind that makes you long to watch it, and even the entire series, immediately all over again. The absolute practicality of the piece really is mind-boggling. It's actually difficult to comprehend, the antidote to the washed-out CGI blockbusters we're battered with too often nowadays. It adds a palpability to the picture that makes every moment entirely believable and utterly compelling. Each dangerous beat is heightened by the fact that our star really is doing the things he claims to do. Really, it's the superb suspense that makes the movie work as well as it does, though. There's always something to care about, even when the plot takes a turn into slightly sourly familiar territory, and it's always in jeopardy, be it from maybe the highest directly villainous stakes of the franchise (which aren't cartoony at all this time) or from the more personal and character-driven emotional ones. This tension is constantly present, making the flick probably the darkest of the lot, but never becomes overwhelming, allowing the brief interjections of levity to do their job all the better. Overall, this is supreme, high-octane entertainment. Not only is it perhaps the best of the series (just about tied with the first and fifth entries, I'd say), it's one of the best action films in the past twenty years. I mean, from a purely action stand-point, it's going to be tough to beat. It isn't often that I wince along with a movie, invested in the literal survival of a character in a set-piece (or ten). That kind of engagement is very rare (helped by the ever-tightening bond between character and actor) and key to the nail-biting, jaw-dropping enjoyment of this fantastic film. 9/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
39,bowmanblue,"Nothing new, but is that so bad?",7,30 May 2019,"I remember watching the first 'Mission Impossible' film back in the mid-nineties. No, I won't claim to understand every single plot point in the film, but when the stunts were so high-octane, I simply put it down to some evil supervillain trying to take over the world somehow and a pumped-up Tom Cruise and co out to stop them.Now I'm older (and so is Tom Cruise, although he seems to be aging a damn sight better than me!) and therefore I should be able to get my head round the (only slightly less complicated!) plots. Sadly, I can't. Besides the fact that there's another supervillain (or society - the 'MI' films tend to alternate between the two threats) threatening the world with another menace (this time the 'tried and tested' trope of 'stolen nukes') and so Tom and co must spring into action.Yes, there's more to it than that. It is - after all - a 'spy movie' therefore you have to expect all the clichés that come with the genre. You have the Government officials who want to shut down Tom's team, some doublecrosses thrown in here and there and all the obvious action. And, yes, there's plenty of action.Tom Cruise makes it well-known that he does all his own (or is it at least 'most?') of his stunts and there are some pretty impressive ones here. If you believe the online trivia for this film, he had to train for a year to do one such action set-piece. There's also a pretty high-octane motorbike chase through the streets of Paris. However, despite saying that Cruise does most of his stunts, I couldn't help but feel that some of the shots looked a little 'CGI' (feel free to correct me if you can find proof otherwise).Although 'Fallout' is - as usual - Tom Cruise's 'baby' and, seeing as the entire franchise has lay heavily on his megastar shoulders, this one is no different. But, as is now common in the series, familiar faces such as Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are also on board in order to lend a hand where necessary. The real newcomer to the show is none other than 'Superman' himself, Henry Cavill, who can certainly rival Cruise when it comes to kicking people's heads in and I think he's a welcome addition to the film and adds something that the previous instalments haven't had.Basically, if you like the recent 'MI' films (at least from 'Part III' onwards) then you'll like this. If you're a fan of either Cruise or Cavill then it's definitely worth a watch. In a world where action films are 'uber-serious' and everything is highly realistic, it's nice to see one that's totally over-the-top in terms of its stunts, action and - of course - those 'perfect fit' full face masks guaranteed to fool any baddie they need to. It's a great popcorn movie where you don't really need to understand every last betrayal to have fun.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
40,dromasca,a real fallout,4,30 July 2018,"I know that I am the only one to blame. Guilty pleasures are often punished and enjoying action movies now and than is one of those. I also should know that in the first week on screens it's mostly the hardcore fans running to see the film and writing viewer comments on IMDB, so the current stellar grade does not really mean that 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' (8.5 right now) is a better film than 'Citizen Kane' (8.4). I took the risk of being among the early viewers and I was punished. The quality level of the installments of the M:I series is on a decreasing curve, and this is continuing with this latest issue in the series. My opinion, of course.I am never judging an action movie with the same criteria as I am judging a drama, a comedy, or an art film. Yet, there are some elements that I look for in any film - a story that has logic and catches my interest, and characters that I care about. None of them is present in this film co-written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie whom Tom Cruise trusted with writing and directing some of his latest movies. The story of the rogue terrorists threatening to blow up the planet or at least half of it is placed as many of the latest movies in the genre in an aseptic and non-politic environment with non-identifiable bad guys, so that nobody is bothered and the film can be sold in as many markets as possible. The heroes destroy half of Paris and a quarter of London killing scores of policemen and innocent by-standers with no consequences. The main hero has a couple of Ethan-girls to care about and one more who seems to care for him, but the characters seem to be frozen or maybe wearing some of those rubber masks that the heroes are experts in.Yes, there are good and well paced and choreographed action scenes, but their gathering of coincidences makes them non-credible. The 3D capabilities are well used, but there is nothing that we haven't seen yet. Actually this M:I6 looks more like a 3D James Bond film, without the charm of Bond. There is a change of guard in managing Ethan Hunts activities, and Angela Bassett seems to replace Alec Baldwin who probably had enough and decided to jump wagon. Frankly speaking, I am not sure that I want to see M:I7 after this disappointing M:I6. Tom Cruise is 56 years now, and cannot pretend being 35 or 40 years old forever. He seems to enjoy the narcissistic exercises that the movies he plays in for the last ten years, but how long can these last. If I am not mistaken his last non-action role was in Valkyrie in 2008. On the other side, if he has fun and viewers have fun watching him, who am I to tell him what to do? I can only decide to not watch his next movies.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
41,ThomasDrufke,One of the Best Action Films of All Time.,10,2 August 2018,"The Mission franchise is an interesting one. It's spanned over 20 years, has only had two actors appear in every film, has never fully embraced continuity, and has undoubtedly gone through many production issues. Alas, it's also one of the greatest franchises because it has defied what it means to impress audience with action and it keeps getting better and better with every film. Although admittedly, I'm not exactly sure how it can get any better from here. I saw this movie early, and instantly felt it was one of the best action movies of all time, but I also knew I needed to see it at least one more time before I really did give it that title. Well, I've seen the film 4 times now and each time further cemented my feelings. Everything from the Halo jump, to the middle act (which is essentially one long chase sequence), to the callbacks, to the Helicopter scene, to Henry Cavill's unnecessary but totally bada** facial hair. Mission: Impossible Fallout is an unbelievable ride that simply never lets up. Even in its quiet moments, it has touching dialogue that makes the action more weighted. Even in my 4 viewings, I've never been bored, and I can't wait to see it again. It also surprisingly had a great amount of emotional stakes, something the serious didn't really have since Mission 3. There are a few moments with Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, and Michelle Monaghan that really hit me emotionally, and I never would have expected that from this series. It has the best antagonist(s) since Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and maybe even better, the action is easily the most impressive in years (probably since Fury Road), and the actors have never been better. If there's going to be another one, then take your time and do it right, because this could very well be the best conclusion possible for the series. Thank you to Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie for making this an instant classic. 10/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
42,gbill-74877,Pretty standard,6,21 September 2018,"Pretty standard stuff. High octane action, great shots on location, and Tom Cruise sprinting (in any of his films dating back to the 80's, does he ever not do this?). Predictable plot twists, not much originality, and in the desire to pack in as much as possible, excessively long at two and a half hours. The improbable (dare I say impossible?) sequence with the fifteen minute countdown seemed to last a half hour at least. I liked how Cruise (ageless at 56) sometimes gets knocked down or fails in this one, and the stunning shots in Kashmir. It's a summer blockbuster that filmgoers lapped up like ice cream, and it's entertaining enough as it trots out all the usual tropes. I do wish the mentality was 'less is more' instead of 'more is better', and that there was as much creativity in the story as there was in the stunts. I'm clearly in the minority though.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
43,ericstevenson,They just keep getting better,9,29 July 2018,"I went into this movie not knowing how long it was. I really didn't know that it would be this long, although sequels do escalate. I believe I've seen all of the other movies. I bet most people aren't even aware it was based on a TV show. Anyway, the plot is that Ethan is trying to get plutonium away from a group of criminals known as the Apostles. Their plan is to unleash a virus that will kill a third of the world's population as it takes place between India and China.I'm glad I was able to remember some of the characters. We all get great performances from Simon Pegg, Tom Cruise, and Alec Baldwin. I guess it probably could have used some more action. It's mostly because it seems to go on a little too long. What matters is that the acting is great and as much as people might make fun of Tom Cruise for his beliefs, I will admit he's a good actor. I personally find ""Rogue Nation"" to be the best in the whole series. ***1/2",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Returning members Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin are all spectacular and round out the story immensely well, and newcomer Henry Cavill is a very welcome addition, who's character is interesting, unique and always keeps you wondering.Action packed, funny and entertaining, everything you would want in a Mission: Impossible movie. Though I would not call it the best in the series, Fallout stands on its own, and fans of these movies will not be disappointed.

The franchise that began with shallow action movies, from the fourth installment turns into a spy action thriller and it is getting better and better, surpassing many of the cult Bond movies. The story is complex, and from the very beginning strings excellent plot twists which, with the superbly-directed non-stop breath-taking action, won't let your focus slip for a moment. I've never had a high opinion of Tom Cruise's acting abilities, but for these twenty years he has become the trademark face of the franchise and, at this point, hardly anyone could replace him. In particular, he must be acknowledged for shooting all of his stunts personally, however difficult and dangerous they were. The rest of the cast is awesome. Henry Cavill plays the role of a cold-blooded assassin. Ving Rhames brings the soul into the franchise and, in tandem with the charismatic Simon Pegg, even some extent of comic relief. The trio of ""Bond girls"" - Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, and Michelle Monaghan - by their very appearance makes you forget about the quality of the acting, though, if you were able to pay attention to it, you would certainly not be disappointed. And in the end, in slightly lesser roles, big names such as Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett.

Unlike most movie critics, apparently they must have been hypnotized by Tom Cruise's cult-like personal life connections. This latest version of Mission Impossible resembles some of the last Roger Moore's depiction as James Bond. And in some ways, this movie script might have been better served with Daniel Craig's character as James Bond. The action and humor sequences have almost become parodies of themselves. The movie plot is also so manipulated with fantastical unlikely coincidental events that the plot becomes an obvious stitched together strands of action shots put together along with the requisite death of an important character and the attempts at serious human emotional bonding that have been much better portrayed elsewhere, that even being on television. See Person of Interest (2011-2016) series with Jim Caviezel. Even Hitman: Agent 47 (2015) had an even more convincing and necessarily even tighter, explosive beginning action sequence. Knowing this is a Mission Impossible movie, the predictable twist in the first half of the movie seems lame. The bad guys seem too obvious too.

53,ironhorse_iv,Mission Impossible: Fall Out is worth hunting for! It's a fine movie.,8,25 October 2018,"While, some critics & fans said, this sixth film in the film series was the best movie yet. I have to disagree. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to understand, why. Read further to find out. Loosely based on the 1960's television series of the same name, the spy genre film directed by Christopher McQuarrie has once again, disappoint me in one department. The story. The script wasn't even finished, when they started with production. Because of that, the movie relies too much on bringing back so many familiar faces and making callbacks to earlier films that the motion picture's plot didn't really stand out, much. It built on the same foundation as the five preceding films were, meaning there will be a lot of same repetitive somewhat wearisome tropes like Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) getting framed, while trying to take down some vague criminal arm dealer organization from launching nuclear weapons upon the world like another terrorist group did in 2011's film, 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol'. The story felt a little too generic to the point that the disavowed parts were self-aware lampshade in the film, by the deliberately trying to sabotage predictable wolf in sheep clothing villain. The movie was really missing the great twist and turns of the previous films. Every bait and switch was pretty much foreseeable. Even some of the action scenes like Ethan using his rock climbing skills, going on a motorcycle chase and disabling a helicopter felt like recreated reruns at times. Don't get me wrong, the set pieces still pack a punch, but the film seems to acknowledge that we've see these things before. The movie only tries to improve upon recycled safe tropes, rather than taking some climatic risk. It didn't give us, much of anything new. Regardless of the tiresome story; seeing Cruise perform death defying dangerous stunts in exotic locations around the world is entertaining and sheer adrenaline fuel. Some of the action set pieces were impressive, particularly in the brutal well-choreographed bathroom brawl with fight performer Liang Yang & the complex Parisian roof top jump scene where Cruise really did break his ankle on a stunt. However, I doubt any of them will be as memorable as the franchise's biggest past standout moments, such as Ethan hanging on a wire during CIA vault break in from the first movie or the agent climbing the Burj Khalifa in 'Ghost Protocol' or even him clinging to the side of an ascending cargo plane; which happen in 2015's 'Rogue Nation'. Regardless, fight coordinator Wolfgang Stegemann and stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood did a hell of a job, here. I just wish, McQuarrie didn't make up so many action sequences on the fly that Tom wanted to do; rather than planning it all out. It create a lot of action scenes having to be cut; due to pacing issues, like the helicopter about to hit a truck sequence, the assassins at the party scene and most of all, the car crash, in which the nuclear scientist was captured. Having them, cut left a lot of unanswered questions. Even some of the action moment left in the film doesn't even add up. It left a lot of jarring plot holes, like what was the whole point of the HALO jump, if anybody like can walk in, through the front door like Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). Also, isn't it kinda weird to see barely any men in a very clean loo area during a crowded high class party? How about the agency getting realistic visual effects done in a short period of time for the news skit!? Then again, these might seem like nitpicks, but it really did take me out of the movie at times; in the same way, the heavy exposition intro dump in the beginning, did. I get it, you have to rewatch the previous movie to get, what's happen, here. Despite that, I found the performances in the film to be, very good. Despite, what's going on, in his personal life, I have to say; Cruise as Ethan seem a good guy to hang around. I love the use of inner struggle within Hunt about being a Good Samaritan. Seeing Ethan repeatedly goes the extra mile to save the lives of innocent individuals, while sacrificing his personal life & dealing with the horrible consequences for failure, make him into a tragic emotionally tortured hero. Sean Harris as Solomon Lane is the closest this franchise has to a traditional compelling villain. His delivery is cold and eerily. Unfortunately, Lane is rarely used much in this film besides as a MacGuffin. As for Henry Cavill's character, August Walker. He has proven as formidable physical foe/friend to Ethan, during the action scene, but his character and performance are fairly wooden, behind his grizzled hammer like appearance. I kinda wish, Jeremy Renner's character, Agent William Brandt from the previous movie was in this role. It would make the film, a little more shocking. Plus, it would solve the problems from mustache gate scandal with 2017's film 'Justice League', a lot better. Sadly, Renner couldn't return for this film as he was filming another movie. As for the rest of the supporting cast: Simon Pegg, Alec Baldwin & Ving Rhames were alright. Ferguson was also decent in this movie, even her character doesn't do much until the end. It's weird to think, that the actress was seven months pregnant while filming this. That impressive that she got through this film. As for the rest of the female performers, like Vanessa Kirby, Michelle Monaghan, and Angela Bassett, much more screen time was desired to see if they were worth having in this flick. Overall: This motion picture offers quite a thrilling ride. While, the film not as good as the previous films. It's impossible to think of good reasons why not to watch this movie. It's still worth lighting up the fuse & see what blows up. This film is highly enjoyable.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

TN.,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
55,The-Sarkologist,More Tom Cruise Action,6,5 August 2018,"Opps, it looks like that having missed the fifth film in the franchise I found myself caught up in what felt like the middle of the series. Then again, of the six movies that have been released so far I have only seen three of them, which means that there are probably a few things that I sort of don't get, such as this guy Solomon Ley. A part of me was a little confused at first because I remembered seeing one where Cruise is running around the Burg Kalifa, and I wasn't sure whether it was Ghost Protocol or Rogue Nation. Well, it turned out that it was Ghost Protocol, and because I didn't think all that much of that one, I sort of let Rogue Nation pass me by.
 Well, I guess that was a little mistake on my part, until I realised that films should at least try to stand on their own. If they are bringing too much in from previous films, then we end up with audiences that are way too lost to know what is going on, not that actually knowing what is going on really means anything when it comes to a Mission Impossible movie. Honestly, we can simply replace Solomon Lew with 'generic bad guy' and the syndicate with 'generic bad guy's organisation' and it really doesn't matter all that much.
 Not quite, because that was the last film, and Solomon Lew is now in custody. However, there happens to be a bunch of people called the 'Apostles', or 'generic group of thugs who used to be a member of the generic bad guy's organisation but since he was captured they are now on their own'. Sort of, because you have another generic bad guy who apparently is a contact for this ground of generic thugs, the catch is that nobody knows who they actually are. Then again, this is a spy thriller, so why would we expect any less.
 So what can you expect. Well, you can pretty much expect more of the same. If you've seen the other Mission Impossible films you probably know what you are going to get - Tom Cruise riding a motor-cycle, Tom Cruise doing stunts (or at least somebody who looks like Tom Cruise doing the stunts for him), and of course scenes where you look at it and scratch your head wandering how on Earth he was actually able to survive half the things that he actually survived. Oh, and they also have Simon Pegg in the film, which I think is pretty cool.
 Oh, and then there is the bait and switch. Sort of the way they set something up and you are led to believe one thing, and all of a sudden, once they have the information that they are looking for, the walls come down, the masks come off, and you realise that it is all a set up. Then again, I suspect they have this in all of the films, so in the end, while it is pretty cool, I suspect that once you know what is going on, and what these films are about, then you are going to pick them out from a mile away - I worked one of them out pretty quickly.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
56,tomgillespie2002,May just be one of the finest action movies ever made,8,22 November 2018,"Over the course of twenty-odd years, Tom Cruise has clung to the side of an aeroplane as it soared into the sky, had a knife held millimetres away from his eyeball, and ran down the side of the world's tallest building, all for the sake of the Mission: Impossible series, a franchise that no-one would have dreamt would still be packing cinema screens two decades later when it began back in 1996. Cruise's enthusiasm for putting himself at genuine risk of death has seen these movies continuously trying to outdo each other, and the sixth in the series, Christopher McQuarrie's Fallout, is not only the most ambitious in scale and clinical in its execution, but may also just be one of the finest action pictures ever made. I never believed the sight of Cruise running across the outside of the 119th floor of Dubai's Burj Khalifa would ever be topped, but Fallout delivers not one but two superior set-pieces, and that's not even mentioning the rooftop-hopping that saw Cruise break his leg and carry on with the scene.Ethan Hunt and his Impossible Mission Force team are tasked this time with intercepting three plutonium cores in Berlin before they fall into the hands on an organisation called The Apostles, a terrorist group made up of survivors from The Syndicate. Joined by Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), the team fail in their mission when Hunt refuses to let one his own die. As the terrorists make off with the plutonium to sell to a mysterious buyer called John Lark, Hunt receives a dressing-down from CIA director Erika Sloane (Angela Bassett), who is furious at their failure to secure the weapons of mass destruction. She forces Hunt to take on CIA operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) as a shadow, and the odd couple head off to Paris to track down Alanna (Vanessa Kirby), an arms dealer they believe has connections to Lark. Double-crosses and high-speed chases ensue, as well as Tom Cruise's trademark run, as all paths start to lead back to Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the formidable villain from last time.Christopher McQuarrie is the only director to have returned for a second stab at the Mission: Impossible gig, and the choice seems odd given how lacklustre Rogue Nation proved to be. But whatever he failed to grasp last time around he confidently nails here. McQuarrie and Cruise pull out all the stops, executing everything from a terrifying night-time sky-dive to a helicopter chase that sees Cruise plummet from the chopper's rails to the cargo swinging 40 feet below like veteran masters of the genre. The sheer risk and danger of some of the stunts pulled off here is gobsmacking, and Cruise can now comfortably sit alongside the likes of Jackie Chan as one of the greatest action stars ever. Cruise isn't the only star of course: Cavill particularly impresses as the deadpan slugger with a moustache so impressive it manage to cock up Justice League's re-shoots. Rhames and Pegg, who are both given larger roles than usual, can now banter like colleagues who have worked with each other for four movies, and reliable support is given by the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Alec Baldwin and Michelle Monaghan. At two and a half hours, it can be argued that there's at least one climax too many, but I doubt anyone will be checking their watches.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
57,cruise01,Tom Cruise delivers another breathtaking sequel with awesome action that keeps you on your seat.,10,28 July 2018,"Mission Impossible: Fallout (5 out of 5 stars).Mission Impossible: Fallout is an awesome, exciting action packed sequel that shows Tom Cruise is up for more crazy stunts. From jumping out of an HALO plane, being chased on a motorcycle in Paris, running and jumping on rooftops in London, and flying an helicopter and being caught in a dogfight. These movies get better through sequels and I am not complaining that they should stop. Each movie gets better and tops the one before. Fallout is probably the best one out of six movies now. Sure, I find Tom Cruise climbing the burj khalifa to be the most intense stunt and the motorcycle chase scene in Rogue Nation to be well done and the best action sequence. Fallout in general has a lot going for it. From a plot that has a lot of pieces moving with characters betraying another. Double and triple crosses with each other. But it all makes sense in the end when everything is pieced together. The plot follows Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luthor (Ving Rhames) are on a mission trying to retrieve stolen nuclear devices. When the mission goes awry and Ethan has to face the consequences of saving ones life over millions. They are forced to have a shadow from the CIA with August Walker (Henry Cavill) tagging along with them on there missions. While a terrorist group called The Apostles are after the nuclear devices. A lot more goes on with the plot which makes it better. But the less you know before going to see it, the better. There are a few twists that will surprise you. Characters wearing masks and fooling the audience that will leave you surprised. And a few triple crosses. Yes, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) returns with her own agenda that may interfere with Hunt's mission. The movie is loaded with action packed set pieces throughout. I will consider this to be the best action movie of the year so far. Definitely, a summer blockbuster type of movie while it is keeping you thinking and focused on its heavy-handed plot. Writer/Director Christopher McQuarrie does well with topping each action scene over the one before that. From a HALO jump scene that is dizzying and crazy. To a brutal fight scene in the bathroom at a club. To a convoy breakout that leads Ethan being chased by the police with more bad guys after him while Faust is hot on his trail as well. To an overlong rooftop running scene that shows Tom Cruise can jump and sprint for long distances. Then, the climatic finale with Tom Cruise being in an aerial combat dogfight while flying a helicopter which is dizzying and thrilling but the best aerial combat scene shot on film. Tom Cruise is at his best again. Henry Cavill is a great addition as well playing a character that is hard to trust. Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg are still good. Pegg having more hands on action this time. Rebecca Ferguson is great playing a character that is difficult on trusting but has feelings for Ethan while they have different agendas on their mission. Sean Harris returns with that monotone voice but is still menacing. Alec Baldwin was great too with having more confidence in Ethan's actions and choices even though he does not show it. The music score Lorne Balfe was also good and helped create the tone of the movie which is a bit darker. His score almost sounds similar to Hans Zimmer. Overall, Mission Impossible Fallout is a great film. If you are into the series or not. This film will definitely win newcomers. The action sequences are top notch exciting and thrilling. There is a lot of action from beginning to end. The cast is great. The plot is all over the place but works well with the twist and turns. Tom Cruise is not holding back with stunts. This 2 and half hour film does feel short when the pace flies so fast with its busy plot and non stop action. You may finally catch a breath when it is over.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
58,zkonedog,Another Strong Link In The Chain,8,30 July 2018,"Your mission, should you choose to accept it: Sit back, relax, and watch the new king of action/adventure movie franchises continue on in its greatness.I'd give a basic plot summary of the film, but that's tough for a film like this for a number of reasons. I don't want to give away any spoilers, and the ""plot"" of a MI movie is always going to be more of a conduit to the next action sequence than anything else. Suffice it to say that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) & Co. are once again in top form, combining spy antics, tech gadgets, and high-octane stunts to complete their seemingly impossible tasks.In my review of the previous film, I noted that (at least for me) the MI franchise has now eclipsed Bond in terms of being able to reliably churn out action thrillers. Nothing in ""Fallout"" will dissuade many from that opinion. It crackles from beginning to end with the perfect mix of action, character moments, sex appeal, and even some light-hearted humorous moments. Everything that Bond once was able to accomplish, in other words.Personally, I'll say that this film's predecessor (Rogue Nation) is a tad better overall, for its perfect meld of everything. But this one is close. The major difference is the general move away from spy/tech gadgetry and towards bigger stunt pieces. Whereas it used to be all about the espionage, now it is just as much about ""what mess will Hunt and the gang have to get out of next"".Overall, though, ""Fallout"" is still an excellent film that will keep you entertained from beginning to end. It looks like the type of film that everyone involved in had a blast making, and that goes a long way in how it comes off to viewers.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
59,eddie_baggins,A hugely fun blast of action and thrills,8,2 August 2018,"Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, welcome to the Tom Cruise ego show!Showing us all that he is not a mere mortal like the rest of us and continues to defy his age of 56 years, the newest impossible mission Cruise's Ethan Hunt takes on; Fallout, is an action packed thrill ride that sees the divisive actor throw caution to the wind and put his body on the line to deliver some of the most thrilling and death defying stunts seen in a feature film in some time.No matter how you feel about the man, Cruise certainly knows how to put on a cinematic spectacle and whilst he is jumping out of planes, riding his bike far too fast through the streets of the city of love, flying a helicopter in a wild fashion or as we've all come to love, running fast in a way in which only the Cruise can do, we as an audience find ourselves with a big old-fashioned smile on our face, aghast, yet thoroughly entertained by what the action star and his seemingly best buddy directing partner Christopher McQuarrie have come up with for this franchises 6th instalment.It's incredibly really to be 6 films into a series that has no real right being as good as it has become but here we are and after the delights of Ghost Protocol and the box-office highs of Rogue Nation, Fallout is the final say in the now undeniable fact that Mission: Impossible has become one of the great action franchises of cinema and one of the most reliable properties of the current era.It's often dumb, frequently unbelievable and highly over the top but it doesn't matter as Cruise, his on-board co-stars and the increasingly confident McQuarrie combine to make the story of Hunt and his team chasing down some stolen plutonium and facing old-foes in highly photogenic and world-known locations, a seriously entertaining ride.By the films mid-way point you can't help but just sit back in your chair, put your hand deep into your oversized bucket of popcorn and willingly partake in the thrills and spills provided and there's a genuine sense of pulsating kicks to be had thanks to the pure audacity and craftsmanship of a film that values practical stunts over big CGI set-pieces, making most of Fallout's big action beats operate on a whole different level to other similar films that have lost much of appeal by the over-use of computer generated carnage.If you're seeking a cinematic experience that feels palpable, real and dangerous, Fallout is the film you've been eagerly awaiting for.Final Say - Putting aside your logic or your disdain for Cruise the public figure, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the action thrill ride of the year. Filled with some genuinely jaw-dropping set-pieces and a frenetic and non-stop energy, Fallout may just be a franchise high and quite easily the action event of the year, tailor-made for the biggest screen available to your viewing needs.4 bathroom stalls out of 5",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
60,leonblackwood,Same old Cruise saving the world from evil! 5/10,5,9 January 2019,"Review:
Although the action scenes are top class, and the stunts are amazing, this movie just seemed like another Tom Cruise action film to me. The storyline was half decent, even though the director overcomplicated it with technical jargon, and it was good to see the original cast back. After watching the bonus material, I don't think you can appreciate the work that goes into making one of these movies, especially with Cruise doing most of the stunts, and the director could have easily used a green screen for a lot of the locations, which he decided against. My problem with the film is the fact that it's not that different from the rest of the Mision Possible movies. It's just Cruise pushing the bar when it comes to the various stunts, including learning to fly a helicopter for this film. Don't get me wrong, it's still worth a watch if you're into your epic action films but I'm personally getting a bit fed up with Cruise running, jumping, and driving every vehicle made. After his amazing performance in Tropic Thunder, which a lot of people rated him for, I think it's about time Cruise stopped saving the day, against all odds. Anyway, two years after Solomon Lane's (Sean Harris) capture, the remnants of his organisation, The Syndicate, have reorganised as a rogue terrorist group called the Apostles. IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is assigned to buy three stolen plutonium cores in Berlin before the Apostles can. He is joined by Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) for the mission, but the team fails when Luther is taken hostage and Ethan's attempt to save him allows the Apostles to make off with the plutonium. Furious at IMF's failure to secure the plutonium, CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) instructs Special Activities Division operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) to shadow Ethan, as he attempts to retrieve the plutonium. I think you can guess where the movie goes from here! Basically, Ethan and his team go through hell to try and retrieve the plutonium, which they lost at the beginning of the film. With the help of MI6 agent IIsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who saves Ethan's life a few times during the movie, their information finally leads them to a medical camp in Kashmir, were Ethan's estranged wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) is working. The team deduces that Solomon and August are actually working together and that they plan to detonate the nuclear weapons over the Siachen Glacier, contaminating the water supply of Pakistan, India and China, with a third of its population affected, the world will descend into anarchy from which Solomon and August hope a new world order will emerge. Now you know why I said that the director overcomplicated the plot! Basically, some nutter wants to blow up half the world, so Ethan and his team have to stop him. Personally, I thought that there were way too many characters in the film, and the action went on forever. You can see where every penny of the budget went, especially as they shot in real locations but I would have liked more character building, and some wit to lighten the mood. It is non-stop from the beginning to the end which, in some ways, becomes a bit claustrophobic after a while. We all know that Ethan is going to save the day, once again, and after many years of saving the world, the stupid CIA Director still thought that he went rogue, which I thought was ridiculous. Anyway, I think that Tom Cruise has done every stunt known to man by now, so I think it's time for him to hang up his ""adrenaline junkie"" shoes, and try something new to entertain audiences. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who also brought you The Way of the Gun, which I really enjoyed, Jack Reacher and Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. He also produced Valkyrie and Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, and he wrote the Usual Suspects, The Way of the Gun, Valkyrie, The Tourist, Jack Reacher, Jack The Giant Slayer, Edge Of Tomorrow, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation and The Mummy which also starred Tom Cruise. McQuarrie and Cruise have built a healthy relationship over the years, which is why they produce some of the most extravagant stunts seen in film. It might also explain why most of Tom Cruise's films are similar to each other, and we always have the famous running scene, which gets on my nerves. With another Top Gun in the pipeline, which is also being directed by McQuarrie, Tom Cruise is definitely a true Hollywood star, and he is still got the audiences flocking to the cinema, judging by the profit that this movie made. After the terrible, The Mummy, I did think that people had enough of Cruise's action blockbusters but this movie has proved that one bad movie won't tarnish his name. As this is the 7th highest-grossing film of 2018, which is Cruise's highest-grossing film to date, and the highest-grossing film in the franchise, I'm sure the MI franchise isn't over, even though Cruise is 56 years old.Budget: $178million
Worldwide Gross: $791millionGenre: Action, Adventure, Thriller
Cast: Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Michelle Monaghan, Wes Bentley, Alec Baldwin, Vanessa Kirby and Frederick Schmidt. 5/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
61,TheMovieDiorama,MI: Fallout seemingly does the impossible by becoming the best of the franchise.,10,27 July 2018,"It's a rarity that a two decade series of spy films somehow becomes more exhilarating with each instalment. But Fallout is not just the best film in the franchise, it's quite possibly one of the best action films of all time. Hunt and the remaining members of IMF must search and obtain stolen plutonium before the nuclear devices utilising them are detonated. Honestly, I am floored. Absolutely flabbergasted. Incredibly astonished. This, technically in terms of an action film, is perfect. A high-stake story that provides suspense and tension through slithering twists that one would hope to find in a spy film. Inducing and personifying a momentous undertone that feels both serious and weighty. Accompanied by McQuarrie's astounding direction that balances humour, character development and action through inventive camera placement. Balfe's hypnotic rendition of the infamous theme tune complementing the chaos shown onscreen. A colourful array of characters where the actors showcase both emotional and physical performances. A flawless three act narrative structure where each consecutive segment increases the heart palpitating pressure even more. But the highlight of this blockbuster, and I'm sure you will agree, are the action sequences. Phenomenal. Just phenomenal. From a one take HALO jump to a motorbike chase through Paris to a rooftop sprint in London ending on a helicopter duel (accompanied with mandatory countdown). Every single action scene was jaw-dropping. The technicality behind each expertly crafted sequence exhumes confidence. Immediately entrancing you into an awe-inspiring world of espionage. Cruise, dedicated as always, does the majority of his stunts. It's safe to assume he would die for this franchise. But he's done it! He has finally made the action film we've always wanted, and should be immensely proud. Energetic, death-defying and relentless. Fallout marks a benchmark in both the franchise and action films. It is the best blockbuster of the year and, without hesitation, gets the perfect rating.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

63,matthewssilverhammer,The Best Yet in a Truly Spectacular Franchise,9,3 August 2018,"In my opinion, Mission: Impossible is the single most impeccably entertaining spy franchise in history. Forget womanizing, too-cool-for-school Bond. Forget ever-changing, overly-serious Jack Ryan. Forget forgetful, mirthless Bourne. Ethan Hunt is my spy idol. And with Fallout, McQuarrie and Cruise have delivered easily their most impossible (and best) mission yet. A globe trekking, twisting-and-turning, intensely exciting sequel that continues and expands the reigning power of this unlikely blockbuster franchise.
Once again, Hunt and his crew find themselves amid a potential global disaster, on the outs with their own government and the criminal underground. What sets this one apart is its story and plot connections with the previous films. Where the others are essentially stand-alone outings, letting you jump in where you please, this one requires you to have a modicum of knowledge on Hunt and his exploits, allowing for growth in characters and stronger stakes in the villain's mysterious plots. 
As expected, there are an endless number of great reveals that beautifully unravel information only when necessary. Thanks to some stellar editing, it's predictable when it isn't important, and unpredictable when it is, making the mysteries and the marquee action scenes that much more impacting.
Honestly, God bless Tom Cruise and his lack of self-preservation. At 52, he is one of the last true action stars who sells a movie purely by putting his name on it, thanks largely to his renown for doing his own action. And with bathroom fist fights, helicopter chases, and skydiving malfunctions, what action it is. I always think this should be the last Mission with Cruise before seeing the most recent outing; by the end I just want more.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Ethan and his team are sent to Berlin to intercept them, but the mission fails when Ethan saves Luther and the Apostles escape with the plutonium. With CIA agent August Walker joining the team, Ethan and his allies must now find the plutonium cores before it's too late.On the plus side, it's a fast moving action film, but it's really confusing and hard to get the characters straight.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
65,southdavid,Fallout ... Boy!,7,14 August 2018,"The sixth edition of the long running spy series is another fine, if familiar, action adventure that continues to show the value of an evergreen leading man, who seems happy to genuinely risk life and limb for a better framed shot. Following a botched mission, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team try desperately to recover three nuclear warheads from a terrorist organisation known as ""The Apostles"", acolytes of previous film antagonist, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Unimpressed by Hunt's refusal to sacrifice his team for the mission, the CIA attach ruthless agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) to Hunt's team, ostensibly to help, but also to gather evidence to further their theory that Hunt has been disavowed once too often, and has turned on his country. Although CGI has made even more improvements over the past few years, it's nice to see a film that invests heavily in practical effects, particularly when you can see it's the real actors themselves performing the stunts and not a double. This is further emphasised in ""Fallout"" as you can see the scene where Tom Cruise's ankle smashes against the rooftop and he tries to walk it off. Christopher McQuarrie writes and directs well, and his script acts as not just a direct sequel to the previous film, but also has a number of scenes and characters that call back to earlier films in the 20 year history of the series. I do enjoy how this series has been around long enough to have transferred from the age of ""sequel"" be retrofitted into the ""Universe"" world that all studios now hope to recreate. But it's not perfect, the plot is pretty recognisable, with its story of cross and double-cross being fairly standard for all spy movies . . . ever. The plot also doesn't really stand up to much scrutiny, once your back in the daylight outside of the theatre. (I don't write reviews with spoilers - but the questions are asked in a few other reviews for the film). Some of the acting is a bit hammy too, especially and noticeably from Cruise himself, this particularly struck me as, though he has his detracting qualities, I've never noticed him struggling to act before. Personally, I'd like to see them go the other way for Mission Impossible 7, rather than trying to top this. Maybe a smaller more intimate film where the team work together to accomplish something, rather than just facilitate Ethan's work. Either way, after six films and twenty years, I'll be there.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Only suited for the braindead.,5,4 August 2018,"If you liked the last Mission Impossible with the same director (Cristoperh McQuarrie) then you will probably like this one too. Congratulations, you have just passed the test: you are braindead. Because only the braindead can enjoy another boring sequel like this one. Or the previous one. Both are mindnumbingly boring.Bigger stunts with cgi are SOOOO boring. And those same bigger cgi stunts cant cover up the fact that the story is without any real suspense whatsoever. Real suspense and an intelligent story is what made the original Mission Impossible movies 1, 3 and 4 so great. None of that in this sequel nr 6.Oh yes, I forgot about the jokes. There arent any. And those who should suppose to be funny are NOT. Jokes could have saved this movie, but they failed at that too.It isnt a big box office hit either. Figures. Mamma Mia is more popular. Both are giving me headaches though. I will watch one of the classic Mission Impossible movies 1,3 or 4 instead, just to keep the hope alive that Tom Cruise hasnt become a thing of the past, like Bruce Willis: turning out movies just because it is a franchise...Imdb should check out fake contributors that work for the movie industry, because there is no way that so many reviewers can give this movie 9 or 10 stars. That is just ridiculous. Even the braindead cant possibly be that dumb...",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
67,Vartiainen,Rogue Nation gets an actual sequel,7,25 February 2020,"Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the first time in the franchise when a director has not been changed between movies. Originally, Tom Cruise wanted to keep things fresh by having a new voice every time, but apparently he was so impressed with Rogue Nation's Christopher McQuarrie that he asked the man to direct more.And now McQuarrie is apparently permanently attached to this franchise. And for a good reason. He has a good voice, knows how to direct action, has interesting storylines and his characters are some of the best additions to the franchise since Simon Pegg's Dunn.Fallout is also the first Mission: Impossible film to continue the storyline from a previous movie. Sure, there was a mention of the Syndicate at the end of Ghost Protocol, which technically ties all three of these together, but that hardly counts. Not when Fallout has both the main villain and the main lady of Rogue Nation returning in full force. Even the main threat is eerily similar, but in a logical, pleasing way.And it works. I haven't minded at all that all previous Mission: Impossible films have been stand-alones, and Ghost Protocol is still my favourite in the franchise, but neither do I mind there being continuity. Especially when done this well.As for the new stuff, I liked Henry Cavill in his role. The twist was a tad obvious, but they executed it well, and Cavill's physical presence gave the role much needed menace. Not to mention the man can act. I also really enjoyed Vanessa Kirby as a sophisticated high-end black market broker.If I had to name any flaws, I'd probably call out the fact that they didn't get out as much from Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa. She's still a good character and a welcome addition to the franchise, but some of that zest has been lost between movies. And I blame the script more than Ferguson herself. Still, a minor gripe at best.Fallout falls just a bit short of Rogue Nation, but it's still one of the best action movies of the 21st century. Breathtaking stunts, great characters, high stakes, exotic locations, practical effects, diabolical schemes, and the kitchen sink too. What's not to like?",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

At this point we're less than 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you';; just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the 6th movie in the Mission Impossible franchise starring Tom Cruise. I've seen all of them, and I can unequivocally state that this is the BEST of the franchise. Written and directed by frequent Tom Cruise collaborator Christopher McQuarrie (Rogue Nation; Edge of Tomorrow; The Mummy), there is absolutely no sign that this franchise has run out of ideas. The plot is a bit hard to follow, but frankly, do we care all the much about a plot when we are there to see daredevil Cruise do stunts that nobody in Hollywood dare do, in fact nobody in the world. These scenes defy belief, but you seem happening in front of your very eyes. Some of them had been teased to us in the movie's trailer, but to now see the whole thing... The chases (yes, plural) in Paris are out of this world. And of course the film-closing helicopter scenes are even more gripping (I saw Cruise tell Jimmy Fellon on Friday evening that he (Cruise) trained 1 1/2 years for these scenes.... The support cast is terrific all around. Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, Alec Baldwin all do a great job. But in the end it's all about Cruise, and his determination to win you over, he simply will not take no for an answer. Bottom line: ""Mission Impossible - Fallout"" in my mind has reset the modern day gold standard for action movies, and in fact it's now a platinum standard. Thank you Mr. Cruise & Co., job well done, and then some.""Mission Impossible - Fallout"" opened wide this weekend. The Sunday early evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was pretty much a sell-out. The movie grossed over $60 mill in its opening weekend (not counting the rest of the world).

70,subxerogravity,Not the best movie in the world but I could watch it over and over again.,9,28 July 2018,"I never thought we would actually get to the point in which we would see a six installments of the franchise. No matter how good you think Mission: Impossible III was it should not have even gotten that far, but I do feel it was that movie that started the franchise in going the direction of a true franchise.Fallout once again features Cruse as Ethan Hunt, head of the Mission: Impossible field agents. Continuing from the movies previous Ethan and his team have to stop a rogue agency from using stolen plutonium to make three nuclear bombs.Once again on Ethan's side is Luther Stickell, played by Ving Rhames who has been in every Mission: Impossible movie since number one, and let me tell you, I love just seeing that Ving Rhames is still in this franchise. As good as Ghost Protocol was on it's own the best part about it was that they did not forget about Luther who made a cameo at the end. Also joining Ethan again is Benji Dunn played by Simon Pegg who has been doing this since Mission Impossible III .The adventures of Ethan Hunt and his team have become episodic. In a lot of ways I like it cause it makes a lot of the missions more mimic those done in the original series (only bigger obviously). Although it does mean that you have to have seen the other Mission Impossible movies to follow the actual story that's going on.However, if you chose not to follow the story, Fallout is filled with some great and unique action sequences that were outright impressive. Mission: Impossible goes for the more realistic suspense and low tone over the archetype dramatic hype.It's a change of tone that allows the filmmakers to add humor to the movie that blends in pretty well (Better if you have been following the Mission: Impossible franchise).Mission: Impossible Fallout is a great movie, it's good action and if you are into the franchise the humor is nice, especially between Cruse Rhames and Pegg who lead the charge.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
71,jtindahouse,The best entry in the series yet,9,26 February 2019,"The 'Mission Impossible' series of movies have always been a bit hit and miss for me. I've always liked them without ever really loving any of the entries in the series. I've always seen it as the American version of the 'Bond' films, and I've always been of the opinion that 'Bond' was superior. 'Mission Impossible - Fallout' however was far and away the best entry in the series. They finally nailed it.The action in this movie is relentless. It starts immediately and never lets up. There was a point where two characters were talking for maybe 2 minutes and I actually thought to myself: boy it's been a long time without an action sequence. That's how fast paced this film is. The two and a half hour run time is gone by in the snap of your fingers. Also the action sequences aren't just plentiful, they are of the highest quality too. Every stunt is incredible to watch.This film is smart too. So often it caught me off guard with just how clever it was able to be. The story is incredibly well thought out and some particular scenes and even just moments are bordering on genius. Tom Cruise also proves that he still has it. He has infinite charm and is endlessly watchable. The only negative I found in the film was that the helicopter scenes (filmed in my beloved and beautiful New Zealand) were probably the weakest of all the action sequences. So to have them be the last ones seen in the film ended the movie on not quite the high I would have liked. Otherwise though this is an excellent film that you should rush out and see if you haven't already.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
72,Turfseer,"Tom Cruise. doing all his own stunts, provides edge of your seat entertainment as nuclear annihilation must be prevented",8,4 September 2018,"More than halfway through the 6th installment of Mission Impossible (aptly subtitled ""Fallout""), the CIA is infiltrated by a bunch of bad guys known as The Apostles. They manage to grab dangerous international anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). from the clutches of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his crack IMF team consisting of Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames). Behind all this is fundamentalist John Lark, who is assigned to shadow Hunt at the beginning of the film posing as a CIA operative. How he actually gets his men into position to retake Lane is never explained. It's not exactly essential to explain how everything works in a thriller such as this as we're too busy marveling at all non-stop derring-do (led primarily by Tom Cruise, who does all his own stunts). 
The basic plot involves Hunt being assigned to retrieve three plutonium cores which the Apostles end up stealing from him after Luther is briefly held hostage and Hunt must save his life (in the process losing the cores).The narrative is dependent on a series of very entertaining plot twists, the first of which involves Hunt and his team deceiving nuclear weapons expert Nils Debruu into revealing where an arms dealer named The White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) is planning to meet Lark. 
The following developments will keep you glued to your seat as they involve incredible stunts, all of which Tom Cruise is at the heart of: 1) Cruise as Hunt must save the CIA agent Walker (later revealed to be Lark) as he's knocked out by lightning while parachuting over Paris; 2) Cruise and Lark have death-defying hand-to-hand combat with a man who poses as Lark in a bathroom 3) the IMF team extracts Lane from a convoy after they knock his armored vehicle off a bridge and Cruise leads cops on an incredible motorcycle chase in which he's constantly riding in wrong-way traffic; 4) Cruise chases Lark on foot through Paris in an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend him. 
All the excitement culminates in Kashmir, where the IMF team learns that Lane is planning to explode two of the plutonium cores (earlier the White Widow gave Hunt one of the cores as down payment for Lane). There is an incredible helicopter chase in which Hunt eventually prevents the nuclear explosions by killing Lark and obtaining a key that's part of the detonator. Meanwhile, Benji and Luther (joined by Hunt's ex-flame Ilsa Faust played by Rebecca Ferguson along with Hunt's ex-wife, Michelle Monaghan as Julia Meade) must disable the nuclear cores manually after a 15 ,minute countdown has already been initiated by Lark. 
Rounding out the fine cast is Alec Baldwin as the IMF boss who's killed in an altercation with Walker (aka Lark) and the CIA head, Angela Bassett, whom eventually eats crow after allowing Lark to infiltrate her agency. As stated above, not everything here makes sense, or rather it's not sufficiently explained. But the plot twists and incredible stunts will keep you riveted to your seat. At 56, Tom Cruise must be commended for keeping himself in shape and doing all his own stunts (despite breaking his ankle while filming in mid-production).",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
73,jamesrupert2014,Action packed no-brainer delivers on what is expected of it,7,17 June 2019,"Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF crew deal with an apocalyptic plan to ignite a new world order with the usual array of high-speed chases, noisy gunfights, gravity-defying martial arts, masterful disguises, and hyper-kinetic stunts. While some of the action set-pieces go on a bit too long (the motorcycle chases all start to look the same after a while), any claim to plausibly is thrown out the window (mastering helicopter controls looks pretty easy), and the 'comic relief' is a bit strained, MI#6 is an entertaining hyper-action flick. The stunts are excellent and Cruise is entitled to a lot of credit for the work he puts into this kind of film.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
74,DarkVulcan29,Nothing is Impossible,9,31 July 2018,"In a Mission Impossible film you got to suspend a series of disbelief, like the Fast films, they are just fun and never take themselves seriously to a point.The story is pretty much the same, Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise) goes on a mission, and things are never what they appear to be. Never knowing who to trust, Ethan has to complete this mission before time runs for him and his team.
A good Mission movie, not the best, but still good and entertaining to watch. Action scenes don't disappoint, and fight scenes are intense. Tom Cruise is always good has Ethan Hunt, and Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg also play there roles well also. My one real complaint is Henry Cavill, not that he was terrible, but I didn't feel he was quite the menacing presence has the trailer made it look. But still a good fun action film.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
75,jadavix,"More of the same, but not as good",6,11 December 2018,"""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" seems to be a deliberate attempt by the filmmakers to turn the clock back to the confounding plot shenanigans of the first movie. There are a few moments where characters pull their faces off and reveal other characters underneath, and even one moment where the room the characters are in is actually a different kind of room.Nobody goes to see ""Mission: Impossible"" for that, though. You see it for action, which the previous, breathtaking movie delivered in spades. It was one of the best movies of the year it came out, and definitely one of the best action movies of the decade so far. So what of this sequel, ""Fallout""?Unfortunately, it's a bit underwhelming. There are no memorable action moments like in the previous movie. It jumps around a lot, which is less exciting than tiresome. Sean Harris is a great bad guy, but he's barely in it.""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" feels like a collection of scenes that weren't good enough to go in the previous movies.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
76,dfranzen70,It lacks luster and originality.,6,1 April 2019,"When this came out, it seemed like it got a lot of positive reviews. Tom Cruise looks the same as he did in 1996, the stunts are awesome, and so on. But the plot is predictable and, at times, overly complicated. I mean, there's so much double crossing and so many twists and turns that it's not hard to see where things are going or who the bad guy or guys will be. If one hasn't seen the most recent M:I movie (Rogue Nation), then this movie will be very difficult to follow. Anyway, if I had to name one overarching problem with this entry, it would be the obviousness; at this point in the series, if Ethan and pals are up against a wall, chances are good that the wall will lead to a hidden cache of weapons. Metaphorically speaking, anyway. Great stunts include a high-altitude, low opening jump; Cruise piloting a disabled helicopter over mountainous terrain; and a race through the streets of Paris on motorbikes. And yes, it's nice to see someone who doesn't have super powers save the day, but one gets the impression that Ethan Hunt can do things simply because he thinks he can. Don't try this at home.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
77,stevendbeard,NOT Boring,8,30 July 2018,"I saw ""Mission:Impossible-Fallout"", starring Tom Cruise-The Mummy_2017, Knight and Day; Henry Cavill-Superman in Justice League, Red Riding Hood; Rebecca Ferguson-The Greatest Showman, Hercules_2014; Angela Bassett-Black Panther, London Has Fallen and Sean Harris-Deliver Us From Evil, Prometheus. 
This is the 6th in the Mission:Impossible series that started in 1996, starring Tom Cruise as spy Ethan Hunt. As can be expected, the stunts are great and there are lots of chases. There are motorcycle chases-Tom is not wearing a helmet so you can see it is really him doing the stunts. There are foot chases across rooftops-Tom actually broke his ankle performing one of the jumps. There are helicopter chases-and even a HALO jump, or high altitude low opening. There is a fight in a bathroom that is unbelievable. Let's just say, it is not a boring movie. Henry plays a C.I.A. agent that has to tag along on Tom's mission-he has orders from his boss, Angela, to take Tom out if he fails. I guess the IMF and C.I.A. have issues with each other. Rebecca returns as an MI6 agent-she was in Rogue Nation-and Sean also returns from Rogue Nation, making him the first villain that has made a second appearance in the franchise. There are people that are not who they claim to be-that is in the job description of a spy's life-and there are people that don't make it to the end of the movie.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, intense action and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 27 minutes.

Actiony and explosive parade of badassdom with superb direction, suspense and not without a sense of humor when it needs it.

81,alindsay-al,A Great fun action packed film,8,29 July 2018,"I think as they have gone on these Mission Impossible films have just got better and better and even though I don't feel like this is the best film in the franchise it is still a great action film that is above the majority of its competition. The premise of the film sees Ethan Hunt and his IMF team have to go after missing Plutonium that could cause damage to the entire world. Tom Cruise has done a great job with the character of Ethan Hunt over the years and he commits once again to give a truly great performance as this character. He is an action star that always gives his all and this film is no different with some crazy action scenes that also made his character feel as human as they possibly can in this film. I also liked seeing the moral dilemma's that he had to go through as it made his character more complex and easier to root for. The supporting cast is mostly back and do a great job, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames have great synergy together and they provide more of the humour filled moments of the film but while remaining serious characters as well. back from the last film is Rebecca Ferguson and she has her own quest in this film and it comes across very well and she comes across as much more then a damsel in distress for Cruise. Alec Baldwin isn't in this film as much as the previous one but does such a good job when he is on screen that it reminds you just how good an actor he really is. Henry Cavill joins the team in this film and he fills his role well, I found that him and Cruise had a pretty good chemistry about them and it made their arc in the film feel more natural. The story as mentioned before deals with a few moral dilemmas and I thought that overall the were well handled and interesting. I just found the main plot to be pretty generic and dull, there are these characters introduced that could have been cut out of the film completely and it would have been no different. Plus the big twist in the film is easy to read from a mile away and won't surprise you one bit. The script is really good, with the drama working when necessary and also the little bits of humour being used effectively to add layers to these characters. The style of this film visually is great with so many amazing action set pieces and hand to hand action scenes. There are plenty that stand out and make this such a fun film to watch. However, this film in my opinion is too long, I feel like this film would have been so much better if it was just a bit shorter as it really is hard to stay engaged for the whole movie. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and feel that if you like action films this is a must watch for you.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
82,iquine,A Xerox of the Shallow Save the World Plots,4,9 January 2020,"(Flash Review)Reaching for another identical soda from the case is what this movies like. Very little of this was memorable yet it felt just like any other action movie as it just checked off the expected boxes. It put effort into the production quality but coupled with the wax paper thin story made this film feel flat and mundane. The unimportant archetypal Hollywood plot is Ethan Hunt must recover some plutonium from the bad guys before it, of course, is too late as a bomb timer ticks away. It had the expected motorcycle and car chases, some gun play, explosions and a countdown timer working against Hunt yet all of it was rather run-of-the-mill and mediocre. Plus there is so much double-crossing it becomes comical and not cleverly executed. This is a big screen popcorn movie and nothing more.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
83,Fluke_Skywalker,Mission accomplished,8,30 July 2018,"Plot; Agent Ethan Hunt and his team race against time to recover three plutonium cores from a shadowy splinter group known as The Apostles.In an industry that's already on its third incarnation of Spider-Man this century, the phrase ""Better with age"" rarely applies, but there's no better description I can think of for Tom Cruise and his venerable and odds-defying Mission: Impossible franchise. W/gaps as long as 6 years between entries and sporting a catalog of directors whose styles could not be more different, it doesn't have the precise, lab tested and exhaustively vetted formula of something like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, yet here it stands 22 years after the release of its first entry stronger and more vibrant than ever. The same can be said of its star. One of my biggest gripes w/the M:I series has been that the character of Ethan Hunt really isn't a character at all. What's his personality? His quirks and vices? If I asked you to describe James Bond's personality you could do it easily despite him having been played by a growing roster of actors under the pen of a legion of writers. Ethan Hunt? He's just kind of an avatar for Tom Cruise. What Fallout does is finally begin to rectify that a bit by giving us some dramatic carryover from previous films. It gives Ethan and his world another--and desperately needed--dimension. But you don't go see an unabashed popcorn extravaganza like Mission: Impossible for drama, you go for the thrills, and they're here aplenty. There story is a bit thin, but it's well told and a solid enough vessel to hold our interest and make us care about the white-knuckle action. Cruise famously does his own stunts, and that's not just a gimmick for the sales pitches. Director Christopher McQuarrie puts us right there w/Cruise and the result is action that feels palpable. Too often massive, CGI-filled action set pieces are impressive to behold, but lack that tactile sense that Cruise and McQuarrie bring to the proceedings here. Here you don't feel like you're watching someone else in danger, you feel like you're in danger w/them.The mission here, should you choose to accept it, is have fun. Thanks to Cruise and company, it's once again mission accomplished.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
84,pixrox1,"This new flick is just like a ""James Bond"" film . . .",9,9 August 2018,". . . with such exotic story locales as Paris, New Zealand, and Norway, and such Bond-like incidents as helicopter ramming, nuclear bomb defusing, and several false face masks. Cast in the Secret Agent 007 role, ""T. Cruise"" may NOT be swilling martinis (whether shaken, or stirred) , but he gets to have his cake and eat it too when it comes to ""Hunt"" girls, as wives and mistresses begin accumulating around his final hospital bed thicker than would-be heiresses on a croaking Rich Man. Given the scuttlebutt that Cruise performed his own stunts (and delayed filming at least once due to a pitfall fracture), MISSIION: IMPOSSIBLE--FALLOUT begs the question as to exactly how many replicas exist of this iconic cult figure? Unlike the plethora of blokes who've been trotted out as Jimmy Bond, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE has tried to maintain the myth that only one actor has filled the role of ""E. Hunt"" over the decades. However, viewers must ask themselves if they REALLY want to swallow such an obvious Hollywood PR fabrication hook, lie, and sphincter. Given TC's cult-like cash cow status, and remembering the fact that we're now living (for better or worse) in the day of 3D biological laser printers, isn't it likely that this movie franchise alone has chewed up and spit out AT LEAST a dozen incarnations of the ""ageless"" Tom?",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The movie is high on action and stunts with some great car and bike chases.It is advisable for you to watch M:I-5 in order to understand what is happening in the movie as both the movies are somewhat inter related.The plot of the movie might not be fresh as we have seen similar plots in the franchise but credit should be given to the makers for it's execution as with some unexpected twists the movie will keep you glued to the screens till the end. The acting is one of the strongest factor of the movie apart from it's stunts and action.Cinematography and it's powerful visuals is the another strong aspect and also the movie is shot in some of the very beautiful locations and is been captured nicely.Climax of the movie is like typical Mission: Impossible climax and will give you goosebumps. The stunts in the climax should be appreciated.Overall in my opinion this is the best movie of the franchise and a must watch.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
87,kirbylee70-599-526179,"YOUR MISSION, SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT",10,6 December 2018,"The MISSION IMPOSSIBLE series of films is an undeniable hit. Any series of films that can make it to six films qualifies. They've been able to do so with a continuing cast, adding members as they've gone along says a lot about the team behind the movies. That they've been able to go this far and continue to make exciting action packed films that don't play to the lowest common denominator is something to be proud of. This week the sixth film in the series, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: FALLOUT makes its way to disc and odds are it will be this week's hot rental.At the end of the previous installment (MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: ROGUE NATION) Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team were able to track down and capture Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) the man they felt was tip of the iceberg for a group known as The Syndicate, a criminal consortium many in intelligence didn't believe existed. With Lane in custody that attitude changed and so did the Syndicate. With his capture the group is now a rogue terrorist group called the Apostles.As the film opens Hunt is on a mission to buy 3 plutonium cores in Berlin. With Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) on his team he is caught off guard when the Apostles take Luther hostage. To save his life Hunt allows the plutonium to leave his hands and a new mission is assembled to track down nuclear weapons expert Nils Debruuk, a man who designed nuclear devices for John Lark. They do so in the hopes of using him to find Lark, a man they are certain has plans for those devises and the plutonium.CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) is not pleased with this turn of events. In an effort to rein in the IMF team and save face she assigns Special Activities Director agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) to shadow Hunt and his team every step of the way. As the team shifts into gear to take on a different challenge their mission changes from moment to moment as new players enter the arena. When one contact they are supposed to meet is killed they set out after the killer, the mission morphing into something new.Along the way the team encounters MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) who we met in the previous film. But is she there to help or to hinder them? Cross, double crosses and triple crosses are found throughout the film and it isn't until the final 30 minutes or so that we know just who is responsible for what and what they then intend to do. Needless to say it isn't something good and is in fact devastating for the world. But isn't that always the case in these films?The movie is an action packed thrill ride from start to finish. But it's not just those action fueled moments that make the film work on various levels. The movie works because it's smart and has a deep story behind it. It works because you find yourself caring for the characters we've come to know and love in the course of six films. It works because it combines the action and intelligent story with humor and emotions, a difficult mix at best and one that they seem to accomplish with ease.Cruise continues to show why he's one of today's top stars. He has a charisma about him that is undeniable. He also seems to have found that fountain of youth in his appearance that only Dick Clark seemed privy to. Still insistent on doing many of his own stunts he broke his ankle doing one of these, a painful item to watch is you go looking for it. In an interview the cast members when asked what he did after it happened said he got up and continued walking on it until the shot was done.The rest of the cast is amazingly comfortable in their roles as well. Pegg remains the comic relief and does it well. Rhames is the tech wizard who cares more about his friend than many realize. Ferguson shows that she is worthy of being on the team and let's hope she remains there if the series continues. And Cavill shows that he can handle a role other than Superman and do a solid job of it.I've found I've been able to watch and re-watch all of the movies in the series and know I will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. They're never tiring and always guarantee a good night's film to watch. This one is no different. The only problem with the film is the same problem the others had. It ends and leaves you wanting more. So let's hope that the success of this film ignites the spark for them to carry on. If James Bond can reach double digits then why not Ethan Hunt?",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

I liked Rogue Nation the best, and for good reasons, but I just didn't get that same feeling of complete satisfaction after seeing this one. I feel like everyone is praising this film for it's really great action and giving it 10's just for that. I give it a lot of points for it's cool effects and action, because it does those things really well. But I feel like it suffered in other areas. I don't think the performances were quite as strong here as they were in the previous films, with the exception of Cruise. Not saying that the acting was bad because it wasn't, but I just didn't feel as invested as I did in the others. I also don't think the pacing was as good. And I felt like the other films had more content wise, I felt like I had been on a wild fun adventure afterwards.

Our team is about to purchase that plutonium but they are outsmarted by the Apostles a shootout ensues and the bad guys make it away with the material because no one from the team bothers to grab the case. But our team manage to grab and deceive some guy who build nuclear weapons for the Apostles. Now our team at least has the design of the weapons. No one at the CIA has happy with this so it decides to have a agent Walker join out team. They go to a party in Paris where some guy is going to buy the plutonium. They intercept and impersonate the guy, not after a cool martial arts-fight scene, and also the lovely Ilsa Faust is back. Ethan makes contact with the broker but the deal now involves having to rescue bad guy Solomon Lane. Our team doesn't follow the script but instead has its own plan to grab Lane.

Our team also ends up there where Ethan´s wife is as well for some reason. They have to disactivate the bombs in time while Ethan has to get the detonator from the villain.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is awfully long, with a complex story, which I suspect doesn't quite make sense in the end. Cavill does a good job, Ferguson is lovely as always. The team is noticeably one team member short. This movie takes itself a bit too seriously, there's little humor, and little dialogue. We are not privy to any planning like in previous MIs but stuff happens and we find out what´s what when the deceived do. There's the usual globe trotting but we don't get to see much of the places. The final scenes in New Zealand playing Kashmir look pretty amazing. This movie is entertaining enough but something is missing and it's hard to tell what. Again, it's too long so at the end you can't keep track of things. We don't get much of a break from the action.

Henry Cavill is a great addition as the CIA man who's there to mainly use brute force to get through situations. He's got the perfect frame and straight delivery needed for the role.The plot jets around the world, hitting major globe-trotting destinations and filling them with really well executed action sequences. Chases evolve from utilizing trucks to motorcycles, zipping through traffic in Paris. They go on foot from underground to rooftops to an elevator. They're constantly moving, never settling with a single gimmick, but throwing more and more at the screen. The stuff filmed in IMAX, like the helicopter chase at the end, looks absolutely amazing.Production design is fantastic as well, especially at the large party in Paris. That mirrored hallway is just such a fun image.Everything about this movie is just the right kind of adult flavored action movie fun. It's not filled with quippy dialogue through entire action sequences. There's actually surprising little talking in the chases. When you're filling something tension filled with jokes, you're breaking the tension with each joke which prevents the sequence from really building properly. The chase through Paris, in particular, mounts with tension until its denouement and it's completely engrossing, in part, because it allows the action scene to be an action scene instead of a bit of comedic banter with action happening in between.The movie's' not a great intellectual exercise, but it exists proudly in a long tradition of thrilling entertainment that has graced the silver screen for a century. So very highly recommended.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

99,jadepietro,Improbable but Great Fun,8,28 July 2018,"GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Mission improbable, but great fun due to the expert stunt work and fine action sequences. JIM'S REVIEW: Mission Impossible: Fallout is a circus act of death-defying stunts surrounded by espionage plots, double crosses, and enough action sequences to idle one's time. The film is is full throttle non-stop excitement with many hand-to-hand combat scenes, high flying leaps (of logic and otherwise), and speedy motorcycle chases and car crashes, which would certainly kill or, at least, cripple the common man. But this is no common person on that big screen. It is the ne'er aging Tom Cruise, a spry 56 years of age, playing action hero Ethan Hunt who engages us in most of the his risky business. It is a very physically demanding role and the actor is very convincing and should be the official poster boy for AARP.Much is made of Mr. Cruise's uncanny ability to do his own stunts. Kudos to him on that physical talent. Yet no one questions if he does his own acting. He mostly runs fast, drives hard, and delivers a few lines with the utmost sincerity. His stoic character, as written, is rather bland but he has a colorful crew of supporting figures that provide conflict and interest. Once again, he has his loyal IMF sidekicks, Luther and Benji (Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg), love interests Isla and Julia (Rebecca Ferguson and Michelle Monaghan), a femme fatale named White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), and the complimentary evil villain (Sean Harris). Mr. Cruise also has some competition (both acting wise and stunt wise in the manly form of Henry Cavil as Agent Walker. There is a nice anti-chemistry between them.The plot involves lost plutonium and preventing global annihilation via nuclear bombs, this time from a terrorist group called the Apostles. It all grows more complicated and far-fetched as the story progresses, but logic is rarely achieved in these spy capers. No, it's the set pieces of high energy happenings and dare-doing that one comes to see. And while the plot twists aren't very inventive, nor are they remotely surprising, this film delivers that comfort food for action junkies big time.Credit director Christopher McQuarrie and his expert team of stunt performers for their well-staged choreography and the taut editing by Eddie Hamilton. Mr. McQuarrie knows how to effectively layer his cliffhangers and build suspense and tension skillfully. (The fight sequence in the porcelain white bathroom is classic, and the helicopter chase ranks up there too.) The film is strongly crafted entertainment for the masses. And who doesn't love hearing that classic Lalo Schifrin's 60's television theme punctuating Lorne Balfe's lively score.But no matter how filmmakers update this spy caper with all of the state-of-the-art techno-CGI wizardry, the basic plot is borderline tiresome. The director's script is loaded with more than a smattering of cinematic cliches: double agents, globe-trotting to international cities, absurd running and jumping from windows and rooftops, frenzied car chases against incoming traffic. It's all there, right down to the timed ticking of that activated bomb showdown we have seen in so many countless thrillers as it goes down to the very last second till possible doomsday.This crowd pleasing film series will keep going and going due to its satisfying and memorable action work. Despite its narrative flaws, Mission Impossible: Fallout, the sixth installment in this franchise, becomes a i mission accomplished, improbably well done.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
100,RatedVforVinny,Pretty solid action with expected thrills and spills.,7,1 January 2020,"Sort of what you expect from M.I.6 and maybe a bit more. Tom Cruise, still looks the part despite his advancing years and still insists on doing his own stunts. This incredibly includes flying a helicopter, which only took him six weeks to learn (and pass his test). The rest of the movie is nothing majorly new but won't disappoint fans of this six part series. I'd be up for another, or even a couple (depending on how much the botox stretches).",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

102,rgkarim,Agents... suit up for a mother mission. Fallout is ago,8,28 July 2018,"The familiar chimes of a flute, the booming sounds of a drum, and the orchestra starts up on a familiar tune that is pleasing to the ears of fans aloud. Yes, this can be any movie, but for this reviewer, it means that it's the theme to a series that continues to sneak around in modern times. I'm talking about the spy thriller series that has dug up more terrorist plots than Sherlock Holmes, where gadgets and gizmos are utilized to conceal more than kill. I think you know what I mean, (most likely because you read the title) and thus we enter the latest review on Robbie's list. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to read on to find out my thoughts. Agent Karim bringing you a review on: Movie: Mission Impossible: Fallout (2018)Director:
 Christopher McQuarrie
Writers:
 Christopher McQuarrie, Bruce Geller 
Stars:
 Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames
LIKES: Acting: Get down to the basics first, the agents selected for this mission certainly had the skills to bring the adventure to life. A solid chemistry between the various players in the game, Fallout's pieces have been fine tuned to provide a cavalcade of thrilling characters worthy of bringing the conspiracy to life. Cruise leads the group the most, utilizing the majority of the screen time to be the keystone for just about everything. Newcomer Cavill is also a welcome addition, dropping his superhero leotard and its morals for a new set of justice to be served. And as for the supporting players of Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, and Sean Harris they too are elite enough to be integrated into the mix. The Story: If you have followed the series up until this point, seldom do we have solid connections between movies, with only the team and a tiny thread to tie each lead together. For once, Mission Impossible straight up follows a movie, and the continuity is welcomed as it opens up new avenues for than and the gang to travel. While the majority of the plot is pretty straight and narrow in regards to a spy thriller, the victory comes in seeing a few of the characters get unclassified. It's fantastic growth that the series needed that managed to get integrated well. In addition, the story manages to bend from the linear presentation, resulting in a little more excitement to be had. Pace: If it's a like, you know it moves, and for a 150-minute run time that pace is key to keeping people intrigued. Fallout forgoes much of the slower, drawn out jargon filled moments to keep a continuously moving story, which worked very well for me. In addition, the liner story bypassed the convoluted presentation the first movie had, which I think is a victory for most. The Action: Since the reboot of Ghost Protocol, the MI series has really found its roots in the action genre, which works very well for me. Much of the pace of the films has to do with the amount of action in this piece and the numerous sequences it contains of spy warfare. Exciting vehicle changes, some gunplay, and ruthless physical combat await the audience members in this piece and this dynamic change of action theme further strengthened the film. Of course, the special effects and sound editing helped bring the scenes to life, alongside a supporting music list, which gave it the theater worthy quality. Yes, the action is certainly the selling point of the movie and will win the hearts of adrenaline junkies like me to no fault. The Comedy: Again, the writers have done their homework and accomplished a balance of funny meeting thriller. MI 6 does not rely on cheap gimmicks to deliver its laughs, but instead is a display of the art of comedic timing, non-grandiose acting, and simple facial mechanics to deliver the gold. To integrate it into the scenes without diverging too far is an added bonus that I relish to see in future installments. DISLIKES: Cheesy at Times: My friend was right on one level; the MI series continues to get cheesier with every rendition. This isn't a total bad thing, but Fallout sort of crosses into that territory more than the other installments for me (at least form what I remember). It follows a lot of stereotypical spy gimmicks, including the ability to somehow stretch 15 minutes into 45 minutes by some form of magic. In addition, the corniness starts to come in the extreme stunts and nearly invincible forms of the agents until that one special wound. Don't mind this? Fantastic! However, the MI series needs to keep check or risk falling into the obscure stunts laid out by Fast and Furious. Predictable: They tried to throw curve balls our way, utilizing the art of multiple deceptions and suggestions to lead us astray of the true plot. A noble effort indeed, but the film is still a very predictable tale to say the least. Some of this comes from the fact that the movie's linearity is just leading us to the final point and you know deep down something good is going to happen. Another component comes from the fact the five trailers have shown a good majority of clips that you can search for in the 150 minutes. Yet for me, the movie almost tried too hard to throw too many twists into the mix, resulting in lackluster revelations (some of which were buried in jargon conversation). The series had moments to really surprise, they just didn't quite execute them. The Length: Sure, an action filled dynamic was able to lighten much of the load, but that doesn't mean the movie still isn't long. MI 6 is not for the ADD, and may require several trips to the bathroom if you guzzle down your drinks. This is a dislike only because there were some areas that it could have tightened up, as well as several places to end the movie for another sequel. Had they utilized the time better, I think I could have given it higher, but hey, you do get your money's worth right?New Characters: A few were used well, and others not so much. Fallout introduces new pieces to the game that hold potential, but we haven't quite seen their full capabilities unleashed yet on screen. Future installments will hopefully hold the keys to their influences and lethality, but at this stage of the game they were nearly pointless for me for the length they were focused on. 
The VERDICT: This installment of the MI series is a nuclear blast of action packed stunts, mixed well with an expanded story, good acting, and strong writing by the team. It certainly is one of the more exciting spy thrillers and will fuel the drive to stick it to the end. As the fallout begins to occur though, the lengthy time may wear on you, especially given the predictable, and semi grandiose, elements of the movie that ironically needed some restructuring. Still, all the excitement and special effects nets this movie a must see in theaters for the experience award, and is currently the leader for the month of July for me. Catch it fast before the next rush of movies my friends, or await the rent on Netflix. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Thriller: 8.5

103,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Mission: Impossible - Fallout,7,7 August 2018,"I haven't seen an M:I flick since J.J. Abrams got behind the lens in 2006's Mission: Impossible III. It's now 12 years later and I'm glad I decided to revisit this juggernaut of a techie gag franchise. Heck, star Tom Cruise at a Rob Lowe-like age of 56, is a lifetime away from any AARP BS here.So yeah, I'm talking about Mission: Impossible - Fallout (my latest review). It has to do with something about plutonium cores and saving places like Jerusalem and the Vatican from nuclear destruction. Cruise and company are back to light it up. They give you a brisk 147 minutes of pure adrenaline, pure poetry, lush locales, and some seriously deluxe, motion camerawork. Sure ""Fallout"" contains numerous twists which appear as though the screenwriters are making stuff up as they go along. And yes, the scenes between all the visceral mayhem seem like languid preludes or clear setups. Oh well. With Mission: Impossible - Fallout, it's all about the steadily forced engagement sequences that take a big fat dump on the concept of CGI. You know the ones where the director gives Cruise's Ethan Hunt tailor made chances to survive by the skin of his teeth. There's an aerodynamic motorcycle chase so brilliantly filmed by Christopher McQuarrie, you feel like you're in it and living it. There's also an in-your-face helicopter pursuit (and crash) that no human being could survive (but of course Hunt does). Finally, there's a bathroom fistfight segment with punches and bone cracks so loud, you might need earplugs. For reasons clearly evident, ""Fallout"" contains some of the most fearless and most outlandish stunt work I've seen in many a moon. I'm remember turning to talk to my friend at the theater and whispering, ""are you seeing this dude, seriously?""Anyway, ""Fallout's"" acting standouts include of course Tom Cruise (except when he's talking to himself in airborne fashion) plus Henry Cavill and Sean Harris as would-be villains. As for director Christopher McQuarrie, well his staging of action is up there with some of the greats (I'm talking John Woo, William Friedkin, George Miller, and John McTiernan. All for different reasons). Too bad McQuarrie's mumbled script, predetermined chaos, and messy narrative for ""Fallout"" fail to measure up. Still worth a recommendation though. Rating: 3 stars.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
104,rannynm,Fantastic! Filled with Adrenaline-pumping Action! Best in the MI series,10,28 July 2018,"So far, this summer's action and adventure films have been very boring. However, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is far from boring. It's full of adrenaline-pumping action! I believe that this is the best summer action / adventure film of the year and the best Mission Impossible film to date.In this film, we see Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) as he receives a mission he chooses to accept, but fails to complete, because of an ambush. As a result, Ethan and his IMF team must work together with the CIA and other familiar allies to stop Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), John Lark (Henry ) and his group, known as the Apostles, from trying to execute a nuclear threat to the world.What I really enjoyed about this film are the sound designs, stunts, plot, cast and all the mind-blowing illusions IMF uses to trick the bad guys. I must say, the sound design is fantastic. The audio for explosions and gunshots sound authentic. It sounds so real that I felt as if I was in the scene. The stunts are intense because, if you don't already know, Tom Cruise does all of his stunts. When he performs them, it is hard to watch since he jumps off of many things such as planes and buildings. I felt so nervous that these stunt are real. The stunts are so nerve racking because most of the movie isn't made with CGI's, so most of the stunts are done exactly how the movie shows it. The story is very interesting. I like that you really don't need to see the other films to understand what goes on in this one.The cast overall is superb. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are excellent as the IMF, since every delivery is spot on. I like that Benji is the most nervous character and you feel what he feels when a dangerous event happens. Also I enjoyed the performance of Sean Harris, who really brings in the mystery of this character, since he doesn't speak a lot until the end of the film. Rebecca Ferguson, as Ilsa Faust, makes a great curious assassin, since she always goes the opposite way of the IMF and always finds something different and important, which helps the IMF. Also, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin's performances as Erica and Alan are fantastic. I like how their relationship is shown as contradictors, because they both argue their own points. It is a shame we don't get to see more of this in the film. Henry Cavill, as August Walker, is also fantastic. I like how Ethan and August have different ideas about what they should do in the missions and they both try to incorporate their ideas, but those ideas come at a cost.I really like how each scene feels more intense than the last scene. At one point, I thought that the movie was going to end a certain way and I was so nervous about what was going to happen that I almost fell out of my seat. Finally, what I extremely like about this movie is the tricks the IMF use to trick the bad guys. In certain scenes I was surprised that it was an illusion. My favorite illusion is the masked one where Benji wears a mask that allows him to look like anyone.This movie had a lot of great things going for it. The only thing I did not like about it is that it shows way too much in its trailer. However, it is fantastic. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to people who like action / adventure and thriller movies. I recommend it gor ages 13 to 18, as well as adults.Reviewed by Ryan R., KIDS FIRST!

106,Easygoer10,Pitifully Predictable,4,24 June 2020,"Unlike nearly all ""sequel-type"" films, this is one which I have enjoyed....to a point. MI 4 ""Ghost Protocol"" was excellent. I found ""Fallout"" to be almost as ridiculous as could be. It had the required ""Tom Cruise running fast"" scene and a jump (which he broke his ankle doing). If you want to see ""jump action"", watch the best: David Belle (the master of parkour) in ""District 13: Ultimatum"" (2009). Even stranger was Henry Cavill being cast as an antagonist. Typically this is reserved for A-list actors past their prime. I like the idea of using people who are typically cast as protagonists to be bad guys. For example, take Ewan McGregor in ""Son of a Gun"" (2015); a brilliant film. However, in Cavill's case, this simply does not work. He looks like a fish out of water. I think it would be great if Cruise was the antagonist. Sadly, I noticed MI 7 and MI 8 films ""announced"". Give it up, people. Cruise needs to step out of his happy place and play a really bad person. Bad Robot, indeed.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
107,Kingslaay,Did I watch the same movie as the critics?,6,4 August 2018,"The latest Mission impossible installment was adequate in showing great action scenes, suspense and decent acting. However it is certainly not the best in the franchise. The main reason is the super complicated and quite flawed plot of the film. Just because the writers understand it does not mean the whole audience will. It is thus bizarre that a number have raved about this film when there is a good chance not all of it made sense to you either. It starts off normally enough with a mission gone wrong when the plutonium is not captured. Then the plot becomes messy. The motive of why the predictable bad guy Henry Cavill is not revealed. We do not know why he one day woke up and decided the 'old order' needs to be replaced by the 'new order'. The lack of motive as well as no valid reason Solomon Lane or Walker kill Ethan Hunt is given besides Solomon wants to take revenge? Even though he likely had many chances before to do take it but doesn't it. For this and other reasons the plot collapses on itself. The plot is complicated, messy and badly written. Inception was a complicated film but it was well written and made sense. Besides the impressive action scenes, stunts and views this is one of the weakest additions in the franchise. It is not as good as ghost protocol and rogue nation.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
108,pc95,More of the Same,6,2 September 2018,"Mission Impossible Fallout"" had some hot-air hype going for it. ""Top shelf or some of the best stunts in cinema"", many reviews boasted. True, not really. The stunts ar respectable but the action and plot are old hat. No the movie is may not be as good as its next older sibling. Its not a bad movie per se, but I should have kept my expectations lower. II'll put the blame on myself for letting the hype get my curiosity going. As far as Tom Cruise movies go, his recent Sci-Fi movies Oblivion and Edge of Tomorrow are a notch or two better than his Mission Impossible franchise popcorn-fest. If you like the Mission Impossible series, you'll probably like this movie, but don't expect anything extroardinary. 6.5/10.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The action was top notch along with the epic fight scenes! There were some pretty cool charterers in this film & loads of twists & turns!But the main problem I had with this film was that by the end it dragged!

112,shakercoola,Implausible as ever but remarkable for its stuntwork and sheer exhilaration,7,27 July 2018,"An American action adventure; A story about an agent of a covert American government intelligence agency called IMF, whose order is to infiltrate a criminal organisation and thwart a dastardly plan to detonate plutonium devices. But, not is all that it seems when he joins forces with the CIA. This sixth installment never forgets its MO - to entertain, and it easily works as a stand alone film requiring only a smidgeon of prior backstory. It has superb staging, a combination of spycraft, intrigue and action. It's as convoluted as the wiring mechanism on a nuclear device, but it still manages to keep the viewer's interest with boldness and confidence in its storytelling, thrilling races against time and trademark surprises. It is all buffed smoothly with a stirring soundtrack.The film's appeal boils down to the visceral - the stunts. Although there isn't a series defining sequence like with the original, Cruise admirably performing many of his own stunts provide a renewed interest in this subgenre. It's a bit too long as a film and the plot takes some following too. The third act drags amid escalating absurdity, a combination of one part fatigue and one part thrill as one high octane sequence follows another.
As an aside, it is worth noting that Tom Cruise is as old here as Roger Moore was in his final outing as a fantasy spy a generation earlier. Both had charisma which is the glue that makes these films work more than anything else. No one hustles harder than Cruise in these films. He will probably receive a lifetime award for 'human special effect' by some film academy in years to come.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
113,Abdulxoxo,Spectacular action but too many plot twists,7,6 February 2021,"The cast and the action set pieces were terrific. Tom Cruise as the titular character Ethan Hunt is really cool. Him performing his own stunts is just amazing. We also see some great performances from the supporting ensemble. The returning characters of Benji Dunn, Luther Stickell and Ilsa Faust were all fantastic. Also impressive were the new inductees to the franchise August Walker and the White Widow. This franchise, however, is best known for its great action sequences. In this film, there are so many amazing sequences that from beginning to end it's an almost non-stop thrill ride. There's a fantastically choreographed fight scene in a bathroom, a motorbike chase through the streets of Paris, a thrilling skydive, a helicopter battle, shootouts, the obligatory Tom Cruise trademark running scene and much more to keep you on the edge of your seat. As far as action set pieces go, this film surely delivers. However, the plot is mostly forgettable and fairly predicable, and is full of twists and turns to the point where you're never really sure what a number of the characters' agendas truly are. That said, because the films are so much fun, it's not a major obstacle to enjoying them. Overall, At the end of the day it's another addition to the already great franchise of films where the plot is fine, but the set pieces are excellent",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

I could even say it deserves it's Rotten Tomatoes rating of 9.7. The talking was fast and intelligent, though hard to keep up with. It was all mixed with humor and fun. I found myself wanting to instead put on an intelligent spy movie or something. I just couldn't keep up nor did I want to.The stunts I am sure were absolutely amazing.

117,leftbanker-1,This 1960's TV Show Has Always Been Stupid,1,15 September 2018,"So it's been many, many years since I've seen one of these moronic franchises, but I have a decent memory so I was expecting the worst. The movie delivers the worst right from the beginning.They still do the completely ridiculous stunt from the old 1960's TV in which the mission is secretly delivered, the protagonist listens (and now watches) his upcoming assignment, is given the option of passing on this one (your mission, if you choose to accept it), and then it self-destructs in five second. This is totally moronic in the digital age, but the knuckle-draggers want to see a little smoke if they can't get a spectacular explosion. Instead of the device burning up or exploding, wouldn't it be a lot more fun (and cinematic!) if they had a huge truck come by and bury the device in horse manure? Hooray for Hollywood!He arrives at a meet-up with a guy with plutonium in an alley, because that's just the best way to buy nuclear bomb material. The scene is just about the dumbest thing you are ever going to see at the Cineplex this year or last year. ""Oops, I forgot the plutonium.""I have a rule and it's always correct: if the trailer for a movie has more than one explosion, the movie is a bomb (and not ""The Bomb""). This one has many explosions...in the opening credits. They actually have a trailer for the movie at the beginning of this ridiculous movie.Flash forward to the next action scene (because the story is WAY too stupid to spend anything but the bare minimum of screen time). It's in a men's public bathroom that looks like it's in the Google headquarters, a nice quiet place for a cheesy martial arts sequence. Except it's a huge disco which means the bathrooms would be completely full all the time-small point, but still...and they did a HALO jump to get there for no real reason.The only vaguely interesting thing about the scene is that Tom C gets his butt handed to him by an Asian guy. The fighting is a complete insult to me because I actually know something about hand-to-hand combat, but it will wow 13 year old boys. The Asian guy grabs a pistol when they are on the ground wrestling. Tom C grabs the guy's wrist. Nope, don't ever do that. Grab the barrel...always grab the barrel.The story is the usual MI stuff about saving the world for humanity and should have been left for dead in that same public toilet. They simply string action scenes together with no thought about what comes between them.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
118,Troy_Campbell,High-calibre action cinema.,9,9 August 2018,"The vast majority of movie franchises suffer from diminishing returns. This Tom Cruise-led action series has avoided that common downturn by turning in ridiculously ambitious, consistently fresh and eminently exhilarating thrill rides. The sixth M:I entry, Fallout also boasts some firsts: first time a director has returned, first time the story has been directly influenced by the previous instalment, and first time a femme fatale has come back to seduce/endanger our protagonist. A big part of the franchise's success has been the revolving door of directors at the helm, each bringing their own visual style and filmmaking priorities, so it's interesting to see how Christopher McQuarrie attacks his second impossible mission behind the camera. Not surprisingly, seeing as McQuarrie has always been a more blunt-force kind of action filmmaker, this sequel is arguably the most bruising and intense. Which is no small feat for a series that has prided itself on its physical demanding set pieces. There are no less than four sequences that are genuinely jaw-dropping in their execution, featuring crunching hand-to-hand combat, an invigorating car/motorbike pursuit, an adrenaline-pumping roof-top chase on foot, and a ballsy helicopters-playing-chicken sequence beginning with an unbelievable stunt. Love him or hate him offscreen, it's getting harder to argue that Cruise isn't one of the finest showmen working in Hollywood today. His dedication to performing some of the craziest stunts committed to celluloid is admirable and, quite simply, amazing considering his age. But it wouldn't be the hugely entertaining film it is if everyone wasn't firing on all cylinders; from the pitch-perfect supporting cast (Simon Pegg's comedic sidekick, Rebecca Ferguson's MI6 agent, Henry Cavill's undiplomatic CIA henchman) to the behind the scenes crew. In fact composer Lorne Balfe deserves special mention for his left-of-field score, the use of low, haunting orchestral tunes (including a fantastic rendition of the classic M:I theme) during select sequences is a masterstroke in imbuing the movie with a certain gravitas. With everyone at the top of their game, headlined by another fervent Cruise performance, Fallout is extremely high-calibre action cinema that will feature predominantly on end-of-year 'best' lists.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
119,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Mission Impossible: Fallout is easily comparable to the best James Bond movies.,10,27 August 2018,"**Warning: Spoilers Ahead**Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie returns to direct the next instalment of the Mission Impossible series; and he already did a great job with Rogue Nation and he's not showing any indication of running out of creative gas.Mission Impossible: Fallout was probably one of the most entertaining experiences I've had at the movies in a long time: the set pieces are phenomenal especially the Paris sequence, and the helicopter finale is great while also being entertaingly implausible, because who'd have thought that choppers could become bumper cars when they're crashed and about to fall off the edge of a cliff, all while Tom Cruise is trying to disarm the nukes from Henry Cavill, Superman himself.Fallout is great modern cinema: sure it's contrived in terms of the elaborate schemes in parts of the movie but it's well-done and amusing contrived as opposed to something like mockbuster films where clueless directors pad-out their films with awkward exposition. Mission Impossible: Fallout is clever in its use of the franchise's legacy and using the set-pieces to show how epic and implausible the scenarios can truly be in these movies. It doesn't matter though; their purpose is to entertain you and show that Ethan Hunt is willing to save anyone and everyone, like that French Police Woman he saves from some thugs. Showing Ethan do something selfless as that shows how great a guy he truly is, even if he proceeds to drive on the wrong side of the Parisian traffic.Fallout is an action movie that is easily one of 2018's best and it's sure to have a lasting impression on you long after you've seen it. It's pop-art that is self aware yet clever in how it subverts what you've come to expect from these kind of movies. 5/5 Stars.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
120,ketgup83,Tom Cruise Steals The Thunder And He Is Just 56 !!!,9,28 July 2018,"Mission Impossible - FallOut adds more shine to the franchise, which was started 22 years ago, makes the stunt more realistic and adrenaline-pumping. Tom Cruise does all the stunt by himself and good god, he is just 56 years old.In the sixth edition, Hunt and his team have to race against time to track down a dangerous terrorist named Solomon Lane, who is planning to strike on the world with global nuclear destruction.Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who also made Jack Reacher and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015), Mission Impossible - FallOut brings out the real action and stunts infused into the film. The movie opens with Ethan Hunt saving his friend, Luther, but losing the track of plutonium bomb which takes his team right from Paris to London and finally concluding in Kashmir. The makers have ensured that all scenes performed by Cruise himself is as real as possible. The plane scene where Tom Cruise performs a halo jump from a military aircraft which requires specialized equipment and substantial training, is jaw-dropping. In the bike-chase action scene in Paris, Cruise gets hit by a car and rolls-over couple of time before he makes himself stable, is probably one of best action sequence I have seen in my life in any movie. Similarly, in the roof-top scene in London, Cruise is required to run and jump from the roof of one building onto the next one, proves that he is probably the best in the business (he actually breaks his ankle during the shooting). Even the climax scene with helicopter chasing, beautifully shot in New Zealand, will keep you on the edge of the seat. Kudos to the mind blowing choreography and adrenaline rush stunts for making the action sequences look so natural while Tom Cruise should be lauded for his death-defying stunt.The action-adventure does have its share of flaw as well. The length of the film is too long with running time of 2 hours 27 minutes and should easily be trimmed. The plot, with lot of twist and turns, of the film is a standard one but screenplay falters during the second half. The cat and mouse game should have handled efficiently. In spite of few shortcomings, the film manages to keep you on engaged with witty humor and performances. Cinematography is eye- catching. Art direction is mesmerizing.Tom Cruise is just awesome, to be precise. The actor not only performs his own stunts, he is so enduring in his role that you would hardly think of any other actor doing the part of Ethan Hunt. Henry Cavill does well in the supporting role. The rest of star cast do justice to their part.Mission Impossible - FallOut is one of the best film in the 22 year-old franchise. Go for it if you want to get pumped-up, enjoy yourself and of course if you are a Tom Cruise fan. Excellent : 4/5",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
121,Prashast_Singh,And the award for the best action movie goes to...,10,27 July 2018,"Let's get straight to the point: MISSION IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT justifies the need to watch action movies on the big screen. Every single action scene works, particularly the final one. Tom Cruise never disappoints when it comes to fighting, chasing and of course, running! He officially killed it in this movie!It was a pleasure to see Henry Cavill join the show. All actors were impressive as well, but he was very effective throughout the movie. MISSION IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT showcases a perfect blend of breathtaking action, eye-catching locations and exhilarating cinematography combined with suspenseful thrills. Even though the summer's come to an end, the film made me feel it just started!I don't think just one viewing is going to satisfy me. Halfway through the film and I was thinking of a second watch. IMAX viewing totally justified.When I watched the previous 3 MI movies back-to-back yesterday, I had no idea I'd be in a complete treat today! I knew FALLOUT would be great, but it just surprised and surpassed all my expectations!I can talk about this movie all day. I love action movies and this is easily one of the best ones I've seen this year. Apart from entertainment, it also provides lessons on how to make action movies, efficiently. It couldn't have been any better than this. I would easily label this as my finest IMAX experience of an action blockbuster, ever.In one word, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT is PERFECT. Recommended catching it on an IMAX screen.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
122,vithiet,"Great action movie, true to the quality this franchise has gotten us used to",9,29 December 2018,"At some point Tom Cruise is riding the same bike I have and he crashes. That made me very sad (fist to heart, peace sign to sky). Other than that, this is as good as action movies can get, perfect in IMAX. This franchise is the only one that never disappoints and by now they got the formula to a T: great cast, awesome action sequences, fantastic pacing and they're pushing the limits of impossible (haha I so funny) situations just enough that we stand at the edge of suspension of disbelief without falling over.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
123,kevin c,"Action, action",7,2 December 2018,"Movie night with Iris.This is rip-roaring fun, and an unashamed gem. The Mission: Impossible films don't have any hang-up's about cannon. It's spectacular action pieces, that seem rooted in realism. I remember nowt about the previous five, and it just doesn't matter. The plot's wafer thin, but it doesn't matter. You get the gist.Henry Cavill is a great love-hate bromance, then evil foe. Indeed it's one of those films in which heroes and villains are continually blurred. We are never sure who is trying to kill Ethan, who is trying to help him and who is simply there for the money.So chill and enjoy the set pieces, there are too many to mention. The stand-off in a car park, brutal fight sequence in the gents, a riveting motorbike chase through the streets of Paris, a rooftop chase from St Paul's Cathedral to the Tate Modern, helicopter battle; and a clifftop climax.Invigorating viewing, just wish we'd had more of the theme tune.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
124,educallejero,The best of the franchise,9,1 March 2021,"After a good, but not great start in the franchise, McQuarrie creates the best combination of the good that came before him, with a better script that even MI-I, the unstoppable action of MI-3, good humor without going over the top contrary to MI-4, and those romantic touches that help the movie to slow down and feel a bit for the characters.I think there is one part of the movie, Vanessa Kirby's character and its plot, that is really questionable. Other than that, the movie is just a great all-around action blockbuster.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
125,rockman182,Mission Impossible: Fallout (2018),8,2 August 2018,"The Mission Impossible series is a really solid action franchise. With the exception of the second film, the rest offer good fun and nice twists, basically the perfect summer popcorn movie. Early reviews for Fallout were super. I heard people calling it the best action film of all time, and also the best in the series. Thus, this film became my most hyped for the summer. After watching, I'm not sure if its the greatest action film of all time (though the action is admittedly insane) but it is my favorite of the series.Ethan Hunt returns once again with his crew but this time three nuclear plutonium cores have been stolen and Hunt must find out how to retrieve these devices. Along the way, he must partner with a mysterious assassin (played by mustached Henry Cavill) and gets involved in a high risk international plot involving many set pieces. Sounds familiar to the other films and it is in most respects. However, there is a lot that is improved upon and I think its with distinction that this is the most well made film in the series.The cinematography is excellent. The on site locale is a wonder to behold, and the effects and location blends in very well on screen. The action scenes are insanely good. Its almost jaw-dropping that this film can achieve higher levels to its already insane action. The fight scenes are intense and so crisp. Love him or hate him, you have to applaud Tom Cruise's commitment to the film, even if it means taking a bump and getting hurt.The film is oddly low in humor, which is something that is ever present in big budget films these days. This wasn't problematic at all for me. MI 6 is definitely a film where you want to pay close attention to every bit of dialogue and seen, because its easily to get lost in the intricacies of the plot. I wholeheartedly enjoyed this effort though. The score is a perfect accompaniment to the action in the film. I think the bathroom fight scene and the car scene are as good as it gets when it comes to filmed chase and fight scenes.Absolutely everything doesn't work as some characters fade away into the background. The film is also long, so you're in for a trip. Its enjoyable though. I had plenty of fun with this and do recommend it for fans of the franchise and cinematic thrill seekers. Its a very well made action film that goes the extra mile and by far the best in the franchise, for me anyways. How often can you say the sixth in a franchise is the best?8/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

127,jon.h.ochiai,He's a Good Man,10,30 July 2018,"Virtually ageless Tom Cruise is back as fearless Agent Ethan Hunt in ""Mission: Impossible-Fallout"". ""Fallout"" may be the best summer movie of 2018. I think Writer and Director Christopher McQuarrie's ""Mission: Impossible"" sequel is one of the best action movies of all-time. Tom performs all of his own stunts like skydiving out of a military cargo jet over Paris in the helmeted pressure suit. In fact production on ""Fallout"" halted when Tom broke his ankle leaping between buildings. Rob Hardy's breathtaking and pristine cinematography captures the adrenaline rush as Tom races on his motorcycle through cluttered traffic in Paris or when he soars his helicopter to catch his adversary's over the snow capped mountains of Kashmir. McQuarrie electrifies in the restroom fight scene as Tom and Henry Cavill's Agent Walker throw down with martial arts expert Liang Yang. Relentless punches, elbows, and kicks awe for several minutes. Christopher's ""Fallout"" is by far the best ""Mission: Impossible"", elevated in pulse pounding action accelerating throughout 2 hours and 30 minutes. Chris's story is nearly too convoluted in its betrayal. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised in its emotional gravitas, and Tom Cruise's authentic humanity. The good man is the Hero. In a signature scene, an innocent women police officer stops Ethan and his team's escape. While Ethan convinces the officer to let them pass, a villain mercilessly shoots her down. Enraged, Ethan shoots down all five men. Character can be fate. Ethan's dearest friend Luther, played by powerful quiet Ving Rhames, tells Ilsa, played by beautiful strong Rebecca Ferguson, that Ethan loved only one woman before her. That he let Julia, played by beautiful kind Michele Monaghan, go keeping her safe, so he could save the world. Luther says, ""He's a good man. If you care about Ethan, walk away..."" Ethan is the hero, who gave up the love of his life to save the world. That's the high price to pay, even for the noble cause. The Hero deserves better. Tom Cruise passionately enrolls in Ethan's tireless conviction to do what's right, and protect the innocent. Tom's unspoken sadness in Ethan too, resonates. As ""Fallout"" opens Ethan messes up his mission to recover three weapons grade plutonium cores, when he chooses to save the life of his friend. New IMF (Impossible Mission Force - I think) Lead Alan, played by solid Alec Baldwin, reminds Ethan of his tragic flaw: he chose ""one life over millions"". I'd say that's more honor and compassion. No longer trusting Ethan, CIA Head Erica, played by smart bold Angela Bassett, mandates that her best Agent Walker, played with humorlessly ironic strength by Henry Cavill, accompany him in the plutonium recovery. Ethan and Walker's mission leads to the mysterious anarchist Lane, played by eerie calm Sean Harris. Lane believes, ""The greater the suffering, the greater the peace."" Ethan and Walker form reluctant alliance with notorious arms broker White Widow, played cleverly by beautiful cunning Vanessa Kirby. So Ethan once again accepts his mission to save the world from annihilation. Strangely, this time around is wondrously captivating. In Tom's authentic sense of Ethan's loss, we get the depth of what's at stake for him. Yes, Ethan valiantly risks his life to prevent the nuclear terrorist threat. But does he find peace at the end of his great suffering? Does he discover love again? Ethan is a good man. He deserves peace. He deserves love. Ethan is like all of us. ""Mission: Impossible- Fallout"" is spectacular thrills in one of the best ever action movies. What makes ""Fallout"" so satisfying is that we pull for the Hero to find peace, to find love.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
128,phanthinga,Most overrated action movie of 2018,6,9 December 2018,I heard so many great things about Mission: Impossible - Fallout and when 2018 about comes to an end it also dub as the best action movie of 2018 by many people so it pretty natural when some group of people find this movie overrated and as a fan of Tom Cruise and the Mission Impossible franchise it sad for me to say this but I'm also a part of that group now when I finally got the chance to watch it at home.The story felt flat to me and all of the characters (even Ethan Hunt) are so boring to watch except Ving Rhames as the hacker Luther a character I hardly care for before this movie.The movie is beautiful shot to look at and the action and stunts work by Tom Cruise definitely the highlight of the movie but aside from all that everything else is just above average,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
129,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A Mission: Impossible film that almost has too much action and too much plot.,7,8 March 2019,"It's a little weird to think that we're already on the sixth Mission: Impossible movie, especially considering how far the franchise has come since (what I consider) its revival in Mission: Impossible III (2006). Since then, the action has been consistently impressive and the stunts mind-bogglingly intense. Fallout continues to provide on this franchise's promise of high-octane action and neat spy tech, even if the latter doesn't seem to be nearly as impressive as in its previous installments. Ironically enough, one of the problems I had with this movie was how it tried to interweave plot from previous films in the franchise.I'll be honest and say that I don't watch these movies for the plot. Sure, I'll follow along to see how the team has to accomplish the ""impossible"" in the form of setting up a ridiculous stunt. From scaling tall buildings in Dubai, accessing computer servers underwater, and hanging above the floor of a highly secure room, these set pieces were always what drew me to this series. The main characters were pretty memorable, but I honestly couldn't tell you about any of the tangential characters, especially the previous villains or love interests. And that's where Fallout lost me.While this film was also jam-packed with action, I also felt there was probably one sequence too many, and each of the action scenes were probably 10% too long. It was a bit exhausting having to sit through almost 2.5 hours of bathroom fights, car chases, and helicopter acrobatics. The stunts do look quite impressive, and it is clear that Cruise does most (if not all) of the stunts here. Although, at this point, I'm wondering if Cruise has it in his contract for this series to have his ""running"" scenes in these movies, as it seems to be an additional trademark of the franchise.A Mission: Impossible film that almost has too much action and too much plot, I give Mission: Impossible - Fallout 3.5 stars out of 5.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
130,RforFilm,"Your mission, should you chose to accept it, should be to watch the beautiful shot and adrenaline filled Mission Impossible: Fallout",9,31 July 2018,"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to see how far Tom Cruise is willing to push himself. Tom Cruise, regardless of his mysterious personal life, has to be one of the hardest working actors in Hollywood. His ageless face (I swear, he has not aged since the early 2000's) along with his willingness to pull off crazy stunts, has kept him in the spotlight in an age where movies have had to compete with better television and streaming content. Yeah, he'll have an occasional misfire like Knight & Day and whatever The Mummy was supposed to be, but he may be one of the last ""A-name stars"" that have the same draw that stars of the golden years like Kirk Douglass and Jimmy Stewart. The Mission Impossible movies are not only his most successful film series, could be argued as one of the most successful adaptations of a TV show. In fact, when I mentioned this to a movie theater employee, he had no idea that it was based on an 1980s show. Whether it follows it closely is anyone's guess, as I haven't watched it. But if future movies are a lot like Mission Impossible: Fallout, then Tom Cruise should be safe. IMF agent Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) accepts a mission to intercept a group of terrorists called The Apostles (made up from the remnant's of The Syndicate from the previous movie) from selling plutonium. Along with Benji (played by Simon Pegg) and Luther (played by Ving Rhames), he tries, but fails to protect the plutonium cores from disappearing. He does get an idea from a nuclear weapons expert where they may be sold; Paris. The IMF is scolded by CIA director Erica Sloane (played by Angela Bassett) for their failure, and thus has CIA operative agent August Walker (played by Henry Cavill) shadow them. For their next mission, Hunt and Walker HALO jump into Paris to intercept the dealer, only to also encounter Ilsa Faust (played by Rebecca Ferguson), another agent from the previous movie. They all agree to work to meet with the arms dealer, only to encounter The Apostles as well. On top of that, even the CIA doubts Ethan Hunt enough that they suspect that he could be turning sides. The race is on for Hunt to find the plutonium cores and prove he's still the biggest adrenaline junkie in all of Hollywood. I'm glad to say that Mission Impossible: Fallout is phenomenal! Is it the best of the series? On its own, I still think Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol was perfect. As part of the bigger story, this does build upon the themes of complications of government agencies in conflict. It just happens that this is the better movie. Not only are the stunts more memorable, but the pacing is better and more align with a spy thriller. It helps that director Christopher McQuarrie has staged much of the action that does reveal that there aren't any wires or CGI replicating. Even if that's not the case, it manages to keep us in constant suspense with not too many edits. The HALO jump especially look cool as it's done in one long take. Tom Cruise remains as charismatic as before. This really isn't much of an acting challenge as he's basically playing himself. He makes up for it in overall charm, his adrenaline rubbing off on all the stunts, and even the occasional humor. His lack of fear could have derided another performer, but something about Cruise's method makes it work. I think it's that he genuinely does seem to have fun hanging off of helicopters and jumping across buildings. I mentioned before the this follows the story of Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation, but that is mainly on the villain Solomon Lane, who played by Sean Harris, has made for this series equivalent to Blofeld in the 007 series. Though it's pretty obvious how things are going to turn out, his overall confidence and intimidation does make you suspend that for the duration. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are just as entertaining. Rebacca Ferguson has a lot of awesome moments. Without spoiling anything, let's say that Henry Cavill does pose a challenge for Tom Cruise.Let's give this nine helicopter chases out of ten. This is certainly one of the best in the series (though Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol still ranks slightly higher). You don't need to have seen the others to enjoy this, though it does help to have seen the previous one. You get enough of an idea of who these people are to enjoy the story regardless. I highly recommend this and you should accept this mission.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
131,Holt344,The best Mission Impossible movie which delivers suspension and superb action sequences,10,23 July 2019,"I've to agree, this is the best Mission Impossible installment in the franchise with also the best stunt work, the fight choreography is something I have to praise as it's breathtaking and realistic, superb! Every character fight in its each unique way which make every fight different and amazing. With the change of its tone and atmosphere we get a darker installment and it works perfectly. The movie has suspense from start to finish, it's written and executed with perfection. The music score was also incredible from the instrumental music in the chase scenes to everything else, just fantastic! The writing is another thing, it's some of the best writing of the franchise as everything is thought out. The locations and sets were amazing and beautiful, they really choosed well there.Tom Cruise is just incredible in what he does, wanting to do bigger and better stunts in each movie and its just spectacular and a joy to watch him do all the stunts. Let's start with that Halo jump stunt in the beginning, Tom is the first actor to that on camera and it's just spectacular, I'm speechless yet again in his huge stunts. The rest of the movie is filled with other incredible stunts and chases that had me on the edge of my seat. The rest of the cast was also great, everyone delivering solid performances but Henry Cavill stands out the most after Tom Cruise as he just nails the character and the brute force, it was a needed character for the movie and it was well cast.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
132,carbuff,I never thought I'd say a roller-coaster ride can be too long.,6,25 August 2019,"You pretty much know exactly what you're getting when you watch ""Mission Impossible: Fallout"", and it fully delivers on its expectations. The only reason I'm marking it down to 6 stars from 7 is that it never knows when to stop delivering. At its heart, this film is nothing more than one major action sequence forcibly shoved right into another one; unfortunately, it seems like every time a particular scene is building to a ridiculous but semi-sensible crescendo, you discover that it's really only getting started. Watching this film actually physically tires you out. There's quite a bit of violence and death, although none of it feels the slightest bit real; however, I very strongly suspect that the actual film editor was somehow killed during production. Of course, the plot makes no real sense, and you could easily fly a C-130 through the plot holes with Ethan Hunt dangling out the back on a mile-long rope, but then that's fully expected from any film in this franchise. I don't regret watching it, because I went in with my eyes open, but the experience would have been so much better if it were 20-30 minutes were shorter. I'm just exhausted and so is the person I watched this with. Mae West might have felt that ""Too much of a good thing can be wonderful"", but this isn't one of those cases.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
133,juliankennedy23,Cruise... Cruise never changes,9,28 August 2019,"Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018): 9 out of 10. The Bond series has been flaying around bleeding in the water for years and no action franchise has taken bigger chunks out of it than Mission Impossible. (Fast and Furious is a close second).The Good: The recent main appeal of the Mission Impossible franchise is to watch the seemingly ageless space Jesus Tom Cruise attempt to kill himself in various ways. Mission Impossible: Fallout does not disappoint. While no particular stunt is as impressive as hanging on the side of an Airbus A400M Atlas while it takes off from the opening sequence in Mission Impossible Rogue Nation. ( Honestly my favorite stunt in any movie surpassing James Bond parachuting off the side of Mount Asgard in the opening scene of The Spy Who Loved Me. Of course, that was stunt double Rick Sylvester, not Roger Moore while all the Mission Impossible stunts seem to feature an unadulterated Tom Cruise.) The stunts in Mission Impossible Fallout are very impressive indeed.Strangely with all the impressive stunts (halo jumps, helicopter stunts, driving in Paris traffic), it was the bathroom fight scene that impressed me the most. ( Surpassing my previous favorite bathroom fight scene from the beginning of James Bond's Casino Royale... okay I will stop now) For one thing, it introduces the biggest surprise of the movie, a mustached Henry Cavill.I admit I never cared much for Henry Cavill. Of course, my only real experience was him as Superman in which he was awful. Well, that might not have been Henry's fault. In Fallout Henry Cavill is perfect. He plays his character so well you feel sorry for him and he is easily the most lovable thing in a movie with two puppy dog eyed sidekicks (Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg) and two puppy dog eyed love interests (Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan ).The location shooting is also on point in Mission Impossible Fallout with a particular kudos for using all of Paris and not just the five-minute highlight tour. The movie has a very good sense of place and time and the plot is practically followable if we are grading on a curve that is previous Mission Impossible movies.The Bad: Supporting characters seem to be a chink in the armor of the Mission Impossible movies. Henry Cavill (lauded above) and Simon Pegg get an easy pass. On the villianish side, Vanessa Kirby as Lady Gaga and Sean Harris as the Unibomber both put in great work. I thought it was time for Luther (Ving Rhames) to retire in Rogue Nation and Fallout has not changed my mind (He seems more like a punch drunk kidnap victim rather than a highly trained agent).The love interests are a bit of a mess. Rebecca Ferguson is way to kittenish to be believable as an MI-6 agent that could turn on you at any moment and Michelle Monaghan comes across less than the love of Ethan Hunt's life and more like that college girlfriend who you dated before you met your wife and whose name you can't quite remember even though you lived together for eight months.My winner however for worst side character is Angela Bassett. Now Angela Bassett is a very talented actress but her character is horribly written and she doesn't help matters. It as if she saw Viola Davis' horrible performance in Suicide Squad and said ""I am going to do that""The Ugly: There is someone missing on this outing. Unfortunately, Jeremy Renner was needed on the Avengers: Endgame set, presumably to get coffee for the actual heroes, and is replaced with a now demoted Alec Baldwin whose character is handwaved to have taken that demotion from the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency to Tom Cruise's fluffer because he believes in the team.There is a scene where Alec Baldwin has a fist fight with Henry Cavill. I am not sure what they were going for here? Drama, suspense, pathos? But I am sure that the actual reaction of OMG no followed by gales of laughter was not what the director Christopher McQuarrie was aiming for.In conclusion: A very solid and rewatchable film with tons of little touches and big moments and have not even spoken of in this review. Easily the best Mission Impossible movie so far and one of the best action films of the year.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
134,bankofmarquis,"Quite possibly, the best action film of all time",9,1 August 2018,"MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: FALLOUT just might be the best action movie I have ever seen.Yes...it is that good.The 6th entry in the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE franchise, this film stars, as usual, Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, part of the IMF, a secret government entity that takes on the impossible missions that the CIA (and other agencies) won't touch. He is joined, yet again, in this installment of the franchise by his ""usual"" team, Simon Pegg (Benji), Ving Rhames (Luther), Rebecca Ferguson (Ilse) and Alec Baldwin (IMF Director Hunley). It was fun to have ""the band"" back together again. They looked like they had a good time filming this and I had a good time watching it.Jumping right in on the fun is Angela Bassett (BLACK PANTHER) as the head of the CIA, but doing more than just being a thorn in the side of Alec Baldwin. As well as Vanessa Kirby (THE CROWN) as the mysterious ""White Widow"" and, especially, Henry Cavill, who shows that he can do more than be DC's Superman.And, finally, the franchise wisely brings back Sean Harris as ""big bad"" Solomon Lane (think Bond's arch-nemesis Blofeld). He proves to be, yet again, an able adversary for the IMF team.The plot, of course, is somewhat convoluted, with twists, turns and double-crosses (by both the good and bad guys) throughout this film. If I have a quibble for this film, it is that they got a little ""cute"" with the plot twists - there was (perhaps) one or two too many ""gotchas"" - but that is just a quibble, for the plot gets us from point ""A"" to point ""B"" nicely.And when I say ""Point A"" and ""Point B"", I mean action set piece ""A"" to action set piece ""B"" (and ""C"" and ""D"" and ""E"" and ""F""...) - and boy are these action set pieces EXTRAORDINARY!Director Christopher McQuarrie (he also Directed the previous film in this franchise, ROUGE NATION) is the first person to helm two of these films - and I think it is a smart choice for he established in Rogue Nation an ability to create smart, tense action, chase and fight sequences that are easy to follow and fun to watch.Credit for most of this fun has to go to 55 year old (at the time of filming) Tom Cruise - looking every bit as fit and capable as a 35 year old Tom Cruise. He dives into the action sequences (literally) with gusto and proves more than capable of delivering the goods. Once again, he does a death-defying stunt that left me amazed.But, what I really left the theater with was an appreciation for McQuarrie, Cruise and company for delivering an end sequence that earned the build up it was given. EVERY member of the company had something to do and the action in this endpiece was a step up of anything that had come before it - either in the Mission Impossible series, or in any other action flick.If you are a fan of good, solid action films, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: FALLOUT is one to not miss.Letter Grade: A9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
135,Anurag-Shetty,This franchise just keeps getting better & better.,10,29 July 2018,"Mission: Impossible - Fallout continues with the adventures of IMF agent, Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise). Hunt & the rest of the IMF team join forces, to prevent devastating consequences from a failed mission. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is an awe-inspiring film. Returning director Christopher McQuarrie makes sure that he ups the ante from Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation(2015), in all the aspects. This movie is an edge of the seat, action-packed, pulse-pounding, non-stop thrill ride. The action set pieces are the highlight of the film. The climactic set piece especially, will leave you gobsmacked. The most impressive part of the Mission: Impossible franchise is that, all the stunts are actually performed at real locations, with very little use of green screen & visual effects. The locales are exquisite. Tom Cruise is spectacular as Ethan Hunt. The fact that Cruise performs all his own death-defying stunts, makes us love & respect him even more. Henry Cavill is superb as August Walker. Ving Rhames is great as Luther Stickell. Simon Pegg is amazing as Benji Dunn. Rebecca Ferguson is brilliant as Ilsa Faust. Sean Harris is impressive as Solomon Lane. Angela Bassett is good as Erica Sloan. Vanessa Kirby is perfect as the White Widow. Michelle Monaghan, Wes Bentley, Frederick Schmidt & Alec Baldwin are excellent as Julia Meade-Hunt, Patrick, Zola & Alan Hunley, respectively. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a must watch for Tom Cruise & Mission: Impossible fans. Go, have an absolute blast!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
136,fernandoschiavi,"Technically and emotionally, Mission: Impossible: Fallout is the first major representative of action genre",9,26 July 2020,"It was from Mission: Impossible 3 (2006) that the franchise began to strike a balance between pace (faster than the first) and history (more elaborate than the previous one). In addition, JJ Abrams' debut as a director on the big screen introduced two important secondary characters, Julia (Michelle Monaghan) and Benji (Simon Pegg) - he established himself as the second most frequent supporting actor, second only to Luther (Ving Rhames), the single that appears in all the films together with Ethan. After the well-executed Ghost Protocol (2011), commanded by Brad Bird, the series gained a very interesting touch with the arrival of Christopher McQuarrie. As a screenwriter, he smartly took advantage of the mention of the Union at the end of the previous film to develop the Rogue Nation plot (2015), which brought Ethan, Luther and Benji chasing this terrorist organization, headed by Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), and at the same time, dealing with the risk of dissolution of the IMF as a result of the Ghost Protocol events - this created a hitherto unprecedented sense of continuity between the two films.The title's Fallout has several meanings - among them 'Side Effect', 'Rest' and 'Radioactive Dust'. In the film we have a literal and figurative meaning at the same time. There is a real threat of nuclear bomb and also the consequences of the choices that our protagonist Ethan Hunt made in his life, when the past comes back to haunt him, what remains of all his good deeds. This sixth part of the franchise continues several of the situations established in the previous work, Rogue nation, also directed by Christopher McQuarrie. In addition, the filmmaker takes up other previous ideas, exploring the twists that marked the first and third films, as well as the notion of loyalty to the team members, seen in the third and fourth, and the protection of loved ones, as in the second and in the bedroom. This not only creates thematic unity in the series but also helps to reinforce the protagonist's personality.Even repeating starting points previously seen, such as the rescue of nuclear weapons, the dismantling of secret associations and the search for double agents, there is a new topic to be discussed in the ""Fallout"". Something that was always present in Hunt's story, but that had never been addressed literally: his own humanity. This is the greatest homage that the film pays to the complete saga. After all, how to forget how many times the agent has already put his life, and that of all humanity, in danger to save those he loves. That relay from before, with forgettable characters replacing forgettable characters, no longer exists. Exceptional control by the filmmaker in what he wants for the franchise, in the second film under his command, is exactly what allows Mission: Impossible - Fallout to be an apex of the genre.
McQuarrie tells a story, in the usual conspiratorial molds, being told under a superficial layer. Far from being simplistic, but also far from extreme complexity or wit, what is being told is not very impressive. The motivations for the antagonists follow, in short, the classic recipe, but the central issue is not in the functional story, however, in the exciting narrative, which drives events to another dimension and allows the Fallout to be the great achievement of the genre in which finds. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to characterize the feature film as one of the most energetic American action productions of recent years. By also having control over the script, McQuarrie invents and reinvents the antics related to the iconic twists, filling his project with countless of them, but never too much forcing them. Each turnaround is an impulse, which multiplies our interest and involvement in the film. Cinema is about action, not wanting to be anything more, with clever metaphors or some biblical allegory to show how intellectual McQuarrie is. The impossible happens on the scene, however, we do not discredit what we see, because the feature film, unlike others of the genre, has self-awareness of what it is, thus allowing the suspension of disbelief to be combined with entertainment that only values McQuarrie's work.The screenwriter and director reconstructed the genre cinema with Mission: Impossible - Fallout: the action received more dramatic layers (without plummeting to melodramas or clichés); Ethan Hunt was decentralized from the plot despite obviously being the protagonist; women received an importance ranging from the femme fatalle of Vanessa Kirby with her White Widow to the development of the fantastic Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) - who repeats her participation; the exaggerated comic relief gave way to a more restrained Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and without losing his personality; Ving Rhames with his Luther Stickell received much more importance (as it might have happened some time ago); and the villain went from being episodic and one-dimensional to being of rare complexity in action films - so rare that the last one that reached the depth of Solomon Lane (the spectacular Sean Harris) must have been Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber in the first Die Hard, 1988 (30 years ago).McQuarrie, likewise, surrenders to the film with such competence that the action scenes directed by John Woo in 2000 are instantly forgotten. That choreographed movement by Woo gives space to McQuarrie's restless camera, which, even though unstoppable, manages to be very well understood. This same camera, positioned for several counter-plunges (below eye level and facing upwards), magnifies the character of Henry Cavill (the intimidating of so big and strong August Walker) and strengthens the excellent performance of the current Superman. Here, more than ever, we see scenes of visceral struggles, of high physical vigor, impact and realism - the bathroom scene and the final fight on the precipice are the greatest examples - and they do not show that they are choreographed.The action is practically uninterrupted and if, in the end, the reminder is that the film started out slow and then started, it is a problem of perspective. This chapter extrapolates and raises to the maximum everything that has been shown so far. Christopher McQuarie's direction knows how to create magnificent action scenes mixed with tension and a sense of urgency, making the audience emotional, tense, twist and be impressed over the two and twenty hours of footage. Again we have everything and a little more than expected from the series, which improves and challenges itself more and more throughout the franchise. We have scenes of jumping from a plane in the air in a phenomenal sequence plane, chases at extremely high speed involving motorcycles, cars and trucks through the streets of Paris, the whole passage in London (highlighting the rush of Hunt and the jumps between buildings in the hunt for the villain of the production) and, obviously, the scenes in Kashmir that make up the best last act of recent cinema times, combining tension with the rest of the IMF group trying to defuse two nuclear bombs while Hunt stars in a helicopter chase that culminates in a visceral struggle on the edge of a precipice. The film abuses the practical effects and it is difficult to differentiate what has CGI from the real. Beautiful technical work.The most impressive thing is to see how Cruise still avoids the use of stunts in most scenes. Not exactly because of the difficulty of these, which are really difficult without any further obstacles, but because of their age. In one scene, the actor even broke his ankle and went uncut, limping, but firmly on his Ethan's body (and delayed filming later, of course). Cruise is undoubtedly an actor who is never limited to an ""autopilot"". Fly helicopters - and hang from them! -, driving cars at high speed, jumping over buildings and running as if there was no tomorrow, all done in the most realistic way possible, even if we are facing a character who practices impossible acts are some of his most notable feats. This without mentioning the most dramatic part that the actor knows how to conduct in full.Alec Baldwin, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames return and fit the plot very well. Other prominent returns are that of Rebecca Ferguson who returns to deepen his personal dilemmas and his relationship with Hunt, both actors have an enviable chemistry and Sean Harris who returns to give life to the villain of the previous feature, here he keeps talking little, but his ambitions are much clearer and he serves as a ""ladder"" for the real antagonist of the feature. In the new additions the one who steals the show is Henry Cavill in the role of a government agent who is tasked with watching and caring for Hunt. The actor has an enviable physique and if he is not impressed by his performance, he is not to be desired in terms of beating and other action scenes in the feature.With an accelerated and uninterrupted soundtrack composed by Lorne Balfe, referring almost directly to Hans Zimmer, it makes the Fallout clearly result in a bigger Mission: Impossible. The soundtrack that anguishes and carries us on our shoulders throughout the projection, combined with an unbelievable sound design, making us feel every punch delivered and received by Hunt, ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is the best film of all the franchise. Technically and emotionally. Mission: Impossible - Fallout wins in a historic process. In times when genre cinema has been gaining more and more space (see the horror), the action gains its first major representative.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

138,agmoldham,A surprising gem,7,14 August 2018,"I can never say that I've been a fan of the Mission Impossible movies. They always seemed a little bit like a poor effort to copy the James Bond movies. As such I went along to see the latest installment, Fallout, with mixed feelings.Well I'm pleased to say that the latest movie is the best so far. I really enjoyed the movie which had some epic action sequences and some pretty fleshed out characters. My hat is off to Christopher McQuarry who wrote and directed the movie. He seems to have breathed life into the franchise. There is real chemistry between the characters and it is a really entertaining movie. If I was to sound one note of caution it is a slightly complex movie at times where it's difficult to work out the plot. Compared to how simple some movies are though we can't really criticize a plot that requires some thinking. Great movie!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
139,MihaiSorinToma,A flawless execution of the Mission Impossible franchise,10,31 July 2018,"When the acolytes of the captured Salomon Lane take action and put their hands on three plutonium cores, agent Ethan Hunt and his crew must track them down and recover them.In typical Mission Impossible style, we're faced with many conspirations, making the viewer confused multiple times about who's on which side. Furthermore, the complex narrative manages to keep it all together, creating an unique, suspenseful atmosphere. Add plenty of action moments into the equation, accompanied by breathtaking stunts, and you get yet another great installment of this well-known franchise.The characters are complex and well played, contributing a lot to the twists and turns the plot often undergoes. It's full of emotion, drama and suspense, while being highly unpredictable, making you eager to find out the next move. As a bonus, the visuals are top notch, making it a visual delight. There isn't much to say when speaking about a movie like this. It's simply flawless, so I can only praise it as it fully deserves.Overall, I found a wonderful movie. It was on par with the expectations I had from it, even excelling in some aspects. It's full of action, drama, suspense and thrill, and together with a great cast, plot and characters, it ends up being a great movie form every point of view. A must see for fans of the genre but also for ones who haven't seen any previous installment.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
140,markthomassintek,What purpose Simon Pegg?,9,26 July 2018,"REVIEW - MISSION IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUTThe latest Ethan Hawk escapade has finally been released but is it not as good, as good or better than the previous films.That's a difficult question to answer because each of the film's had it's stand out moment, from flying a helicopter in to the channel tunnel to dropping from a great height to stop just short of the floor, one thing which does impress is that Tom Cruise does do his own stunts, even when they go wrong and are kept in the final films release, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.This film while certainly impressive in story with double crossing here and there and of course impressive in stunts for me was one of the better mission impossible films, because as we have seen with the reinvention of James Bond to be more grittier (if there is even such a word) it does payoff and mission impossible for this installment has copied suit.Yes there is technology and gadgets but for me this felt more Bourne Identity rather than Mission Impossible which I enjoyed.Certainly one to go and see.One last small thing, why Simon Pegg?Rating 9 out of 10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
141,allanmichael30,not very believerble,4,24 May 2019,This film was ok but ending seemed little boring and henry cavel was realy bad in this film. The ending failed to create the suspence of usual mission imposibles films a double helicpter crash seem so unrealistic and when you think its over it drag on and hunt still managed to stop the bombs.

142,bob-the-movie-man,Hunt on the edge... again.,8,26 July 2018,"2015's ""MI: Rogue Nation"" was one of my favourite films of that year, so of all the summer blockbusters this was the one I was most looking forward to. Was I delighted? It's a slightly qualified ""YES!"". The film neatly follows on from Rogue Nation with arch terrorist-in-need-of-a-razor Solomon Lane (Sean Harris, ""Harry Brown"") being extraordinarily renditioned (probably not a valid phrase!) between multiple countries who want to torture/punish him. But his followers - ""The Disciples"" - are still active and on the trail of plutonium that could devestate key sites, with religious centres being the top of the target list. Since Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, ""American Made"") originally caught Lane, IMF Director Hunley (Alec Baldwin, ""It's Complicated"") despatches Hunt to intercept the plutonium.But CIA director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett, ""Black Panther"") has no faith in the IMF, or trust that the organisation has not been infiltrated, and she insists that her 'heavy' August Walker (Henry Cavill, ""Man of Steel"", ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."") goes along for the ride. But they are not the only parties in play, for Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, ""The Greatest Showman"", ""Life"") is also involved. But who is she working for?What makes these films a cut above your average action adventure is the stunt work, with the knowledge that Cruise is at the centre of the action. In ""Skyscraper"" you KNOW Dwayne Johnson is standing on the 'edge' in front of a big green screen. Similarly here you KNOW Cruise is standing on the edge of the Tate Modern tower - probably without a safety line - as the camera goes 360 degrees around him. This makes all the difference to the adrenalin count. There are some outstanding set pieces in the film, with extraordinarily spectacular shots from a 'halo jump' and a dramatic helicopter finale. But it is some of the smaller stuff that really impresses: a dramatic edge-of-the-seat car and motorbike chase through central Paris is one of the most impressive and terrifying things I've seen on film for many years; and Cruise's literally bone-crunching run through London is also extremely exciting, with Simon Pegg (""Star Trek Beyond"") adding good humour in his regular role of Benji. By the way, series regulars Ving Rhames, as Luther, and Michelle Monaghan (""Sleepless"", ""Patriot's Day""), as Hunt's ex-wife Julia, also make welcome returns but Jeremy Renner is missing this time.Cruise at 56 (he's just 15 months younger than I am, damn it!) will eventually meet a Roger Moore-like Bond cliff when his Hunt role is no longer credible. But he's not there yet! Rebecca Ferguson is again outstanding as Faust and as a newcomer in a similar role Vanessa Kirby (memorable as Princess Margaret in ""The Crown"") impresses as the ""White Widow"" - someone with a familial link to a villain from the past! Unusually, for a film series which has traditionally been kept fresh by changing directors and composers at each turn, Christopher McQuarrie (""Edge of Tomorrow"", ""The Mummy"") returns following ""Rogue Nation"", and he also writes the screenplay. The composing baton is handed over this time though to Lorne Balfe (""Churchill"", ""Terminator: Genisys"") and for me this was a bit of a step down from the ""Rogue Nation"" soundtrack by Joe Kraemer which I really enjoyed.Is it sufficiently fresh though? Let's be clear here, I was enormously entertained throughout, and this should be near the top of your summer watch list. But it did ultimately feel at times a little like a light retread of ""Rogue Nation"". Some of the stunts - notably the Paris and London scenes as above - were a step up for me, but there are some annoyances in McQuarrie's script (see the spoiler section on bob-the-movie-man.com), so for me the rating plateaus at the same as I gave ""Rogue Nation"".(For the full graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man Thanks).",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
143,tonypeacock-1,The action franchise keeps going strong despite Tom Cruise getting older!,8,14 November 2019,"Now don't get me wrong this is a very good action film, it just has a few issues I will go on to. As I'm sure you all know the Mission Impossible franchise (this is the sixth entry) follows the antics of the IMF, a sort of private intelligence organization, which to the intelligence community seems like the EU army to NATO, using a Donald Trump like analogy. (The film interestingly stars Trump adversary Alec Baldwin).The film has great stunt work some of which are noticeably performed by star Tom Cruise himself. One particularly painful stunt landed Cruise with an injury that halted filming for a while. The stunt makes the final cut. The pain is there to see! However the action sequences have been seen before in other films, most noticeably the James Bond franchise.I lost count of the number of times I said to my wife who was also watching. I've seen this before in such and such or wait for the scuba divers to rescue the guy locked in a security vehicle which has been rammed into a river! I am trying not to make my liking of the Bond films effect my review but it is difficult at times! The story is a little complicated but the action keeps your attention span and director Christopher McQuarrie paces the film well.The film has a two and a half hour run time which passes very quickly. Spy film aficionados will also take note of the casting of Henry Cavill as CIA agent August Walker. Cavill was cast in spy film The Man From U.N.C.L.E. in 2015. Director Christopher McQuarrie directed the last Mission: Impossible entry 'Rogue Nation' back in 2015 so comes with experience. Talking of experience the crew are veterans or the next generation of Bond film veterans (here he goes again!). I thoroughly enjoyed the film despite my picky protestations above.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

146,kjproulx,One of the Best in the Franchise (Maybe Even the Best),9,27 July 2018,"Whether you personally believe in this notion or not, the Mission: Impossible franchise has been on an upward trajectory for years. With the release of the first film entertaining action fans and Tom Cruise fans alike, it was inevitable that a sequel would be made. Personally, I think the second film easily could have sunk this franchise easily. Mission: Impossible 3 revitalized the franchise in terms of character and story and the rest is history. In terms of critical reception and fan appeal, this franchise is better than it has ever been. Mission: Impossible - Fallout has just hit the big screen and I would be lying to myself if I didn't give in and say this may be my favourite of the entire franchise. I know that's a bold statement, due to the fact that the previous two films were fantastic, but let's dive in.Picking up a couple of years after the events of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, this is the first film in the franchise to directly continue a storyline from movie to movie. I was slightly wary of this notion, but I believe it worked very well. Following Ethan Hunt and his team after a failed mission, this team seeks out three orbs of plutonium, to prevent further, global catastrophe. While it seems like these are the McMuffins of the story, Solomon Lane (the previous villain) also becomes a McMuffin for the team, as he stirs up more trouble for them along the way. This is a very complex movie at times, which leads me to my only real complaint.Although this isn't technically a negative, because they pay everything off in a very nice way throughout the third act, it does feel like there is a little too much going on at times. The reason I don't find any of these movies absolutely perfect is due to the fact that they choose to be overly complex in their execution of certain storylines. From world-ending possibilities, to double-crosses, to bringing back previous storylines from past movies, and even to relying on an emotional core to the film that some viewers may not latch onto if they haven't seen the other movie, it can be quite the task of a movie to sit through. That being said, I'm a huge fan of this franchise and I was able to follow everything quite easily, so I think the execution of my possible, aforementioned complaints are only an issue if you haven't seen its predecessors.Mission: Impossible - Fallout almost seems like a culmination of everything since the third movie and the action is just the icing on the cake. Although slightly ridiculous at times (which of these films isn't though), the action throughout this film is some of the best that this franchise has ever seen (in my opinion). From the hand-to-hand combat to the aerial chases, to the terrifically daring stunts, this is a sequel that doesn't pull any punches and satisfies in both storytelling and pure, adrenaline-fuelled excitement. At a pretty lengthy 147 minutes, I never once felt bored. That's probably due to the fact that I loved a lot more than just what was on its surface.Christopher McQuarrie returns from the previous film to direct and although each film has a history of switching directors, I believe he did a job worthy of continuing from the previous instalment. He, along with superb cinematography by Rob Hardy and a surprisingly fresh sounding score by Lorne Balfe, everything about my experience of this film was nothing short being utterly impressed. It's not very often that I find myself praising a movie for being near perfect on a technical level, as well as story and action, but Mission: Impossible - Fallout did it for me.In the end, Mission: Impossible - Fallout at least deserves to be in the discussion for best of the franchise, even if you personally don't agree. If you can allow yourself to be completely immersed in a movie for nearly two and half hours, then I believe this may be one of the better moviegoing experience you'll have at the theatre this year. Aside from feeling a little too complex at times, there are many arcs that come full circle and I felt incredibly satisfied. Mission: Impossible - Fallout may not be an Oscar-contender, but I had an absolute blast with it and it's surely going to be included with some of my favourites of 2018.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
147,kuarinofu,A pleasant surprise / no spoilers,9,28 July 2018,"MI: Fallout was a well crafted and tightly packed movie. The plot wasn't as simple as it was introduced, all the characters received a lot of attention and actually were useful in the story, it had some great stunts beautifully shot and a good mix of action and spy stuff and some legitimate laughs. The thing I enjoyed the most was the fact that the story was moving through characters and their interactions. They didn't feel as lifeless as they typically do in action adventure where the story just sort of writes itself on the go. Hunt and the crew felt much more human and thus it was much easier to feel and actually care for them.
If you go to see this movie as a generic summer action adventure you will be pleasntly surprised (as I was).
My only complaint was that it was probably a little too long (10-15 mins).
P.S. Don't forget to lower your level of realism for this one, this is a MI movie after all :)",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
148,Carycomic,Whoa!!!!!!!!!!!,9,28 July 2018,"I just got back from seeing this, tonight. And I was not disappointed! First off, there's an all-star cast. Alec Baldwin is back as Sec.-Def Hunley; as are Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg (as Ethan's IMF partners); Rebecca Ferguson (reprising Ilsa from ""MI:Rogue Nation""); Sean Harris (reprising Solomon Lane, also from MIRN); and Michelle Monaghan as Dr. Julia Meade (Ethan's ex-wife from ""MI: Three"").  Then, there are relative newcomers, to the franchise, Henry Cavill and Angela Bassett (who might or might not be rogue double-agents called ""Apostles""). At nearly two hours and forty-five minutes long, this is the most knuckle-whitening sequel, yet. There's a lot of stunt work by Tom Cruise as Ethan; increased sexual tension between him and his female acquaintances (including a profiteering minx called ""The White Widow"" and a very sultry French police agent who goes by the initials ""A.J.""); the requisite number of plot twists provided by those awesome rubber face masks; and even some comedy relief worthy of the Indiana Jones films! In fact, there's so much packed into this particular sequel, that I have to ask: could Cruise be thinking of ending the franchise, here, while it's still popular? Because, frankly, I don't know how another MI sequel could possibly top this one! But, if Cruise wants to try, I'll go see it with just as much non-hesitation as I did this one.

its a classic modern film this is 2hrs 27mins with 178 million budget well its well worth heres to the next mission film 
what next drive a car out of a plane like fast and furious but with tom in there paragliding and a tight rope over a building or jump a bike over a plane oris their anything else he can do for the next one.
well enjoy this two years later and some characters returned, including one Solomon Lane (played by Sean Harris) with more villainy than ever before. In the past, we would cruise through team members such as Maggie Q, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Paula Patton, and heck even Jeremy Renner who was not in this flick... but we have grown into others like Ving Rhames (whose character wasn't just there to look cool and throw in some one-liners, but rather to shed some actual emotional weight), Simon Pegg (who has finally earned his wings""in the field"" where I feel he and newcomers Alec Baldwin (underused again) and Rebecca Ferguson Yes, they threw in some new characters in this film... I'd say one too many for me to keep track of... but they didn't interfere too much with the chemistry already in place with the other actors/actresses surrounding Tom Cruise , particularly three of them. 
. I think it is enough of a companion to make 3-6 part of a larger something when all watched together, even though 4 is only loosely connected at this point from a story perspective. In terms of feel however, it is not like any of the other M:I films before it. Instead of going for sleek and stylish, they chose raw and gritty in more ways than one. It really had its dark and serious moments, even played demonstrating it would carry more epic i but ultimately you would feel it. It still had light humor time-to-time, but this was not a light-toned film in the slightest. I don't know if ""grounded"" is the right way to describe the film's attitude but any time that it is on the ground everything is pretty simple. This film isn't built around stealth and technology; in fact, outside of masks and GPS-tracking (and some thing reading off a mission), I honestly couldn't name a single piece of technology that was more advanced than it definitely had a throwback feel to it, pulling the reins a lot but not in a forced way. This one just didn't call for a lot of futuristic technology. Because of the characters involved, YES. Outside of one of the beginning set-pieces, every action scene in this movie is heavily built up and driven by the story around it, and felt like the story's impact of the moment was always bigger than the stunts being pulled off. This is a good thing, but that also means it's not all surface-level entertainment. You could pop in your Blu-ray of any of the previous three M:I films and watch an action sequence and just go: ""Hell yeah."" In this film, each moment is earned",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

152,anselmdaniel,A great callback,8,14 November 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the sixth movie in the Mission: Impossible franchise. The movie is a follow-up to 2015's Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. The movie takes place two years after the events of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. The movie is written and directed by the same writer and director of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, Christopher McQuarrie. The cast from the previous movie reprises their roles, including Sean Harris as Solomon Lane.After Solomon Lane's capture in Rogue Nation, the remains of The Syndicate are reformed into the Apostles. After a plutonium deal is intercepted by the Apostles, Ethan Hunt's Impossible Missions Force team are dispatched to retrieve the missing plutonium cores and stop the Apostles. After the mission ends in failure, August Walker, played by Henry Cavill, from the Central Intelligence Agency is embedded into Ethan Hunt's team.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is different from the previous movie installments. This movie does utilize callbacks to the earlier movies. This is the movie's greatest strength. The movies that this has the most connection to are Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation, Ghost Protocol, III. It does feel like Ethan Hunt is more of a character than in the previous movies. The audience can appreciate more of the character backstories that were started in the previous movies. Julia is brought back after small cameos in Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation. Likewise Ilsa Faust returns to help Ethan with the threat of the Apostles. Solomon Lane also returns in a major role where he is a major driving force for the plot.The plot is much improved from Rogue Nation and earlier Mission: Impossible entries. The plot had clear character motivations where dialogue was not needed to explain character actions. It felt satisfying to watch a much more direct sequel than the previous movies. Anybody that likes plot-driven action will enjoy this movie.The action set pieces in this movie are absolutely wild. This movie's set pieces are a thrill to watch. They are simple in the concept but grander in the execution. The movie has Ethan Hunt in HALO jumping, escaping police in Paris, and chasing someone in a helicopter. All of these scenes are a treat to watch and even see the resolution of.I highly recommend Mission: Impossible-Fallout. This movie is one of the best Mission: Impossible movies.Grade: A",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
153,msbreviews,Rating: A,9,6 August 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Oh. My. God ... These are the three words that kept coming out of my mouth while watching Fallout. In a world where we barely have any real action anymore since everything is or uses bits of CGI, it is a huge breath of relief to be able to enjoy such jaw-dropping, mind-blowing, outstanding action set pieces! I know I have been writing this a lot throughout these reviews, but this one completely floored me. This is going to be the action movie to beat for a few years ... Maybe until the next Mission: Impossible installment, who knows?!My heart pumped like it never did before. The stuff that Tom Cruise actually does (which is basically everything) is unbelievable. Truly unbelievable, like you will have to get home and search for behind-the-scenes videos to understand how were they able to pull those sequences off. He runs like hell, jumps from building to building (you probably already know about the story of his broken foot), performs a HALO jump (a military parachuting free fall where the parachute is open at low altitude and the drop is performed at 25.000 feet), insanely drives a motorcycle through Paris streets, pilots a helicopter ... You got it, right?!This is the reason why the Mission: Impossible saga needs to continue. If it stops, there is never going to exist another film series that can bring such realism and incredible stunts like M:I does. It is undoubtedly the best action franchise of all-time, at least regarding the action set pieces. There is no possible comparison with any other movies. I am writing this because the ending might bother a few people.I have been having some bad luck with endings this year. There are a lot of films that I have watched and loved almost everything about it, but then its ending disappointed me in some way (Avengers: Infinity War, A Quiet Place and some more). I hate when directors tease a particular end, which would be a shock and something entirely unexpected, and at the last minute they back off and take the safe route.Christopher McQuarrie does that, but Fallout might be the only movie where I understand why he did it. I do not want to go into spoilers territory so I will justify it this way. If McQuarrie chose the bold ending, Fallout would probably be an A+, but the franchise would have to end as well (if it wanted to continue to be successful). By choosing the safe route, he guarantees the saga's vitality, but the film suffers from the issue in the last paragraph since everyone is going to leave the theater thinking ""oh, I wish they would have gone with THAT ending"".This is a minor issue that I have apart from another one regarding the first act's pacing. This is the longest movie of the saga and McQuarrie already answered why. Not to this question in particular, but he did admit that this film was structured around the action set pieces. Usually, this is a problem because it is often awfully executed. Never create a movie without writing your story and characters first. However, this is the sixth film of the franchise, and pretty much every significant character has been in the previous installments.Nevertheless, this justifies why the first act delivers so much information which causes the plot to start a bit convoluted. It eventually organizes itself, and it becomes a simple story, filled with predictable twists and turns that ultimately accomplishes its mission: to support the fantastic action sequences. Please, do not expect some Oscar-worthy screenplays from M:I movies because if you leave disappointed due to your unrealistic expectations, that's on you.As always, the cast is sensational and every character that we love and care about come back to one hell of a ride. I already blabbed about Cruise's courage, but there are a lot of exceptional performances. Simon Pegg (Benji) and Ving Rhames (Luther) are a hell of a team, providing some needed comic relief moments in such an action-heavy film. Rebecca Ferguson (Ilsa Faust) continues to be incredibly captivating, Michelle Monaghan (Julia) has some screentime to shine, and Alec Baldwin (Alan Hunley) also brings his A-game. Sean Harris (Solomon Lane) returns in style, and Henry Cavill (Walker) proves to be a fantastic addition to the saga, by being the protagonist of some of the most potent hand-to-hand combat in the series.Besides the action, every technical aspect is seamless. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, there are so many beautiful wide shots, and some of them are a true filmmaking achievement. The score is remarkable as it usually is in the M:I movies and it helps to raise some goosebumps in the vertiginous scenes (people with a fear of heights are gonna have a hard time with this one). The editing is perfect, and the tone and pacing are very well-balanced with the help of Rhames and Pegg's characters, who bring some stops to the extended action sequences (the driving around Paris sequence could have been shorter). There is still that sense of urgency and the frenetic pacing, which provides a significant level of entertainment.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the best film of its franchise and one of the best action movies of all-time, regarding the execution of said action set pieces. Tom Cruise proves that he is an icon if not the biggest icon in action film history, through dozens of runs, jumps and God knows what more. McQuarrie brings his fantastic technical attributes to this movie and uses an exceptional cast to interpret remarkable characters. A simple yet captivating plot supports the excellent action, and it still carries a few (predictable) twists. Only a few nit-picky things forbid me from giving this film an A+, but I promise you, it will definitely be in my Top10 by the end of the year. Go see it! On IMAX! NOW!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

or ""My heart rate monitor thinks I'm running...""Genre: Action/Thriller
In this the sixth installment of the franchise, I was just going to buy it when it came out to video. There were just too many movies that I wanted to see in the theater and I was going to get it anyway...then I read all the reviews and heard people talking about it. Oh ok twist my arm...so I went to see it. Man was it intense! My daughter said it was too stressful for her...that's just my game. You want to give me an action movie that has me white knuckling it...I'm your huckleberry! Let's saddle up for the O.K. Corral in true Lowedown fashion and break this movie down.
Cast=10
Most of the cast returns for Fallout, so it's a great ensemble. We unfortunately lose Jeremy Renner but we gain Henry Cavill. That's like going from Hawkeye to Superman in one shot...oh wait, that's exactly what happened! Add in Angela Bassett and a few others and I have to give the full ten points.
Acting=8
There are some great actors in the bunch...Simon Pegg and Michelle Monaghan stood out for me. It was great to see Monaghan with a larger role in the franchise, where we usually get a cameo. If the acting is to get ten points, then that means an Oscar-worthy performance. It wasn't quite that good, but it was solid...eight points for Hufflepuff.
Plot=9
Ethan Hunt and his IMF team face what's left of the Syndicate....a group calling themselves the Apostles. When a mission to retrieve nuclear cores fails, the team must race against the clock to stop the Apostles and their new leader...John Lark. I can't give it full points...it's a great plot but has been done before. Nine points for the IMF to help them win.
Ending=10
What a nail-biter...wow! This was where I had to take an extra blood pressure pill, as a lot of stuff was happening at the same time in different spots. There just seemed to be a level of intensity that I do not remember having from the previous films. Think of it like taking a Red Bull and pouring two of those five hour energy shots...I was wound up like a seven day clock. Ten points for the good guys!
Story=9
I really liked how the story played out...the intensity was a given, but there was very little lag during the film. With always something to pay attention to, it makes for a great movie. The only thing that bugged me is with all the MI, even though it looks like they messed up everything went according to plan. I didn't get that here...it really made like they messed up. Nine points to the score.Favorite Quote: ""There cannot be peace without first a great suffering. The greater the suffering, the greater the peace.""
Genre: Action
Violent=10
Oh yeah...it's violent! Explosions, car chases, fights in the bathroom...you name it and they did it. I like that Tom Cruise does a lot of his own stunts. He even broke his foot jumping from one building to another. All in all, I was very pleased with the violence and award ten magical points for that violence.
Pace=9
There is always something going on...even when they are planning an attack there was intensity. ""You use a scalpel, I prefer a hammer."" My heart rate was on a roller coaster...just as I started to calm down a bit, the action amped up. It was like they did it on purpose...I'll give them a nine and a big thank you for the interval training. Calories burned during the movie: 107
F/X=10
The explosions...the stunts...the whole thing was just EPIC! There was a lot of green screen stuff, but not as much CGI as you would think considering what they did. I really admire that in an action film; which is why I score for effects as a whole and not CGI (see Infinity War). Ten points awarded for this film...it's a dream for the action junkie.Sub-Genre: Thriller
Intense=10
What makes a thriller is how intense it is. You have be on the edge of your seat in breathless anticipation...just waiting for something to happen. That intensity was in so many places that even my daughter had a problem with it. I can't help but give this film ten points.
Fate whispers to the warrior.
There's a storm coming.
And the warrior whispers back.
I am the storm.
Twist=7
There is a solid twist...that is something that gives a Thriller such a good ending (he was a ghost all along!!). Unfortunately, I saw the twist coming pretty early. That's ok, though...the ending was still great and the twist was a factor of that ending. I will have to give this film seven points for a good but predictable twist.
My Score: 9.2
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to go see this movie. If you decide to wait for the video release, it is well worth a watch for any action junkie. I know some people do not care for Tom Cruise, but I can't help but praise his work ethic and the quality of his movies. Just do what 'ol Jack Burton does at a time like this...look that big storm right in the eye and say, ""Give me your best shot pal...I can take it!""",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

157,mahmus,The second best action movie of the decade,10,15 September 2020,"Whithout a doubt, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the best in the series. It is also one of the best action movies of the past decade. It would be THE best were it not for Mad Max: Fury Road honestly.This movie does practically everything right. It has the best hand to hand fight in the series, the best bike chase in the series, the best foot chase in the series, the best AIR chase in the series and my jaw was on the floor the whole time.This is a masterclass in action. It's incredible how a franchise that started all the way in the 60's, was rebooted in the 90's and continued for almost a decade could still find ways to better itself with each new entry, culminating in this insane ride.It's gonna be difficult to top this, but then again, this not mission difficult, it's mission impossible. ""Difficult"" should be a walk in the park for them. (yeah, I referenced the worst line of the worst MI movie, sue me).Also, Benji finally got to wear a mask and for some reason that makes me really happy.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
158,Alexander_Blanchett,The franchise is getting better and better,8,3 August 2018,"Tom Cruise was solid and it was again a walk in the park for him. His stunts were thrilling and indeed ""impossible"" . I wasnt a fan of Henry Cavill as he was his usual boring self. Always good to see Rebecca Ferguson, especially in that role she truly shines. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames were fun sidekicks. I liked Sean Harris more in the first one but he was still giving me the creeps. Great turn by Alec Baldwin who thankfully got more to do than in the last installment. Nice addition of Angela Basset. Also glad they resurrected Michelle Monaghan. That girls needs to do more films.The score as great, the cinematography excellent and the editing nearly perfect. The chase scene through Paris was one of the greatest action scenes of the last years. I think Cruise found his directional master in Christopher McQuarrie. I already look forward to the next part. Ethan Hunt is still no James Bond but he is on the best way to become one...",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
159,TheTruthofItIs,"Not much better than kung-fu theater, though final action scene saves it",6,26 October 2019,"Unfortunately, I see ""Fallout"" as a failing of plausibility. When you spend a gazillion dollars on a film project like this I expect the story/plot to be tight, plausible. I don't buy the ""it's just a movie"" excuse because then you're no better than the mindless kung-fu action flicks all over cable tv. No, producers/directors have a duty to polish what may be a dumb screenplay into a plausible action story, but this fails in almost every key scene. The bathroom scene starts off plausibly with a lot of people coming/going from it but when the decent fight scene starts, no other party patrons enter, despite all the noise/commotion - fail. The Grand Palais scene equally silly with the crowd simply not reacting/stampeding for the exits after an expansive knife fight - fail. Pointless chase scenes through populated Paris where no bystanders are hurt, or worse yet, there aren't even any bystanders - in - populated - Paris - fail. And then his chase to Walker, brushing off multiple injuries, why not just make him a superhero at this point?! Fail. And the dialogue is just so unrealistic and melodramatic - fail. The only diatribe worthy of attention was Lane's manical plan. However, as bad as all that, the final helicopter chase and ensuing fight scene was pretty nuts, and ends up saving the movie from an overall fail rating.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
160,cardsrock,One of the best action films ever made,9,10 August 2018,"I've been a member here for awhile, but this is the film that finally forced me to write a review. I cannot heap enough praise onto Christopher McQuarrie for filming some of the most visceral, jaw-dropping action scenes I've ever seen. The bathroom fight is unreal and the helicopter scene is simply mesmerizing. The story also is quite strong and filled with many great character moments. The bar for this series appears to be at an impossible high, but here's hoping they can top it.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
161,CANpatbuck3664,Fallout May be the Best Entry in a Franchise That Continues to Deliver,9,6 August 2018,"As much as this is Tom Cruise's franchise, the biggest reason to go see the new Mission Impossible movie is the stunts. McQuarrie, Cruise and the creative team found new ways to push the envelope even farther and it made for a thrilling trip to the theatre. I can't go into specific set pieces without spoiling things, but not only do they go as big as they can but they way they decided to film these scenes was just as impressive. If you consider that Cruise did many of the stunts himself, what they accomplished here becomes even more credible.Character development is rarely the focus of action movies. They made some interesting choices here and one of them was the inclusion of Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan). I won't go deep enough to spoil her entire arc, the main purpose of her character is to humanize Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) a little. She hasn't been a featured character since Mission Impossible 3 but she's a fun character to bring back and her inclusion brings a new set of problems for Ethan. Another area of focus is the differing ways that Ethan Hunt and August Walker (Henry Cavill) take care of their jobs. Walker is a force of nature and rarely leaves anything but dead bodies when he exits a mission. Hunt cares about the individuals and the movie poses the question which is the more effective philosophy for a spy? It's not essential to the plot but I thought it was a nice touch.Tom Cruise is a controversial figure, but if you put that aside, there's a reason his movies continue to top the box office (can we all just forget The Mummy?). He's great again as Ethan Hunt, he's not Cruise's most layered character but between the action and his interactions with his team, he pulls it off. Simon Pegg is his typically charming self again and he even gets a chance to do some more regarding the stunts. To say that he nailed his role again isn't newsworthy. Rebecca Ferguson comes back and continues to shine as Ilsa, she's very smooth and capable as a spy but she has enough warmth to have great chemistry with the rest of the ensemble. Ving Rhames is solid again as Luther, he also has a couple of nice moments and is a central figure in the cast. Henry Cavill still isn't the most expressive actor and the trailers for the movie almost spoil where his character ends up going but he's a good fit here. He has a lot of physicality and I think he does his job capably. Sean Harris carries over his good work from Rogue Nation as Solomon Lane and I enjoyed Vanessa Kirby, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin in their supporting roles. I don't have much to criticize Fallout for, it's not a perfect movie but there aren't many glaring flaws. The end has a couple of moments where the laws of physics don't seem to matter but this is something that every action movie is guilty of. Its not always about whether everything is accurate to the smallest detail, its often about whether you can distract the audience or coax them to believe it when they know it isn't true. There isn't anything here so egregious that it ruined the movie for me. I would also say that the movie does take a little while to warmup. Previous entries in the franchise began with a big set piece but Fallout goes in a different direction. There is a good payoff though, so my advice is to have some patience and it will be rewarded.I was blown away by Fallout and while it doesn't re-invent the Mission Impossible wheel, it represents an almost flawless execution of the formula. This is a step up from Rogue Nation (which was a solid film as a standalone) and clears the high bar that this franchise has set for itself. The action and the stunts are jaw-dropping intense, there's some nice moments of comedy (mainly from Pegg and Rhames), the cast is excellent, the characters are developed further (as much as they can be in an action movie) and while there are moments that stretch plausibility, the rest of the movie is executed so well that I could easily look past it. If you're a fan of the franchise or just enjoy big action that will get your pulse racing, this is worth going out of your way to see. I'm happy this is doing well at the box office and I can't wait for the next installment.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
162,cliftonofun,Here's all you need to know: Tom Cruise runs fast (again),7,1 August 2018,"You can critique the formula or the cliché or the Tom Cruise-iness....but this movie was still entertaining as hell. There are many franchises these days, but this one somehow manages to float in and out every few years with no backstory required. That is the brilliance of it. All the same double crosses and plot machinations and ridiculous stunts of the previous movies (and, of course, the masks), but it still feels new enough each time. And the stakes still feel real enough too. The MI movies have somehow become the perfect summer franchise.

He had several serious crashes and yet seemed unharmed by any of it. This irresponsible movie making is, I believe, what leads some youths to think they can drive cars at high speeds and that crashing won't kill them.It is a shame Angela Bassett decided to appear as she is better than this!

And yet, he chooses this life, knowing it has taken everything from him.It is in Ethan Hunt's blood. To protect the world he has to cut ties with anyone personal. One false slip, and the baddies can use this as his weakness.
This is the core question of this latest installment which adds a question to spycraft many have attempted and none have adeptly tackled as writer/director Christopher McQuarrie has. That is...are you willing to sacrifice yourself for the greater good of the world? Then why couldn't you sacrifice friends and family for the greater good of the world. The answer is bigger than ourselves. And injecting this depth into Ethan Hunt was a stroke of genius.Mixing man of the previous installments, Hunt, this time is haunted by a man who spins spies across the globe. The plan, in this case, is to create worldwide pain and suffering so that they can rebuild into the new world. That part is still a mystery, what isn't is the fact that the old regime just doesn't want to die overnight. The operatives are clandestine and very much operating on their own schedule. The rest of the world peeps in here and there (a policewoman scene is painfully touching) but we're always a few seconds from annihilation.
Hunt is a relic. We know this from this series and also...well, spy movies in general. What Solomon Lane, the villain from ""Rogue Nation"" has touched on, is that his sensibilities would thrive in their world order. Why not join them? The conflict isn't that. It's to create chaos in every facet of government espionage. Sorry if I'm confusing you, but this will make more sense the more you sit with the information.
What I absolutely love about this film is the life that Hunt gave up for the larger life that he chose. And continues to choose. What was so confusing in part 3 was that he found happiness but his past haunts him. Here, the past catches up to lay to rest his reasoning. That he can't continue to be a clandestine spy and not eventually plant roots in life. This is what James Bond desperately continues to tackle, but ""MI6"" really allows you to feel the sadness of loss that comes with the emotional loss that goes with dirty people doing dirty deeds.

175,CinematicInceptions,The best action movie since Fury Road.,8,6 August 2018,"Though there were some problems with it, I can say with certainty that this is the best installment of the Mission Impossible series. It is very much in keeping with the things we have enjoyed about its five predecessors, but I enjoyed aspects of it that I didn't expect it to be strong in. Christopher McQuarrie is the first person to direct more than one Mission Impossible movie, and I think the series may have finally been placed in the right hands. The first three quarters of the movie had a plot that was somewhat complex, but not so much that I lost track of anything. It was also finally a plot that was worth paying attention to, where Hunt and the team of agents he works with actually had some kind of concrete connection to their antagonists. Walker (Henry Cavil) contrasts Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) in some interesting ways that even the best of Bond villains don't. Double-crossings are certainly not new to the series, but the betrayals we saw here had an emotional weight that was lacking in the other Missions. Granted, one or two subplots get sort of dropped to the wayside in an unsatisfying way and the climax is one that we've seen many times before, but to be fair it is a very good version of that sort of climax. The biggest surprise for me was that there was a solidly developed theme. Throughout the movie, Ethan is faced with choices that will either jeopardize his global-stakes mission or require him to put one of his team members in danger. In some ways, this sort of calls out how things generally work out well in Mission Impossible movies and action/adventure movies as a genre, but I've definitely seen several movies and even some books do much worse versions of that argument.I very much enjoyed the action itself, but again in ways that I did not expect. The best scene of every Mission movie prior to Fallout has invariably the stunt that Tom Cruise does in the middle of the movie (see the airduct drop, climbing the Burj Khalifa, and the underwater key card switch). In Fallout, I think they were intending the skydiving sequence to be sort of the ""big stunt"" of the movie. I didn't think it was a fabulous scene, but I didn't mind that much. The rest of the movie was chock full of very well constructed action and chase scenes that created some excellent tension, had some great character-based twists, and, oddly, felt somewhat grounded in reality. One could argue that there is a degree of ""invincibility mode"" in the action sequences, but certainly not as much as in the second and third Mission films or other action series like Fast and Furious or Bond. Writing is typically not something one considers when thinking about action sequences, but I must give Christopher McQuarrie credit for writing some excellent scenes here without leaving the story at all to the wayside.If you like action movies, definitely see this. You should probably watch Rogue Nation first to get a little more context on some of the characters. Fallout is not entirely devoid of action clichés, but it avoids them for the most part and disguises them pretty well. If you have liked the other Mission movies but don't like keeping track of the plot, I would encourage you to try to follow along here. Most of the time, it's not worth it to puzzle out the intricacies of the plot in a spy movie, but this is a rare case where you will enjoy the movie a lot more if you pay attention during the more dialogue-heavy scenes. It may not be the best action movie of all-time, but it could very well be the best one of the year. Overall Rating: 7.9/10.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
176,cinemamoviecars,the most personal mission,10,5 November 2021,"The opening set the tone, basically this movie works like spectre, this mission of ethan hunt is a tough call of every mission made before this one.every way he took this time, reminds him to his past missions.In alot of ways this movie is not only more serious, but more somber and more dark, and all works for the better. Yes, the police segment have nolan influence and the car and bike chase have ronin influence, but the movie have a good script that only help to make it better. Basically, in this movie ethan rides a bmw serie 5 from the 80s in fast speed and have a reason, the same when he rides the bike.Everything here feels like is ethan last mission, and still he survives, this time still feels like he take even more risks than before. So is a thrilling movie and enough serious.to me is a 10.Also rebeca fergusson steal every scene, and vanesa kirby shows why she was in another action movie. She knows how to play action being serious.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

It has an intricate and interesting plot without being too convoluted for it's own good and manages to pull off twists and turns that surprise you rather than leave you scratching your head! The action is also very good, everything from fistfights to shootouts and chase scenes have that much needed weight to it and feel intense and meaningful, the fact that there are also actual stakes and what happens matters only adds to it. The cast is great all around and turns in some great character moments and the occasional humorous moments work and never overstay their welcome. All in all, if you have liked the other MI movies this is a must! And if you are just a fan of good well made action films, then this is very much worth checking out!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The last two movies have been the best of the franchise yet, but this one is the best yet. The plot was so good. It kept you on edge and it was very engaging. Tom Cruise was once again good as Ethan. Henry Cavill was my favorite part of the movie. He did such a good job. The action sequences are some of the best that I've seen in a movie in quite a while. They were so thrilling. So much happened in the film that sometimes it was jut a little too much at times but still it was good. The final act was probably the best part of the movie. The score was pretty good compared the previous films. The only problem I had was that it was just a little too long. Otherwise it was the best action film in ages and I don't want to spoil anything so you can see it for yourself.My Grade: A-",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
179,funtasticfour,Good solid action and continued rare quality for a long running series.,7,3 August 2018,"This series has been a very fun, and often smart series. The stunts and action seem to be getting bigger and better...though the better movie here was the previous one. It's hard to up the game all the time, but I was excited going in, and this was a very entertaining thrill ride. It just wasn't better than the previous one, but thats ok, it was hard to beat. More tense moments this time around, and the bathroom fight scene was the highlight for me, though I was disappointed not to hear the song from the trailer in there somewhere.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
180,abcvision,If you agree to take on the mission,10,13 August 2018,This is probably the best Mission Impossible I have seen. The buzz about Tom Cruise doing his own stunts is true.

The perfect movie to escape the mundane predictability of everyday life.,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
181,Offworld_Colony,The best thing I can say about this film is that watching it this time was exactly the same as when I saw it in the cinema.,10,12 February 2020,"Which is to say, it is every bit as excellent, it is the quintessential action blockbuster of these few years. It is the pinnacle of the franchise; gripping, brisk, accessible and clever. Everything in my previous review stands verbatim. This is an excellently entertaining flick with everything firing in all cylinders against all odds.
It is a better film in every way than its predecessor. It carries its own unique voice despite being the same director as the last film. An action blockbuster is inherently flawed and so it must mask its flaws and perform greater, smarter feats to obfuscate and override its flaws and, like The Dark Knight before it, Fallout manages to do so.
It's running in clean, renewable creativity.
Impossible Mission: You want me to say the Halo jump but while I find its addition into the picture to be pleasingly and shockingly sudden, the use of a CGI backdrop (storm) downplays the reality of it for me. Fallout may be the first in the franchise to have such forward momentum, thrust and its own blistering finale to catch up to, that it forgoes the trope of the big central mission. At a push I'd say the finale is exercised like a team mission, with everybody doing their part, a welcome addition of Monaghan's Julia, and IMAX footage of Cavill shooting a LMG at Tom Cruise flying a helicopter for real. It saved the best till last.
Roll on Mission: Impossible 7 and Mission: Impossible: Infinity
An additional shoutout is needed for Lorne Balfe who managed to create an evocative and memorable score using the bongos from the first film, with a brilliant epic update to the theme, and like David Arnold's work in Casino Royale, also creates a new exciting theme, hopefully for all the rest of Mission.
And in regards to the editing of the IMAX ratio shifts into the movie, I only noticed twice towards the end of the movie and couldn't believe how seamless and effective it was when compared to the eyesplitting nausea of something like the latest Transformers.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

He deserves a lot of credit.However, having said that, this was so hilariously ridiculous.The writing was so bad. Everything had to be explained every 15 minutes through lengthy expositions. There is nothing worse than a writer that has to EXPLAIN through dialogue things that could otherwise be shown or told in a way where you don't feel like it's a powerpoint presentation of what is about to happen or what could go wrong.Not gonna tell you what happens, but the last part was just so insanely bad. 15 minutes? HAHA. In 15 minutes Cruise stole a helicopter, fell from it in midair hanging from it, climbed back up, disarmed two soldiers, took over the helicopter, chased the other dude through mountains getting shot at for what seemed like forever, then crashed the mountains, meanwhile the other crew spent time looking for the bomb, got captured, tied up, got loose, fought the bad guy for what seemed like 20 minutes. We have to pretend a woman was able to beat the hell out of a trained soldiers. After all of that there was still 5 minutes left on the clock..

Tom Cruise compering to Bond character does not at all come across as exhausted or bored with this franchise which has everything you want in a summer action film (non-stop action) and nothing you don't (lots of boring conversation). This film proves that with a great cast, crew, director and writers, that sequels and series can progress the story and get even better. I did found Sean Harris' performance this time around to be rather bland just because I expected much more from him considering how well he brought Solomon to life in ""Rogue Nation"".

I'm more of a Jason Bourne or a James Bond kind of guy.
However after watching this latest instalment I have to say that both James and Jason will now have to up their game.
Fallout isn't just the best MI film to date but one of the best action films of the last decade.
It really is that good.
I'll admit that the story doesn't break any new ground. It's generic super spy formula.
What does change the game is the way action set pieces are presented onscreen.
Tom Cruise once again commits 110% and delivers some truly amazing stunts. I'm not totally naive to believe that it's him doing everything but he does seem to go that extra mile compared to his peers.Practical effects help deliver a more authentic action scene and nails will indeed be bitten down to the wicks. This film is immensely exciting.
Speaking of Wick. Even Keanu will have to turn it up a notch as I believe Christopher McQuarrie's movie has raised the bar.
Just as The Bourne Identity pushed James Bonds rebirth with Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, Fallout renders all other action movies as watered down pretenders.With a fantastic supporting cast
and a brilliant turn from Henry Cavill, Fallout is one of the best blockbusters of the summer.
From fisticuffs to car chases to dangling from a helicopter both Cruise and McQuarrie don't let the audience catch their breath.
Even with some nice comedic touches from Simon Pegg it's the action that really drives this movie.
It looks fantastic, it sounds fantastic and delivers as a perfect summer popcorn treat.I don't know if Cruise can top this one. They've set the bar very very high indeed.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The fight scene in the bathroom was well worth the wait. Wow! Henry Cavill and the Asian actor (have to look of the character's name and the actor playing him) threw down! That one little piece, that movement, when Cavill gets up his dukes and guns up...hot damn!For the females (and some males), Henry was some delicious man meat. Yeah, I said it. He can flex his muscles and eat crackers in my bed any time. Yum, yum. That is one big boy (to quote Tom on the Jimmy Fallon show). Oh yeah!The action sequences were crazy. I was actually afraid for Tom Cruise's safety in that motorcycle chase. You know he's doing his own stunt pieces, which is why I love him - that man works hard for his fans - but I couldn't help thinking, Tom you're going to kill yourself one day. (He broke an ankle jumping on to a building (look for the limp.)It's a cliché, but I was truly on the edge of my seat. I even had some jump scares with the action. The person next to me was gesturing wildly with all the action sequences - you feel you were right in the middle of them.This is a great summer action movie. Tom did it again. Having said that, this one is not my favorite one. 
There was more story added and frankly I don't care about the story, I just want non-stop gimmicky, slick, there's no way they can get out of this one, action, which is the MI schtick. I found the pacing somewhat odd and not in keeping with the franchise. However, with 6 installments in the franchise, we have something for everyone.Must see summer movie!

189,LloydBayer,"Tom Cruise saves the world again, and this film.",6,27 July 2018,"I must have missed something fundamentally riveting about this film, or, the film is mostly the same as any other Mission Impossible film - Bike chases, car chases, aerial chases - it's all there and as good or as cheesy as the previous films. The story, however, did not hold my interest. Simply put, it's about thwarting a terrorist attack by double crossing double agents. Seen that before? The issue isn't just the tired old save-the-world generic script but the heavy onus on Tom Cruise to hoist and thus save the film from mediocrity; which he does single-handedly. But it isn't enough. The action choreography, though thrilling, has all been done before. Not only in previous films of this franchise, but the same as in the Die Hard and Bond films. If John McClane can take down a helicopter with a car and James Bond can take out a motorcade with a plane, then guess what? So can Ethan Hunt. But if these are standard expectations in superspy films, then there should also be a super villain we all love to hate. How good was Philip Seymour Hoffman in MI3? In this film, the villain, who turns out to be a double agent (SURPRISE!) is an embarrassment to the entire cinematic world of villains. But I like how he ended up resembling Two-face from the DC comics (so much for being a double agent...two face, get it?).So if I recommend this film, it would only be for Tom Cruise and his infectious energy in every scene, with one in particular revealing Ethen Hunt has a heart of gold. As Maveric, Ron Kovic, Cole Trickle, Lt. Kaffee, Lestat, Jerry Maguir, Les Grossman, Tom Cruise has immense versatility matched only by his onscreen magnetism. At 56 he's still got it and probably the only reason ""Mission Impossible - Fallout"" is watchable. That said, the second biggest disappointment (after the wooden villain) is the lack of any real mission that is seemingly impossible to pull off. Part of what made the earlier films thrilling was just that: the hi-tech heist. From dangling upside down to steal a microchip in the first film to actually holding his breath for six minutes underwater in ""Rogue Nation"" (to steal another computer chip), doing the impossible was one of the highlights of those films. None of that here and no hi-tech gizmos either. Instead, new director Christopher McQuarrie (who previously wrote the brilliant ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Edge of Tomorrow"") settles for oomph over an actual story that lets us care about any of the characters. Even the whimsical team camaraderie we loved about the previous films are missing here with Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg taking a back seat (and Jeremy Renner nowhere to be seen). Driven by its strong action formula, ""Fallout"" will entertain the masses, but memories of which will self-destruct in less than five months. If that sounds corny, wait till you see the last thirty minutes...or the longest 15 minutes in cinema to diffuse a nuclear bomb.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

191,Magow-Intermean,Mission: Impossible - Fallout Review,10,27 July 2018,"Director: Christopher McQuarrie
Genre(s): Action, Adventure, Thriller
Rating: PG-13
Runtime: 147 min
An Impossible Mission Force mission goes wrong, so that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team must protect the world from a fresh nuclear threat. But with the CIA's Agent Walker (Henry Cavill) sent to keep an eye on him, Ethan will face an uphill battle to show that he can still save the day.
The best intentions often come back to haunt you. Mission: Impossible - Fallout finds Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team (Alec Baldwin, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames) along with some familiar allies (Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan) in a race against time after a mission gone wrong. Henry Cavill, Angela Bassett, and Vanessa Kirby also join the dynamic cast with filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie returning to the helm.
Also: There's fresh blood on the scene. Henry Cavill, on leave from puffing up as the DCEU's stalwart Superman, brings unexpected twists to the role of Walker, a CIA agent assigned to watch Ethan's every move. And best of all, there's Vanessa Kirby (just Emmy nominated for playing Princess Margaret on The Crown) as the White Widow, a knife-wielding femme fatale with a gift for arms dealing and an eye for Ethan. Except he's still hung up on his ex-wife (Michelle Monaghan), who's fighting a smallpox plague in Kashmir.
The visuals, even in the film's more sedate moments, are the best the series has ever seen. Solo's controversial low lighting is brought to mind with Rob Hardy's noirish, moody cinematography, yet the darkness perfectly suits this material, introducing a sense of intrigue that has been absent from the series since de Palma's twisty-turny original. Fallout is, as ever, Cruise's show, but his supporting cast admirably round the film out, both with affectionate, often humorous turns from Rhames and Pegg, Alec Baldwin's returning IMF secretary and Angela Bassett's tough CIA director. Finishing the cast is Henry Cavill's Agent Walker, a lunk with about as much charm as his infamous moustache, his oaken, Schwarzenegger-esque physicality contrasted with Cruise's wiry frame.
If there are any weak links it is, invariably in the women characters - more or less pushed to the sidelines as tropey femme fatales and plot devices. Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) proves the exception here as the MI6 agent from Rogue Nation with an agenda of her own - though even she feels a little underused. Nevertheless, the whole machine is so finely tuned that these quibbles barely register as flaws. A film like Mission: Impossible will never be considered high cinema, and nor does it need to be. But as the best possible version of itself, Fallout is essentially perfect.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
192,Mike_Devine,An action franchise that ages well,7,18 November 2018,"After five installments, many would assume the Tom Cruise-starring 'Mission: Impossible' franchise would be on its last legs. In actuality, the latest effort - 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' - is not just a hit with audiences, but also garnered critical acclaim, especially for a film of its genre.This time around, Ethan Hunt and his motley crew must track down and secure plutonium from the clutches of a mysterious terrorist group known as the Apostles before they can incite a nuclear holocaust. Sure, this plot sounds like it's done before by any combination of action films that have been churned out over the years, but it's not the ""what"" that makes 'Fallout' what it is. It's the ""how,"" as the film is well done.This is partly due to the all-star cast. From Hunt's partners in crime - Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) - to new faces - fellow agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) and Vanessa Kirby as the deceptively devious White Widow. And of course, Michelle Monaghan reprises her role as Hunt's ex-wife, while Rebecca Ferguson is the motorbike riding, sniping MI6 agent Ilsa Faust. Throw in Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett as CIA bigwigs and a bonus cameo from Wolf Blitzer and you have yourself quite a cast of characters. Of course, there's no denying this is still the ""Cruise Show,"" as the A-lister consistently delivers, whether it's in doing his own stunts or giving convincing lines.In terms of other elements in 'Fallout,' there are plenty of ridiculously over the top scenes that are somewhat lol-worthy but also expected for this franchise. They don't feel as annoying now as they have seemed in previous installments. We also get to go on a world tour, everywhere from London to Paris to Kashmir, with your fair share of car chases, karate chops and skydives to go around. But what makes 'Fallout' stand out from others is the focus on values and personal fulfillment over ""just doing your job,"" as Hunt struggles with his relationship with Julia throughout the mission.There are no signs of Cruise slowing down anytime soon, and in 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout,' it's fair to say things are headed in the right direction.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
193,arjunflamingfeather,Watch Daily For Courage,10,27 July 2018,"Recommended to view with a brave heart; like a rose that perishes after a day. 'The Mission Impossible: Fallout' is encrypted and obsessive. The series continues here with 'Ethan Hunt' a recruit; being filmed in various sequences of movements to create depth perception. 
The perception that is created is from the second dimension: movies and cinema are viewed in the second dimensions. The dimensions exist like the unlikely combinations of Ethan's counterparts with 'Monoghan' playing a role in the movie. 
Tom Cruise is brilliant; does run through the screen in locations both in Hollywood and abroad. The mischievous crew are known for stunts and acrobatics but here utilize makeup. Makeup that is common like lighting assistants whose jobs are to hold a screen to bring light upon the faces of the actors are effective. 
Trivia like from the International Movie Data Base brought this English language masterpiece starring Tom Cruise and 'Monoghan'. In the unlikely event that peace does not prevail while on enemy lines or fighting terrorism: it is a movie about terrorist threats.

195,scottshak_111,Ethan Hunt is on Another Wild Joyride,8,10 August 2018,"Christopher McQuarrie walks in with yet another installment of the MI series and he doesn't fail to deliver. Mission Impossible Fallout is fully packed with action and a mind-racking mission that will have your heart in your mouth. To ice it all, the fact that Tom Cruise has done all his stunts himself deserves a standing ovation per se. The bloke is so invested in acting that even a broken foot doesn't stop him from completing a scene. It is just thrilling to see him this phenomenal at the age of 56.
Mission Impossible Fallout doesn't have any separate memorable side-missions like all the prequels used to carry except the immediate prequel. I guess we have to accept McQuarrie's way of filming an MI movie. He doesn't really cash in on a sub-plot rather focuses more on the actual one. For him, the idea of an impossible mission is to stay with the primal plot, and it makes sense too. He has literally changed the way we have been looking at an MI mission. For some, this very fact could be bothersome while for some, it doesn't really matter.
The end you've always feared is coming. And the blood will be on your hands. The fallout of all your good intentions.
Mission Impossible Fallout has old school written all over it even though it is working along with all those latest gadgets IMF has. Everything boils down in the end to a cliched helicopter chase where the hero throws himself in the nick of time on a rope or someone in the team does something as intricate as cutting wires off bombs. But what makes it all different and why does Mission Impossible Fallout movie stand out?
The Direction of Mission Impossible Fallout Movie
McQuarrie believes in delivering a realistic experience to his audience. The fact that he doesn't resort to that much visual effects in order to shoot an action sequence just goes on to prove how serious he is about filmmaking. If you get a complying actor who never fails to impress either, lo! the circle is completed. Judgment is delivered. You get a complete cinematic experience that focuses on what's innate and not what's fabricated. Tom is his golden goose, and the magic seems to be working every time.
Christopher McQuarrie satiates action lovers with all kinds of stunts in this new installment that capers around topics that makes all its stunts justified. It is a mind-boggling adventure of a tale that comes with its own twists and turns. Working for IMF and for so long (we are talking all the installments here) the team has become capable enough to outsmart people, and they do it plenty of times here, thus proving why experience gives them the upper edge.
There are close calls aplenty that will have you jumping on your seats. It also has an endearing love angle that places the two women Ethan loves and his boss in front of his mission and he juggles them all like a pro. There are split-second decisions to be made that Ethan makes unflinchingly. Plans going kaput that places him in dire situations and he always manages to come through.
McQuarrie leverages Tom in a way he has never before whilst depicting uncut original shots that will have you biting your nails off. Whilst Cruise cruises through it all dedicatedly and unfazed by what it might do to him. Such a level of commitment! It leaves you speechless.
The Plot of Mission Impossible Fallout Movie (Spoilers)
Set two years later after the events of Rogue Nation, the movie starts off with a dream Ethan Hunt has where he is concerned about his ex-wife Julia's (Michelle Monaghan's) safety with the prequel's villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) by his side as the world speeds up into oblivion. With Lane in custody, the remains of The Syndicate forms itself into a terrorist group called The Apostles. Ethan is assigned a mission (""should you choose to accept"") to intercept the sale of three Plutonium cores which are being handed over to their client John Lark.
There cannot be peace without first a great suffering. The greater the suffering, the greater the peace.
Cut to Berlin where he meets the rest of his team Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) to carry out the mission. Ethan fails when he chooses to save Luther's life over securing the plutonium cores which is stolen by the Apostles.
Nuclear weapon's expert Nils Debruuk (Kristoffer Joner) is captured by the team then and is tricked into believing that the nuclear bombs indeed went off and that cities like Rome, Jerusalem and Mecca were destroyed in its wake. Duping him, they take the info about Apostle's next move.
August Walker
Enter August Walker (Henry Cavill), a Special Activities Division operative who is instructed by CIA director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) to shadow Ethan for the rest of the mission after knowing about his debacle in Berlin.

Mission: Impossible - Fallout feels unique compared to the other action movies in 2018. Every movie in 2018 feels like it tries to be like Marvel; goofy and filled with comedy; I think it's because they're afraid of failing at the box office. Mission: Impossible - Fallout doesn't do that though, they take a serious tone, with few jokes; and honestly, it feels good not to watch a goofy action movie. I always wonder how they can one-up themselves every time they make a Mission: Impossible, and now, I think they reached the top.In this Mission: Impossible, the entire world is at risk by a group called the apostles, who gain access to nuclear weapons. This type of antagonism is different because they don't threat the world for money, they threat the world because of cult-like beliefs. This wouldn't be a Mission: Impossible movie without the plot twist, and there's many plot twists in this one, but all of them are slightly predictable.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is two and a half hours long, and the pacing is fine at the beginning, but at the end, it feels really long. At the end, the nuclear timer is supposed to blowup in 15 minutes, the sequences during that time are double that. You're just sitting there saying to yourself, ""The bomb should've blown up ten minutes ago"", and it feels so unrealistic and it ruins the intensity for me.I like how they always kept the same characters in every movie, and they add more and more to the characters each film, and they always leave a cliffhanger on the characters' relationships. Most movies have cliffhangers on the story itself, but Mission: Impossible - Fallout does it with the characters, which makes the cliffhanger better.The action feels realistic, even though it's insanely unrealistic; which is a very hard thing to do. Mission Impossible - Fallout has some intense action scenes that are filmed in a cinematic way. There's so many locations in this movie that's it's hard to remember all of them, and it's amazing to look at the scenery. Some scenes in the movie show how beautiful the landscapes are, which is rare to see in an action packed movie nowadays.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is another great Mission: Impossible movie. It's action-packed and cinematic. It has a serious tone that grounds the movie to a more realistic vibe; and it reminds me of 80's action movies. I lost my interest in action movies lately, do to the repetitive style of comedy; after seeing Mission: Impossible - Fallout, it gives me hope for the future of action movies.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

203,TheHonestCritic,Is the hype about this movie being one of the best action films in recent years worth it? I'll be the judge of that. Check out my review below!,10,17 February 2020,"""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" (2018), directed by Christopher McQuarrie. Starring Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Henry Cavill, Sean Harris, Rebecca Ferguson, and more. Now that's an all-star cast lineup! One neat thing to point out, that all of the ""Mission: Impossible"" films were all directed by someone different. That's a good idea, because each movie would be unique and fresh because it's respectable director brings their twist to the aforementioned film. This marks the very first time that two ""Mission: Impossible"" films were directed by the exact same person, Christopher McQuarrie. Also, this is the final movie in the current saga of ""Mission: Impossible"" films. ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is my third favorite ""Mission: Impossible"" film of the series. Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect special effects, beautiful sets/locations, and a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together! The story is very well laid out, and it keeps you invested from beginning to end. Just like ""Mission: Impossible III"" (2006), and ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" (2012), all of the action sequences work and are well choreographed. The acting is overall outstanding from all of the actors and actresses. But, the one cast member that I was worried would ruin the movie was Henry Cavill. He is one of the many reasons why the modern day DC superhero films suck (EXCEPT FOR ""THE DARK KNIGHT"" TRILOGY). He is definitely not Superman, by any means. Despite what everyone else insinuates. I don't think they could've picked a more out-of-place actor for Superman. If I was a casting director, and a casting agent came over to me with Henry Cavill and said: ""I think that this man would be a great Superman!"" I'd immediately say, ""YOU'RE FIRED!"" Henry Cavill is absolutely not worthy of the Superman title at all, and neither is the so-called ""costume"" they made for him to wear. Christopher Reeve is, and will always be the one and only, true Man of Steel. However, the Superman role is just a step back in Henry Cavill's acting career, and that doesn't mean Henry Cavill can't act well in other movies. Sometimes actors end up being cast in the wrong movies, but if they're cast perfectly then the movie will be much better. That's definitely the case for ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" on his behalf. Henry Cavill put on a great performance in this movie! He was perfectly cast, and did a great job in this role. A movie can make such a big difference in how great the performance of the actor, or actress is. I honestly think Henry Cavill would be great as the next James Bond! They need to boot Daniel Craig (THE WORST BOND ACTOR OF ALL-TIME, BUT HE IS GOOD IN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MOVIES THOUGH) out of the franchise. Which is what they should have done 12 years ago! Henry Cavill would make a great James Bond! Pretty much any English actor, except Daniel Craig, would make a good Bond! Any way, back to my ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" movie review. The special effects are first-rate. Being made in 2018, that's no surprise! All of the sets/locations are beautiful and really set the tone for the movie. Finally, the soundtrack is very well composed, this time by Lorne Balfe. He's not as good as Michael Giacchino, but I think he did this film score justice. ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is a phenomenal achievement. Christopher McQuarrie did a great job directing, no wonder he was called back again. They really struck gold with him! This is a fantastic movie, and I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. At close to 150 minutes, ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is the current longest film in the series. It is one of the fastest two and a half hours I've spent watching a movie. It goes by in the blink of an eye! If you haven't seen it, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to go see ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" as soon as possible. This review will self-destruct in five seconds.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
204,gavinp9,Best one yet?,8,27 July 2018,"'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' (MI6) follows on closely from 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation', with the IMF trying to round up the Syndicate/Apostles. This leads them to chasing some stolen nuclear bombs - always good when the stakes are high! Most of the gang are back - Ethan (Cruise), Benji (Pegg), Luther (Rhames), Ilsa (Ferguson), Julia (Monaghan) & Hunley (Baldwin) - but no Renner, with Lane (Harris) still the main bad guy controlling the bad guys. Walker (Cavill) is the new guy - a CIA agent sent to watch over the team after they initially lose the plutonium.As always, the highlights is the action - there's some exceptional fight scenes here (especially the best bathroom fight since 'True Lies') and some excellent car/motorbike chases. There's also the classic M:I masks and possibly a quadruple-cross? I lost count, but it certainly makes things intriguing.The stunts are stunning - and very impressive, given Cruise is now 56 - and kudos to the director for leaving in the building-jump where Cruise breaks his ankle: it looks great & is so realistic! The helicopter scenes are exceptional and, as always, there's plenty of Cruise running. The scenery - Norway & New Zealand filling in for Kashmir, plus Paris and London - adds another layer to the action. Six films in 23 years seems right - not overload, but enough to keep you interested (there's been eight Bond films, by comparison). Very enjoyable spy thriller.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
205,thebricks,Absolutely floored by how great this movie was,10,29 July 2018,"Usually, the sixth movie in a series is just pushing it. I was expecting garbage, I won't lie, but I had AMC's A-List pass so I'm obligated to watch as many movies as I can, so I watched this in my city's newest Dolby Prime theater.Safe to say, absolutely no regrets. It was incredible. The last film had a lot of problems, from the stilted, uptight, disconnected storytelling that lacked flow, the ridiculous product placement that made it hard to take the movie seriously(can't believe how many people did not spot the blatant ad for the military cargo jet by Airbus in Rogue Nation; yes, that was an ad, believe it or not, no bad guys would be flying a plane with the manufacturer's brand name and plane's model number on it. That took product placement to a whole new level for me).Like 3, this movie doesn't really have an impossible mission that requires ridiculous planning. To me, that works incredibly well because there's really only so many times you can pull this off before it gets trite.I absolutely loved the action scenes in the movie. Bravo, well done. Can't believe the Oscars do not give awards for this; whoever did the second-unit work for this movie did an amazing job. The helicopter chase in the Kashmir mountains was crazy. Worth the ticket price alone.I know it sounds ridiculous to say this should be nominated for Best Picture, but like Logan, action movies never get a fair shake, even at their best. What a shame.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Mission Impossible Fallout. This is outing number 6 for Ethan Hunt and his IMF team and the plot doesn't get any less complicated. I really feel if you take the chance for a toilet break you would completely lose the thread, having said that, once my bum was in the seat it didn't move for the whole of the film, and to me that's a sure sign of genius. Apart from the opening scenes of Tom Cruise hanging off the Airbus A400 in Rogue Nation, this film is notable for having some of the best shot scenes in the series to date. This episode sees Ethan Hunt struggling to catch up on himself to right a mission that has gone wrong. All the old favourites are back with him, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Alec Baldwin and a second appearance for Rebecca Ferguson, apparently not something achieved by a female cast member before in Hunt's team. Fast paced, fast motorbike chases, fast helicopter chases, fast plot. This film is pure action from start to finish and the whole cinema winced in that scene where Tom Cruise broke his ankle and kept on running. That guy gets better with age, long may he keep going and long may we have Mission Impossible to grace our screens.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
210,kermitkid,Ol' Reliable,8,31 March 2020,"As far as plot goes it was pretty much the same as the others. Hard to follow, high stakes, same old same old. But we don't go to ""Mission: Impossible"" movies for the plot, we see them for the action scenes, and boy did this film deliver! The action sequences were fantastic! Henry Cavill and Tom Cruise have a great dynamic in the film. A lot of the plot seems a bit overstuffed and some characters a bit unneccessary. The humor is unexpected for this kind of film, and it's great. Simon Pegg has some of the funniest lines here. Definitely one of the best entries in the series.

211,ritera1,"Lots of fun, to a point",8,21 January 2021,"If you're looking for soul-bearing character development, this isn't for you. But you knew that.I find it very hard to separate Tom Cruise the tabloid personality vs Tom Cruise characters. He's either mentally-sick for his devotion to Scientology or he's over-a-barrel doing movie after movie to pay hush money. Good for him in his rant about people wearing masks, though, in that on-set Internet rant.Cruise does fulfill the physical requirements very well as the action scenes were nicely crafted. The gem is the restroom fight. The others are fun but err'd on the side of conventional. Very high production values made up some gap. But the bike chase in Paris got to be silly in its speed. Return of the Jedi started this in the speeder chase with being so fast that no one would keep-up with their reflexes.But Cruise can pull off ""moments"" like when meeting Monagan at the camp. Or the ""What don't I know?"" ""I'm working on it"" or ""Jumping out a window"" lines. The ""outraged"" scene with Baldwin was too much for him, though.Not bad emotionally, from the dream sequences to a decent attempt of him caring for his team and others. Good comedy at points. I saw the reveal near the end of the 2nd act with Caville's turn by referencing the rule, ""It's the last person you expect.""I'd like to see Cruise in a bad guy role, to know if he could do it. I'm on the fence. His attempt at faking a bad guy in this was, ""Meh.""Story-wise it suffered for being too complicated in some instances and obviously writing themselves out of corners in the other. Very clear what would happen in the early hospital scene.Even as Cruise as the bad guy walking in the night before the breakout. The breakout was ready to go without the bad guy (him). Hunt participating was not crucial for its success so wasn't for the deal for the plutonium. But don't pay attention to that, dear audience (the director pleaded). Clearly just a reason to have another action scene. Nothing else. (Not portrayed but was likely Hunt's realization that Cavill's character was the actual bad guy. Although it was so bad that Cavill should have also known.)Not a bad way to spend 135 minutes, though.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

213,kaptenvideo-89875,The most invincible 56-year old is back to kick some baddies a**,8,8 August 2018,"""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is about presenting Tom Cruise as near-invincible hero Ethan Hunt who can pull off incredible stunts and seems impervious to pain and physical damage.This time he's fighting a new threat to the world... blah blah blah... look, a bad guy!.... agents outwitting each other... what makes one a terrorist anyway?... blah... you get the picture. Something or other is happening and there's plenty of evil henchmen to kill and backstabbers to reveal, before taking on the big boss.Also appearing, Henry Cavill, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Bridget Moynahan, Alec Baldwin, Angela Bassett, Wes Bentley.The most interesting character is Vanessa Kirby's White Widow - if we can talk about characters in a story so thin, instead of roughly drawn sketches which have mostly decorative function in places where Cruise is supposed to come and kick ass.And he does, and still very well, although he must have been 54 or 55 during the filming. It's safe to assume that there's another fight left in him to continue with ""M:I"" for at least five to ten years, and maybe also do ""Jack Reacher 3"".And why not - the first five ""M:I"" chapters have brought close to 2.7 billion USD from box office, and the sixth one has also started strongly indeed.If you are able to specifically remember some of the most physics-defyingly insane moments and setpieces of the ""M:I"" series, then you might conclude that it would be really difficult to top the previous highlights.It seems that the producers and authors of ""Fallout"" have understood that and have not even tried to set new records, instead settling for just high-quality action scenes, most of which take place during the high-speed car and bike chases, or in the air.As expected, the whole long movie is full of cool moments that make the viewers' palms sweaty - still very unreal but not as absurdly so as, say, ""Fast and Furious"" or ""xXx"". Still, a lot of quality action for one's time and money.And so it goes, intrinsically not different from any other ""M:I"" movies, the first excluded. But no need to invent a wheel if the current wheel is rolling so nicely, is there?If I can think of any real complaints, I'd make it shorter. 147 minutes is a lot of screen time for a story signifying so little. Still, it's the most captivating action movie released in 2018 that I've seen.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

A terrific new addition was Henry Cavill (of Superman fame) as CIA agent Walker, a powerhouse assassin who fills that role mightily.Plutonium has been stolen and IMF must get it back before the bad guys reek havoc on the world. That's pretty much the general plot.An old villain returns to add gas to Ethan Hunt's fire. There is a mysterious broker who can get the plutonium. There's another mysterious buyer who confronts the IMF force in an outstanding fight scene. There are fantastic motorcycle/car/truck chase scenes in Paris. There is an outstanding chase scene in London. And of course, the combatants take to the air in an unbelievably taut helicopter chase scene through mountain passes.But Fallout wins because of the story. Ethan is still haunted by nightmares of his ex-wife Brigid Moynahan. He's still trying to figure out Rebecca Ferguson's role - is she trying to kill him? save him? What role is the CIA holding here? Who are the good guys, really? And can his arch-nemesis be stopped, or will he have the ultimate revenge against everything and everyone Ethan cares about?The last 30 minutes ratchet up the tension like I can't remember in an IMF film, similar to the fantastic villain Owen Davian, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman (rip) in IMF 3 around the mysterious Rabbit's Foot. Wow, I kept cheering on Ethan to try to save the world again. Whoa, the ending leaves you breathless.Fantastic acting across the board. Terrific direction to keep things hidden but moving. Great choreography and super fight/chase scenes, and a tight story that leaves you gasping at the end. What else could you want from an IMF movie in a series that still stars Cruise after over 20 years.The only questions remaining are - can they ever top this? and how much longer can Tom Cruise and his team keep going.

But, it had its moments of humor, it was interesting, had imagination and hot women. This one has (almost) none.What little humor is there is not very funny and is a rehash of similar humor in previous M:I.It's not interesting. Actually, the fist half is _boring_ about half of the time.The action sequences and plot/twists are not inspired and lack imagination. You see about 3 minutes into his appearance that ""Superman"" is the new villain (not just because Henry Cavil's Superman is a villain of sorts). And, for crying out loud: terrorists planning to detonate nuclear bombs and our heroes stopping it in the last second? Really? Are we so out of ideas?The women are not very hot. Michelle Monaghan is a hot grandma and Rebecca Ferguson is a hot aunt, but, that's it. The ""White Widow"" is simply not hot. Sure, Ethan Hunt is getting older, so it makes some sense, but, loses one of the crucial elements of the M:I formula.What we got is neither M:I, nor is it a ""real"" spy action thriller. It's something in between and it doesn't work very well.Having said all that, it's well done. It's actually more grounded than previous M:Is, though it is still way too silly. That makes all the stunt and special effects work look better as it looks more real. Several shots are _very_ well done, show great skill (the flood scene, the ""double Solomon"" scene...).

220,williampsamuel,The Series Just Keeps Getting Better,10,16 March 2019,"They say lightning never strikes twice, much less three times. Yet for the third time in a row the Mission Impossible franchise has absolutely nailed it, delivering heart pounding, supremely satisfying summer entertainment.Those who have seen the trailers will have a basic idea of the story. Ethan Hunt and his team lost a trio of plutonium cores, and now he has to get them back by whatever methods necessary. Now despite what the trailers suggest, this movie is not about Ethan snapping and going rogue. The movie never even suggests it. But it is very much about whether he'll reach his limits and break his own most deeply held rules to complete the mission. Because with the stakes this high and with so many different players and agendas, there may not be any way to save the world and keep his hands clean.This movie is also very much about Ethan's past. In many ways this installment is a continuation of the last film, featuring old friends and enemies and tying up loose plots threads you never noticed before. So much of what happens here is the direct result of the missions Ethan has completed and the choices he made before, all of them weighing heavily on the choices he has to make now.After six installments in the series the filmmakers have fully perfected the Mission Impossible formula. The pacing ranges from quick to breakneck. The chases and shoot-outs are excellent as always, and some of the fight scenes are worthy of Hong Kong. Henry Cavil is a powerhouse. The pure power of his fighting style is a perfect match for Hunt's kinetic improvisation. Fighting together they make a hell of a duo. When they come to blows with each other it's even better.And then there are the aerial sequences and other death-defying stunts that no Mission Impossible movie would be complete without. They may not top the data core scene from the last installment, but they are still absolutely breathtaking. I don't know how Cruise is able to keep doing these kinds of stunts at his age, but I can't argue with the results.And refreshingly, the plot is more than just an excuse to string together the action scenes. There are enough twists and stunning revelations to fill the best spy novel. Just when you think you know where it's going it manages to surprise and raise the stakes even higher. At times Fallout is a bit darker and grimmer than previous installments. Occasionally it even brings a touch of pathos. But the trademark wry humor is still there, if a little more subdued.
Ultimately this movie has everything that a summer blockbuster should. It's tense, exciting, action packed, and everything in it just works. On the heels of Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation it's safe to say that the Mission Impossible franchise is delivering more consistently than than James Bond. I don't how long they can keep this up, but I look forward to finding out.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The man is simply phenomenal, he is in tip-top shape, and still able to pull these action blockbusters off so effectively at his age that is simply impressive. But it's not all about Mr. Cruise's feats, but also behind his amazing stunts there is a great cast that supports him greatly, a story that keeps surpassing itself with each outing, and the thrilling action that never stops. The bathroom fighting scene is one of the highlights of the film, I truly enjoyed that, that is how you're supposed to do a fighting scene.Was this the best action film of 2018? I genuinely think so. It almost makes you think about beautifully done action secuences that deserve to be regarded as true art. My only regret is to not have watched it on the big screen. It is well-shot and virtually exempt of CGI, which gives the action an authentic feel. The characters feel as if they have evolved from previous films and they give a more mature tone to the film.To be honest, I really don't see how they could top this entry. This is a franchise that might have reached its quality peak. Or maybe not, who knows? Ethan Hunt's story is definitely not over and when the time comes to end the story, it has to go with fireworks.

And I loved every second of it.Before I fully start this review I would like to take time out of your busy schedule to say that the review for this film written in The New York Times is one of the most pretentious things I've ever read. You might be wondering why I'm bringing this up, but just read this quote from their review: ""The setup doesn't fully work and could be read as an example of gay panic rather than a swat at it."" What? This quote too, boggles the mind: (keep in mind, this quote is discussing an action scene that happens in a bathroom with Tom, Henry Cavill, and another man) ""The setting and Mr. Cavill's pornstache and strapping masculinity invest the scene with titillating possibility: Is this an operation or a hookup?"" What the fu*k is this guy talking about? Did the writer seriously expect Tom, Henry, and the other man to start making out and have a threesome in the bathroom stall? I mean really, I've never read a more pretentious review in my entire life - who in their right mind would ever read THAT MUCH into an action scene (one of the best action scenes I've ever seen in my entire god damn life!) that takes place in a men's bathroom? Regardless, now that I've gotten that off my chest I feel much more relaxed and ready to jump right into this review that you've probably stopped reading. For some reason, I was skeptical walking into this film; I just really didn't think they would be able to make yet another amazing action film. Let' s be honest, the third, fourth, and fifth ""Mission Impossible"" movies were incredible, thrilling, white-knuckle movies, so when it came to ""Fallout,"" the sixth installment in the series, I really thought they wouldn't be able to strike gold again. But you know what? They did it!""Fallout"" has some of the most thrilling action sequences put to film, and I'm not exaggerating. And you know what really sells every single god damn action scene? TOM MOTHERFUC*ING CRUISE. The man is a legend. Some people may think it's ridiculous that he insists on doing all his own stunts, but the only ridiculous thing that him doing his own stunts causes is ridiculously amazing action scenes. There's a scene where he jumps out of an airplane, and I was like ""pfft yea right he did that"" but he DID IT and the film SHOWS IT in ONE TAKE. God, I was seriously shaking in ecstasy, my jaw dropped, and my grandma walked out of the theater because she was so embarrassed I decided to wear a hot pink beanie (after the movie my grandma literally took me aside and told me I needed to dress more conservatively or people will think I'm gay, oh grandma). But Tom doesn't stop at jumping out of planes. He stops at nothing.I don't want to get into any real specifics as to what other action scenes you will see in this film entail because I would like to avoid spoilers as much as possible since this is a new release at the time of this writing, but I really do want to emphasize how incredible the action is. Every set piece is going to have you holding your breath and gripping the person next to you. The fights are brutal, clearly filmed with gorgeous wide-shots, and the choreography is pretty much perfection - I haven't seen such gorgeous fight choreography since ""The Raid.""And not just the direction of the action scenes, but the direction of the entire movie is really stunning. There are certain scenes that, coupled with the fantastic soundtrack, feel like they could be right out of a Nicolas Winding Refn film (watch for the scene where Tom Cruise is surrounded by men in black masks, but he himself does not have one on, you'll know it when you see it). And speaking of music, there are certain times where the music cuts out when something intense is happening, and all that does is add to the visceral quality of the movie. I really wish my writing abilities were better so I could fully convey my feelings, but please just take my word for it and better yet go experience it for yourself. It would also be criminal for me not to mention how super duper sexy White Widow is. There's a scene where her and Tom lock lips and I almost cried out of jealousy. Okay fine, I admit I really didn't have to mention how attractive White Widow is but my God, I practically fell in love so Vanessa Kirby, if by some chance you're reading this, I will literally take you out to dinner and a movie, I'm not sure if you've seen the new ""Mission Impossible"" or not but you'll love it, give me a call. 8/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
225,pranayjalvi,Another fast paced and thrilling action continuing the franchise,9,15 July 2018,"Ageless, riveting and seemingly unstoppable, Tom Cruise remains a force of nature in this Mission: Impossible franchise. The sixth film in the series is among the most outstanding, delivering a near-exhausting amount of fantabulous action sequences paired with deft character drama and the requisite life-or-death stakes. At nearly two-and-a-half hours, Fallout has ambitions as vast as its running time. McQuarrie weaves elements of tragedy and political commentary into action packed crime thriller.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
226,rehmankhilji,Not to be missed,8,14 November 2018,"Firstly, you have to see all the movies of this series in order to understand the concept. If not at least see from part - III onwards.
Tom Cruise at his best and the best of action you can have in one movie. I simply love the way they are connecting the movie with the previous ones with a different story all together.
Must, double must watch.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
227,Aly200,Another Exciting Mission You Must See,9,1 August 2018,"Even after 22 years and now six films in, the creative minds behind this film franchise do not disappoint with this latest offering. Following the events of ""Rogue Nation"", Ethan Hunt and his team must track the elusive John Lark, an unknown man who has links to the Apostles (a subgroup within the Syndicate) and to find missing plutonium planned to be used for nuclear desolation. However as is known in this franchise, the mission becomes far more complex and dangerous for everyone involved.A host of familiar faces return for this latest mission such as series lead Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, Ving Rhames as hacker member Luther, Simon Pegg as the nerdy yet helpful Benji and Rebecca Ferguson as the skilled sole female member of the team, Ilsa Faust (who is far less of a femme fatale after ""Rogue Nation"" and is more included as a member of Hunt's IMF team). Cruise is charismatic and engaging to watch as ever with his 6th portrayal of Ethan Hunt. Ethan is still dedicated to his team and continuously makes the choice to protect them despite this being a costly error in the film's opening sequence. However we know that Ethan can save the world against all the odds. Cruise continues to impress with insane stunts which are upped to the ante in this film as Cruise performs a HALO jump, rides a motorbike dangerously through the Parisian streets without a helmet, jumping off roofs (which resulted in a broken ankle) and piloting a helicopter during the climatic showdown and also hanging from a cliff-face. Yikes! Joining the cast as the wild card is ""Man of Steel"" star, Henry Cavill as CIA assassin August Walker. While Cavill isn't exactly the most emotive actor, the Superman actor is able to hold his own alongside Tom Cruise. Walker is the more ethical foil (almost like Ilsa in her pursuit of Syndicate leader Solomon Lane throughout this film) to Hunt's renegade IMF agent; he is looking out for the CIA's interest in seeking the plutonium lost in the opening scene. Being a known physical actor (as seen in ""Man of Steel"") Cavill captures the combative scenes with an ease that compliments his costar's own prowess. Then there's Walker's own secrets that come to light as the climax hits with twists and turns, but this won't be spoiled here.Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie returns to the chair to helm his 2nd M:I film after the success of helming ""Rogue Nation"" three years prior. McQuarrie's writing is definitely sharp and snappy when needed, but the director does not forget to insert an instance of humor to lighten the mood. The editing is a little sloppy at points and the run-time could've been trimmed a good ten to fifteen minutes, but the story doesn't fail to engage the audience. Yes while we know what to expect from this franchise, but we keep coming back because of its stories and Tom Cruise's star power. This a mission you should definitely accept.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

229,austin0731,"Big, fun, adrenaline fueled action thriller",7,9 June 2019,"At this point the Mission Impossible franchise is a blur of montages and insane action sequences that really doesn't have much of a narrative. It seems like recently every Mission Impossible film has been about some sort of infiltration in the system and how that needs to be combated by Ethan Hunt and his group of agents. Yet, it somehow manages to remain entertaining no matter how many times this franchise comes round to do practically the exact same thing but dialed even further up.Fallout was no difference, it was a very stylized and fun action/thriller that featured over the top, risk taking set pieces and fun, likeable characters. Tom Cruise owns this franchise at this point, it is synonymous with him as he is with it and this time round was as always the Tom Cruise show as we see him doing one dangerous thing after the next. A returning Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson were once again great in their supporting roles and I really enjoyed the new addition of Henry Cavill.At the end of the day this is a big, fun adrenaline fueled action movie that is definitely fun and enjoyable but I couldn't tell you much of the plot beyond 'Ethan Hunt has to kill the bad guys'. And I probably wouldn't be able to distinguish this with the other entries in the franchise. It is the same formulaic Mission Impossible film, but the fact that they keep making it and we keep buying tickets just goes to show that the formula works I suppose.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
230,galahad58-1,Time to put the Missions to rest,4,28 July 2018,"The best word to describe this movie is ""predictable"". Within the first 10 minutes you know who the double agent is, you know how it is going to play out, you pretty much can leave the theater and come back 20 minutes later and not miss a beat. It is very predictable and not well written.
If you have seen any of the previous Mission Impossible movies, then you have already seen this movie. There is nothing new. 
Example: you see two helicopters - you know that Cruise's character is going to fly one to chase the bad guy and repeat the old Rambo helicopter chase - it is a given. You have a scene where a gunman has a gun to Luther's head - you know the IMF is going to save Luther and let valuable plutonium free for the bad guys to grab. You know that the CIA is going to act like idiots and throw a wrench into the IMF plans. 
Nothing new - just retread old ideas that flow from action scene to action scene with very little story.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
231,asifahsankhan,MI6 is a delight!,9,27 July 2018,"I have to say that out of all of the Mission: Impossible films this one has to be my favorite. I am not sure how they manage to up their stunt game every time but they do hands down. The action in the film is unreal and if you keep in the back of your mind that Tom Cruise is doing almost all of his own stunts is pretty impressive. The guy is a beast. The other nice thing that has upped the game for us in this film is Superman, himself, Henry Cavill. The man is built like a tank and takes on the role of CIA skull-cracker August Walker. His fighting scenes are brutal, to say the least. Rebecca Ferguson is back in the role of Ilsa Faust and she is kicking all kinds of ass throughout the film, usually while on the back of a motorcycle. And if you are looking for the heart of the team Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg are back in the roles of Luther and Benji just to keep things on the level. Writer/Director Christopher McQuarrie and writer Bruce Geller have done a great job weaving together this high-action spy tale. They have really created a fun and intense film for audiences to enjoy. Honestly, I am not even sure how you can come up with writing a story that weaves in and out of itself as well as they have here, but they have done it. You don't necessarily need to have seen the previous films to follow this, but it will certainly help you keep up with the story a little easier since there are lots of references to past films, old missions, and character storylines especially with Michelle Monaghan's role as Julia Meade-Hunt. Seeing this film will almost want to make you go back and rewatch the previous ones anyway, so maybe a refresher is in order before seeing this. Overall, this is a kick-ass film. There is so much happening at any turn that you are almost guaranteed not to get bored. If suspense is your thing then be in the right place this weekend and buckle up for a Mission: Impossible to not-accept. Seriously!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
232,itsbobr,The Most Exciting Mission Impossible Movie Ever,10,5 December 2018,"Ethen Hunt's (Tom Cruise) mission is to get back the Plutonium bombs that he let get away because he decided to save the life of his team member Luther (Ving Rhames). He is to disable the new Syndicate called the Apostles led by John Lark, and no one knows what he looks like. Nice, eh?You know the ultimate goal Ethen Hunt is tasked with, but there will be many twists and turns and this will become quite complicated at times. There are many scenes trying to figure out who John Lark is. Just keep an eye on those bombs and this will become most enjoyable.With the fight stunts, going the wrong way on a motorcyle being chased by Assassins at the Arc de Triomphe, racing around Paris in a souped up BMW, climbing into an airborne helicopter and clinging to dear life on the side of a very smooth mountain wall you will need to catch your breath often. These scenes are absolutely mind-boggling and you wonder how well they were done without mishaps. You do know that Tom Cruise does his own stunts, right? Oh, almost forgot: Cruise as Hunt leaps across open spaces from one building to another. Something inside of me said that can't happen. With Cruise it's more than just movie magic. (Indeed)This is probably the best Mission Impossible ever and we are forever grateful, but we keep hoping no one gets hurt. I held my breath often. You'll see.Notables: Henry Cavill (with mustache and the beginnings of a beard) as Walker, an Assassin forced to work with Hunt, but is willing to kill him if need be; Simon Pegg as Benji, a member of the IMF Team; Rebecca Ferguson as Ilisa, a MI-6 Agent who needs to prove herself to MI -6 to finally be free of them and she has feelings for Hunt; Angela Bassett as Erika, CIA chief; Alec Baldwin as a U.S. Secretary, of Defense or State (wasn't clear); Michelle Monaghan as Julia, Hunt's former wife; Vanessa Kirby as The White Widow: she brokers deals between governments; Christopher Joner as Nils Debruuk, who made the bombs.It does surprise me that actors from these kinds if action movies never get Oscars or even get nominated for one. That's a pity because these actors are every bit Oscar-Worthy. Bummer. These are great actors.At the end, I was hoping that Ethen Hunt would say he wanted to learn how to learn how to fly a helicopter. Remember he was in one when everything went wrong. You'll see.

234,ivanmessimilos,Great action movie,9,1 November 2020,"One of the better directed action movies in recent years, certainly one of the best in this decade, although it may be to the point that such films have been in decline for the last ten or twenty years. It's almost unbelievable that the sixth sequel to any franchise looks this good and fresh. Interestingly, the director changed for each film in the series and this film is the first where the predecessor remained the same. The last three are very good, and this one is probably the best in terms of quality. An interesting story that requires attention, tense action scenes that are at the highest level. I must also mention Tom Cruise who is a masterful actor as well as an action star who participates in various breathtaking stunts. Shooting, driving, racing, jumping, parkour, flying, the character did absolutely everything in a very tense film through his 140 minutes, which is not a small amount for an action film.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
235,FelipeCarrillo,Tom Cruise will never die,9,17 October 2018,"By their own efforts, force-sensitive scavenging Jedis; vengeful ladies with psychokinetic skills and enhanced mental abilities or lethal combat prowess from ancient Chinese martial arts; drivers with good values ready for any racing madness involving high speed; young people experiencing memory or hearing problems thirsty for the adrenaline of a car, a motorbike, a yacht or a punch; supermen, superwomen, villains and anti-heroes who fight for stability defending their beliefs about peace, truth, love, hope, justice, ""law"" and chaos staunchly; top-secret agents/spies wearing elegant attire that, most of the time, emerge victorious from their missions; retired assassins who forcibly return to 'the Continental Hotel' by a puppy incident and characters and/or animated heroes who save continents, countries, cities, friends and families deserve their due respect and recognition both in the industry and in the history of film. However, suddenly, the sassy boldness and unstoppable charm of the IMF agent who leads, legally or illegally, impossible agency missions have helped to shape one of the best action/adventure films of the 21st century and, sans nul doute, the best actioner since George Miller's 2015 multi-Oscar-winning post-apocalyptic masterpiece. Hence, critics, cinephiles and moviegoers alike are greeting it with raves, comparing the latest and most barbaric adventure of Hunt and his team - save William Brandt played by Jeremy Renner, who was committed heart and soul to Marvel Studios - to modern-classic ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" for its mastery assembling and disassembling heart-stopping sequences and to the Christopher Nolan DC trilogy, especially with Warner's 2008 classic ""The Dark Knight,"" for its courage to deal with sore, meaningful purposes with a firm hand and mind-blowing ideas, piling layer after layer on the characters and the plot.To the rhythm of the all-time original theme by Argentine Lalo Schifrin - which was written in full in a three-minute period, a true impossible mission, - ""Jack Reacher"" filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie immerses us in the plot, getting down to the moral issues, picking up the timeline alongside most of the well-known characters after an undisclosed time since the events of ""Rogue Nation,"" presenting the main mission that will lead our fav spies to venture into the most imposing wonders in the world, dreamscapes where explosive surprises will take place, playing around with the bad and good guys in a progressive whipsaw that will end in a devilishly old-school twist, vitalizing via ""hyper-Hitchcockian"" anticipations that cement solid intrigue and interest in one of the most eye-popping, high-impact set-pieces you'll see this year. Moviemaking, good moviemaking is a joint process in which hundreds of agents play a role in favor of making the vision of a single individual a reality, the director is that individual. McQuarrie isn't oblivious to good, grandiloquent action extravaganzas, that's for sure, he isn't oblivious to equally coherent and captivating narrative constructions, or much less, to team up with Cruise, either directly or indirectly. On the basis of the foregoing, with irrefutable logic, it's correct to affirm that, in fact, he isn't oblivious to ""Mission: Impossible,"" being responsible for the direction and writing of the fifth (previous) installment of the saga. This filmmaker not only has the necessary qualities to pull off another strong Abrams-produced production, but also finds time to expand his scope as a screenwriter while giving his own personal seal as an artist with powerful and always focused additions that embellish the cinematic process in a fascinating way. In addition to enjoying a clear magic directing actors on set, the Oscar-winning writer knows exactly when and how to move the gears for each genre, has the precise measurement of baking for either a drama or comedy moment, knows how to intersperse clear, static and fast shots to compose unrelenting sequences, knows how to keep his vision alive, knows that taking real risks is necessary and, in short, knows how to direct mega-productions with verve and conviction. McQuarrie makes this sixth installment go forward and not backward as usually happens with sequels, as keeps the whole movie moving, everything spins and works like a Swiss watch, with precision, fast pace and poise. According to many viewers, we're in front of the best film in the series, and taking into consideration the not-so-low standards of the succession of films started by Brian de Palma in 1996, one of the best sagas in the history of action film. His direction is an indisputable harmony, ears and eyes alike enjoy the excellent work carried out despite the difficulties that arose throughout the shooting, however, his role is greater by accrediting as the only screenwriter, his boldness, odds in favor, gets wonderful results for contemporary Hollywood cinema. Hunt receives a story that, albeit not break the usual spy canons where the game of cat and mouse is a constant or where the 'no-one-is-what-they-seem-to-be' formula comes to light in the third act, it's a treatment pushing him to unusual edges, causing the emergence of issues that involve and mix the moral with the ethical, deeper and more interesting dilemmas that compel him to think more than once what he's about to do. To sum things up, the screenwriter bestows three-dimensionality, he's thought of as a human being in spite of his extravagant actions, a human cornered not only by a trio of nuclear bombs.This leads us to the fast-paced twist the plot itself becomes. McQuarrie provides well-defined resolutions from the beginning to create new ones with such sensitivity and understanding that hardly anyone can anticipate that true-blue heart-stopping last thirty minutes. It's an incredibly harmonized screenplay between character development and exposition of the events that conceives an impressive spy movie, the best of its kind since the billion-dollar Sam Mendes-directed film ""Skyfall.""An A-1 mainstream film must represent each feature of the script to the screen in the best way possible, however, an A-1 mainstream actioner must articulate smoothly the above with, of course, emblematic sequences. Every new movie in the 22-year franchise provides substantial added value coming in the form of legendary Tom Cruise, a true super-man who categorically rejects the use of stunt performers for his high-risk scenes. Modesty apart, Cruise is an actor who, literally and figuratively, gets under Ethan Hunt's skin, he's Hunt, thus becoming one of the few stars who perform their own action scenes today in Hollywood. This time, forget scratches and bruises, an on-set ankle injury has called him, an accident that halted the movie's shooting until his health improved - as a curious note, the editing team incorporated the sequence of the accident in the final cut for honoring the feats of the American idol. - But the cinematic push is further enhanced by the perfect, high-standard motion picture film format: IMAX 3D. Lower-voltage scenes get a drastically reduced ratio and the hyperactive, dangerous, bold acrobatics by Mr. Cruise make full use of the overwhelming magnitudes of the screen, stepping up the immersive experience with a sound system as surround as only IMAX can do, conveying sensations of emotion and adrenaline, mixtures between danger and intrigue that, even knowing in advance that our hero is practically immortal, deliver a two-hour heart attack. Forget theme parks, run to watch Christopher McQuarrie's latest, non-stop action-packed movie!Drawing upon some landscapes and townscapes of India, UK, France and New Zealand, Rob Hardy, a modern cinematography maestro who has built artistic sci-fi gems such as ""Annihilation"" and ""Ex Machina,"" places his exquisite style in a setting far from fantasy, getting artfully neat visuals on its objectives with high levels of elegance, sobriety and magnetism on costume and production design, in the old-fashioned Parisian streets or the crushing European dreamscapes. Commitment by each and every one of the members of the huge technical and artistic team is awe-inspiring, they esteem a big budget, and, moreover, prioritize film's artistic purpose over the ever-lurking avidity for extravagant grosses.There are few cases where a commercial advertisement transcends beyond its purpose, here one of the best examples. The creators of the trailer released during Super Bowl LII must not only headline the year-end best trailers lists by critics and movie reviewers, but receive a true award for their exceptional, exceptional work. Although few talk about this kind of stuff in their reviews, the perfectly matched 2-minute stunner made by highly skilled trailer makers deserves it; one of the best trailers of this decade.""Mission: Impossible-Fallout"" by Christopher McQuarrie smashes, on several occasions and ways, big-budget action movie tropes much like contemporary classics do, moving away from the artificiality of danger to get fully into building a true-blue adrenaline rush. In these times, making high-quality action films in Hollywood has become an impossible feat, putting the blame on plotting emptiness and tech breakthroughs that bury a good narrative. However, with an overlong period of time in between, mainstream gems serendipitily flourishes trying to propose through risks. That is what makes this ""MI"" entry to take part in the select, coveted must-see top of the last eighteen years. Film doesn't falsify reality, imitates it, for this reason, those breathtaking, stunning- in the vast majority truthful -set-pieces are an out-of-this-world experience, where suspense, adrenaline and enjoyment are involuntary reactions to a cinematic cocktail everyone should see. A spectacular, unforgettable roller-coaster ride that vitalizes a billion-dolar spy franchise, a triumph that must be experienced in the largest IMAX screen.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Every fight scene had great cuts that amplified the action. The car chase scenes reeled me in, even though I usually use those as bathroom breaks. The skydiving scene was brilliant and should be the first clip he shows to potential employers. I am not a huge fan of the spy flick/secret agent genre, but MI:F was able to keep the plot complicated and interesting.

The spy espionage twist and turns act out as remarkably clever plot pieces-that were certainly crowd-pleasing-and seemingly outdue the previous films' cunning endeavors. Just the commitment and passion that the filmmakers, crew, and cast have devoted into this entry especially when it comes to the action concepts and sequences-which are rightly accomplished stylishly-are to be praised alone.

And he fights Superman! So the main theme to part 6 is this. Ethan Hunt did not kill the bad guy, Solomon Lane from the previous film, played by Sean Harris, a cool creepy character actor, and he's back to tear Ethan Hunt a new butthole, and plans to take a bunch of people with him, including Ethan's ex Julia, what??? And to top it all off, the government bastards don't really trust Ethan, so they send a babysitter, Henry Cavill as August Walker. Ok, so the big mystery of this one... there's a mystery guy out there working against Ethan's team, and they seem to know their every move. So Ethans entire team, and August Walker is out to recapture Solomon and stop the madness before the mystery bad spy can get him. Who could it be??? The basic cast has remained the same, a few additions along the way, and then there's Henry Cavill's character, this one will be tough to figure out. But a really fun entertaining flick...

242,LukeCustomer2,Could have been better.,7,12 August 2019,"I give Tom Cruise great credit. He really tries on everything he does. He takes a nugget that most people would rush through and really fleshes it out and makes something pretty good. Keep in mind people this is MI:6. To have a movie that is this good - this long into a franchise -says something about Tom Cruises's desire to produce something good and, I see that, and I appreciate that.But there were two big problems that really brought the movie down for me. Too many double crosses. Now, I know, this is mission impossible.. that is what they do! But too many added to the mix just confuses the audience and makes it so when you finally get to a real scene, you have no idea if Hunt's wife is going to pull off her face at the end. It cheapens the real story to have too many fake outs. This was way over the top and extended the movie run time needlessly.Second this movie seemed to be going for a theme that what makes Hunt special is that he won't just allow his friends to die for the mission. On the one hand.. I like that. Hunt has come a long way from who he was (as has Cruise) when he was younger and it is good growth. But the problem here was too heavy handed. We could see Hunt's decisions.. we didn't need to hear the CIA higher ups going on about it. Or see Hunt spare a beat cop. Also, kind of makes me wonder if that is the wisest choice for a spy and makes me wonder if it means Hunt needs to retire.Othwerise I thought it was all great. I enjoy the extended action scenes where you can tell a lot was put into it. I enjoyed seeing Hunt's wife again in a way that made sense. I enjoyed Hunt just being an action guy with good friends rather than getting bogged down in a heavy romance. Even Henry Cavill was pretty good. I would watch it with a remote handy.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Well, maybe not Tom Cruise the actor, but definitely Tom Cruise the monster ego. And what an ego it is! Honestly, I marvel at how the other actors can keep a straight face or keep from vomiting as they are required to mouth lines in praise of Tom's character's awesomeness and how the world would definitely self destruct without him at the centre of it keeping us all safe. Sigh.That being said though, there's no question Cruise can act and puts on a good show (his self aggrandisement aside). The Mission Impossible films have oodles of action, lashings of techno-geekery, spectacular scenery and convoluted but interesting plots. This one is no exception and if that's what floats your boat then you'll love this.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
244,Lewis_Heather787,Greatest action movie franchise ever??,8,27 July 2018,"We should all take a moment and realise how lucky we really are to have the Mission Impossible franchise, it is the very essence of what a modern day blockbuster should be. Brilliant action, great twist, over the top story and all over great acting, comes together for a fun and bloody entertaining time at the cinema. Is there really another film franchise like it?? It is extremely rare that a film franchise, such as this one, gets better with every entry.............well apart from MI 2 which I think we should all try and forget about. Brushing over that I am very pleased to say that since MI 3 every Mission Impossible has been better than its predecessor and that trend has continued without Fallout. I know its cliche but this is the best film in the franchise for some very good reasons.Firstly Christopher McQuarrie has directed a beautiful, fun and thoroughly entertaining film from start to finish. The directing is sublime with some incredibly complex action set pieces that are shot perfectly, with a mixture of wide shots and close ups. Showing fantastic angles to the breathtaking locations or stunts that are being performed. The most important takeaway I have from his directing is the fact it is so tonally different to Rogue Nation, which he also directed. Being the first Mission director to come back I was worried that this film would feel to much like Rogue Nation, which is not a bad thing but every entry does and should have a different feel. This one certainly does, fantastic job all round.Lets move onto probably one of the greatest actors to have ever lived in Tom Cruise, say what you will about his private life, but he really is the last big movie star . I highly doubt that there will ever be anyone else quiet like him. As per usual he is fantastic in the role of Ethan Hunt, I don't think he has ever phoned in a performance in this franchise. The heart and soul of every film he knows how to carry a story and a cast with him along the journey. The stunts are truly breathtaking and a wonder to watch, we should be extremely thankful to him for going the extra mile just for our entertainment. No other actors would go to these lengths to do these stunts its something that should be championed and honoured. Or is that to much??? I think that general audience just take it for granted but the time and effort that is but into these films is immense. Not everything is done on green screen!The other cast members Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris, Alec Baldwin, Angela Bassett, Vanessa Kirby and Michelle Monaghan are all really good in their either reprising or new roles. However there are two others that just stand a little above them, firstly Rebecca Ferguson who is perfect in the role as Ilsa. She brings such energy and heart to the story in both this film and Rogue Nation, I'm so glad that she was brought back in this film, and she was used in the best way. Her story arc throughout this film is really strong/emotional and has a nice ending. Easily one of the best characters that the franchise has had. The other is Henry Cavill, and his infamous moustache, plays a role that has much more to it that you first think. There is a scene in the film involving Sean Harris and masks, thats all I will say...... genius on McQuarries part, I personally didn't see it coming until Cavill says ""men in halloween masks"" or something like that.Overall this film is 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10, very good film throughout. The directing is top notch, action enthralling and jaw dropping, acting top class throughout. The franchise keeps getting better and better, the best one to date I have to say. There is only one slight negative I have about the film and that is........its about 20 minutes to long but apart from that it is a true joy to watch. Funny, jaw dropping, noisy, over the top and out of this world stylish......this is what a true modern blockbuster should be!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
245,novagirl11,"exciting, captivating, suspenseful, and girl power!",8,13 August 2018,"This film had high expectations, a huge budget, lots of hype, and it did not disappoint! Knowing that Tom does his own stunts makes it that much cooler to watch. I was on the edge of my seat for two and a half hours! The plot twists and complicated storylines were captivating, although I think Henry Cavill's character development could have used some more work. The music and sound effects were classic, appropriate and added to the scene without being overwhelmingly loud or distracting - no small feat! Also, I love the strong, powerful, badass women in this movie!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
246,mr_bickle_the_pickle,6th Movie in and still going strong,8,7 August 2018,"The Mission Impossible films have rarely made a misstep. Some would say the second one but even that is a fun in a cheesy 90s action kind of way. And this latest one is really no different. Its a solid film which feels really rare when you're the 6th film in a franchise.There was some really great action set pieces. I loved the fight choreography in the bathroom scene especially. I mean, it wasnt always the most realistic action. If you're throwing people through mirrors and ramming them through pillars, I just dont think they're gonna get up from that so easily. But it was still a great scene and executed well by both the fight choreographers and the director. There is great stunt work as well, although I didnt feel like it topped the last installment. Although once you've held on to the side of plane its kind of hard to beat that. I also liked that they brought Michelle Monaghan's character back. I thought it added a nice bit of closure to that chapter in Ethan Hunt's life. I also liked that this film had other ties to the past. Like Vanessa Kirby's character is the daughter of someone in a previous film (I wont say who to try and keep it a surprise). It doesnt play a big part in the movie but I thought it was a fun little easter egg. And overall I didnt find the plot too complicated or hard to understand. In fact there were scenes where I could guess (correctly) what would happen next. There was some comedic moments too. The ones that really tickled my fancy were the little winks and nods that Ethan is getting older and this isnt as easy anymore. Like during the chase scene where he hesitates to jump out of a window. There is one thing that I am kind of tired of with these movies. All of them except the second one have played around with the concept of ""Ethan's gone rogue"" in some shape or another. It doesn't feel fresh anymore. Also, they make a point in this film about how Ethan cares more about his team than ""doing the job"". And I kind of wish there was a moment where Ethan actually had to make a hard decision for the sake of the world/mission. Yes, it would have been dark if he had to sacrifice one of his team members or if he had to kill some cops but I think it would have brought a little more gravitas and weight to the movie. But overall, its a great action movie and if you like the Mission Impossible franchise, I dont think you'll be disappointed with this one.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
247,Jared_Andrews,Best Action Movie of the Year,9,30 July 2018,"'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' burst onto the scene this weekend, rejuvenating what had been a mostly baron summer of action-blockbusters. Sure, we had 'Equalizer 2' and 'Skyscraper,' but those were both meh. Thankfully, this film is far better than meh. Actually, it's excellent. Its excellence comes from a commitment to the craft. Normally, three months of intensive training are required for someone to qualify for a helicopter pilot's license. Tom Cruise, in preparation for this film, did it in half that time. How? By training 16 hours a day, seven days a week. He did all this for one action sequence. That's the level of commitment to the craft that went into this movie. Each grand set piece (all of which are glorious) fills the frame just right. Very little CGI is used, which makes everything look real because it is real. We aren't watching a contrived creation of what is supposed to look like Tom Cruise zipping through town on a motorcycle-he's actually zipping through town on a motorcycle. And that helicopter pilot training? That paid off in a big way. It delivered what is one of the best, most intense action sequences in years. Each scene flows smoothly into the next, rarely pausing to catch its breath. It brings to mind memories of 'Mad Max: Fury Road,' which featured a similarly breakneck pace and continuous propulsion. Fallout's action doesn't quite reach that level, but the feel is certainly similar. I've waited this long to mention the plot because I hardly considered it essential, which might sound weird or as though it's a detriment (it's not). There is a lot to know and also very little know. Early scenes feature some rather extensive exposition. The density and length of these conversations may cause some viewers' minds to wander-that's okay. While the dialogue is crisp and the details are helpful for better understanding the plot, all viewers really need to understand is that a group of terrorists called The Apostles want to wreak havoc, and it's Ethan Hunt's mission to stop them. Basically, he and his team need to save the world. There's nothing wrong with action taking center stage over the story in this case. After all, this is an action movie. The minute reasons why something is happening become less important when what is happening is so masterfully executed and thrilling to watch. The camera whirls majestically around each chase sequence, and the fight scenes pop off the screen. They're brutal, well-shot and coherent, which is not always the case with big budget action films. The violence feels real, as do the consequences. I know jaw-dropping is a bit of a cliché description to use, but these fight scenes (and a few additional action sequences) literally made my jaw drop. And of course, in between the fights, we receive a hefty dose of Tom Cruise running really fast. He's one of the all-time best movie runners. Tremendous intensity. Beautiful form. Cruise is exceptional. This franchise would crumble without him. Ving Rhames, who has been at Cruise's side for all six 'M:I' films, is a steadying presence once again. Simon Pegg provides his usual comic relief, and Henry Cavill steps in as a younger, stronger super-spy, to remind us that Cruise can't do this forever. Overall, this is an exceptionally satisfying movie-going experience. It's one of the best films of the year and one that will stick with you well after leaving the theater.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
248,sirwillisiv,One of 2018's finest action films...,9,15 August 2018,"Mission: Impossible is a film series that just keeps getting better with each installment. Fallout is a constant surge of slick action and riveting stunts. You'd think the sixth installment of a film series would be tired, repetitive, and offer very little refreshing material, but Fallout manages to deliver quite a rousing marathon of engaging set-pieces, including fast-paced car chases in London, blinding shootouts in the canals, foot races on building tops, and even helicopter dogfights along snowcapped mountains. The set-pieces are very well choreographed, shot, and edited. My eyes never got lost, I could always make out exactly what was happening on screen and I was invested throughout.As for the story and characterization, it's pretty standard; a simple premise regarding a global threat with its occasional twists and turns. It doesn't feel forcibly rehashed, as it continues the on-going sub-narrative involving Ethan's wife and brings it to a satisfying conclusion. Overall, the plot is nothing ambitious, but also nothing dreary and done-to-death. If it wasn't for the action sequences keeping me enthralled I would probably be more hard on the writing, since it does have its cheesy moments, mostly played for laughs or to drag on some redundant tension. It's an action movie; thrills before tales. My personal biggest issue was the overstuffed cast, particularly on the villain's side. Too many faces to keep track of and it complicated the story a bit, as well as a few set-pieces, yet the central antagonist (I won't say who) is pretty menacing and sets a promising standard for the particular actor who played him.I've got nothing else to report. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is quite the rousing picture. With stunning action sequences, a decent story with grounded performances, and impressive stunt work, I think Fallout is the best Mission: Impossible yet. One of 2018's finest action films. Leave your brain outside the theater and have some fun!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
249,coasterdude44,It's the best action film of 2018,8,15 October 2018,"Mission Impossible 6 - Fallout is a great movie and is the second directed by Christopher McQuarrie and probably have to say that it is even better than the last, Mission Impossible 5 - Rogue Nation which came out in 2015 even though I thought Rogue Nation was much more visually striking and vibrant production design wise while this one looked a lot more, well... black. But that's okay because the film is still great and is probably now my second favourite M:I film behind M:I 4 - Ghost Protocol by Brad Burt, which is my favourite action film of 2011, which is then behind Mission Impossible 1 followed by M:1 2. I still haven't seen Mission Impossible III, but it can't be any better than Mission: Impossible 2 which was still a really good action film in the end. 
Anywaym M:16 is still my favourite action film of the year that has gone leaps ahead from it's predecessors always trying to be more entertaining than the last, in which this one succeded. Tom Cruise is always pushing himself as an actor and his own personal stuntman to electrify the audience no matter what the cost. I thought it was impossible to top climbing up the side of Burj Khalifa but he managed to do it by training himself to fly a helicopter through a canyon sequence which took over 2 years to complete. The plot is more powerful than ever when a religious warhead threatens to blow up three of the holiest sites in the world with three nuclear shotput balls in where it is up to Ethan Hunt and his team to track him down and stop him and the bombs from going off before it's too late, even if it caused him to question his morals along the way.
Mission Impossible 6 gives you everything you want from a Mission Impossible and Tom Cruise action movie. It has the incredible action and fighting sequences, the nailbiting infiltration scene, the very complex and hard to follow plot and Tom Cruise's incredible stuntwork dedication and stamina. I just wish it didn't look so visually dark. But apart from that, it's the best action film of the year and you should definitely see it.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

This one though I just found a bit boring. The plot was not that intriguing, the twist was predictable, the filming of it seemed quite grey and lacklustre. Most importantly tho, the action sequences were not that good. Quite boring. It just did not do it for me. Most movies like this, even with flaws I give 7/10 as they are enjoyable.

Why are you thinking so far into this?The action sequences are great, as usual, and Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill both are amazing together. The acting itself is also very good from all the actors and actresses.The storyline is typical MI, but even still, I thought it was well thought out and entertaining, if not a bit unrealistic.

257,ccorral419,"""Been there, done that""",7,31 July 2018,"Director Christopher McQuarrie (Oscar Winner -Best Writing ""The Usual Suspects"") has written and directed two Tom Cruise MI films, in addition to Cruise's ""Jack Reacher"" action film. Could it be that McQuarrie/Cruise has run its course? Or, is this rather predictable misstep the blame of Producer J.J. Abrams (""Star Wars: The Last Jedi'), who hasn't really been on roll these days himself? Present is the ""should you choose to accept it..."" destructing instructions, the debonaire Cruise, the familiar MI theme music (by Lorne Balfe), attractive co-star (Henry Cavill ""Superman""), the cold-hearted boss (Angela Bassett), goofy side kicks (Ving Rhams and Simon Pegg), car & motorcycle chases, daredevil leaps, bounds and flights (by Cruise), fight scenes that rarely cause a bruise, gun battles that always hit the bad dudes (but never the good guys), terrific London cinematography (Rob Hardy), good and bad love interests (Rebecca Ferguson ""The Greatest Showman,"" Vanessa Kirby ""The Crown"" TV Series, and Michelle Monaghan ""Pixels""), and a few fun/interesting secondary roles by Wes Bentley (hot off of ""Yellowstone"" TV), Alec Baldwin and CNN Newscaster Wolf Blitzer. And, if that's not enough to stimulate your senses, ""the dossier"" (not today's ""dossier,"" but the word dossier) gets tossed into this action packed extravaganza. Personally, I found the whole thing ""been there, done that"" from the get go. Maybe it was McQuarrie and Bruce Geller's verbose writing that required the actors to continually overly explain what's happening, why it's happening and what might happen if something doesn't happen. Even the fun twists and turns that are usually associated with this series, are predictable and lack exciting impact. Hey, this is MI and we're told to love this film. So, check it out, and you decide if you have a ""Fallout"" with this series.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
258,kjjames81,A solid auctioneer.,6,28 July 2018,"The premise is the same as the previous ones, Cruise and his buddies have to save themselves and the world.
Cruise does these movies with great flare and is good at it.
The pros: the bike sequence is again done very well, the stunts good as usual, Henry Cavill excellent as an agent, maybe this will be his new calling, he looked more at home here than Cruise.
Cons: Simon Pegg, a bit of a thorn in the side in this movie, he needs to stick to the comic roles not action, he looked totally out of place when he had to do the action sequences.
All in all a good film but brought the same formula as the previous ones. Yes I am a fan of these movies, so when it comes to buy it on DVD, I will.

259,Fields201,Fallout Won't Be The Last,8,31 July 2018,"Surprisingly, I kept up with the Mission Impossible series since its debut with Brian De Palma's first entry to the series. I thought the direction was weird, felt nothing like the series, but the action was decent. Then part 2 came out and the only reason why I saw that was because it was directed by John Woo. That one wasn't that great. Then the third came out, and like I thought, Philip Seymour Hoffman's villainous portrayal was the best part of the movie. Then Ghost Protocol came out and it was probably one of the best action movies I ever seen and Rogue Nation was no slacker either. So now here we are, with the sixth installment, and it's still a great series.Basically, the movie is about Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team of Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, and new recruit Henry Cavill trying to find three pieces of plutonium before the world is annihilated. Some twists and turns happen, but let's face it, you go these movies for the action and it delivers. Early on, there is a cool bathroom fight that almost reminds me of the bathroom fight in True Lies. You even get a scene where Tom Cruise is running. I'm actually shocked that there is no scene in this one where Tom Cruise is dangling in some restricted area. I guess they ran out of ideas for those scenes since they've practically been in every single one of these films unless I missed something. I really don't have too much complaints with this one. If you are in the mood for a summer blockbuster, see it. If you are a fan of the series, definitely see it. The performances are all great, especially Henry Cavill, and it's over two hours of a good time. So far, this is the best movie of the summer for me.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

261,achyutaghosh,How Ethan Hunt one-upped James Bond for like forever,10,29 July 2018,"First things first. Mission Impossible- Fallout is an incredible movie. Tom Cruise raises the bar so high in the sixth entry in Mission Impossible series, and I am already salivating at what comes next. Frankly, saving the world is what Cruise does as a day job. But Fallout is exceptional- world ending context, dizzying action, thrilling chase sequences, picturesque locales, solid acting, witty script and the odd emotional moment - all come together to deliver probably the best action movie so far this year, Infinity War included.""There cannot be peace without first, a great suffering. The greater the suffering, the greater the peace. The end you've always feared is coming. It's coming, and the blood will be on your hands."" - Solomon LaneFor the first time in the franchise, we have a sequel. Fallout begins where Rogue Nation ended- Solomon Lane is incarcerated, and the remains of his organization, the Syndicate has become a terrorist group called the Apostles. Due to an uncharacteristic goof-up by Hunt and his IMF team, the Apostles get three plutonium cores, which they plan to detonate in Vatican, Jerusalem and Mecca. Ironically, not very religious, the Apostles. Hunt and his team has to recover the plutonium cores under the watchful eyes of CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) and her stooge August Walker (Henry Cavill). This is a Mission Impossible movie, so mind you nothing meets the eye, and the pace is incredible. The action begins in Paris, moves to London and ends in Kashmir. In it, Ethan Hunt does halo jumps, suicidally bikes against traffic in city streets, runs like only Tom Cruise can, beats up thugs half his age in a Paris bathroom, and hangs out of helicopters for half the movie. Hell, the bathroom fight itself is worth the price of admission. Is this the future of action movies? Maximum action, maximum impact? One begs the question though- at 56 how does Tom Cruise still do it? The Mission Impossible series may be 22 years old, but it still does stunts the old fashioned way, no green screen. Yet each stunt is so impeccably planned and executed, and Cruise goes all out to please audiences. During the production of Fallout, Cruise could have died half a dozen times over, but he emerged only with a broken ankle. Respect. Mission Impossible 6 is also the 7th collaboration between Director Christopher McQuarrie and Cruise, each of them know each other so well that even though the plot is generic, but the inventiveness of the action, the wholehearted trust that Cruise has, and the sudden double crosses ensconced in the script is more than enough for this one to hit gold standards. Of course the references to older MI movies such as the rock climbing sequence from MI2, the moral choices that Nolan explored in The Dark Knight, and the True Lies bathroom fight dials in the nostalgia. The rest of the cast is great. The old gang returns- Ving James as Luther and Simon Pegg as Benji, and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) from the previous movie join in too, along with Ethan's ex-fiance' Julia (Michelle Monaghan) who last featured 12 years back. There is a scene where both Julia and Ilsa share the screen, and then you realize Ethan has a type- tall, leggy brunettes. Cavill is the hammer to Cruise's scalpel, and the movie does not hold him back in the fights. But then with Cruise in such top form, not even Superman is a match for him.10/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
262,Come-and-Review,An exciting and stylish film,9,25 August 2018,"Finally, a good and enjoyable film from this year.
Let's make this clear: Fallout uses several classic spy tropes and specifically Mission: Impossible tropes (masks, for example). What makes this entry so great, and maybe the best in the series, is the way everything is orchestrated.The plot centers around Ethan Hunt and his team trying to prevent a nuclear attack to prevent (much like in M:i-5).I must say that every single action (and non-action) scene of the film is very enjoyable. There are some very outstanding stunts and sequences, also plenty of comic scenes (I didn't expect that I would laugh this much), and the final 10 minutes excel at keeping the tension on. Despite the conclusion could have been predictable, up to the last second the viewer is in doubt whether Ethan and his team will succeed at saving the world or not. I really liked the visuals of the film. Much of the lighting seems to reproduce a nuclear blast, (the impending danger that has to be prevented) providing this entry of the series with a distinct visual style. There is definitely some very stunning photography that permeates most of this film's scenes.Christopher McQuarrie seems to give a different direction to some characters, particularly Ethan's wife from M:i-3 (introduced by Abrams) and Rebecca Ferguson's character, introduced in the previous film. The ending suggests that there are some options for a seventh film (which, given the success of this one, is most likely to happen).So far, 2018 releases, apart from a few exceptions were pretty much letdowns to me. The arrival of Fallout definitely improved the landscape of features from the year.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
263,jace_the_film_guy,Nearly Flawless,9,16 July 2021,"The cinematography in Fallout is flawless. The transition after Ethan's mission self destructs is gorgeous and I rewound it three times because it was so clean. The biggest flaw in my mind is the White Widow. I think that her character is completely unnecessary and I found her scenes bland and boring. That being said, the bathroom fight before meeting her at the club was brilliant. Finishing off the film, the climactic 15-minute countdown was the most captivated I have been in film in a long time. I was glued to the screen! In addition, bringing back Ethan's wife Julia was a perfect conclusion to her character's story arc. Rather than have an ambiguous end to her story, she is given a new beginning. Not only that, but she cleared Ethan's conscious and allowed him to move forward with Ilsa and the IMF.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

269,plasticanimalz,"Okay, Now I Know IMDB Accepts Bots or Fake Reviews",5,11 August 2018,"I've always wondered how it is that tent poll action movies one after the other get such high scores. It doesn't matter if they're terrible, mediocre, or good, they always rate from the low 80s to middle 90s, no matter the quality of story or if one exists. Keeps happening over and over and I thought maybe it's because guys just love the crud out of these movies no matter the plot. I can accept that. And some of these movies are clearly just geared toward men. I can accept that too, and usually I won't bother to write a review on those, and some times won't bother to rate it 'cause clearly I'm not the intended audience. Which, does hackle me that guys will go out of their way to write and score a bad review for a movie clearly intended for women that they haven't even seen. So annoying along with immature. Women are half the population. The expectation that all should be geared toward men is ridiculous, childish and selfish when women pay for half the movie tickets. MI is clearly a movie meant for men that they want to attract a female audience for, so, all though I originally had no real interest in reviewing this, in light of looking at the female IMDB ratings for MI: Fallout and for Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, I simply couldn't let it go. Clearly something is up. I get it, Tom Cruise is a big, rich star and his ego is invested, so, he needs high scores and reviews along with box office tickets...but, I'm compelled to say, enough is enough. There is simply no way on god's green earth that women of all ages rated MI; 5, one of the weaker of the franchise, higher than Mamma Mia:2, and by a considerable amount. Impossible. Literally impossible. I went to see Mamma Mia:2 with a group on opening weekend on a Tuesday afternoon and the theatre was almost sold out, and entirely women, along with the theatre across the hall that was also showing MM:2. We went to talk about it afterwards and everyone loved it. Didn't think it was rocket science but fully enjoyed it. Every woman I talked to had either seen it and loved it or was going to see it and looking forward to it. I think the score MM:2 is fairly accurate. Like I said, it's very enjoyable but not like it's a great film, just fun. I saw MI:2 on Thursday night a week after it opened and the theatre was almost empty and almost all men. My only allure to see MI:5, to be honest, was Rebecca Ferguson. I enjoyed the first two MI, but MI:3, was fairly whatever, and I had little interest in seeing 4. I've been a long time fan of Tom Cruise, but he's simply getting up there in age and he's got Bourne Identity and a ton of other action films to compete with over the years, so, I'm just less inspired to see this sort of played out franchise. Not as much as James Bond, which my dad still likes, but no one else I know. The Kingsmen had promise, but then the second one sucked. I enjoyed the first 90 minutes of MI:5 as far as a fairly pointless action movie that didn't have much plot...then, the script sort of went off the rails enough so that they couldn't fix it in the editing room and prayed that people would just not notice or get confused and think they missed something. There were 3 serious plot holes that happened within 5-10 minutes of the film at the 90 minute mark. You simply can't miss that. Well, given today's viewing audience I guess they can...or maybe just not care. That really lost it for me because it made the rest entirely pointless. Not to mention, it's all very predictable. I knew the villain from the beginning. I knew the twists before they happened. MI really does not have much more to offer. And the villain when you give it even a second to think about it makes absolutely zero sense. None of it makes any sense. I don't mean I didn't understand it, I was up to speed the whole way through, I just mean it's in no way believable. Also, it's super dark. MI is supposed to be fun, not talking about starving populations, ending the world, etc. Why is everyone trying to be Dark Knight? Just be your own thing. Back to my point, aside from the mediocrity of this film, which, has more going for it then Fast & Furious, just not enough anymore and super played out, is that there is no way women of all ages unanimously loved this film. It's just pointless dude action from one action moment to the next with a paper-thin plot that falls completely apart at 90 minutes. There is very little dialogue. It's basically '90s Jean-Claude Van Damme on a budget. You can sit women in front of a screen with a trace of a plot, pretty faces and singing for 90 minutes and entertain them, but you can not sit them in front of pointless action for 160 minutes and expect them to be anything but upset. Not to mention the obvious handing the torch from Michelle Monaghan to Rebecca Ferguson, aging-out at 42 and the first sign of a wrinkle is going to annoy any female audience member. Like, really, she's too old for the dude in his 50s still pretending he's jumping out of buildings? Ferguson and Monaghan literally look identical. The fact they think women are so stupid they don't know Monaghan has aged out while Tom is getting too much Botox and still going at it is just lame. Not to mention, they think that women don't notice that they've replaced Monaghan, the dutiful wife who sits home by the phone while her man saves the world, with the carbon-copy Ferguson, who fights by her man, but really still doesn't have much of an existing roll other than to look hot in tight, black outfits, occasionally punch someone, and occasionally look at the hero with a smoldering look. Gag. Can we please move on from this. Played out. Played out. Played out.Next.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
270,gcsman,The running man,6,5 August 2018,"See Tom run. At some point fairly soon now, I would expect that Tom Cruise (age 57) will realize that he can't do all the action-star stunts that would be appropriate for a 30-year-old, including spending a lot of time sprinting here, there and everywhere on screen. Yes, he's got a good stride all right, but those scenes are so contrived that you get the feeling the production crews of his films must deliberately scout out locations that would look particularly photogenic for him to run through.The thing is that Cruise is actually a very decent actor. He's got an easy, comfortable screen presence, and he's capable of turning in quite strong performances given a story and script that are not just setups for action scenes. I'm thinking of examples like Edge of Tomorrow, Oblivion, Magnolia, Jerry Maguire, Rain Man. He's never hard to watch. Some of us would really like to see him to get past the stunt movies and finally get back to doing things that (insert any other decent action star here) couldn't do just as well. For the rest of the cast, Henry Cavill (who has a great voice and good delivery as well as that Superman body) turns in an interesting role -- he's one of the main reasons I went to see this in the theater. Michelle Monaghan and Rebecca Ferguson are both fine though they looked strikingly alike; they could have played sisters. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames again do fine as the MI sidekicks but again they don't have as much to do as one would have liked. Everyone is subordinate to Cruise, and the script drives that home repeatedly.So then we're left with the stunts themselves. If you mainly want a high-production thrill ride then this movie will do admirably. There's some kind of plot behind it but the explanatory details quickly get obscured in the imperatives of delivering high-octane, adeptly paced thrills. In short it's necessary for Ethan and his MI team to Save The World, what else do you need to know? Some beautiful scenery too deserves credit, both urban and mountainous. But the last 20-30 minutes went beyond impressive to being ludicrous. Sensory overload. And, there is actually no real suspense here because we know the heroes will triumph, maybe a little banged up, but that's all. I still rate the first MI film as the best of the series. It was a good successor to the TV show, where the key feature was the intelligence and cleverness of its plotting, not somewhat mindless action. Generally I'd prefer action movies where the stunts take second place to the plot, not vice versa.What if the latest MI movie opened on the same weekend as a new Bond film? They have become stylistically very similar and appeal to the same audiences. I imagine the answer would depend on which country you live in. But it would never happen.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
271,PotassiumMan,Mission Impossible's durability is proven once again,8,6 August 2018,"Whether you've followed the Mission Impossible series from the beginning or you're just getting acquainted with it now, this installment is worth seeing for the sheer adrenaline/action quotient. Just don't expect a chase scene that will look or conclude too much like reality. If this is the final chapter, the series will certainly be ending on a high note.Ethan Hunt and his gang are back in Europe, after a previous failed mission, to extricate plutonium from the hands of a dangerous international anarchist cabal that is hell-bent on world devastation. Tom Cruise is his usual, reliable, athletic self in this vehicle and is quite impressive in the action sequences for his age. Sean Harris returns as a scowling Mission Impossible villain. And Henry Cavill almost steals the film with a compelling, bristling performance.Although I did find the film's climax a bit protracted, there was never a slow, less than gripping phase in this film. As always, the sleek cinematography is unrivaled. The running time is long but doesn't feel long in the end. That's because this entry delivers a compelling action story of international intrigue as well as any Mission Impossible film to date. Gladly recommended.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

277,AnishMisra,Mission: Impossible - Falloue Review,10,28 July 2018,"Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a film written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. Having watched the trailers and being a fan of the series, I was very excited to watch the film. And once again, the M: I series did the impossible.Plot: Ethan and his IMF Team are tasked to work with CIA Agent August Walker to recover 3 plutonium cores that could be used for nuclear fallout.Story and direction: This series doesn't fail to surprise me. Each time I wonder what new they will bring to a franchise. Because by the time a sixth film does come in there is franchise exhaustion. But McQuarrie (who also directed ROGUE NATION) very well understood what he is dealing with and gave us and enthralling and memorable action film to watch. The story may not be ground-breaking in any way, but it was engaging enough to keep me glued to my seat and relish 147 minutes of pure fun. I was not bored for a single scene. The film is quite darker and mellowed down than the previous films, which I very well appreciate. The cinematography is just wonderful and captures the essence and beauty of the captivating locations perfectly. The action scenes and VFX are top-notch. The makers really upped the ante in terms of both the story and action aspect. Even the score is just awesome. Lorne Balfe has really done a good job and I can also term it the best score of the series. Performances: Tom Cruise is as usual the main star of the series and it is quiet a sin to fault him for a role he has excelled at doing for 22 years. Same goes to the eccentric Ving Rhames. Simon Pegg never fails to impress me even in the scenes that don't require comedy. Henry Cavill gave a compelling performance. Where it was felt in ROGUE NATION that Solomon Lane was not justified, Sean Harris just nails the role here. Rebecca Ferguson also added her charm and charisma to the screen. Vanessa Kirby, Angela Basset and Michelle Monaghan were good additions to the film.Favorite Scene: Not spoiling anything, the scene was kind of an epilogue between Ethan and Julia. It was beautiful and poignant to see these two characters on screen together after a very long time. Also the dialogues in that scene were very beautiful, which instantly attracted me to the scene. In addition to this scene, the final action sequence of the helicopter chase was jaw-dropping. Each time I was on the edge of my seat.Verdict: FALLOUT would be the best the M: I Series has yet to offer. I feel that for a sixth film they did justice and lived up to the name. I walked out of the hall satisfied both as a fan and a movie-goer. If there will be a seventh instalment, it better be in par with this one or above this (which I think is very difficult to top). A Perfect 10 from my side for this film.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
278,bastille-852-731547,"Thrilling, Exhilarating Action...and Not Much Else",7,28 July 2018,"I really enjoy the ""Mission: Impossible"" films, and was eagerly anticipating this new installment. I rate it on par with, but slightly below, the last film (""Rogue Nation"") of the saga in terms of quality. The film certainly brings the goods with intense, adrenaline-rush action scenes. Viewers will gasp in unison as Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) HALO jumps out of a plane, embarks on a high-speed motorcycle chase through Paris, scales buildings in London, and pilots a perilous helicopter ride. Cruise still packs plenty of charisma and swagger playing Hunt, and the film's supporting cast is generally good as well. Henry Cavill, a new addition to this franchise, gives an interesting performance as the film's only character with truly multiple dimensions to their characterization.The main criticism I have of this film is that ""Fallout"" is the first ""Mission: Impossible"" film to treat its action sequences as primary plot devices, rather than treat action sequences as logical and entertaining extensions of primary plot devices. While the film is paced well and certainly has connective tissue between its action set pieces, the density of its narrative is a bit skimpy for a film with a 2.5-hour running time. Many audiences, however, won't care about this, as they will be so enthralled by how intense and genuine the action scenes are. Cruise, who reportedly does his own stunts for these films, makes defying death look remarkably easy (and I mean that in the best way possible.) Despite this key flaw, the action, globe-trotting settings, and characters make the film tons of fun to watch. Fans of the franchise will have a great time. Those looking for a very thoughtful and dense spy film a la ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" might be a bit let down, but all others who expect not much beyond (admittedly great) action scenes will be incredibly entertained. And of course, there's something great about hearing that classic ""Mission: Impossible"" theme song that we all love with the sound up loud on the big screen. Recommended. 7.5/10Note 1: Here is my updated ranking of the ""Mission: Impossible"" films from best to worst--(1) M:I-Ghost Protocol, (2) M:I, (3) M:I-Rogue Nation, (4) M:I-Fallout, (5) M:I-2, (6) M:I-3.Note 2: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema. The intense Dolby Atmos surround sound system and Dolby Vision picture quality certainly helped enhance the experience and made the action scenes all the more engaging. That said, I think I probably prefer IMAX to Dolby Cinema (even though the latter has more comfortable seats) since I find the rumbling/vibrating of the Dolby seats to be a bit annoying. That said, I still look forward to enjoying future films in both formats.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
279,calorne,Fabulous action - Spoiler alert,7,18 June 2020,"I really enjoyed the high octane action and great to see more of Ving Rhames again.But once more it looked very much as if Benjie was a goner and yet he was saved again. This time by Isla.The Benjie character makes no sense. He is supposed to be a field agent, but even Isla is crying out ""no Benjie no"" when he is heading into a dangerous situation. She is tied up at the time - and if Benjie was a serious agent she would be pleased he was coming to save her, but she is as worried for him as if it were a mother concerned for a child climbing up a tree.Benjie simply does not sit right in MI.

280,calspers,Fine action and directing - but crucial writing issues,6,21 February 2019,"Ethan Hunt is on it again, out on the run to stop the world from a plutonium bomb in the hands of Mr. Lane from the previous M.I. film.I felt the strengths of the film were its excellent practical effects, choreography, direction and overall production value.The serious premise of the film unfortunately was severely infiltrated by Christopher McQuarrie's writing. To me it seemed there was way too much wit in the writing, forcing the actors to say things in very unnatural ways. Worst of all was Henry Cavill's ""performance"", which I found to be deeply unconvincing and not at all charming as the bad guy.
Tom Cruise was Tom Cruise, and I think it worked on some levels and did not on others.
The supporting cast were performing well.Well, you get bang for buck in terms of action and wonderfully looking effects, but a rather cheap script for my taste compromises the overall quality of the film, especially considering this alongside great action films.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
281,compugor,Mission Interminable & Convoluted,6,29 August 2019,"The fantastic action sequences and team charm typical of the franchise are overshadowed by a tortuously jumbled, drawn out story line with too many despicably wicked characters keeping the upper hand throughout, even in the fight scenes, staying a step ahead of Cruise & crew all the way through by the skin-of-their-teeth to the last second. Utterly ridiculous in the extreme, it succeeds only as mindlessly thrilling fantasy entertainment, with apparently no expense spared on effects.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
282,arishsankar,THE BEST PURE ACTION MOVIE OF SUMMER 2018,10,30 July 2018,"The key word for this franchise is not ""impossible"". Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt and his team always find a way. It's ""mission"" because these films are all about the job. Ethan Hunt barely ever pauses to let his love life interfere with his work, nor does he take time to swot up on his wine knowledge or choose a new bespoke suit. But each time he chooses a mission, what follows steadily are adrenalin-triggering exploits, loosely strung together by double-crosses and chicanery. And at the heart of it is the biggest movie star on the planet, still, a man who risks life and limb each time he steps up, to accomplish stunts we've never seen. Tom Cruise probably climbs the Cliffs Of Insanity before breakfast and rappels back down using his own discarded M:I-2 hair. He's sort of breathtaking.The plot sees Hunt face a terrifying nuclear threat from the acolytes of imprisoned anarchist baddie Solomon Lane (Sean Harris, still on supremely creepy form). Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa Faust crosses his path again, on a conflicting mission of her own, while CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill, with moustache) is foisted on Hunt as a minder. He's a hammer to Hunt's scalpel, as CIA chief Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) puts it, and despite the effectiveness of their partnership the two immediately clash.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
283,elenaphysics,This movie is great,10,13 November 2018,"I really enjoyed this movie. When I was a kid, in my country the would show mission impossible tv series, every week and I loved that series. Then Tom Cruise introduced us to the new Mission Impossible. I was 10 years old then.It has been more than twenty years. And over these 20-25 years he has released 6 movies I think. It is not the movie itself. It is Ethan Hawke. The man.The legend.
People have connected with this personality over the years.

285,justinwfirestone,Best fun and excitement since the first De Palma movie,8,6 August 2018,"As a fan of the original TV show, the show way back starring Peter Graves as Jim Phelps, watching a team of elite super-spies protect the world every week from a diabolical plot was imaginative and fun. The revival of Mission: Impossible for TV in 1988 was also generally fun and imaginative, but some of these Tom Cruise movies, man, they blow those old shows away, often figuratively, sometimes literally with nods to special effects or technology of the past.The IMF needs people to wear many hats, although Ving Rhames only has one hat to wear. The team needs a technology expert who also knows demolition skills. The team needs a master of disguise who no longer needs actings skills because a scanner, laptop, 3D printer, and a voice modulator do all the hard work now. You need a lead spy to coordinate the plans, even if there are none, providing moral support and a tacit rallying cry when the mission seems doomed to fail, is failing, or seems downright impossible.Then again, the IMF would be terrible spies in reality, just as James Bond would be a terrible spy in reality, because anyone who's anyone in the global threat theater knows each other and if they somehow do not, they all meet at some fancy party dance gala pushing intrigue to teeter on the precipice of its own ennui.Some have told me Henry Cavill is a good-looking man. I say he is a bad actor, who not only does not need to cock his fists before each fist-fight, but could easily be removed from this sixth installment altogether, without sacrificing too much excitement or too much twisting of plots.Also, nice to see Wes Bentley getting work again, this time without an infatuation for plastic bags blowing in the wind.

287,yashrajs536,A film which fulfills your expectations !,9,27 July 2018,"I was deliriously waiting for this one. As I am an ardent fan of this franchise especially after Ghost Protocol. I wanted this movie to be on par of that. As usual the film has its basic MI elements. Thrill, Top Class Action, Stylishness, Transmogrification of the team mates through masks, Real Cruise stunts. But the fact that this film is much better than its prequels is that not only this movie levels up its basic elements as mentioned above but also it adds another thing which makes this movie interesting and that is the acting performances of actors. Each and every actor in this movie has given justice to there roles. Henry Cavill is the right choice for these types of franchises. This film has saved the name of franchise and also the career of Tom. Unlike Fast and Furious ; MI relies solely on the shoulder of Cruise. It has to struggle to get a good collection at the box office. F & F has many elements that makes it a block buster but this is not the case for MI. Now a days, we have superhero genre to entertain us or the fantasy films. But these types of real action movies are fading in Hollywood. Thanks to MI that we are getting these movies. I will recommend everyone to watch this movie. It is my second most favourite MI film after Ghost Protocol. Do watch it.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

No actor can do what he did. From the Halo Jump, going against on coming traffic, and doing helicopter stunts is pretty cool. Henry Cavill is another badass. Between them two I applaud them. The sixth mission impossible movie may have some pacing issues. They are slow parts. But Tom has too many girlfriends. You are married.Nuclear bombs, yes we know that already. Countdowns. We know that too. I am wondering when will Hollywood stop using nuclear bombs, missiles, or etc. It's a boring concept! Too many shows and movies uses too much of it.Overall I love the mission impossible movies. Tom Cruise never ceases to amaze me! How would you rate this movie?",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
289,Dr_Mark_ODoherty,Great action - and very educational spy film!,10,16 February 2020,"As an NGO activist, who sometimes (regrettably) has to work together with the intelligence community, such high calibre spy films are very educational to me - to get some insight what the intelligence community is currently up to these days! I especially liked the MI6 agent who turned anarchist; (or perhaps it was even Ethan Hunt himself, who had turned anarchist?) A pity though, they captured the rogue agent and returned him to MI6 - as anarchists should be free, I think, like dolphins, for example... The movie script was also pretty wild, I think, pretty much in line with the whole anarchist theme of the film. However, it must be emphasised, that Ethan Hunt was very gentlemanly towards that fetching French Policewoman, who took quite a serious hit from one of those badboy anarchists! I actually agree with Ethan Hunt on that point; some people can be so unappreciative and rude to France - so it's a good thing that France was protected and avenged. (In my experience though, French women are quite tough and resourceful; even coming to the aid of male colleagues - when they have been hit - which actually happened to me once, back in the day when I was an activist in Israel/Palestine, and a very fine female French activist came to my aid :) Anyway, I also liked the wicked feminist villain - The White Widow! - and her hypnotic effect on Ethan Hunt; with her mesmerising victorian accent. Reminded me a bit of British royalty and witchcraft - oh no, wait, I think that was the other cool spy, Ilsa Faust, who reminded me of her... So some pretty feisty female agents in this educational spy film! Therefore I certainly can recommend this one :)",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
290,paulijcalderon,Breathtaking execution! An action film that already feels timeless,9,4 August 2018,"Now that's what I'm talking about! How can a sixth film in a franchise be this phenomenally breathtaking? Well, by not being lazy and committing to the story and especially the filmmaking. If you're making a sequel, you better ensure it deserves to exist. Christopher McQuarrie, Tom Cruise and company outdid themselves now. Honestly! I felt like I was thrown out of a moving vehicle while watching this. I was that floored by some sequences in this. Films can motivate and inspire you, and I haven't felt this hyped because of a new release since... I don't know.. Maybe ""Blade Runner 2049"" last year. But that was of course a different type of experience. Too much digital green-screen locations annoy me these days, so one of the biggest compliments I can give ""Fallout"" is that here all the places are beautifully used.. And they are real! Paris, New Zealand and Norway. It's just jaw-dropping to behold. Especially when you get action with real stunt-work and ingenuity at play.But, look. The movie is not a masterpiece in every aspect. It's riddled with classic movie-isms and aspects of the plot have been seen before. But the execution of all the elements from the previous entries have been perfected to give you a thrillful helicopter chase with engaging character moments. Because remember, this series has been going since '96 (the same year I was born!) - That's crazy. Ethan Hunt has never slowed down, and I like that his character gets a progression. He doesn't just stay the same. No, he's evolved and become nuanced to the point where you can see the endearing side of him; And it's genuine. The happy-go-lucky suave guy we saw in the second film is gone. Remember that? Jeez - that was forced. But even though the character has roughened because of his life threatening struggles, you still see that he cares for his friends around him. Maybe more than ever before. Ving Rhames' Luther Stickell has been a part of this since the beginning too, and I never expected to feel that bad for him considering what he has to go through. Rhames probably gave his best performance here and I'm getting the feeling that Simon Pegg did that too. He's not simply the funny man anymore either. And of course, Rebecca Ferguson helps the team in great ways by giving an intense and impressive performance. The cast members have transformed into an organic part of the whole thing. I can't see any other people playing these characters. What else can I say, I'm just rambling on here. Well, the cinematography is one of the best this year. It's shot on film, and I love how it looks. The framing, the way the lighting is set-up and how the locations are presented are beyond this world. Oh, I can't forget to mention Tom Cruise. The guy's extremely dedicated and I applaud him for the great efforts in making this worthwhile. This would never be the same if he didn't say that each movie has to deliver something exciting and creative. Christopher McQuarrie hasn't directed many movies, but he has to continue. He makes ""Fallout"" feel like a very traditional movie. The lack of CGI messiness is gonna make it more timeless down the line. This is gonna hold up for years to come. Aspects are classic and done, but I don't mind it. As long as it's good and that you can care for what's going on - then I think you got something that works. It was also nice to see Henry Cavill have fun and play a different character compared to what he usually gets to do. It's gonna help him to not only be seen as Superman for sure.I've been praising this enough. But I was just so happy to see a summer blockbustery action movie take both story and filmmaking execution seriously. I was looking forward to see it because it seemed like an entertaining time, but it was so much better than I ever thought it'd be. So, yeah. Very traditional, but phenomenal execution of action and it plays out like a film that doesn't treat you as a fool. The last thing I wanna say is that I was shocked to see Preikestolen in Norway be used as a major location. It's up in the mountains and it's beautiful. But I was just there at the same place week ago! And I had absolutely no idea that they filmed there. I was actually thinking that it would make a perfect area for a movie of this caliber, and then I see this and get even more stunned. No wonder there were so many tourists there... But, hey - It was bizarre to say the least. Ethan may have hanged on the edge of the cliff, but me on the other hand... I didn't go that close. Anyway, what in God's name am I babbling on about? If you like classic great spectacle cinema, then ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is a must-see.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
291,themovieparadise,Best Action Movie Since Mad Max: Fury Road,9,1 August 2018,"Christopher McQuarrie's mission, should he chose to accept it, is to make the sixth installment in a 22 year old movie franchise feel exciting and fresh, and he pulls it off in spades. I've been looking forward to Mission: Impossible - Fallout, though it never topped my list as one of my most anticipated films of the year. I was mainly looking forward to it because I've enjoyed the past two installments, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, the latter of which Christopher McQuarrie also directed. He is the first director to helm more than one film in the franchise, and after seeing the great job he did with Rogue Nation, I was very curious to see what he would do with Fallout. I never imagined I would like Fallout as much as I did. Somehow, McQuarrie found a way to make the sixth installment be the franchise's best. The stunts Tom Cruise and team pull off are mind boggling. The action sequences are some of the most intense ones I have ever seen, and this is the best action film I have seen in theaters since Mad Max: Fury Road.

This is just so obvious, and yet, because it simplifies the task of lighting the scene, this is what they do.So, this would have been an average disposable popcorn-muncher, but instead it's become, for me, a case of being barely able to sit through the rest of it. And the budget! $125 million, to make a non-event like this? With that kind of money, I'm sure they could have found lighting solutions that didn't insult our intelligence in this way. They think, nobody will notice, or realise that nobody would actually do this. I noticed the absurdity of this trick the first time I saw it, I wouldn't remember which film it was, because I don't remember anything else about it. Same with all the others I've seen since.

It very rare that a film can up its game from the last film, which surprised me with this 6th instalment.
It not only written well, it some of the best action sequence ive seen in a long time, not stuntmen was used this is all Tom cruise doing the stunts, which make every scene just that much better.Henry Carvil is a badass in this film which after watching this, I can see him playing the next bond as he has the talent and skill to play some a character like that. Great performances from returning characters played Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and the gorgeous Rebecca Ferguson, which all them have some comedic parts at times as well.The chorograph wide shot filming and location scene bring a beautiful visual film with some of the best action and stunts which are spectacular, couple with the soundtrack as well this is one of the best Mission possible films to date.The storyline might be confusing to some which isnt a flaw, it just a well written intelligent storyline as well as casting, this is what makes a great action film, with outstanding intense moments, outstanding acting for all the cast, outstanding stunts and the film from the production team.

I sense the passion, but for me, his performance was flat. Secondly, some of the action sequences were too drawn out to really care how they ended. One in particular turned into a National Lampoon's Vacation parody where whatever could go wrong did, over and over and over. For me, two nice twists...and a movie that was about 30 minutes too long.

298,Doublej20005,One of the Best Action Films of the Decade,9,2 February 2021,"Scrap what I said about Rogue Nation and Ghost Protocol and MI3, THIS is the best film in the franchise, and by a pretty large portion too. The stunts are once again taken to a whole new level. The insane helicopter fight at the end, the skydrop sequence towards the beginning and everything else in between is just magnificent to watch, and the film stays exciting from start to finish. Tom Cruise is just an absolute madman, and the way he throws himself into all his stunts is just incredible. The story here is also really good with a great twist villain in Henry Cavill, even if it was spoiled in the trailer (there's a reason why I don't watch trailers anymore). The side characters are pretty much all enjoyable, and I liked seeing the return of characters from other films like Ilsa, Solomon Lane and his ex-wife Julia. The direction and cinematography is the best in the franchise by a decent portion, and that third act is just so unbelievably exciting to watch, and had me literally on the edge of my seat. I have two minor issues - some of the comedy falls a tad flat and not enough Angela Bassett. Otherwise, this is not only the best Mission Impossible film, and not only the best Tom Cruise film, but it is also one of the beat action films of the decade if not of all time, and I'd definitely, definitely recommend it.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
299,Hawkensian,"Impressive, but not involving.",7,11 August 2018,"Mission: Impossible - Fallout impressed me, but it did not involve me. The stunts and set pieces are indeed a sight to behold, but the story and characters are so utterly generic that it becomes a rather detached exercise of 'I wonder how they did that?'. It's as if they began by storyboarding the set-pieces and then assembled the hackneyed premise as a perfunctory afterthought.Again, the set pieces are amongst the best in the business, but sometimes even these fail to impress, especially some of the combat. The problem is that in the world of Mission: Impossible, everyone has superhuman powers of strength, agility and recovery; we see a litany of characters, both men and women, beat the hell out of each other with an absurdly gymnastic style of violence that's so bereft of consequence that it wears thin by the film's second burst of tiresomely frenetic melee. As the The Raid series demonstrates, fighting, even amongst the highly-trained, is a nasty, brutish affair - not a balletic, bloodless spectacle of flying kicks and spinning torsos.This isn't the film's undoing, however, and neither is the trite plot, the real drag is the character work. Fans of the franchise will no doubt welcome the familiar faces and enjoy their chemistry, but to the uninitiated (i.e. me), the IMF crew were so-so, and several antagonistic characters, namely Erika Sloane and the White Widow, were smug in a decidedly unlikeable manner.Still, despite the negative tone of this review, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is not a bad film, just an overrated one.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

301,Endless_01,An action packed movie ride.,8,6 June 2019,"The Impossible Mission saga once again surprises us with a fascinating and entertaining new installment, Fallout, following the fantastic tradition of offering us incredible scenes with fantastic choreography and tense moments, Fallout probably becomes one of the best in the entire saga.The story continues each time by some sort of unfortunate event or new mission, an impossible mission, with the difference that this time, we find ourselves at a crossroads full of mysteries and mistrust, Ethan Hunt finds himself in probably one of the hardest moments in his entire journey. The film through its star direction makes us feel the real pressure of the characters, rewarding us with incredibly intense and long action scenes that do not leave us with dry mouth, on the contrary, leave us asking for more.Cinematography is something quite remarkable too. Fallout has an enormous amount of beautiful and fantastic scenes, taken with excellent precision and detail to give us a glimpse of a beautiful world immersed in frenetic action.An excellent action movie without a doubt, it is good to know that each of the deliveries has managed to give us fantastic moments full of intensity and fun, the unrealistic aspects and even exaggerated, are probably one of the strong points of the saga, because they show us full action, full of incredible and fantastic moments without restrictions or limits. I must especially highlight two scenes in the film that are one of the best action scenes I have ever seen. Totally recommended for action lovers.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
302,anupapu8,2nd Best of the series after GHOST PROTOCOL. And came very close.,9,18 August 2018,"MISSION IMPOSSIBLE : FALLOUT - So for me , it's the 2nd best of the series. And came very very close to the best GHOST PROTOCOL. But both movies are far different. With Ghost Protocol it was total consistency. The movie was great thorughout all the running time. But in case of FALLOUT it's pretty average jn the first half , then start to get better and the last action set piece is one of the best , gorgeous and Realistic set piece ever made in the history of film making , which more then compensate for the average writing came before it.Let me be clear - It's an awesome movie.But writing was very very very repeatative. U r gonna see a lot of things happening in the film which happened in Rogue Nation. Infact a person says to Ethan Hunt in this film that 'if YOU WILL GO ROGUE HE WILL KILL YOU' This same dialogue was said to him in Rogue Nation too. in rogue Nation the Head of the CIA at the end of the film says that now he understand that there will always be a need of IMF. In this film too the Head of the CIA (Now changed) say the same thing at the end. In Rogue Nation the character of Rebecca Furguson chases Ethan Hunt throughout the film with opposite agenda , she does the same things in this movie too. But that doesn't mean that the writing is as average as Rogue Nation. No . It's better. And some new things happen too. It's just that this movie with so many action set pieces could have been the Best MI film if the writing has been better , but it didn't happened. Some predictability hurt the film too . I already new the MOLE far before it was revealed. Also why Furguson was working against Ethan Hunt was pretty clear from the start too. But the again some small surprises were there which I was not able to see coming.Hence time to talk about the actions. First and foremost the End Action set piece with Two Helicopters. O My My. Such a great action scene. Totally done in real. Breathtaking. Shown to be happening in KASHMIR but was half shot in New Zealand and Half in Norway. After that two of the best we're BATHROOM FIST FIGHT (where Henry Cavell shines best) and 2nd was the LONDON ROOFTOP RUNNING SCENE(where Tom Again proves that no one can run more gorgeously in Hollywood then him).Now when it comes to acting , I would like to start with Henry Cavell. Because I find him exceptionally average. He is good when he doesn't open his mouth. He looks stylish , fights great. But when he says , he clearly proves that he is no great actor , and I don't think he will be ever.Do I have to say anything about Tom Cruise , no I don't think so. Apart from Cruise who shines best for me was Vanessa Kirby(of THE CROWN FAME) playing White Widow. Who although had a small role but acted beautifully. And I think her character will continue to pope in future installments. The music and Cinematography were very innovative. Infact I think there will be a high chance of nomination in Cinematography catogory along with Sound Effect and Sound Mixing.I know I was late to watch the film. But at least I got the chance. And this was surely worth every penny. 8.5/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

304,andymhancock,The criticisms are right --but who cares? You don't watch for deep meaning!,9,9 June 2019,"All that was said about the shortcomings are true. But you don't watch this movie for those. It's like Rocky Horror Show -- very predictable, but fun because of that. The plot is the joke, and you're suppose to have fun with that. You see how complicated the plot gets in the middle of the movie, e.g., who is really bad, and who is manipulating whom? I simply thought that it was *supposed* to get Monty-Python-esque. All these scenes where bad guys are duped by a the good guys acting, and then the big reveal almost right away? That's like Wayne's World, meant to be laughed at. And the action scenes and stunts --- I'm letting out a whistle between my teeth. I thought ""Wow, that's incredible stunt doubling, and camera angling"". Well, you know what? Cruise does his own stunts. Read up on it, and you gain a new appreciation for what I would have thought was impossible (see what I did there?). I mean, how is the man still alive? Notwithstanding his odd interview behaviour and choice of beliefs, he is in a species of his own.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
305,ewaf58,Middling effort in the franchise,10,21 January 2019,Although handsomely filmed we know there's only going to be one outcome - the bombs will not go off and Ethan will not suffer any really serious injuries despite somehow bypassing the laws of physics ( something Tom couldn't do in real life while filming).The writers need to find a way of making the climax exciting - perhaps with ambiguity - so we're not quite sure what outcome will be the best.I was also disappointed with the lines given to Lane. His character seemed less complex than in the previous film and he came across as just a standard bad guy without the original menace.The action scenes were by the numbers and the use of facial masks a bit too predictable.However it was an enjoyable film but they need a better script and a less predictable Director next time out,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
306,Mike_Noga,Somewhere around the 17th hour I nodded off,6,28 July 2018,"There were some pretty good action scenes in this installment, the one in the bathroom where Crusie and Cavill met there pugilistic match was amazing, some touches of comedy with Benji and Luthor and Vanessa Kirby was dazzling as the White Widow. The parts were good and lived up to the high standard set up by this franchise. But in between there were long deserts of boring dialogue, exposition and muffed attempts at misdirection. At some point the idea of a plot twist loses all meaning if you have too many of them. And unfortunately as much credit as I give Tom Cruise for being in good shape enough to handle those action scenes, he just looked soo tired in some of them. You expected him to throw up his hands after a long grueling fight and say "" You know what? Just take the plutonium I need a nap."" I would have liked it a lot more if they had kept it to about 2 hours. Lean and mean from scene to scene. It's tough to switch gears from adrenaline filled thrill ride to heart felt touching drama to BBC style dry exposition without losing something along the wayThis movie is probably best enjoyed at home where you can speed on past all the filler and enjoy the good stuff.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
307,TheGreatMarkukini,The day when Tom Cruise has no ideas to impress a viewer might never come,7,1 July 2019,"Without a doubt Mission Impossible got the platinum status of a long-running action franchise that walks on the razor's edge in every instance of the series. More than that is the fact of introducing even more risky stunts into the frame each time Ethan Hunt decides to surprise the audience with a new chapter of his adventures.The sixth film does not disappoint with the part of practical effects: the legends about preparing the shots are still spreading around but the truth is that the crew simply takes their butts on the line to provide a viewer with a quality of tricks almost as you are doing them yourself. The fights are like those compositions of Bach except in this case your eyes are enjoying the show instead of ears.For sure there were many plot holes that made me cover my eyes and force to forget them in the sake of great action. The behavior of characters and the repeated nagging motive of distrust keeps bothering but apparently nothing is perfect.Tom Cruise shows an incredible dedication to the role and despite the trauma proves that age is nothing when Ethan Hunt is in your blood. Henry Cavill after the ""incident with a moustache"" had to demonstrate that the sacrifice was not in vain. Frankly, it wasn't. Of course I don't see why the look was required but he really nailed role of the ""hammer"".I'm sure that many people will agree that there is no Ethan Hunt without Tom Cruise and considering the success of the last movie I hope that the seventh film will be getting to us soon. Let's just hope that Tom Cruise stays safe as he does his breathtaking stunts.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Cruise: Yes...
In Every Movie of this franchise, they keep on raising the bar as far as Action films go. What makes these films stand out amongst a plethora of CGI, Green Screen infested genre of films is the Vision to deliver something unique with meticulously built setups, long wide shots of nervewracking moments & Tom Cruise's frightening intent of keeping it as real as possible. The Hand to Hand Combat, Chase scenes on Foot, On Bike, on Helicopters; all of those were Top notch. The story is very similar to previous films so nothing new there.

Some movies are fun but are no-brainer, it was not a no-brainer. I liked the action, cinematography and especially the sound mixing. The movie looked and sounded great because of IMAX. My only problem was that the aspect ratio could have been the same for the entire movie not just for IMAX scenes but I'll let it go. Nolan already familiarised us with this through the Dark Knight Trilogy.Henry Cavill was a good addition and from the get go the ""big surprise or plot twist"" was expected because no movie of this franchise would cast a big actor along with Tom Cruise just to ""team up"". So yeah, the reveal of ""John Lark"" as Walker was expected.The action sequences were very clean and satisfying. The biggest thing I like about MI series is that the fight sequences and chase sequences are satisfying and good to watch.I think MI: Fallout was the Skyfall of MI franchise. Skyfall is my favourite of the bond series of Daniel Craig and Fallout is for MI series. Love Simon Pegg, Rebecca is beautiful and resourceful. Michelle Monaghan was welcomed well too. In all, a nice movie, not a perfect one mind you, but still it deserves a 10 because-
1. The score and sound mixing
2. The IMAX scenes.
3. The HALO jump by Cruise
4. The redeeming action

310,Brevin_Campbell,A first timer's review,8,29 July 2018,"So like..this was pretty much my first time seeing a Mission Impossible movie. Which is kinda crazy cause I have always been a huge fan of the spy drama since I was a little kid.So much that it is very strange when I find a spy franchise like this that has been around for so long, but hey....its fun not going to lie there. The biggest positive I can see on this movie was the action is freaking amazing. Every scene feels truly brutal and powerful. I love movies with this very brutal action scenes that feel very much like John Wick or Winter Solder. Every punch given feels harder and it makes the stakes feel higher than they are. And Tom Cruise only adds to that with his action also not being perfect. He isn't the perfect fighter in the film. There are scenes where he falls and gets hurt and you feel that. Moments of just real intensity that just blow you away.Henry Cavil also plays a great yang to Tom Cruise as his really ramps up every scene he is in and heck even steals the show at certain points and I absolutely love that.He pulls off every scene he is in with great flare and a mustache to boot to go along with it. Was the mustache needed? I don;t really think so, but it was a great add on anyway. The movie's greatest weakness is its execution of its twist. The twist really feel forced and unneeded at times for me. More to give a big gasp over anything else. Im not going to give away the twist here, but there is a scene or rather a collection of scenes back to back when we get one twist after the other and it feels really dragging. Overall though Mission Impossible is a fun time at the theater and one I'd highly recommend.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

also with every film you get new faces to the tam as we'll as some old onesgoing into this movie blind I didn't know what to expect the beginning started off a little slow but once everything took off it kept moving at a very faced non stop rate with car chases plane crashes motor cycles gun fights I mean this had everything and gave us a new character Henry Cavil who grows on you throughout the film 
one person thou who look's like she had a lot of plastic surgery and who i truly hate was Angela basset thank god she really isn't in the film much at all or I don't know if I would have watched it....Some scenes i had to close my eyes because they were to intense and they gave us a lot of character build a nice love story emotions and all out surprises and thrills plus chills
if you like any of the Mission Impossible movies then you are really going to love this new chapter

I take my hat off for the makers.,9,1 November 2018,"Let's just say that it's the most dangerous and hard mission from all the six movies. The movie is called mission impossible and bringing that picture in that way was really ""impossible"" too. but that doesn't mean that there is no
""fall out"" in it.
First, I respect so much the movie and how the makers made every stunt despite how dangerous it is very real. The reality in almost everything in the movie is it's true reason for success and entertainment and that's what cinema is for, To sacrifice to make a life in the form of a movie. The stunts in the movie and the cinematography are tremendous, extraordinary and unbelievable. Tom Cruise is of course the true hero in it with his extremely dangerous stunts that exceeds the professional level along with the great director Christopher McQuarrie with a powerful direction that brought the whole picture together. The music written for the film is pretty awesome like the ones you hear in Nolan's films by Zimmer that gives you the most authentic feeling of the movie as a combination of the movie's original score with the tense tones added to it just superb. The screenplay and the story were awesome too but the ""fall out"" was that the story is just full of playing games every couple of scenes you discover a new game that was a showoff of how they are doing the movie with much work and intelligence. The presence of Luther Stickell in the field seemed that they just must put him in the movie which would cost all the mission and is not helpful in anything than his experience with technology. Also Mark Cavill role was quite predictable but he was the star of the film in the performance. The performance of the others was almost good but I felt that the movie is centered and cared more about the reality of the stunts that you sometimes think of the other roles that they can be performed by anyone and wouldn't feel a difference especially Rebecca's whose character which I felt wasn't necessary to bring her again to the film and wasn't even big enough but for a couple of ""action scenes"" which could have been done by any other character or even not. The movie is very intense , entertaining and I was on the edge of my seat watching it. But always knowing how the movie will end and the luck in some of the stunts and scenes along with the absence of injury and the very last ending scene of the chase scene of this film which I felt wasn't quite real was just written and done without adding the whole touch of reality as in the whole movie was a little bit annoying for me. But overall, The movie is a masterpiece and reviews are for critic purposes always. Just enjoy the film and entertain yourself and absolutely don't miss it. 9/10

321,richarddillomes,I got pregnant from the arm gun reload improvised by Henry Cavill,9,7 October 2019,"So I didn't even know that Mission Impossible 6 was already showing until I saw a review from of all places Vanity Fair and upon checking out the comments section, the few I read were all raving about how this is the best action movie of the year. Right then and there I decided to catch it and thanks to my friend who was late, my 2D ticket was upgraded to IMax and I tell you it was worth the running we had to do in order to make it to the last screening. We've just barely gotten our bearings back after getting to our seat and the first action sequence which takes place in a restroom is Golden (or Lit, depending on which part of the generation spectrum you fall under.) I bet that arm gun reload improvised by Henry Cavill has impregnated people who've seen it (notice the usage of 'people' instead of 'women'.)Speaking of Henry, seeing him on IMax is what the world needs right now to make all of our problems go away. He is huge (Alec Baldwin had to ask him to adjust his shoulders so the camera can see his face lol), and it's hard not to notice him. I can see him taking over the franchise but the movie has something else planned for him. Another sight to behold is Vanessa Kirby as the White Widow. Enchanting is the best word to describe her and hopefully she'll show up again if they're going to work on another MI movie. Missing from the party is Jeremy Renner who was tied up with the Avengers 4 movie and I kinda can't stop feeling bad for the guy. The Bourne franchise went back to Matt Damon, then he misses out on Infinity War, then he's not here as well when all the while I was under the impression he was being groomed to take over Tom Cruise. But I guess with the latter experiencing somewhat of a resurgence in his career (just don't mention The Mummy reboot), he'll try to stick around for as long as he can. And why wouldn't he? It's been a very successful franchise save for the hiccup that was MI2, and he's still very much capable of doing his own stunts at 56 yrs old. In this day and age when it's easy to green screen the hard stuff, we have to give credit where it's due. That jump barely making it to the next building injured his ankle and delayed production for 7 weeks. He also had to train for a year in order to do the skydiving stunt. Even Henry mentioned the disparity between his stunts as Superman compared to here where he really had to get his hands dirty.All things considered, the plot is just okay and some scenes are even predictable for someone who's into the spy stuff but the action scenes are jam-packed and will have you on the edge of your seat. No word yet if there'll be a 7th installment although from how things are going they'd be foolish not to make another one. After Infinity War, this is the second best action movie to come out this year and if I haven't mentioned it enough, you have to see the action sequences and Henry Cavill in IMax. I can say it was worth the dough even if I wasn't the one that coughed up the money.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Cheers to the entire team!!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
325,eonbluedan-1,Competing for most fun of 2018!,8,24 August 2018,"I'll say it up front: This probably tops any previous outing in the globetrotting franchise for its ridiculousness! It's totally stupid! If you ever disliked how previous instalments, or indeed any previous Tom Cruise action film, asked you to suspend your disbelief quite as much as they did, then this one will have you utterly incredulous! But, if it's not completely bonkers, are you really watching a 'Mission: Impossible'? With the return of Christopher McQuarrie to the helm, we have, arguably, the most enjoyable instalment, and for me, perhaps the most exciting action film since 'The Raid 2'. Indeed, it seems that this team of Cruise and McQuarrie are the perfect pairing for the franchise. At this stage, with a sixth film released, it is truly a pleasant surprise to be able to say it doesn't feel tired, and that, despite being a tad heavy on the plot exposition, it remains a joy due to wall-to-wall, jaw-dropping stunt work, chase sequences that echo classics from 'The French Connection' and Nolan's 'Batman' series, more than a smattering of on-point charm, and stunning location shooting. Even in spite of the inner voice that says they really should stop now, you can't help but smile ear-to-ear for the entirity of its mammoth runtime. Doing a lot of the heavy lifting is the team themselves: Rebeccara Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Tom and Ving Rhames, as well as the boss, Alec Baldwin, remain as likeable as ever (an area in which the franchise has steadily improved), with that now familiar sense of camaraderie that proves so important to the success of these movies. Despite all the explosions, chases, and fights that threaten to test the patience, the fact is that you believe in and care about these people, and so find yourself well on board. Of course, fresh meat is always nice, and this film's addition of Henry Cavill as a strangely mustachioed good bad guy (bad good guy?) makes for a couple of fun gags. Personally, I remain unsold on the man as an actor, but he carries a lot of physical heft needed for some of this stuff to work.And the action? Well, relentless might be a word for it, and in less talented hands it would definitely be too much, but McQuarrie understands the importance of the audience's empathy and smarts (Remember, this is is the writer responsible for 'The Usual Suspects'), so there is never a sense that he is being distracted; every action sequence pushes us forward and usually gives us something more to chew on, as well as being sheer entertainment. This goes a long way. Whether it be the best car chase I've witness on the big screen for years, not one but two of the best aerial set-pieces since 'The Dark Knight Rises', or the most surprisingly crushing fight sequence since the aforementioned 'The Raid 2', you never lose sight of why it's happening or what's at stake. A new paragraph...just for the running! Yes, there is a lot of it, and that's the point. Trust me, in time, the extended sequence of Tom Cruise running around London's rooftops and bridges will be a staple-point in cinema. It may not carry the same ground-breaking weight as Gene Hackman driving after a train at full speed, but it is very similar to that scene in spirit, and carries in its DNA the same sense of gritted determination (As with Hackman's Doyle, you really are rooting for Ethan all the way!). It uses smart editing from other points of view to provide a sense of how he is faring moment to moment, drawing us in to the chase, and it shows off a post-millennium London in beautiful, proud glory, so as to make for a classic moment in film history - Guaranteed! So, a bit too much explaining of things? Yes. A bit too long? Probably. A heap of reasonably intelligent fun at the movies? Very much so! Probably the most fun you'll have with an action movie in 2018, in fact. And is it the end? It's tough to say, but if McQuarrie sticks around, and Tom doesn't DIE during shooting (Remember, nearly everything you see him doing, he is actually doing!), I wouldn't be against a finale to what would effectively be a trilogy from this team.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

327,sanjin_9632,I'll admit.. it's a good one.. but far from perfect,7,18 December 2018,"This movie would be perfect .. WITHOUT TOM CRUISE. As much as I can enjoy some of his movies, I just cannot condone his real life persona and the people he's associated with.Furthermore, this movie is far from perfect. Some people here don't understand that an action flick like this cannot be perfect. It can be great or close to exceptional, but NEVER PERFECT.Also, some people here were talking about Tom Cruise doing the stunts all by himself. Pretty sure that's not the case. He might be fit and running a lot, also doing some less dangerous scenes, but he's probably doing none of them.
The level on hypocrisy with this guy is immense. He sends body doubles to press appointments. Did you know that? Some mentioned him flying the helicopter or taking lessons. That might be true, but the scenes are all shot in front of a green screen (idiots).I liked Superman as the bad guy.. although I could spot that one from a mile away. People who couldn't are obviously chumps. After watching the 5 previous instalments, one should realise that it's always the same plot.Nonetheless, this movie was very well made (as were all of them). The one that kinda sticks out for me tho' is John Woo's version, because visually, it just does.

Tom Cruise, even though looks aged and tired at times, does a decent job in portraying our very own Ethan Hunt.Rebecca Ferguson looks dazzling as Ilsa.In fact, her presence has made the last two installments of MI even more fascinating. The rest of the cast is fascinating and trustworthy as ever. Henry Cavill as the unscrupulous Walker steals the show. However, it is the action sequences which actually win your heart.

All the other scenes are dark and blurry. The plot just kept changing and made no sense to me. Dialogue was witless. It was so disengaging I started wondering why I was there. Cruise looks confused in every scene. Wolf Blitzer fills the screen in the opening which made me nauseous and Angela Bassett is Hollywood's new Obama telling everyone what to do.

As always, it's full of very impressive action that is so fun to watch and intense at the same time, but as always it comes a question: is it enough to make it a good film? Short answer: no. Unfortunately there are things that hold it back from that and everyone can have different opinion of what are the negatives.
The problems that i have are: the story as a whole is very weak; the characters (aside from Ethan, Benji and Luther) are weak and not interesting; the script is mixed with one half being very standard dialogue; the editing could have been better and music is bland and forgettable. But it does have also positives like the sound; acting; huge percent of the cinematography with some ok shots; the other half of the dialogue is very good; there is some moments of good editing here and there and three moments in the story that were great, but i wouldn't mention, because it will be a spoiler for some.
As a whole the film is decent at best and it could have been better with some positives and action sequences that makes it enjoyable. If you are a lover of action films, then i recommend Mission: Impossible - Fallout, but if you are looking for a great story, well written characters and good dialogue, than this film is probably not for you, but you can still give it a shot.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
339,Kirollos-Noah,Brilliantly made!,9,2 October 2018,"Mission: Impossible - Fallout is directed once again by Christopher McQuarrie, the director of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, written by Christopher McQuarrie and Bruce Geller and starring Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill and Rebecca Ferguson with tons of other great cast!The best intentions often come back to haunt you.

Henry Cavill, Angela Bassett, and Vanessa Kirby also join the dynamic cast with filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie returning to the helm.I really loved Mission: Impossible - Fallout, I missed these breathtaking action scenes this year, but finally, I found what I've been looking for for very so long, and thanks goes to Mission: Impossible - Fallout.Everything in this movie was completely amazing, except for a small leak.. and it is the script... As I said it's not big, it's just a bothering sentence is repeating every plan..Let's get started with the only thing I didn't like about this movie, and as I said it's the script. Okay, why every thing they are about to do, or planned to do, or anything to do, they just have to say ""I'll figure it out"" or ""I'm working on it""? What? Didn't you plan for anything for this movie or something?
These two sentences bothered the hell out of me, actually! But it's nothing compared to everything that I loved in this movie.First of all, the action sequence, it's one of the best action movie of all the time! Every action scene I was like ""OMG, thank you for giving me a masterpiece in action, thank you!"". I think it's the best action movie in 2018 so far.Quickly quickly.. let's move to the performances... I loved them all! What an act-convincing?! I have no other comment about the acting, cause it was quite perfect!Oh, we're not done yet, we still have the fascinating storytelling! I don't want to spoil anything, but I need to say that don't believe what you're watching, cause they will surprise you like hell!!!!
The story was good in every way that it could be, maybe at the beginning it didn't get my attention, but then it got my whole attention!Believe me, no one is overreacting when he says that this movie is a masterpiece, and if you don't believe us, go and see it yourself. It will not let you down, never ever!I actually wasn't excited to watch this movie, the trailer didn't get me at all, but it did actually give me what I want, it was way better than I expected it's gonna be!Oh, one more sadly thing I just remembered that I didn't like, the OST wasn't that good as it was so usual. But it wasn't so bad!I'm gonna give Mission: Impossible - Fallout an A, I think it's a magnificent movie, and definitely a worth-watching movie, I highly recommend watching this movie, guys.Okay, guys, thank you as always for reading my review, hope you like, and if you have any comment, please, say it to get improved.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

This film wasn't an excuse to milk a franchise for money like so many other franchises that became terrible. I'm also not the biggest fan of Tom Cruise but he gets a round of applause from me for this one. Its been a while since a Mission Impossible movie impressed me so much. The actors all did a perfectly fine job, better than some previous films and the action was just awesome as heck. I don't want to give away too much but this film was definitely worth the price of admission. Better storytelling and action that a great number of action films we see in today's Hollywood machine, a machine that often produces pretty bad movies. So it wasn't perfect, but it was much better than a lot of the tripe we see in our theaters today. This one surprised me, I say you should go see it.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
344,muons,Impeccable action with a poor plot,6,29 August 2018,"Fallout is a mixed bag. While it excels in action and stunts, it fails to deliver a cogent story. I'll start with the positive sides first. The action scenes and stunts are top notch and arguably set the standards for Bond and MI sequels. As most people already put it, the washroom fight scenes feel so real you almost hear cracking bones with each kick and punch. The rooftop stunts pulled by Cruise himself, car and motorcycle chases in Paris streets are shot very realistically. The accompanying cinematography including narrow, cobblestone Paris alleys and a mishmash of a rocky landscape from Kashmir and Norway fjords are breathtaking. The acting is pretty good, too.On the flipside, the plot is so intertwined and flimsy that it eventually loses its coherence. For example, Lark is a member of Apostles who stole Plutonium cores from Ethan in Berlin but then Lark tries to get them from Apostles through a blackmarket arms dealer. Does that ever make sense? Well, according to the screenplay writers it does, because this convoluted mess of a plot is all about framing Ethan as a nuclear terrorist. Why they'd go to such lengths as they could easily put down Ethan in Berlin or any other place when Lark and Ethan were together is a mystery. Apparently, Lark and Lane set themselves on a mission of nuking freshwater resource for over a billion people for greater good (!) of the humanity. As Lark and Apostles have all the opportunity, tools and means to perform this ""holy"" task, Lark's entanglement of himself and all his gang members in a such mess for something as mundane and trivial as framing Ethan as a terrorist weakens the story.What makes things worse is the pace of the movie which runs too fast to follow all the twists. It would be much better and wiser to intersperse some subplots to let the audience digest the unfolding scenario and regain their breath for the following action. Especially with Baldwin's character, there appear some sporadic moments to explain the convoluted scenario but that doesn't come enough. The only breath catching subplot happens with the Kashmir reunion but it is far too late and feeble. Indeed, the sappy meeting with Michelle Monaghan in Kashmir adds nothing to the story but more minutes to the already stretched-out playtime, serving for no apparent purpose than including her in the cast.While other movies are mercilessly criticized for their plotholes and unrealistic story lines, MI series usually get a carte blanche in their starry-eyed stunts like physical impersonations with Benji disguising as Lane, etc. As much as the action scenes in Kashmir are shot very well, we see a series of impossible events happening in 15 min which in reality can hardly be accomplished in a week (like detecting and defusing two nuclear bombs by using a screwdriver and a pair of pliers) I'm not even going to mention how much time it would take to climb up a 50 ft long rope hanging from a chopper twice as it's flying over 150 mph.In short, this is a movie where good action scenes and spectacular stunts are counterbalanced by its unnecessarily convoluted plot and pedestrian screenwriting.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Tom Cruise still manages to capture the Ethan Hunt character although Father Time is not far behind. Tom is actually starting to look a bit older, so I'm not sure how much longer he'll be able to pull this enterprise off. The biggest knock I had on this flick was the running time...it clocked in at nearly 2 hours 30 minutes which was about an hour too long.

348,shivamt25,Taking It Up a Notch,8,13 April 2020,"I started the Mission Impossible series with the sequel. Tom Cruise, with his enchanted silky hairdo, was ascending a hillside in what I can assume was Grand Canyon with this amazing background score to complement the aesthetics of that scene. I was in love with this movie there and then. After that, it was an upward trajectory. MI:3, Ghost protocol, Rogue Nation and now Fallout. It's turning out to be the one and only thing Tom Cruise is doing right (The disastrous Mummy is in my mind) and even Paramount for that matter.I look for class and sophistication when I go see an MI. My expectations have been sky-high since Rogue Nation. Be it Rebecca Ferguson's charismatic character or the well-choreographed hand-to-hand combat during the climax. Christopher McQuarrie demonstrated that he can easily fill the shoes of Brad Bird. So, before even watching the trailer for Fallout, I was skeptical. The question was, what more can they do? Where else can they take the movie? The answer is, nothing seems to be impossible for McQuarrie and his brigade.Fallout is visually stunning, jam-packed with artistic action sequences and is tremendously entertaining. Its best characteristic is the angle of morality they brought in Cruise's character. The movie asks whether its justified that Hunt occasionally risks the lives of millions to save those few he loves. As we go, the question is answered in the most MI way - Hunt can make anything possible. The movie is so judiciously written, some of the scenes are illustrative representations of the phrase poetic justice. The supporting characters hold much importance as compared to preceding instalments in the franchise. Also, we get the cameo which we all expected, Michelle Monaghan's Julia - the one constant in Hunt's life. The music is on point. I like the way they keep the thematic tune almost same in all the movies with a little tweak here and there to make it refreshing but also nostalgic.But for me, the real hero here is McQuarrie. Even the most trivial scenes are shot with perfection. They've gone lengths to make sure that the audience knows that Cruise did these stunts, some of which are so innovative that you'll want to jump from your seats out of sheer exhilaration.
Almost everything works for this movie. The series is making its mark as one of the most reliable franchise, at par with Marvel and Disney movies. So, for those who want to watch something decent and something other than a superhero flick, this movie is for you.A note to MI fans, it feels like a chapter of Hunt's life is closing and another is opening. Thus, in this film you'll find a number of instances when former MIs are referenced. It is highly likely that you guys will love this movie even more so. So, go check it out in your nearest theatre as soon as you can.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
349,DVR_Brale,Top Tom,7,17 August 2018,"Everybody knows Tom is a special type of a special agent (special special agent) who can in his mid 50's win at least a dozen athletic competitions at Olympic games, most notably running mid and long distances. Without breaking a sweat, wearing his trousers. When it comes to road races, he knows how to handle pretty much every land vehicle in a most diverse situations; Schumacher and Rossi are lucky he never competed against them. Besides, we all know Tom could fly military fighting jets from an early age earning his place at top school. Who could've thought he'd be equally good at flying choppers! (There are several brief and subtle Top Gun references in this MI which are going to be appreciated by TG fans.)All of that and I haven't even come to his fighting, climbing and shooting skills! Tom can shot pretty every weapon included in all of Call of Duty series on a marksman level, harshly eliminating all threats. I won't spend much words on his climbing skills but will just say this: he can climb a flat wall while having a fever and several bones broken. Toe to toe fights finish before they even start - bloody details are unnecessary. When it comes to morals, Tom never thinks in utilitaristic terms; he probably doesn't even know what that means! Thank you Tom for showing me how fallen creature I am by making the most noble and cherished decisions never recorded before in even the most sacred of scriptures. On the other hand, his superb intelligence allows him to always be on the right place at the right time! I can't even in my wildest dreams imagine Tom being late or exacerbating already precarious situation. That being said, it is evident Tom is not an ordinary agent. He's on a completely another level! He is ""super-agent"" with most of the emphasis on ""super"". Super-duper agent. Next Mission Impossible should be titled: MI - Top Tom.Let me conclude with a real life example. Once my friend told me how he was concerned about the world ending. I told him: Do you realize Tom Cruise is still alive and is probably going to live longer than both of us even though we are half his age?

I was very relieved that it was in the 2D format, as one doesn't need the dependence of 3D if they have stunning visuals. The plot pretty much continues from where it ended in the previous Mission: Impossible. There is action in the movie from the word go and it lives up to all the hype around the promotions about the real stunts performed. Director Christopher McQuarrie really seem to have find a knack of working with Tom Cruise. This film has one of the best camerawork that I have seen in recent days and the choice of locations and settings compliment it really well. However the humour element as compared to the last 2 movies is slightly less on this one.The movie is a lot about Ethan Hunt and his character and Tom Cruise, not only cakewalks, but runs, jumps and limps through his role. He can be a role model for many aspiring action stars out there. Henry Cavill looks menacing as Agent Walker although his character doesn't have much emotions to portray. Sean Harris once again has a very impacting negative character in the limited screen time he has. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames do good Robins to Tom Cruise's Batman. All other supporting characters do a decent job.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a very good example of a crisp film making for all the action films. Do not miss this end of summer blockbuster.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
352,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,Movie Review: Mission: Impossible - Fallout,9,6 April 2019,"This is not only the high point of the Mission Impossible franchise but a high point for the action genre in the 2010's overall.McQuarrie takes clear inspiration from more recent films such as John Wick and Sicario mixing there tone with the camp nature of the previous instalments of this series. As always the stunt work is fantastic and the choreography of all action scenes is incredible, adding to that McQuarrie has stepped up his game since his last outing as MI director using more tracking and panning shots so that action sequences are easier to follow and the stakes feel more real as well as utilising drone footage to create a more vertigo enduing sequence than when Ethan Hunt climbed with worlds tallest building in Ghost Protocol. The dedication to this stunt work shown by Cruise, Pegg, Fergison and series newcomer Cavill elevates these scenes even further allowing the stakes to be felt by the audience in a more intimate and terrifying way than in most other action franchises.The screenplay makes twists and turns appear as easy and natural as Cruise does with stunt work. It picks up story threads from previous instalments as well as developing new characters in genuinely interesting and engaging ways.My one flaw is almost uniform for this series however between the awe-inspiring stunt work and character development the actual ""mission"" can sometimes be an after thought making it either hard to follow or far to simplistic to still be engaging.With this film's excellent character moments and twist however this issue barely annoyed me if at all during my screening and the balance of these elements is the best and most fluid they have ever been.If you are a fan of these films or a fan of action cinema at all I am telling you that you need to see this movie!Rocky had its first dud with movie 3, star wars' was movie 4 and so was Indiana Jones. Mission impossible continues to push binderies and get better with every instalment giving us the best of the franchise with movie 6.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Mr Cruise is risking his life again doing impossible stunts and the write of the usual suspects does his job really well. The fighting sequence in the bathroom is the best I have seen since the raid. There is no doubt that in terms of entertainment we have here one of the best franchises ever. I hope Ethan Hunt has the retirement he deserves in MI8. He has given us many hours of entertainment and I hope he gets a happy ending. It is obvious that Mr Cruise is really taking good care of the franchise and I have no doubt he will finish it as it deserves.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

355,c-kelsall,Sir Thomas of Cruise does it again,8,31 July 2018,"This is another highly entertaining slice of Missions Impossible. At No.6 in the franchise, the whole edifice has scarcely felt fresher, coming hot on the heels of it's equally solid and entertaining predecessors Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation. Daniel Craig and Barbara Broccoli must be quaking in their boots at the prospect of losing the spy genre crown. I don't know how much longer Tom Cruise can go on making these high-end action films, but he's in fantastic shape for a man in his mid-50's, and looks at least 10 years younger than he is in real life.
Jeremy Renner's absence was not a problem, but there was no explanation for it in the script so far as I could tell. In terms of team balance, however, all the essential elements were in place. The plot leans heavily on Rogue Nation, so the casual viewer may feel a little lost if they skipped on the fifth instalment before seeing this one, but the whole thing has enough of an identity of its own to be thoroughly enjoyable either way. I imagine a new plot line will be necessary should there be a 7th MI film.
The new face on the block was Henry Cavill's CIA assassin Walker, who brought a different dimension to proceedings with his 'blunt instrument' approach; quite a different beast from his suave and polished Napoleon Solo in The Man From Uncle.
So long as the Christopher McQuarrie/ Tom Cruise team can keep it fresh and interesting, I urge them to come back with more in a few years' time.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

357,hiraishinnojutsu,"Using the same formula of the previous movies, 'Fallout' doesn't fail to thrill us...",8,26 July 2018,"Despite some CGI flaws and a mediocre good vs evil plot, 'Fallout' reminds us that in the world of espionage, in order to win the fight against all kinds of villains, being some steps ahead of your opponent is a crucial matter. And once more, Ethan Hunt is already three to ten steps ahead of not just the wolf in sheep's clothing, but also the viewers. this is the magic of The Mission-Impossible-verse, and 'Fallout' is no exception. Well, personally, I think this overused formula will meet it's turning point where people don't seem to be amused anymore, so in order to keep people to the theaters, in my personal humble opinion, maybe Tom Cruise need to consider making the villain wins (like Marvel did with 'Infinity War'), or just make some story with an unexpected ending. Ethan Hunt is not a DC or Marvel character, but he is surely one of the (if not the) best hero in the history of fictional franchises or cinematic universes (he is definitely better than that pussy-riding James Bond).",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

And the more you watch him, the more you have to admire his involvement in the movie from doing a lot of his own stunts to making what happens look VERY convincingly REAL!! All the other actors in this movie were excellent as well! You really got the impression that the actors were a ""team"" when it came to making this movie. Lots of excitement.. a ton of action.. a nail-biter at times.. plus the occasional interjection of humor. The Mission: Impossible franchise is like a younger, more hip version of the James Bond ""empire"". Plus at 2 hrs and 30 minutes, you really get your money's worth.

359,e-70733,An Excellent Sequel,8,1 September 2018,"Overall, it is not as good as the Ghost Protocol, but better than the Rogue Nation.
As far as the script is concerned, the film is quite old-fashioned and even suspected of being lazy in the creation of the story outline. The specific performance is that some plots can be more elaborate. However, by using the excellent action scene to control the narrative rhythm, the film has once again become a leader in the same type of film in emotional rendering.

Car and truck chases.

There's even a helicopter chase.
And they are very well done; Sets, settings, photography; all are technically brilliant and absolutely gorgeous.
In fact, ALL of ""Mission Impossible-Fallout"" is technically spectacular. Even the acting is textbook precise.
But I found the movie cold and clinical. Such emotional connections as were attempted were all used as plot twists. And on that subject, ""MI-Fallout"" is overly complicated, as if the writers were TRYING to create a tour du force of bewildering, labyrinthine plot twists.
I did note one fascinating evolution in the series: This mission makes it clear that in the operational strategy of the IMF (Impossible Mission Force), reliance on luck is a formal tactic.

I understand he is one of world's biggest stars; but at some point he's got to stop trying to look like a boy. In his last films, several of them, he looks odd. esp. next to stud Cavill. You got Pegg and Rhames who do fine. He needs to sync up with them. But who can argue with millions and millions of dollars in gross revenue? They did great. Incredible! action sequences.

368,Abranth-d,Damn !,9,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of Mission Impossible : Fallout. So fallout ( not to be confused with the game of course ) is the sixth installment in the mi franchise and is probably the best in the series. So Tom cruise is back as Ethan hunt and is still running away from explosions. The thing I like about this franchise is that it gets bigger in size with every movie , the story might be cliched in all of em but the size and grandness never fails to surprise me. The plot in this movie is very linear and doesn't drag anywhere . I also liked how this was the only movie in the franchise where the story retains characters and plot pieces from the previous movie. Simon pegg wasn't as funny as he was in the other movies but I guess his character has evolved. Henry Cavill as walker is just a monster , This guy should've played batman instead of superman. Now the action in this movie is just insanely good. There was absolutely no CGI and most of the fight choreography as well as the stunts were just mind-blowing and will keep you at the edge of your seat. In the end , fallout is the best in the series with edge of the seat action , great characters , Tom cruise jumping off buildings and one classic theme song remixed for every movie.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The pace is on from the get go. My only complaint is Carvill and Bassett's characters. Carvill was a very bad choice IMO. He just doesn't fit the character and his acting was a bit stiff. He looked out of place in every scene.I give major credit to Cruise who continues excel in these movies. In one scene he's running over some buildings and makes a big jump, barely making it. When he gets up he's facing the camera and continues to run, limping. In reality he broke his ankle on that jump and the limp was real. They kept filming. It added a great realism to the scene. This is what you can expect from this movie - great, action packed scenes.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
370,sanjidparvez,An excellent follow-up of the ROGUE NATION that clearly lived up to the expectation.,9,28 July 2018,"In this 6th installment of the series, the business was as usual; The Apostles (a reformed version of The Syndicate), a terrorist group of rogue operators from different intelligence circuits tries to get hold of Plutonium Cores to build three portable nuclear weapons to destroy the ""old-world-order"" by a simultaneous nuclear attack on the Vatican, Jerusalem and Mecca. Ethan Hunt & his IMF team mates join forces with CIA assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill) to prevent this disaster of epic proportions but soon they find themselves in a desperate race against time before it's too late to stop the enemies. As the franchise's signature elements, the highlight of the movie was edge-of-your seat chase sequences & intense fight scenes but what actually still worked for this 22 year old long running series was the way they improvised those tricks & filmed them so remarkably believable way. Moreover, it was also highly appreciating that less use of over-the-top artificial techs and more to realistic stunts put the gadgets to rest this time, and that made it more grounded than ever. The entire motor bike chase in Paris as well as the helicopter pursuit in Kashmir may give you goosebumps thinking that this guy did it all by himself! Therefore, kudos to Mr. Tom Cruise & the director Christopher McQuarrie for pushing the envelope in some most daring ways possible and making a movie like M.I: FALLOUT that deserves its shining place in the history of Action movie genre.
Another thing that I mostly liked about this movie was that one particular scene where Hunt's team confronts a female police-patrol officer in an awkward moment. The thing is that scene wasn't much an integral part of the story and they easily could have avoided it but I'm glad that they kept it in the final cut. It was very nicely handled and revealed a vulnerable Ethan Hunt who doesn't hesitate to draws the line & make the choices in some desperate moments that delicately uncovers the most humane attribute of a character like this.
Rest of the cast was great in their respective roles. Benji & Luther proved themselves as little more matured & experienced member of the team this time. And for Rebecca ferguson's Ilsa Faust, only thing I'd like to say is, from ROGUE NATION to FALLOUT, whenever she appeared on screen, it just made me think of what a loss for the 007 franchise for not to ever signed her for a major Bond girl role! This Swedish beauty got the perfect look & talent to fit in any role of an espionage tale. On the other side, Cavill already showed his talent to become the next James Bond any day in Guy Ritchie's THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E (2015), so I knew he'd do great but at times it did kind of felt like his character didn't much get the total badass treatment throughout the movie that it deserved (except for the Toilet-Fight segment). I'd love to see some more daring & twisted elements in his character of a CIA assassin.Without any use of hired stunts & CGI, this is another stunning accomplishment by Cruse, McQuarrie & the team. Personally I won't be surprised to see if Director Christopher McQuarrie become the next big target for the major superhero movie studios like MARVEL, WB or Fox and put them in a race to sign him for their next big-budget project.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Ever since the 3rd film directed by JJ Abrams in 2006 thugs franchise has truly established an indentiy for itself, it has only gotten bigger and better ever since.I can say, with honestly that this is best one. All of these good elements are pact. This is a long movie ,2 hours and 27 minutes, yet it never grows dull, never losses steam.

It really was the- 'Avengers Infinity War' of Mission Impossible films, all the previous movies seemed to build up to and be tied into this one.

 Seriously, Henry Cavill is such an amazing an captivating screen presence, if he was up against anyone BUT Tom Cruises- Ethan Hunt, the other actor would be completely overshadowed by Henry's macho charisma (can't wait to see him in the next Superman movie!). 
I haven't bothered with the last couple of 'Bournes and Bonds' on the big screen as they seem to be getting worse over time... but Mission Impossible seems fresher and crazier NOW than 20 years ago and Fallout is literally film school on how to do a spy/action/blockbuster movie RIGHT!!!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

378,bodhi-13262,"""The FALLOUT of all your good intentions.""",7,28 July 2018,"'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' is the sixth installment of the series and Ethan Hunt's most daring mission yet. Being a more direct sequel to 'Rogue Nation', does 'Fallout' deliver to full effect if this is to be the last?1. When a mission to obtain a trio of plutonium shells goes awry, IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) must assemble his team once more and make amends before a notorious terrorist group unravels a sinister plan with catastrophic results. Not to start off on the wrong foot but one of the biggest complaints about this film is the story. I guarantee there will be NO spoilers but I must prepare any audience who goes to see this that the story is confusing if you don't follow it thoroughly. The plot/setup is delivered in an IMF message within two minutes of the opening five minutes of the film. Like always, these messages self-destruct once completed and is never revisited even in passing. Unlike the prior films, this one desperately wants move ""story"" out of the way and get to the action. Though I understand this is an action franchise, the story should take its time to play out rather than how it is rushed here.2. Like I stated earlier, this is a direct sequel to the previous film, so regardless of the plot, you need to revisit 'Rouge Nation' before seeing this or else you'll be confused as to the presence of certain characters in this one. Speaking of characters, one of the best additions to the cast (since Jeremy Renner) is the ""Man of Steel"" himself, Henry Cavill. Cavill plays CIA operative August Walker, whom (if you've seen the most recent trailers) I can neither confirm nor deny is either an antagonist or protagonist in this film. Let's just say he walks a fine line, unless you're able to predict and follow the plot, you'd know what Cavill's character is about and where he's headed from the moment he pops up on screen. Despite him being portrayed as a badass in most of the previews, he's not as engaged in the action or shows his true potential as a combatant unlike Cruise. So if you're hoping to see Henry Cavill kick ass in this film, you may be a little disappointed. 3. The characters I didn't like however, were Angela Bassett and Vanessa Kirby. Firstly, Bassett plays CIA director Erica Sloan of whom August Walker (Henry Cavill) operates under. We all know Bassett to be an exceptional actress but her character in this is as shady as they come and you dislike her off-the-bat. It would be different if Sloan had redeemable qualities, but unfortunately, she doesn't. As for Kirby, her character is simply known as the 'White Widow', an arms dealer who's apparently bad at her job. Though Vanessa Kirby might appear to be ""eye-candy"" in this, she acts her part like an obsessed ex-girlfriend with crazy eyes. Every scene she shares with Tom Cruise and the way she stares at him, makes you think she just might try killing him in his sleep. Regardless of all that, the best character and only actress (apart from Michelle Monaghan) to return for a sequel, is Rebecca Ferguson as MI6 agent Ilsa Faust. Though Ferguson doesn't have much screen-time in this one as she did with the prior, her story ties in with Hunt's more organically.4. Last but not least, Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt himself and the impossible missions only he can make possible. These films just get better and better with its daring stunts and action set-pieces. From the Halo jump at the beginning to the high-octane helicopter chase at the climax, no other film can compare. Personally, the bathroom fight scene at the nightclub and the motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris were the highlights for me. I mean they were both very well choreographed and intricately planned that it felt more genuine and realistic than the rest. Not to say the other actions sequences aren't breathtaking and amazing, it's just preferences I guess. Though one might argue, when it comes to action, humor, a lighter tone and a more simplistic story, 'Ghost Protocol' is still the best of the series. I'd recommend people revisit that film as well as it delivers a better ""race against time"" plot than the current installment.For Christopher McQuarrie to be the first director to return for a sequel in this franchise, he does a good of a job as anyone. Tom Cruise definitely carries this film as he usually does and works the hardest for this installment in particular than I've ever seen him before. Some flaws are unavoidable when it comes to story, script and despite me wanting to see some interesting characters (who meet their untimely fates) return, this is still worth the price of admission. So go see this mission.......cause it might be your last.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

(ie. 'Jack Reacher', The 'MI' franchise, 'Oblivion', 'American Made', That movie where he dies all the time.) In fact, of his last 12 films only 2 were stinkers. Great stuff! But it also means our expectations are higher. So 'Fallout' is not a bad movie although, of the six MI films, it's the least good. Also, I'm the same age as Tom Cruise so it truly pains me to say this... Tom is starting to look his age. At 56, 41 in Hollywood leading men years, his face has less integrity, the hair color is off by years and he looks great but you can tell he's trying. It might be time for 'Agent Hunt' to come in from the field. Just sayin'. Otherwise, Rebecca Ferguson, who is 35 (of course she is), brought a fresh look and much needed fiest to 'Rogue'. More subdued in this film but still wonderful to watch. Frankly, It'd be nice to see her in charge of the IMF team. Am I right, ladies! 'Fallout' is more fuzzy familial and less cold hearted. A six seems harsh but I'm comparing it to the other five movies in the franchise. In my opinion the first MI (1996) is still the best. 'Rogue Nation' (2015) second. 'Ghost Protocol' (2011) third. MI 2 (2000) and MI 3 (2006) tied for fourth and 'Fallout'. Still I look forward to the seventh - Mission Impossible: Reverse Mortgage Scam.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

391,TC-Batsy,Better in IMAX!,10,3 August 2018,"Mission:Impossible Fallout is absolutely the most exciting movie of the summer and all the credit goes to Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie, who really raised the bar and gave movie-goers an action movie packed with intense stunts like never before. The locations were beautiful and breathtaking, that's why watching the movie in IMAX gives you the thrill you need to enjoy the best mission yet with Ethan and his friends and foes. Bond and Marvel movies can never achieve this level of perfection like the Mission:Impossible franchise, and CGI is spoiling the way movies are made because people want to watch a film that keeps them on the edge of their seats with great characters and plots.

One amazing action sequence after another from the get-go keeps viewers palms sweating while sitting on the edge of their seats.
All the usual suspects are here from the other films along with new villains to dislike.
I was impressed with the CGI as it was seamless with the live action.
Once again Tom spends his time running, jumping, fighting ,driving, shooting and flying a helicopter as well as any other action star. Most action stars of Tom's age have stopped but he carries on. 
And we the movie going public are the lucky ones that he does.
A well put together action film with believable good and bad guys who keep you guessing as too which is which.

395,Vishal_s_kumar,Fallout,10,10 January 2019,"With ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout,"" McQuarrie is determined to show his work, creating an extended climax that will likely blow audiences away. The rest of the movie isn't bad either, with Tom Cruise and the IMF unit continuing their impressive cinematic hustle for a new adventure that's the most bruising to date, and the most cohesive in years.Forced to choose between protecting partner Luther (Ving Rhames) and protecting the world, Ethan (Tom Cruise) makes a decision that loses control of a three plutonium orbs, allowing them to reach the black market. Eager to correct the situation, Ethan wants to pursue the plutonium to France, but the CIA is keen to keep an eye on him, putting August (Henry Cavill), a top enforcer, into play, joining Benji (Simon Pegg) as the race begins to charm arms dealer White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) into giving up the goods. In league with a terrorist group known as The Apostles, White Widow requires delivery of imprisoned anarchist Solomon (Sean Harris) to make a deal, forcing Ethan to confront his sense of moral duty as he plans to relinquish control of his archenemy to maintain world order. Standing in his way is Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), with the MI6 agent also concerned about Solomon's status, mixing it up with the IMF as they try to prevent the creation of three nuclear devices in control of a man who's looking to redefine world order.""Rogue Nation"" opened in a huge way, with Ethan sprinting into action as the IMF gang infiltrated an airfield, trying to prevent an Airbus A400M from taking off. Of course, this left the leader hanging on the side of an ascending airplane, with Cruise pulling off an amazing stunt for an eye-popping introduction, maintaining his reputation as an actor who embraces danger to create frightening thrills for his ""Mission: Impossible"" series. ""Fallout"" doesn't attempt the same scale, keeping things low-key as McQuarrie examines the extremes of Ethan's responsibilities, fighting to balance the protection of his squad and the preservation of life on Earth, facing The Apostles, a collection of well-trained mercenaries who are determined to use the plutonium orbs to generate mass destruction, inspiring change through catastrophe, feeding their religion of chaos, celebrating Solomon, their god. ""Fallout"" doesn't mess with bigness for quite some time, finding McQuarrie more invested in a spy game this time around, giving weight to Ethan's work as a superhero for the cause, caught between his need to protect the individual and pledge to save the world.""Fallout"" takes some time to get up and running, but it showcases a more confident McQuarrie, who struggled with balancing the enormity of ""Rogue Nation"" with its primary hunt, resulting in a dazzling but lopsided film. The next chapter in the ""Mission: Impossible"" saga is more confident and fully realized, finding McQuarrie trying to work up a sophisticated scenario of threat for the IMF gang to untangle, but also stepping carefully to keep the audience invested, stopping the feature on occasion to underline exposition and clarify character connections. McQuarrie also tries to slip in a few twists and turns along the way, but his puzzling isn't advanced, with eagle-eyed viewers likely realizing the full reach of The Apostles before Ethan does. Still, the director seems newly energized to make his mark on the ""Mission: Impossible"" world, making a direct sequel to ""Rogue Nation"" that keeps Solomon in play, with the anarchist delighting in any chance he receives to keep his appointment with doomsday, determined to watch Ethan suffer for his failures.""Fallout"" is a sleeker production, utilizing stunning cinematography and a driving score to slowly increase pressure, while the screenplay does a fine job with escalation, gradually increasing the urgency of the mission as it visits a few countries, selling the globetrotting atmosphere of the franchise. The film's centrepiece action sequence takes place on the streets of Paris, with Ethan, playing the part of a terrorist, tries to locate and reacquire Solomon for bargaining purposes, speeding, sprinting, and leaping all over the city while McQuarrie feels out his ""French Connection"" fandom. There's also a memorable fight inside a nightclub bathroom -- a scene that makes the most of Cavill's August, who's positioned as a major complication in the story, but never quite settles anywhere interesting. He's better with blunt power, and ""Fallout"" has its share of violent encounters and massive sequel moments, but McQuarrie doesn't get carried away. The human element of Ethan's world remains, dealing with the seductive qualities of the White Widow and his unease around Ilsa as she figures out what team she's playing for.""Fallout"" is appealingly performed by most of the cast with Cruise his most battered and bewildered here, still giving the role everything he's got, which remains a quite a lot, even 22 years after he took command of the franchise. McQuarrie is also newly inspired, trying to make up for the limp of ""Rogue Nation"" by creating a powerful showdown finale that's timed with a ticking clock and features battling helicopters in the middle of Kashmir. It's a vertigo-inducing doozy, and a helluva way to bring the movie to a close, offering pure nail-biting spectacle that also acts as an apology in a way, with McQuarrie making sure ticket-buyers exit with their bells rung. Directors don't have a habit of sticking around the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise for very long, but it would be something to see McQuarrie return to duty for a third picture, just for the chance to watch him try to top his work in ""Fallout."" That's going to be the real mission: impossible.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
396,jaapeelman,Mission impossible with impossible events,7,3 September 2018,"A new MI-movie again with a pretty lame story: a villain and and a syndicate want to use a nuclear bomb to create a new world-order.
Wow, fantastic, that is something....we have seen about a dozen times in movies. 
The action is as always good but do expect unrealistic events like a chopper which keeps on flying although the engine is shot to pieces....
Benji and Luther are both like an Einstein and exactly know how to defuse a nuclear bomb without any training or study at all.
And Ilsa is like a super-woman but when she finds the second bomb ""forgets"" that there is still an enemy in the house.
No, the story is lame with too many holes in it and too many impossible events.

398,derangedxzombie,"Great action sequences, humour and twists",8,23 December 2018,"When a good movie franchise makes several film's, their job becomes a case of doing better than the last or least being as good; having to being fresh idea's to the table to not seem stale. It's not an easy job, but is one Cruise and his IMF team pull off well. For instance there's many films that have car/chase sequences in France, namely Paris, and when you've seen one they start to get old. This film's chase sequences on Paris felt exciting to watch and tense, especially as events unfold and catch you off guard leaving you guessing what will happen next.The storyline is solid and follows elements of past movies, with an antagonist making a return and other cast too. There's a lot of twists that catch you off guard and story can shift direction quickly, at risk of confusing people unless they pay attention to characters names and small cues, but ultimately not so convoluted you're left a bit lost. There's also some humorous moments brought in especially by Simon Pegg well known for his comical side, and well choreographed fight scenes, a toilet scene in particular.Overall an enjoyable movie and certainly not boring.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
399,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,Brilliant and intense. Don't miss it!,9,30 July 2018,"I've been a casual fan of the series for years and even though there are a few flaws in this chapter it is a personal favourite of mine now and it's turned me into a hardcore fan. When most films get past their 3rd chapter they often run out of ideas and usually make fun of themselves. Take for example franchises like Fast & Furious, Terminator, Die Hard and Death Wish. But the Mission Impossible franchise is one where they improve with each one. They are on the 6th instalment now and even though it retreads a little bit its still full of new ideas and some surprises along the way. Apart from the goofy Mission Impossible 2 this is a near perfect franchise. Tom Cruise is a very committed actor who always does the majority of his own stunts. He raises the bar here performing a HALO jump, dangling off helicopters, doing his own driving (and piloting) and running across rooftops. Also being the producer he does a great job overseeing the wellbeing of the series hiring talented writers/directors like JJ Abrams, Brad Bird and Christopher McQuarrie who have each brought their own fresh ideas to the films respectively.McQuarrie returns as director/co-writer and he really knows how to push performances from his actors while directing some breathtaking action scenes. It's the most action packed entry but not to the point where it defies the laws of physics. Each action scene feels somewhat grounded, they are well shot and edited with some bone crunching sound effects. They don't just rely on CGI fight sequences but instead focus on old fashioned stunts and car chases that remind us of the great action films of the 80s and 90s. One of the great things about this series is the cool gadgets (something the Bond franchise has been lacking in recent years) even though the technology is crazy there is oddly a certain believability to it in the films.It's got a big cast from returning actors Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin while introducing new comers Henry Cavil and Angela Basett. They are all given enough to do (even Simon Pegg gets some action) but Henry Cavil steals the show as the shady CIA assassin. Rebecca Ferguson is a match for Tom Cruises Ethan Hunt as mysterious MI6 agent Ilsa who can really do some damage. The characters are so well written and we never know what they are going to do next. A few gripes about it is the writers put the action set pieces before the story. The plot isn't as focused as the previous films it's a little thin in comparison. It does get a bit convoluted and there are a few tiny plot-holes. There are some references to earlier movies and a certain character comes back who just felt shoehorned in. It is a little bit too long, they could have easily trimmed 15 minutes from it. However nitpicking aside the film works on so many levels, its well paced, it's dramatic, there's chemistry between all of the characters, it's tense, it's funny and emotional and it has the best music score of them all. It's the most enjoyable action packed entry in the series and will turn you into a hardcore fan like myself. I've seen the previous films numerous times and feel like I need to re-watch them all again now!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
400,n-m-bertin,Doesn't deserve all the hype,5,17 August 2018,"I still don't understand the hype around this movie. I liked both previous MI, would have rated them around 7. But this one doesn't hold up. First of all, the villain is awful. Or both villains should I say. You don't really understand their motives. You also realise that they tried really hard to show terrorists that are all white for once. But you guess who the villain is pretty quickly there's no misdirection, no real elegance in the writing process. It's just stunt after stunt, with some bad ""emotional"" moments that don't really work. I didn't for Ethan, nor his wife.They also failed on the humor part. The only time the audience laughed was when he spoke French, because his French was horrible (at a supposedly dramatic moment). They also exploit every cliché possible in the action movie book. The last moment save, the crucial object falling near the cliff etc... It's very predictable, and very annoying. Henry Cavill plays a totally (spoilers) brainless villain. All muscles and no brains. And nuclear weapons ? Smallpox ? Come on... And you couldn't even get the Indian landscape right. You shot this in New Zealand and in the most famous cliff in the world, in Norway... You think we can't tell ? With not one Indian or Pakistani on screen ? Oh and Alec Baldwin's character dies... for no reason. And they just leave him there. Let's not even mention the CIA's director... Anyway, I don't understand why people liked it so much ? Were they bored of all these The Rock and Superhero movies ? Did they need an old school action movie again ? It seems like the same Baby Driver hype, which gave the audience a Tarantino clone a decade after people stopped making them.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
401,iamianiman,Your Mission... Should You Choose to Accept It... is to Read this Review and See Mission Impossible 6: Fallout in Theaters Now Now Now!!!,9,26 July 2018,"As we all know, this is the sixth instalment of the franchise. Supposedly by this time, the series already started long to drag their wear and tear tires here and about, so within so without, sucking every preposterous and ridiculous ideas they can think of. However, Mission Impossible franchise has been one of the few to deny that statement, as the impossible becomes possible, as it suggests that statement is merely a myth, as the ideas never entirely run out, as the stunts are afresh and eye-catching but can this new instalment keep up with the others (putting aside the second one as if it never happens because the majority of us can agree it's the worst) or will it have a serious fallout?One thing to talk about is the plot. It is superficially heavy this time, in fact the heaviest out of all the series. Plus, it is intertwined and ultra-complicated for a summer Hollywood movie that you will be exhausted after the 147 mins ride. What makes this successful is that it has that Oscar-worthy vibe and it solves the puzzles very neatly towards the end despite some revelations might come off as predictable. And before I forget to mention, this movie has a lot of deep connections with Rogue Nation (the 5th instalment). Watch the previous instalment before stepping into this new mission or you will hardly relate with the characters. And if you've had the time, revise the 3rd one too.Now, you must promptly be wondering, how about the stunts? Let me get to this part. THE... STUNTS... ARE... REAL! Every time you go in watching this best ongoing franchise in the world, you should bear in mind that CGI is a non-existent element. And the stunts are performed by Tom Cruise himself. The daring set pieces are well choreographed and acted in a way that looks real and genuine that puts most of this year's other action blockbuster movies to shame. The BATHROOM scene... will leave you in total shock. The PARIS scene... will make you gasp due to many unexpected moments... The ROOFTOP scene... will make you wonder which one that got Tom Cruise injured... The KASHMIR scene... will make your heart jitters and probably, pees in your pants because... THE STUNTS ARE ALL REAL!Acting is well done, of course. Henry Cavill savors his swashbuckler swagness, Simon Pegg brings less comedy to the table but executes a more matured lad, Rebecca Ferguson has improved a lot since her debut in Rogue Nation, and she has lost a lot of weight that perfectly suits her role, Michelle Monaghan makes us miss her character so much and eventually, fall in love with her and Tom Cruise is anything good you can possible talk about. He is a legend!What I like is it plays a bit different this time in which there is less over-the-top artificial techs and more to realistic stunts that put the gadgets to rest this time. This is a classified mission where nothing is impossible in reality but it is impossible to commit because of how dangerous and menacing there are. They opt on breathtaking locations as they fill with richness and intensity making the movie charges with a load of energy that transmits to the audience who becomes alive and fully realizes that this is the exact location without any usage of CGI.When the action scenes come in especially the Paris scene, the sound effect is top-notch; you can hear those tiny details of engineered sound system waving in the cinema hall, sucking the audience as if we are in the action movie ourselves.What I dislike is the repetitive dialogues by the characters, it is semi-cool and semi-irritating because they keep saying the same phrases. It comes off as irritating but why is it cool is because sometimes, it uses the third-act solution technique in creating a storyline... and humor apparently.Another thing I despise is the scene when the theme song emerges on the big screen. Don't get me wrong... I love and salute the theme song. However, I hate it when it shows glimpses of scenes and stunts that about to happen afterwards followed by its almost-constructed chronological order. In my opinion, that is a big spoiler!And I dislike that they fail to tell Jeremy Renner's character whereabouts after Rogue Nation (as far as I can remember).Truth to be told, I wasn't a huge fan of the Mission Impossible series until... three months before this movie came out. I felt a whole energy down my spine and knew this is going to be a good one. Bloody hell! How wrong was I! It isn't just good, it is state-of-the-art masterpiece action blockbuster film.So if I'm going to rank all the six impossible-made films, it would be:
(From Best to Worst)6, 4, 3, 5, 1 and 2.Is there any hope for this franchise to survive in Hollywood? VERY POSSIBLE!
Is there any story left that this franchise can get hold onto for the next instalment? POSSIBLE!
Is there any chance you might doze off during the movie at any condition? IMPOSSIBLE!
Is there any chance left that the stunts can get any better than Fallout? VERY IMPOSSIBLE!Your mission... should you choose to accept it is to see Mission Impossible: Fallout in theaters!Overall: 90/100This message will self-destruct in 5 seconds...",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

407,imdb2-5,A self parody with fake ratings,4,30 July 2018,"The set pieces are gorgeous as you'd expect from a huge budget. The actors are A list. The special effects are very good. That's where it ends. The script was an egofest for Cruise and unintentionally a laugh out loud comedy that has all the laughs from unrealistic early movies. Plot. Tom Cruise is just too damn nice. He's the super agent with a huge heart, willing to risk the fate of the world for his friends or even for an innocent police officer he doesn't know. He's just that kind of awesome sweetheart. But it can cause problems. And now the US government doesn't know whether Tom is just another ticked off agent who is double crossing his own people! Oh no, not that All American boy we love!!!! Can he and a team of geriatric looking jokesters top the world's most evil man, save the world and save everyone they love? Well, not for a minute did I think anyone believed old Tommy was in danger, in spite of doing the most craptacular stunts.Problems:1. When a character criticizes Tommy and says ""no one will fall for that trick"" and everyone in the audience knows what's going to happen next.2. What happens when a double cross double crosses the double crosser who double crosses the double double crosser because it needs to be done in order to double the double cross? 3. When Tom needs help from Hollywood, he gets it. Time slows down, high elevation becomes nothing more than a hit the ground and roll fall, the bad guys simply take their sweet merry time so that Tom can arrive... you name it. Every laughable exaggeration from old films made it into this one.4. The obsession with getting even with Ethan Hunt will distract everyone from their master plan. Hmmm.... so let's see the choice.... get away or get even with Ethan Hunt and potentially screw up all my perfect master plans which would kill Hunt anyway? The obsession must go on and Ethan must always win.The audience was laughing at this lazy tripe. These reviews are fake.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The whole movie is over two and a half hours and is nothing but action scene followed by action scene. While I enjoy action as much as the next guy, sometimes it is nice to actually have a worthwhile plot. And by plot I don't mean the usual convoluted MI plot, subplot, sub-subplot that just keeps changing direction. It is the same stuff that MI has been offering since MI 1 - no changes just the characters got older. Unless you are a die hard MI fan, I would wait and watch it at home, where you don't have to sit for close to three hours waiting in agony for it to stop - at least you can watch it in pieces which would make it a lot more palatable.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The big guy of Green Mile easily subdued by somebody, and the plutonium balls, that freaking multi million dollars' plutonium cores was practically given away.At first I had a doubt when they ignore the plutonium. The cores, watch out the cores.. (I warned it in my mind), but then I thought it was Ethan's strategy to further track the enemy (the apostles).Turned out later (after next 5-10 minutes movie played), it really was slipped to enemy's hand.WTF? That was so dumb.Then the obvious evil agent, who killed every eye-witnesses of one of thr main fugitive (John Lark), nobody seemeed to suspect him (except all this dumb movie viewers, of course, that's so predictable given how dumb this movie is).I just about 20 minutes into movie, and this is suck. very badly written plot.If this was an MI team training, maybe I would pass those all cliched but for those experienced, skilled, veteran MI team, nothing those dumb cliches would ever be happened.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
410,trelerke-politics,strange mix of bad choices and the franchise seems as exhausted as most of the acting,2,3 September 2018,"I thought this was going to be better, in the manner of the more recent James Bond movies, sharp, smart, good production values but it was mostly boring and silly, way beyond the kind of silly one would expect in these movies. No one came off well and the damn thing was long. Again the fate of the world hung on absolute chance and individual action, and the plot was silly, the original loss of the plutonium balls was Monty Python stupid and the manner in which the plutonium was handled was cartoonish, again, way beyond the acceptable silly for this franchise. I suppose my main point is that it simply wasn't enjoyable, everything seemed forced and there was a lot of repetition, not just within the movie, but across the movies. Remember the first movie that had the spectacular and improbably helicopter stunts........well, we get more of that here. And, things were predictable, and often the payoff explanations were trivial. This was a phoned-in effort. Spend your money somewhere else.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
411,ryanbartlett-870-746486,Tom Cruise and Mission Impossible strike gold again,9,11 August 2018,"Fallout once again brought us everything that we love in the Mission Impossible franchise. They got us fast-paced, real stunts curtesy of the dare-devil Cruise, a plot that is full of twists and turns, and a team of characters that are fun and exciting to watch.
The direction was beautiful. Christopher McQuarrie has built a very good relationship with Cruise over the many films they have collaborated on together. He is able to capture intense action scenes in a way that is very clear but one that takes a fresh style on the approach. We have seen fistfights, jumping out of a plane, and motorcycle chases countless times before, so instead of sticking to what we know and giving the audience what they are expecting, McQuarrie brought a new fresh take on how to make these scenes stick out from the rest in a beautiful way. He relies heavily on the rule of thirds which almost immediately in my opinion makes scenes more captivating and allows them to breath and not be bogged down in the center. 
I could talk about his brilliant decisions all day, but he wasn't the only one who exceled in the movie. The cast was fantastic as well, bring an ensemble look to the series that hasn't fully been there at times. The series has really progressed from a Tom Cruise centric film to one that now is just an action thriller that will use every character almost equally to achieve the goal.

415,h-62007-26888,Just when you think Cruise has done it all...,9,10 May 2021,"Fallout proves itself as a superior film to Ghost Protocol and is full of surprises that some will never know what to expect. On a technical level, it's already well-crafted thanks to amazing visuals, solid acting performances, stellar cinematography, an awesome soundtrack, and some of the GREATEST action scenes of the franchise. But also, it succeeds on another level with powerful writing that fixes up any of the problems of the predecessor and characters with depth and development in and out. Though watching this film might require some context from the predecessor, there's no denying that this is one of those films you need to see at least ONCE in order to even FUNCTION in our culture. Will there be more Mission Impossible movies after this one? At this rate, who knows? But the sixth movie proved that making one good is still possible and I can't wait for more adventures the IMF could get into!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
416,DasBobsWorld,Mission Impossible Fallout of a Helicopter edition.,8,7 February 2019,"Well, I have to say that you guys were not kidding. This is a fantastic action film. More than twenty years since the first of these six films had come out and it is still a surprise when a Mission Impossible film ends up this good. It really feels like we are living in a solid era for action franchises with the Raid, John Wick, MI and even the Fast and Furious for our b-movie action goodness. We live in exploding times!Honestly, I don't think I have seen an action movie/spy game thriller that was this much fun in a while. Everything they did in this film was top notch. From the stunts to the chase sequence, to the amazing Helicopter chase...I mean damn. Also, if Cavill not being Superman anymore means we can see him as the beast he was in this movie, with an equally as beast mode a mustache, then I am all good with that. There are a few nitpicks, I thought that the movie dragged a bit between the middle and the end, I also had a few moments when I wasn't exactly convinced with Cruises acting, but nothing that really took me out of the film. Also while there was a spy story as always with this franchise, it still relies on the stunts and action to do the heavy lifting. Which isn't bad, when the action you have is this good.MI: Fallout is very good. One of the better action films of the last while. Easily deserving of the praise it has gotten and making me wish I had seen it a lot sooner.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
417,zterrell,action only film,3,7 December 2018,"Always trying to save the entire world, always in a chase scene, always has a mole trying to implicate him as a bad guy, always in every scene... geez, Tom, don't you know what made Ghost Protocol the best ever MI show? It was the characters... some of them not being you. It was the interaction, the fun, the humor. This was like one lone beer commercial, running over and over for 2 1/2 hours. Enough already! No human could endure the beatings; no helicopter, boat, car or bike can maneuver or handle as much stress and traffic as the ones in this show. It would have been laughable in many places it the show wasn't trying to come across as reality.
I don't like to be critical of a series I enjoy, but it might do Tom and the others involved in the next show to remember how intricate the series was, back when they were only dealing with one tyrant or one serious threat. Saving the entire world is getting boring.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
418,insatiableaskeri,Amazing worth watching work,8,30 June 2021,"I'm a huge fan of Cruise and gotta admit that the whole franchise is still in demand! The last movie really took my breath away. Needless to say that I was astounded by Cruise's capability to do such inconceivable and mind blowing tricks all by himself! As Conan said, he def never heard of CGI:))) astonishing fight scenes! Highly recommended!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
419,CryptoGuy,Mission Impossible is a fun ride,7,30 July 2018,"Real stunts. That alone should put butts in seats. You're not going to see some CGI, green screen action sequence. You're going to see real people doing real stunts; not some cartoon.Fallout is done well. Yes, there are some head scratching choices by the director and DP. For example, do we have to have a lens flare in almost every shot? I'm looking at you JJ Abrams. Your fingerprints are all over this. My advice to young DPs and directors: clean up your shots. Flag those lights, dammit!There's a lot of good action in this film. Cruise delivers the intensity. Cavill is a brute. Pegg the comic relief. Rhames the heart. You'll have fun. Get some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy. If you're looking for anything else other than that, you'll be disappointed. MI Fallout is just good ol' fashion action and fun.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

This one was different though. Not as much comedy as the skyscraper one. Still some good humor.Feels like the MI movies improve with each decade.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
422,neobateman,Blockbusters don't get better than this.,9,13 August 2018,"Tom Cruise returns to ignite the screen in the sixth installment of the incredibly successful Mission Impossible franchise. I will be the first to admit, I liked most of the previous films, but never loved them. I always thought the James Bond or Jason Bourne franchise had the more interesting lore or characters. The stories of these Mission Impossible movies were never this interesting to me. So in conclusion, Mission Impossible for me was a more lackluster franchise that was held together simply by Tom Cruise's effort. Until now because Mission Impossible: Fallout is not only the best film of the franchise, but also one of the best Action movies I have ever seen! The trailers gave a little too much away in my opinion so if you are interested in seeing it, stay away from the trailers if you managed to avoid them this far. All I'll say is that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) have lost these plutonium capsules to a group named the Apostles. The rest of the film consists of the team trying to get back the plutonium. There are many twists and turns in Mission Impossible: Fallout that surprised me. Of course this is not a Tarantino script where nothing is predictable but I thought unlike the previous movies they really used the gadgets and lore of the franchise to the advantage of the story. Often in the James Bond films, 007 receives gadgets to escape from sticky situations. It removed suspense from certain scenes cause we know he'll simply press a button on his watch. Mission Impossible: Fallout has gadgets but uses them to Ethan Hunt's disadvantage. The use of them often led to twists I didn't expect. The story was certainly the most compelling of all these movies. So we have a solid story and it's accompanied by some of the best action sequences I have ever seen. Especially a scene involving a helicopter made my mouth drop. It is a mixture of solid suspenseful film making and a sense of wonderment as the audience is in awe at what Hunt is doing. Say about Tom Cruise, the person anything you want. But the quality he puts into these roles are incredible. He is 56 and has been a reliable movie star for over 3 decades and still learns how to fly a helicopter for the sixth Mission Impossible movie. This allows the director to make long wide shots of action. No shaky can or quick editing that makes one sea sick here. There are a few characters in this film that could have used a little more development. Especially Henry Cavill's character stuck out as a character that felt a little under-utilised. But besides this, Mission Impossible: Fallout is an incredible Action movie, filled with awesome performances by Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Angela Basset, Alec Baldwin and Michelle Monaghan. A film that has some of the best and most thrilling action scenes ever filmed and a story that kept me genuinely intrigued. Overall blockbusters don't get better than this and easily beats Deadpool 2 as my favourite summer movie of 2018.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
423,danjakubik-90443,Possibly the best of the franchise so far,8,30 December 2018,"Easy to follow plot, story and characters. Impressive action scenes which have become expected for this film franchise. Emotionally resonant ending. Plenty of plot twists and changing uncertain identities in this international spy thriller franchise based on the 1960's television series. Highly entertaining and recommended. Directed and written by Christopher Mcquarrie who won the best original screenplay academy award for ""The Usual Suspects"" of 1995.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
424,laura-olivieri,Tom cruise è tornato,10,12 September 2018,"Tom Cruise returns for the sixth time to play the role of Ethan Hunt in a scene where the scenes are made without double. The direction is very beautiful, and we understand each action scene. It is the conclusion of what started in rogue nation",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
425,Bangorboy,Just ok,6,30 June 2019,This had some very good moments but overall I thought it was a bit dull compared to previous in the series. Generally the characters lacked charisma and it was definitely about 30-40 minutes too long.,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
426,navdp,Excellent action scenes for a dud story.,7,16 August 2018,Excellent action scenes doesn't make a good movie unless it has a reasonable story.The excellent franchise usually loses its way as it did while ghost protocol and came back strongly with rogue nation. Fallout without the action scenes and Tom cruise is a dud. It is just a deliberate run around of actors with frivolous melodrama.,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
427,politicidal,The Best Action Movie of the Summer and one of the best blockbusters of 2018.,9,11 November 2018,"The best blockbuster film of the summer. It takes all the elements people love about the franchise then dials it up to eleven.The action scenes and chases haven't been this exciting in an action film probably since its predecessor Rogue Nation. The HALO jump sequence is outstanding and a climactic helicopter chase is exhilarating. The gunfights and hand to hand combat is bone crunching. An extended action beat in a bathroom of all places is brutal and very well choreographed.The returning cast is great. The underrated actor Sean Harris doesn't disappoint as arch-villain Solomon Lane. Henry Cavill's CIA agent Walker is a good addition to the proceedings and Vanessa Kirby is having a ball as the femme fatale arms dealer White Widow.Christopher McQuarrie solidifies himself as one of the top action directors working today. Not only that, he knows how to weave it into a good story too. Now while I loved this movie, there are some things I should probably mention. I cannot go quite that far and call it the best in the series and one of the best blockbusters in years like Fury Road or the Dark Knight or even The Avengers movies. There are still things I just liked better in Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation.Now that being said, this one does stand out from the other films for one reason. It feels genuinely epic, like a classy cinematic adventure from the 1960s. Like an older James Bond film; and this is far better than half the recent James Bonds for that matter.Again I like certain elements more in the earlier films but I dunno, it's more balanced here and the film really benefits from that. I mean, the editing and the pacing is top notch. Nothing feels unnecessary. It really reminded me of The Dark Knight in that senseI must sound confusing right now but don't worry, it remains an excellent well oiled thrill ride that is worth seeing in theaters.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
428,jashezilla,Best action movie EVER.,10,23 September 2019,Flawless movie. Everything about it is incredible and it's an adrenaline rush from the get-go.,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
429,markj-02556,MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE TO HATE,9,14 August 2018,"This film is about the fallout of Ethan Hunts past decisions. He leads a team to try and find a 3 bombs before they are detonated.This film is written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects). It stars Tom Cruise (Top Gun), Henry Cavill (Man of Steel) and Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction).This film was exciting from start to finish, McQuarrie has improved his directing since Rogue Nation, Tom Cruise and the supporting cast are great as always. But Cavill surprised me with a rather charismatic performance as Aganet Walker. A particular highlight of the film was the halo jump scene, which was simply breathtaking.However the third act drags and brings back a character from the previous film that was unnecessary and out of nowhere. Its a shame because the first to acts are incredible, probably some of the best scenes and set pieces in the entire franchise.Probably the best film so far in the franchise.9/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
430,tlpinbcc,Gets that blood pressure up!,9,31 August 2019,Action packed and heart stopping moments throughout. Good storyline and characters. Tom is aging well and action scenes still realistic. Given his age appreciate no overt sexual scenes but love plays a believeable role. Great to see Vin Raines and he is typical funny and sarcastic. Cinematography is very good and compelling. Overall I really enjoyed the movie.,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
431,riskamalda,Pretty boring,5,2 November 2020,"I do not recall other mission imposible series, but this one turn out to be really a movie with unnecessary drama like the unnecessary kissing scene. Everything was kind of duplication from some action movies, the most boring part of this movie is when i have to pay attention to the never ending explanation of what and who the enemy is, tom cruise did a standard job in covering his part and so does other roles. This movie could have been better if they would just focus on the mission impossible part.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

433,tennismenace,Very good summer action movie,8,9 August 2018,"For the most part, I loved this action movie. The plot kept my attention; the acting was quite good; and the action scenes were for the most part off the charts fun. So, why didn't I rate this a 9 or 10? Basically two reasons. I grew up watching the tv series and this is not like that. The tv series was about a TEAM of experts working together to accomplish a difficult task. This is mostly about one person, one super Rambo person, getting the job done. I don't care how big Tom Cruise's name is.....that just rubs me wrong. Secondly, the last action scene with the helicopter was way too long and definitely over the top to the point of it being comical to me. In other words, it took from allowing me the chance to believe this scene. The two previous car scenes were pretty unbelievable as well, but at least they both didn't distract me, and actually were quite enjoyable to view. I can't say that about the unrealistic helicopter scene that dragged on for more than the 15 minutes on the clock. Okay, I guess I said enough, but I still highly recommend the movie if you like action with some twists and political intrigue. Oh, one more thing....Vanessa Kirby is smoking hot even as a blond. I loved watching her as a brunette in The Crown (Netflix), but here, she definitely did not get enough camera time. Very easy on the eyes, for sure!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
434,ashutoshaswaleho,It's just getting better and better.,10,27 July 2018,"Went to the premier. Since the franchisee went in the hands Bad Robit, Mission Impossible movies are getting better and better. Mr. Macquarrie wrote and direct this and previous installment. I became fan of his writing since Jack Reacher. And bringing him to MI franchise, best move by Tom Cruise. Unlike mainstream action movies, simon pegg's benji character is not just a comic relief. We all know, he's more than that. From Cavill's hand powering up to the helicopter scenes, there is so much awesomeness. And all the credit goes to the one and only Mr Tom Cruise, 'cause he made this franchise look good. Love from India.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
435,yeolit,Feels kinda normal to other action flicks,8,7 October 2018,"This instalment of Mission Impossible was kinda disappointing, especially since the main scenes include a few lengthy car chases and Tom Cruise running for a long way. There were some places where the plot was kind of shallow, and a few incidents which turned out kind of strangely.But overall, the presentation was top notch, acting was great as well, and the scenery during the movie were captured marvellously. However, the plot was shallow, kind of cliched or weird at times, and frankly, the car chase scenes were so long I thought I saw them loop a few scenes.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Every actor and actress was as advanced as advanced could be, all playing their characters to perfection. It was filled with epic and awesome action and some of the cliff hangers it left you on was just amazing. The story line was was very strong and no matter how confusing it was, it all made sense in the end. I haven't seen the other mission impossible films but everyone is saying it's the best one yet. I would go and watch it as it's for everyone. This is a movie I can't wait to see again!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
437,youngman44,Decent but Overrated,7,3 August 2018,"I was very surprised at the star ratings this film garnered. Currently it is 8.4 on IMDB. I love the Mission Impossible franchise. Tom Cruise is solid as Ethan Hunt. And the humor is quality, especially since Simon Pegg was added in. The three primary actresses in this film are high caliber and beautiful. And, yet ... while the story arc was good, the emotional elements seemed forced. The character development and use was inconsistent. Ving Rhames' character has become a canned, predictably mundane bit player. I like Ving Rhames and his tough guy persona in combo with his computer skills was an excellent early feature to the films, but the fact is, his character has become a caricature over time - a canned, non-factor that is often more liability than strength. This film seemed more of an Ethan Hunt / Tom Cruise hero worship homage than it did a team oriented, mission impossible. I don't want to trash the film because there were elements I liked. But, 8.4??? More like a 7.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

That's not to diminish the film's successes however, as there are an abundance of wonderfully executed fight sequences and somewhat thrilling chases, whilst maintaining a stylish aesthetic. Similarly, Vanessa Kirby is excellent in her role as arms broker ""White Widow"". However, this is undermined by Cruise and Cavill's monotone performances, injecting scarcely little life into their characters. The writers clearly aimed for an ambiguous and non linear plot, however it becomes quite convoluted to the extent that I struggled to keep up with the cast's varying agendas.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Yet, Fallout manages to include several grand action set pieces involving multiple agents, new and recurring characters, heartfelt dialogues (Luther, Julia), and a well timed humour. Considering Tom Cruise is getting older (he's 20+ years older than other agents) in this new instalment of MI, it's fair to say he pulled off a great job.McQuarrie maintains our empathy and suspense (who's gonna live? Who's the good guy / bad guy? What's happening to the bomb threats, Rogue Nation, and MI team?) throughout the 2.5 hour movie. Casting is great, e.g. Sean Harris' villainous Solomon Lane is devilishly clever, and keeps the stakes high. There's bound to be scenes and dialogues worth re-watching. I watched the movie twice. It's money well spent.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

While some of the twists and turns were pretty predictable (if you're a true MI fan), so what? It was still fun to watch. Tom Cruise, at his age, doing his own stunts is enough to warrant a movie ticket. Hubby liked this one best. I preferred the last installment.

451,TheJohnnyPHreak,IMAX Blockbuster Goes All Out,8,8 December 2018,"When I say this is the most tense and thrilling action film I've seen in years, I'm not being hyperbolic. Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise have created one of hell of an edge of your seat thriller that is actually an action film. Could they step up their game in the sixth installment of a franchise? The cast and crew have, two folds. The film plays out two years after the events of Rouge Nation. There's a job, things go wrong and the IMF is on case to find the villain and stop chaos. I was clinging to my seat with each action scene. I didn't know what was going to happen next and at times was anyone going to survive. They are shot expertly well, pulling no punches and leaving it all on screen.From the opening sequences the intensity is high and only goes up from there. This time they are teamed with a burly CIA agent played extremely well by Henry Cavill. He's such a good counter for the IMF team and he fits in so well with the group's chemistry. Even though they don't get much to do Rhames and Pegg are great when they are on screen. Rebecca Ferguson is once again very good as the MI-6 agent with her own agenda. The adding of Vanessa Kirby to the cast was excellent. I'm hoping to see her show up in future films. Fans of the entire series will definitely enjoy the nods to just about every other film in the series. I had never seen a film in IMAX until this. It was worth the wait. That final action sequence had me shaking. I really think the cast and crew went out to make a thrilling spy sequel. What we get is one of the best pound for pound action films of the year.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Although I do remember liking the first one when I saw it, these movies just don't resonate with me like, say, 'Fast and Furious.' But this installment was #1 at the box office for ages and got rave reviews, so I figured it was amazing.As usual, when a movie is popular, I'm not impressed. It's hard to explain how this film made me feel. I wasn't really bored, but I wasn't in awe. For starters, the plot was too complicated. That's the problem with movies now. The story is either lazily written fluff or it's too much information for the viewer to understand.The action was fun at times (the Paris chase, for instance) but the thrill was quickly gone. It was nothing to talk about later. And it's nothing we haven't seen before. Trust me. If anything, it occasionally rips off other action movies.The acting performances where also mediocre. Tom Cruise was a bit hammy because all of his lines were. And it's hard to take Rebecca Ferguson seriously after 'The Greatest Showman.' I keep expecting her to burst into a cheesy pop song. And it's hard to take Alec Baldwin seriously - well, ever.So, 'Mission Impossible: Fallout' is okay for a Saturday night when there's nothing else on T.V., but if you're looking for something to blow you away, this may not be it.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie
The newest Mission Impossible movie..... Well it came out last year. If you've seen one Mission Impossible movie, you've seen them all, especially when you consider Ghost Protocol through Fallout. Now there is nothing wrong with that. The movie is made well and it follows the formula perfectly. But sometimes having a movie tell its story this well is not a bad thing. This movie lives and breathes for its action set pieces and damn do they provide on that front.The fight scenes are tremendous. That bathroom fight with Henry Cavill and Tom Cruise and their foe is a work of art. You can tell who is who and what is what. In a modern action film, that is truly a blessing. The actors are doing the fighting in most cases. That car chase keeps on going even when you think it's over. It is pulse pounding in the best ways.It also plays with the story details from previous movies. It carries the story from Rogue Nation. It also ties in with part three extending that story. These movies have never tied together in that fashion. They are usually self contained. But not this one. This one actually plays with the conventions of the Mission Impossible stories while still telling the standard rogue agent story that every one of these movies have done.As long as this movie still does the same thing though, it can't transcend to that next level. It does tell the same story we've seen before. I can enjoy the action but I'm not that invested in the story. Also I think Tom Cruise is rather dull in this one. He lacks even the slightest bit of personality he had in the previous films almost like he's bored with this. Everyone else is fine. I think Henry Cavill should get more action movies.If this is your cup of tea, feel free to indulge. It is worth the watch. It is fun and enjoyable.

In other words, much of the enjoyment I derived from 'Fallout' was not the 'If' Ethan would survive a perilous skydive or a helicopter crash, but more so 'How' Ethan would survive (We all know he is going to survive - it's a given). And I think the film achieved an incredible spectacle through that as the film could be as outlandish and extreme as it wants, because it doesn't have to worry about believability or feasibility. After all, I stopped questioning the realism of Mission: Impossible a long time ago because it's not the film's focus. Neither is narrative, truly - the narrative is merely a vehicle for the film's action, and action this film certainly has. It's the film's core impetus to keep the audience engaged - and to keep them engaged, there has to be variety. Without it, the film would get stale. Fortunately, the assured direction of the film means there is both focus on how the action is controlled and on how that action consistently builds and builds.Through this building of action, I noticed something impressive about the film's direction - well-controlled cinematography (with barely any egregious shakycam, one of my biggest action film pet peeves), a variety of colour and colourful lighting and a focus on trying to do many stunts practically rather than doing them against a green screen. The no-music car chase was a truly standout scene for me in this regard as the film understood, at least for a brief moment, that simply having pure action, foley and the squealing of burning rubber was far more important than playing the heart racing orchestral film score to make what was happening onscreen more action-packed than it actually was.There's also a charming obsession in 'Fallout' for twists wrapped in more twists like the revelation at the beginning of the film that the hospital the insane manifesto-writing weapons expert, Nils Delbruuk, is in is a set that dramatically falls apart when he gives the IMF the information they need. There are plenty of 'Gotcha' moments like this in 'Fallout' with both the bad guys and the good guys one-upping each other, playing each other for fools - which is certainly indicative of what one could call classic spy-vs-spy espionage, I would think. And it has to be said that there was a moment near the end where it seemed as if the nuclear bombs were detonated and Ethan's friends, his wife and many, many others have just died - but actually it was just the rising of the sun over the mountains. ""You got me with that one, but I'll get you next time, director of the film 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout', Christopher McQuarrie!""It's not all perfect, obviously. One of the film's most glaring faults is its emotional scenes - neither Ethan's relationship with his ex-wife, Julia, or with Rebecca Ferguson's character Ilsa Faust really left an impact on me. The death of Alec Baldwin's IMF Director character also lacked a lot of punch, especially since he was only introduced in 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation', just before this one. A more prominent issue, however, would probably be the 'reveal' of the villany of Henry Cavill's August Walker. Yeah sorry, 'Fallout' - that was kinda obvious of you, which is a real shame. Considering how well the rest of the movie can play the audience like a fiddle, Cavill's character could have been done way, WAY better. Hell, it would have been more surprising to me if he didn't turn out to be a villain.Overall: mid-to-high 7, borderline 8 maybe?",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Keep the twists coming but don't confuse your audience, make an old man run really fast and get beat up a few times but not really hurt, don't be like James Bond but include a travelogue and femme fatales while defusing bombs and 'sploding stuff. Keep the dialogue smart and funny while keeping it simple for the globalised market where jokes don't work and dialogue can be easily dubbed and understood.Impossible?It's hard for me to fathom the goodwill the Cruiser generates for each new IMF struggle. The films are formulaic and cliche and reuse the same out-of-the-box visual effects as each other instalment after the doves one, to the point I can't tell them apart. Is this the free climbing one? Or the one in London? Or with Simon Pegg? Have I seen this? Or when he rides a motorcycle? Or crashed a car.Cruise dominates each and every part of the film with the same sufferance expression that indicates he may need a hug. As for the women; kick ass heroines they may be (although one's a global network Florence Nightingale instead) but that doesn't mean the don't all go a quiver as soon as the script allows them to share the screen with the Hunt. More shorthand means brunette's a saint while blonde is evil. In fact in one particularly torturous scene Cruise delivers all Rebecca Ferguson's lines himself as she tilts her head at various angles like she's using ESP or like when people personify their dogs, an indictment of what happens when a woman agrees to share a scene with an actor/ star/ producer so intent on self promoting he forgets ""generosity""In fact everyone is so in love with the Hunt that even the copter clouds form love hearts and the only person not to is obviously just evil.Yes it's entertaining and takes itself incredibly seriously but if it has an iota of originality it might be memorable.

I loved seeing Rebecca Ferguson return from Rogue Nation, as well as Sean Harris, and Ving Rhames hasn't had this much screen time since MI3. Henry Cavill was a very welcome newcomer, bringing a brutal kind of power we hadn't really seen in the series yet. The sound design in particular really stood out this time around too, with most of the soundtrack having an ominous or somber tone, usually whenever it wasn't eerily silent. I selfishly hope this series goes on forever, but we all know Ethan Hunt has to retire sometime.

This movie is well-made, the scenes and cinematography are stellar and the scenes unfold with excellent pacing coupled with it's nostalgic score. But, behind it's cosmetic outline, lies a skeletal structure which has not changed much for most action films, which I find personally an issue for most action films.

467,jg_1977,May be the best one yet,8,28 July 2018,"Up until a week ago, I hadn't seen any of the MI movies, but after seeing the trailer for Fallout I decided to watch them all in short succession. I immediately fell in love with the series and couldn't wait to see the new one. It did not disappoint in any sense. Obviously all the movies are fresh in my mind, so I feel like I'm able to compare them fairly, and I can say safely that Fallout is my favorite. It delivers some amazing action, what I think the tightest and best told story yet, with some of the most wellrounded characters of the series. McQuarie clearly knows how to shoot and stage action, that was clear after Rogue Nation, but he's outdone himself with this one. Tom Cruise's stunts are excellent as per usual, but Henry Cavill has probably the best action sequence of the movie. The story in this entry is a little more reliant on the seeing the previous installments than the former movies have been, but is still accessible to everyone. That being said, the story is fast-paced, smart, and just flat out enjoyable, definitely surpassing most of the narratives that came before it. And finally, my favorite part of the movie was the characters, in Fallout, every main character gets a moment to shine and has evolved from their first appearance in a logical way. Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt is the most notable. His character starts the movie as his usual cocky and smart self but gets more desperate and driven as the plot unfolds. The side characters of Benji (Pegg), Luther (Rhames), and Ilsa (Ferguson) are all great in their own ways and have plenty to do. My biggest issue with the previous movies is they usually sideline all the secondary characters and don't give them much development, but that isn't the case here. The standout is of course newcomer August Walker (Cavill) who absolutely stole the show. He was the perfect foil to Hunt and got I think some of the coolest action beats. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series, or first time viewer, Fallout absolutely delivers something for everyone, and elevates the entire franchise. NOTE: even though you can still enjoy this movie without seeing the others, the emotional impact for quite a few scenes relies on having seen the previous installments, so I recommend doing that before seeing Fallout.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Tom Cruise is really unbelievably daring to have done the things he does in this best of series. I'm not surprised he broke an ankle, or whatever it was, doing one of the stunts here. But it all pays off like James Bond on steroids. And the director captures it in such a way that half the time I was gripping my armrest as if I was in danger and I haven't experienced that in years.What amazes me is that the supporting actors get it and are fully committed to join in on the fun. In another scene of impeccable execution, violence is perpetrated in such a harsh and unforgettable way, I was a little shocked anyone could film it with unnamed actors.All in all I was thoroughly entertained but a little sorry I hadn't seen this film the first day it was shown.

This is even more so the case when there is no overarching story (unlike Harry Potter, Marvel etc.), every new instalment met with eye-rolls and cries of ""another one?"" (think Die Hard, Fast and Furious and several horror franchises...). James Bond is an excellent example of a franchise that has avoided this, and now we have no choice but to admit Mission: Impossible films also do not fit this stereotype. On the contrary, aside from the lacklustre first two films, the Mission: Impossible films have improved with each entry. Honestly, I thought it would peak with Syndicate, but clearly writer/ director Christopher McQuarrie knows what he's doing, since Fallout is incredible - perhaps the best in the series.It may seem strange, but in these films their supposedly ""impossible"" missions often prove to be very ""possible."" Fallout, on the other hand, changes this; there are frequent moments where the mission goes wrong, making matters increasingly difficult and complicated. The scope and complexity is suitable for a mission that is said in the very title to be impossible. Not only is the adjective now applicable, but such a plot is much more engaging and enjoyable to watch; constantly fast-paced and rarely letting up, it's such an exciting ride which you can't necessarily predict. The stakes are high and it's so tense, particularly during the finale, that you can't tear your eyes away. Still, despite all this, it's not as impactful as it should be, since we all know deep down that it's going to end happily and Hunt will save the day - they're not bold enough to have an ending like another big blockbuster that came out earlier this year... Nevertheless, there are times where you find yourself questioning if they're going to come out of this on top, adding to the already immense excitement. On top of this, there are elements of the story that seem to reflect our fears today (terrorists, worries about nuclear weapons), but it never really capitalises on this, merely using it to frame the action and no more.As with most Mission: Impossible films, though, the excitement isn't really from the plot - it's from the action; and there's plenty of action to enjoy here with bold, incredible stunts that stand out. Though it may be a slow start compared to previous films Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation, it soon makes up for it, slowly immersing us in a non-stop thrill ride. Each fight is brilliantly choreographed and performed, every punch making an impact. You'll find yourself wincing throughout the entire film - especially the brutal bathroom fight. In fact, it's that scene in particular where you see various characters' fighting styles. Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill and Rebecca Ferguson all fight in different ways, adding diversity to each scene and making sure the fights are never stale or boring (a danger in films with lots of action). Fortunately, however, there's more to the exquisite action than just fights. As we've become used to in Mission: Impossible films there are multiple stunts that are a joy to watch. Whether it's jumping across the rooftops of London or trying to hijack a helicopter, this film rivals the climbing of the Burj Khalifa in Ghost Protocol.Another strength of Fallout is how it's more connected to the franchise than the other films. There's now a secure returning cast other than Tom Cruise, including Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson and even Michelle Monaghan (although it's a shame Jeremy Renner skipped out on this one). Pegg and Rhames bring some comedy and relief, although this aspect of their characters was underused. Whilst still not necessarily the most fleshed out of cinematic characters, they're lovable and give a stronger personality to the overall film. The female characters though are still the most underused. Ferguson's Ilsa Faust was without a doubt the best part of Rogue Nation and, along with Vanessa Kirby's White Widow, is one of the best parts of Fallout too. Yet again, Ferguson is an enigmatic bad-ass with a vulnerable side who commands every scene she's in, being a perfect female equivalent to Cruise's Hunt. Kirby plays a different kind of woman however; less reliant on her fighting abilities, she uses charm and beauty to get her way, but still carries a danger lurking beneath her performance.Newcomer Henry Cavill injects more charisma into this role than he does Superman in the DCEU and even fellow agent Solo in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Suave but obnoxious, we love to hate him - and any fight scene is all the better when he's there; when Sloane describes him as a ""hammer,"" she's not wrong. Sean Harris' Lane, on the other hand, is not as physically intimidating as Cavill, but his character continues in a similar vein from Rogue Nation; cold, calculating and full of malice, Harris' performance is sinister - though still can't beat Seymour Hoffman's antagonist in M:I 3. This is still Tom Cruise's film, however (as well as writer/ director Christopher McQuarrie's). Despite varying opinions on Tom Cruise as an actor, I personally like him and can't imagine anyone else as Ethan Hunt - who else could carry a franchise for six films and seemingly not even break a sweat? In fact, this is arguably Hunt's best portrayal yet, as Cruise delves deeper into his psyche, looking at how his job and actions affect others around him.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is continuing proof that the films in this franchise get better each time. Though it doesn't go much further than just a spy-action movie, it has a solid cast (both returning and new), breath-taking stunts, nail-biting action and a plot that will keep you invested throughout. Fallout stands out as one of the best in the series as well as the genre as a whole. I can't wait to accept the next mission...",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

473,chasemykleby,"Fallout keeps the trend going upwards, of course by getting bigger than the previous installment.",8,9 March 2019,"""Mission Impossible: Fallout"" Review
(8.5/10)I want to start by saying I've never really been a Mission Impossible fan, but Rouge Nation I thought was good and refreshing for the franchise, and Fallout keeps the trend going upwards, of course by getting bigger than the previous installment.
Fast paced, stylish and vastly entertaining, this is not only a reminder of how insane Tom Cruise's dedication to delivering big screen thrills is but also a prime example of how movies are originally meant to be watched on the big screen. Christopher McQuarrie makes Fallout feels a lot like the first Mission: Impossiblemovie than any other film in the franchise, but also cleverly takes everything good about the franchise and marinates it all into one movie.
The stunts, staged with vigor and a sharp eye for spatial balance by writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, grow wilder as Fallout goes on. And, admittedly, they're a hoot. Cruise brings a work ethic as solid as the movie's narrative ethic is hectic, generously and subtly conducting an outstanding supporting cast that includes M:I veterans Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin. Some of Fallout's most delicious scenes, though, feature Cruise and Vanessa Kirby, leaving behind her Princess Margaret persona from ""The Crown"" to play a fascinatingly saucy minx of indistinct motivation.
McQuarrie finally asks what sort of man keeps accepting those missions; what drives someone to put their life on the line again and again? For Hunt, the answer is simple. He can save people, and therefore he has a responsibility to act. For Cruise - and McQuarrie - it's an eternal quest to outdo the last effort. They're only making the next one difficult by succeeding this hard.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

475,roblesar99,The Most Impossible Mission Yet,9,4 August 2018,"97Quite frankly, the only thing I thought to myself as I walked out of the theater after seeing MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT was ""wow, I wish I could have seen that in IMAX."" Unfortunately, I live in a small rural town in a pretty rural state, which means that the closest IMAX theater is about an hour and fifteen minutes away - and I don't have a car. Furthermore, having rewatched all the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE films in the last few days, I just couldn't wait any longer. But I'm glad I finally saw FALLOUT because it truly is the best action film since MAD MAX: FURY ROAD. The film starts off with a bang - literally, and the first twenty minutes provide some of the darkest moments this series has had to offer. In these films, the world has been close to destruction time and time again, but writer-director Christopher McQuarrie establishes a much more genuine threat this time around, imbuing the film with a darker tone than any of its predecessors. And it works. The stakes are higher. The situations these characters find themselves are in much more intense. Their lives have never been in more danger.That's not to say that the film becomes too dour for its own good (after all, the great Simon Pegg is still around), but McQuarrie understands what he needs to do to keep the audience invested in a franchise that is still going strong over 20 years after the original's release. The setpieces in this film are absolutely jaw-dropping, from the bathroom fight in Paris to the helicopter chase in Kashmir and everything in between. McQuarrie truly elevates action filmmaking to the next level, seamlessly weaving action and story to create an astonishing final product - one that leaves every other MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE film in the dust. To think that Tom Cruise is still 56 years old and doing his own stunts is remarkable - the HALO jump over Paris had me breathless. McQuarrie recognizes what worked in ROGUE NATION and what didn't, and he makes sure to not end the film on an anti-climactic note. This might be the first MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE to actually peak at the end, rather than somewhere in the middle (the Langley heist, the Burj Khalifa sequence, the Morocco chase, etc.) Granted, the film shifts a bit more into the Bond and Bourne territory, with the spy hijinks (masks and crazy gadgets) taking a bit of a back seat, but this only leads to McQuarrie more effectively keeping us on our toes (the unveiling of a certain masked figure halfway through proved quite the surprise).Furthermore, everyone here gets a chance to shine, with Henry Cavill's Walker fitting right right in as the CIA agent tasked with keeping tabs on Ethan Hunt and Co. Rebecca Ferguson returns as well and for the better - Ilsa Faust remains the most dynamic female character in the series and it's not even close. Even Simon Pegg, who has mostly been relegated to providing tech support, gets his chance to put his fighting skills to the test in one of the film's many exhilarating action sequences. Sean Harris' Solomon Lane, the primary antagonist in ROGUE NATION, once again returns, and while I still think his plans are much more menacing than himself, Harris makes the most of his expanded role. It was a joy to see Michelle Monaghan back as Hunt's wife Julia as well, even if her screentime was less than I'd hoped it'd be. But as expected, the real star of the show here is Tom Cruise, who manages to ground the film with a clear moral compass. Cruise is clearly one of the best components of this series, pulling double-duty not only as an action star/stuntman, but as a dramatic actor (see: MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III's opening sequence). A lot of praise goes towards Cruise's stunts and rightly so, but this franchise needs wouldn't be the same without his acting chops.Additionally, not only did McQuarrie write and direct the most action-packed and tightly-plotted installment in this franchise thus far, he also assembled a stellar technical crew. Cinematographer Rob Hardy, whose work on Alex Garland's EX MACHINA and ANNIHILATION was one of best aspects of either film, truly makes FALLOUT a joy to watch, with crisp and texturally rich 35mm imagery that made me want to reach out and touch the screen. This is a stunning film, and the best-looking installment in the franchise by far (no small feat considering Oscar winner Robert Elswit shot both GHOST PROTOCOL and ROGUE NATION). Yes, Lorne Balfe score sounds a bit too much like Hans Zimmer's work on THE DARK KNIGHT trilogy, but that doesn't change the fact that it perfectly complements the film. In fact, I'm listening to it right now as I write this review. Editor Eddie Hamilton deserves praise as well - his clean and precise cutting infusing every chase and fistfight with a burst of adrenaline. Hamilton clearly understands the difficulty of the stunts required to make the action work and allows the audience to view them in all their glory.MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT is a astonishing picture that ranks not as the best in the franchise, but as one of the best action films ever. McQuarrie, Cruise, and the rest of the cast and crew poured their hearts and souls into this and it shows. This is heart-stopping, jaw-dropping entertainment.

485,Marc_Horrickan,Cruise and the Gang Keep the Show Very Much on the Road,8,16 September 2018,"Six outings in as Ethan Hunt and Tom Cruise may be beginning to look a little frayed around the edges, but the Mi franchise shows no signs of legginess. Since Ghost Protocol the Mi films have been the one truly pleasurable franchise, and a large part of this is down to the fact that Cruise and his constant collaborators seem to be having so much fun. The same mask play, absurd stunt sequences and moments of moral rectitude are all present. While the intensity of Hunt's apocalyptic paranoia escalates from film to film. In Sean Harris, Cruise has found an actor as dedicated to committed conspiratorial craziness as he is.Christopher McQuarrie is surely now Cruise's primary creative partner, as they continue a run of great action films, that has helped to resuscitate the career of a filmmaker who had lost his way since the brilliance of THE WAY OF THE GUN. Many of the Parisian sequences seemed reminiscent of that film, especially in its use of the narrow cramped spaces and tunneling boulevards of the French capital. The cast may be up to their same old tricks, with Rhames soulful Luther dispensing old school wisdom like a born-again Morgan Freeman, or Pegg's Benji still feeling like a fish out of water whilst 'in the field', but the Mi films have always been about formula and chemistry. With such a tight-knit team around him it seems unlikely that this will be Cruise's final outing as Hunt, even if there is a sense of resolution and homecoming in the film's frantic final fifteen minutes.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

It is a sequel to Rogue Nation, but I think this is a great stand alone movie for the casual MI viewer. I have never been so excited watching a movie before. The stunts were jaw-droppingly good! Tom Cruise must have cat DNA or something. I won't bother with the plot, it was good, but the action was like nothing I've ever seen before. I am buying this movie today!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
487,gregoryblanch88,Return to the Mission Impossible roots,8,15 November 2018,"Fallout is a welcome return to the elements that made the TV series and some of the movies icons of the twisty-plot-action-thriller genre. Fallout favours more dramatic tension and intimate action, ultimately with greater impact than some of the overblown stunts of the past. The exception is the end sequence which treats the protagonists' bodies as largely indestructible and gives us another cut-the-wire-with-1-second-left cliche.There are still plenty of great action set-pieces but plot twists that are actually believable are deployed to good effect. Why, there is even some character development, without going overboard of course. And naturally there's LOTS of Tom Cruise running (and running and running...) Looks like the director read the study that linked the success of MI movies to the amount of time Tom runs.Henry Cavil was OK as a bad guy, though a bit wooden. He needs a menacing smile to counterpoint his smouldering scowl.My challenge to the next movie, save the world with 5 minutes to spare and still make it dramatic.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

489,alvesmarceloalves-73751,Ethan Hunt getting better and better,9,16 August 2018,"Every franchise has its ups and downs. Some very good movies, some bad movies, some more or less. But Tom Cruise has provided us with a sequence of impossible missions ever better than the other.In fact, there is no mystery to creating the films of the serie. It's a killer cake recipe that mixes absurd scenes, twists in the script, betrayals, a simple story explained right away (almost always the good guy has to stop the villain in his attempt to dominate or destroy the world), some surprises and Tom Cruise defying death.And every movie your Ethan Hunt seems to be over the edge. This is how we want it. This is how we like it.The great mystery even of ""Mission Impossible"" is like the 56 year old actor has the breath and willingness to do so much exercise! In ""Fallout Effect"", Tom Cruise runs UNBELIEFLY for London with rooftop jumps, stars in an impressive chase scene in the streets of Paris, pilots a helicopter and suffers an accident that would kill anyone in Kashmir. And still fight with Superman! All this having to climb a mountain at the end to save a third of the planet. China, India and Pakistan are grateful for their dedication.No wonder Luther (Ving Rhames) says, ""This is my man!"" ""Fallout Effect"" is that classic spy story Hunt style. There is a traitor in the agency, you have to find a terrorist, you have to prevent plutonium bombs from killing humanity. In the midst of all this, there is the Syndicate, a group of terrorists who have been demobilized since the arrest of Solomon Lane (Sean Harris).The situation in Washington is also not very good. The IMF is questioned after Ethan lets out the plutonium warheads to save his friends Luther and Benji (Simon Pegg). Because of this, the CIA decides to put the stick on the table and say ""now it's my way"". Thus, they recruit the mustachioed agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) to be Hunt's shadow and act more assertively on the mission.From there the plot develops in that climate everyone distrusts everyone. Even more so after Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) comes full of mysteries saying she can not say anything, she can not say anything. ""But trust me."" Ilsa, this is a world of spies. You do not even trust the shade.""Mission Impossible: Fallout Effect"" is guaranteed fun and keeps the Ethan Hunt franchise alive. It remains to be seen how Tom Cruise will be able to take risks in ever more surreal scenes. Especially since each film seems to have to set new limits. Or keep the previous ones.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

491,nirome,How to make a great action flik,10,3 January 2019,"I'll cut right to the chase; '' This is the best action movie that's been released this year''. There are several reasons for this:
* Well written albeit not very original script.
* Competent acting.
* And above all, as per usual in the Mission Impossible series, outstanding action set pieces.
I could go on forever enumerating the virtues of this movie but without boring you, I'll just say that this is what you have to do to make a great action movie. No shaky cam work, no fast lightning editing where you cannot get a grasp of the geography or in short, what the hell is going on and most importantly, a WELL WRITTEN script. Is that to much to ask for?.
Take notes, Michael Bay.
And in this movie, more than in any other in the series, we get a glimpse into the psyche of its main character. A clearly aging and emotionally exhausted Ethan Hunt, must contend, once again, with a conspiracy to deploy three nuclear weapons, that it's filled to the brim with twists, turns and all manner of double crossings coming from all directions in the form of former allies and enemies. We get a sense that Tom Cruise's character is beginning to get tired of his line of work and in some instances, the restroom fistfight, he's being physically outmatched by his foe. Some old ground is retread and Hunt still comes out on top, but we get a sense that it's getting more and more difficult to get there. That gives his character a much needed vulnerability in the action genre.
The secondary characters do a solid supporting job, especially a particularly nasty and brutal Henry Cavill.
The set pieces are superb. The Halo jump takes the cake. This IMAX one shot aerial sequence is superbly done and really pushes the envelope when it comes to action set pieces of this kind.
The restroom fistfight, the motorcycle chase throughout Paris, the foot chase scene, where Cruise injured himself and the helicopter chase and final fight hanging from a cliff between Cavill and Cruise are the stand out set pieces of the movie.

492,doctord-1,Mission: Statement,2,20 June 2020,"There was a time Tom Cruise seemed destined for Hollywood royalty. But that ended with a string - a huge, long string of money chomping box office franchises, most notably Mission: Impossible. Apparently Tom looks for no other roles. His career has become a Huge cliche. But hey, there is a new Top Gun around the corner to break up the monotony. It's time for him to reflect like Jerry Maguire at the start of that film and ask himself, why am I here?",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Seems like the movie went through a checklist of every possible location to have an action driven scene! In the suburbs of Paris, in a bathroom, in a helicopter, in mountains, etc!The movie also spends so much time explaining the backstory. Its already the 6th movie, most of the audience were not even born when the first movie was released. So stop spending so much time standing and explaining the backstory. The whole concept is already messy, no need to contribute more!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
494,darryl-42069,The best Mission: Impossible yet,10,1 August 2018,"Six. It's been six Mission: Impossible movies since it's first movie came in 1996. In Hollywood, usually, the series at this point will worn out and overstayed their welcome. A third movie in a franchise usually struggles to keep it's content fresh and exciting, let alone six. ""Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers"" and ""Freddy's Dead"" (aka ""A Nightmare on Elm's Street 6"") are among those horrible sixth movies, but movies such as ""Fast and Furious 6"" and ""Harry Potter 6"" (also known as Half Blood Prince), manages to break the mold and presents a solid sixth entry in their respective franchises.And thankfully, and rightfully so, ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" joins the likes of ""Fast and Furious 6"" and ""Harry Potter 6"" as one of the best sixth movie in a franchise. From director/writer Christopher McQuarrie, who also made ""Rogue Nation"", this is by far the most insane M:I movie yet, and might be the best M:I movie to date.Pros:
CastTom Cruise... he's still got it. The good old Ethan Hunt is back, and Tom did such a great job portraying him. He's charming, he's nuts and he's got a great sense of humor. Henry Cavill is great as August Walker. He's menacing, he's dangerous and a great rival to Ethan (and oh boi his mustache...). Ving Rhames is back as the good old Luther Stickell, and he did a incredible job. He's witty, he's charismatic, and I just love his character. Simon Pegg did a fantastic job as fan-favorite Benji Dunn. He's incredibly funny and I like how he did alot more physical stuff in this movie. Rebecca Ferguson also did a great job as the mysterious Ilsa Faust. Alec Baldwin is also great as IMF Secretary Alan Hunley. Sean Harris also did a great job as the menacing Solomon Lane. Michelle Monaghan makes a return as Ethan's wife Julia, and she did a good job. Angela Bassett did a good job as T'challa's mo-I mean CIA Director Erika Sloane. Lastly, I liked Vanessa Kirby as White Widow. She had a great backstory and background, that I would love to explore more should a seventh movie is in production.StoryThis is by far the most complex Mission: Impossible stories to date, but writer/director Christopher McQuarrie made the story very easy to digest and understand. It's also tied up to previous Mission: Impossible entries, and that's a nice touch. The fact that the movie takes time to flesh out some of the characters even more, in particular Ethan, is also a plus in my book.Action scenesI swear, Tom Cruise is a real life Superman. Actors these days would do a stunt double for an action set piece this crazy, but Tom being Tom insisted that he does his own stunts, and it all payed off! The result is a fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled action, that's also real. No CGI nonsense, it's just Tom doing action scenes, on a real vehicle, doing real dangerous stunts. Just give him an honorary Oscar please. Major props also need to be given to Christopher McQuarrie. He knows how to make an action scene brutal, intense, and fun to watch. From the HALO jump sequence, to the bathroom fight scene, to a motorcycle chase, to a chase scene on foot, to the climatic helicopter fight scene, all of these were shot and directed beautifully.MusicThe music is wonderful, intense and great. Lorne Balfe did a fantastic job for this movie. This is possibly the best MI soundtrack I've ever heard since Ghost Protocol. The MI theme in this movie might have beaten Michael Giachinno's MI theme in Ghost Protocol as my personal favorite MI theme of all time!CinematographyAlong with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, this is one of the best looking movies I've ever seen all year. Stunning wide shots, with great looking scenery. The action scenes were shot incredibly well, using wide shots, and zero shakey cams. The camerawork on the helicopter sequence is incredibly well done, with cameras inside and outside of the helicopter, to great effect.PacingThe pacing in this movie is just perfect. They just go full throttle! There's no time to breath and relax, because the action scenes are coming one after another, like very fast. When you want to like take a break, the movie just kinda don't let you, it's like the movie tried to make you pass out due to the neverending tension.
Cons:
Honestly, I've been thinking hard about what I hate about this movie, and honestly there's nothing wrong with this movie, there's nothing I hate in this movie, the entire movie is great. The pros outweighs the (almost non-existent) cons. If there's one thing I hate about this movie, it would be the lack of Jeremy Renner as William Brandt (I already missed that guy. Not appeared in Infinity War, and now this? Why?!), also I wish the movie could be longer (because boy time flies really fast). Oh, and in one particular scene it should be more impactful and sad, But since this is my personal preference, it wouldn't affect my rating whatsoever.Other than my otherwise personal nitpick, ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is simply one of the best, if not the best action movie of this summer. With a great storyline, terrific acting and mind-blowing action scenes, this is easily one of the best movies of 2018 so far, and might be the one that finally took down ""Ghost Protocol"" as the best MI movie to date. If there's a seventh installment, I'll definitely on board.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
495,Simarium,Mission: Impossible Fallout,6,2 August 2018,"Nice Mission Impossible film, but nothing particularly groundbreaking or interesting.

The result is, well, meh - but I appreciate the effort.Everybody talks in three word sentences for some reason - 'take it off', 'shut it down', 'never doubted you' because anything more would likely be too much for the prospective 8 year old audience to handle?",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
497,eden-rabatsch,Tom Cruise: sinew and star hunger powers the best action film of the year,9,3 August 2018,"This is an action film which goes for 2 and a half hours. It makes no sense at all. It borders on ludicrous as evidenced by the nightclub scene and yet it may be the most fun you have all year at the movies.McQuarrie is so judicious in his direction. At all times, you know where the sight lines are, what is being framed, who is shooting who. It doesn't seem like much but married with concrete stunt work rather then CGI, the whole film seems so solid. Almost from a different era.Then there is Tom Cruise. He is just a force of nature. Is it possible to divorce him from Ethan Hunt? The first Mission Impossible was made in 1996...22 years ago. This is more supernatural then The Mummy - basically a combination of sinew and star ambition knits his body together.The mustache of Henry Cavill has its cameo taking the film to an 11. This is a much needed injection of testosterone to leaven the formula and you can see Cavill relish a non Superman role. However, it is again Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust who steals every scene. The rest of the ensemble are great and all do their part especially Sean Harris who I would pay to hear him malevolently read my shopping list.Action pieces interspersed with character moments - it is all you can ask for in a summer blockbuster.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
498,TheDreadedChampion2019,MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 6,8,14 February 2019,"I Really enjoyed this one. The thing that stands out the most is the stunts and set pieces and way it's all beautifully shot and staged. Where it lacks is the script, which isn't bad, but does include some plot holes (The white widow and Ilsa's supposed conflict, introduced, then never followed through..for instance). Take the opening scene in Berlin. It gets the job done, its sets up the central conflict. Yet the logic of that all happening like that is silly when you really think about it. Ethan Hunt will risk the entire world to save his friend... And then you look at the back and forth dialogue between Ethan, Benji, and Luther that happens before that in the setup of the scene. I get it. I get what they're going for. We're feeling the characters, we're with them in that moment, But its like they wrote all that on the spot and used the first take...The script is serviceable. It's really a very simple plot. 3 Plutonium cores are set loose and the IMF is tasked with tracking them down...Ethan Hunt must then deal with ""the fallout of all his good intentions"" as Solomon Lane so eloquently puts it. The execution of this plot is shaky at times. Whereas GHOST PROTOCOL was a slicker more straightforward version of this one, FALLOUT in its ambition to be better, has a few more patchy spots and plot holes showing where you can tell they were making this all up as they went along. Still, it gets the job done in the end, pretty slickly all things considered... FALLOUT can definitely be considered as ""The Epic"" of The Mission movies. It just feels big. Its the longest runtime, It has the most ambitious stunts staged yet (Tom Cruise climbing up into a helicopter and dangling off of the side, The HALO jump sequence), and it boasts that classy old school feel that all epics do... As I Said before, It's really a more complex yet messy version of GHOST PROTOCOL. The IMF team is trying to prevent nuclear war again (in Ghost it was missiles, here its plutonium cores.) And Once again. Ethan's wife plays an important part in the emotional drive of the story...And at a crucial point in both stories, the team is cut off from all backup and support and forced to go at it alone....Both films achieve as entertainment, but I think Fallout is more ambitious and gives you more, while Ghost Protocol is tighter and maybe more straightforward and easily accessible...It was unexpected but good to see Michelle Monaghan back as Julia. Her brief cameo at the end of Ghost was a nice little surprise twist and seemed a good sendoff to her character. But here she is brought back again, but for a more fleshed out and satisfying closure that I believe is justified. Michelle Monaghan has an easy likable presence on screen and her return should be a treat for long time fans...In FALLOUT Ving Rhames get the most significant amount of screen time and importance to the story that he ever has in any of the films. Which is long overdue. There's nice little appropriate bursts of Simon Pegg throughout as well. Vanessa Kirby is a scene stealer as The White Widow, thanks to the brilliant writing of Chris McQuarrie and the beautiful way in which she is lit. You are left wanting more of her by the end of the film...Henry Cavill makes for a great villain. Finally A baddie that can go toe to toe and throw down with Ethan, give him a run for his money...Ilssa Faust, played perfectly by Rebecca Ferguson, in my opinion is the best thing to happen to the series and completely owned ROGUE NATION. She's back again and her arc is my only significant gripe with the movie. It feels too much a retread of her story in the last one. You are once again left to wonder who's side she's on and everything that happened in ROGUE to progress her character is undone and she is back where she was in the last film. She's still great in the part and overall her story ends up being satisfying by the end, but I couldn't help but notice that..The score by Lorne Balfe, I wasn't sold when I first heard it. I liked the percussive opening and certain motifs but I felt it wasn't memorable and sounded like they couldn't afford Hans Zimmer and hired this dude. But my opinion has changed since then and I think he did pretty well. Although its probably still my least favorite Mission score overall...Chris McQuarrie is great at writing these characters. He also shines in directing action. There is clarity in the geography and in what's going on. There are some breathtaking shots throughout. This may be the best looking Mission...Overall it looks great, the action is insane, there are plenty of twists and turns, and it entertains and thrills you as a film like this should. I really liked it. I really like the relationship and dynamic between Ethan and Ilssa. I Hope it continues to develop because its the most interesting thing about this series at this point in its run...Can't wait for the next one!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

I really love how well the film just fits its title, as the way the action and plot flows within the film, the amount of luck and the degree of confidence and intuition Ethan Hunt executes really does make you sit back and say ""God damn, that is Impossible!""

503,danren121,More of the same please,9,4 August 2018,The great thing about Mission Impossible films is that they are like cinematic Jenga; there is the build up to an action scene where the building blocks are carefully put in place and then down tumbles everything in a frenzied action sequence and so the structure quickly begins again barely giving one time to catch their breath.

504,michaeltong-29180,Clusterbomb,6,8 November 2018,"I'm surprised by how much of a mess this film was. Rogue Nation was practically a perfect Mission Impossible that had both great espionage intrigue and grounded action scenes, but Fallout is just all high-wire stunts.There are a few good moments with telegraphed clever twists, but it doesn't have an interesting and cohesive mission with fun heists or ops. It's mostly non-stop action, some of which, like the helicopter chase at the end of the film, is so over the top it breaks immersion.The tone can be inconsistent at times too. Rogue Nation did a great job a juggling the comedy with the drama, but in Fallout the transitions between the two are jaw-droppingly awkward.I was hopeful that Henry Cavill would be a cool character, but he actually has very little to do and doesn't really live up to the promise of a strong and equally capable foe.Overall I was fairly disappointed and would rank this MI among the worst of the franchise, possibly below MI3.If you like the Mission Impossible franchise there are enjoyable elements, but I'd caution against expecting a masterpiece like Rogue Nation. Heck, I dare say that MI2, with all its camp and John Woo silliness, is better than Fallout.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
505,davidvpcol,"So good, it's hard to say this:",9,6 August 2018,"When you write reviews, you always aim for neutrality, stay away from your own emotions in order to write unbiased and earn credibility, but when what you review is so good, so perfect, so exciting and emotional, you just cannot remain untouched. This movie got me thinking all 2 hours how would it develop, but I never got it right, this takes you in a roller coaster of emotions and action that you will really really get out of the Theater with a smile. Most people hate Tom Cruise because of his religion, in fact Hollywood hates him (we only see him in movies he produce, no other studie hires him), but you gotta admit, Tom Cruise is the best actor you will ever see in a film. I really don't know if the serie must go on, because this movie is so perfect!! Is the ultimate jewl of the crown, I am afraid a 7th movie won't be as good as this one, because this Fallout is just unsurpassable. This movie opens so many doors, but I don't know if the franchise should choose one at all. I didn't believe the news when reported this movie as best action film of all times, but now I know, it truly is. I seriously doubt we would see any other movie like this, ever. Finally, to fully enjoy this movie, I strongly recommend to watch the #5 film first, which is not as good as this one, but gives you background.

The perfectionism in even what seems to be a simple car chase at first is what makes it so great, thrilling and believable. Nobody takes any shortcuts here and all the crazy action scenes are well complimented with good writing and flawless acting.
Its action cinema at its best and the quality reminds me at the very best Bond movies or the early Jason Bourne movies. A movie that leaves you satified, because you know you have witnessed a rare talent displaying his full arsenal.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
516,tom-43722,Tom Cruise has still got it,7,17 August 2018,"At 56 years of age, Tom Cruise is still showing no signs of slowing down. Whether he's throwing himself out of windows, clinging to the underside of a helicopter or climbing a sheer rock face, he still thrives on stunts and adrenaline rushes as much as he did when he started this series 22 years ago. On top of that, he has proven himself to be a capable actor as well as a great stuntman. I noticed this when Ethan was talking to his ex-wife's new husband and he just made up an alias on the spot. Tom Cruise has a reputation for playing characters that are similar - Ethan Hunt, Jack Reacher, William Cage (although the latter character differentiates himself from Reacher and Hunt by starting as a coward) - and because of that I was kind of expecting him to just be Tom Cruise but I underestimated him. He interacted with Julia's new husband in a way that made Ethan seem comfortable in the guy's presence, despite having only just received a double whammy by learning Julia was there and that she'd gotten remarried. That scene was enough to show me that Cruise is more than just a crazy thrill seeker. I'm not a Mission Impossible fan or even a particularly big Tom Cruise fan so I just went into this movie expecting action, gun fights, car and motorbike chases and Cruise doing potentially life threatening stunts. We get plenty of that, which I think is all anyone really wants out of these movies, but Cruise goes that extra mile to actually make a decent movie in general rather than one that relies solely on the action scenes and his willingness to put himself in danger. The guy is clearly very passionate and devoted to this series and doesn't let the effects of middle age interfere with his work.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Tom Cruise definitely still has a lot left in the tank and so do the rest of the magnificent cast. There just seems to be one thing after another in the film, and you are never bored.

523,mtrburrows,Great action anddd...that's it,5,5 August 2018,"The Mission Impossible movies have been renowned for their thrilling and original action set pieces, so how does this one stack up against the others? Fallout delivers some fun moment but ultimately nothing I haven't seen before, a franchise that has hung tom cruise out of planes and had him spider up walls is now only concerned with regular foot chases and car chases. As said before, the action entertains in the moment but if I were to go back to any Mission Impossible movie I know it wouldn't be this one, as not only is the action less inspired but the story is too, with out of nowhere character moments, and a cliché diffuse the bomb story, and a predictable secret agent betrayal, the story had me snoozing and just checking my watch hoping it would end soon. The actors are passable, although it seems they're not giving it their all like they have before, Henry Cavill and Simon Pegg give particularly questionable performances. Combine that with bog standard cliché dialogue that had me rolling my eyes at times, and comedy that really didn't land (we're seriously still doing the ""character doesn't notice something going on outside the window"" gag?), and I feel the movie really isn't worth sitting through for the action sequences (which were well shot might I add) and score. Tom Cruise is still a legend for everything he puts on the line to make his action scenes believable, but he deserves better material to work with.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
524,ahsawesa,Formulaic But It Will Get Adrenaline Pumping Through You,7,16 September 2018,"First of all, the prosHats off to Tom Cruise. This guy is nearly a senior citizen and he's still performing some of the most mind blowing and difficult stunts in the Hollywood by his own self.This is only Chris McQuarrie third DIRECTED film but he's proven himself to be capable. Especially with action sequences.This film has several long action sequences, chases, gunfights, fist fights and they're all FREAKING AWESOME. The action scenes are coherent and they look plus feel very real. Especially THE BATHROOM FIGHT scene. The fight choreography in that scene was fantastic. It had me salivating for more hand to hand fights.What I love the most is that there weren't any boring parts. Chris McQuarrie knows very well how to incorporate amazing action scenes with the plot so that they won't feel forced and the story will flow well without feeling like action filled fan service.The theme is amazing as always. Had me humming it after I finished the film. Really well used in the scenes where it's supposed to play and get the adrenaline flowing through you.The theme is amazing as always. Had me humming it after I finished the film. Really well used in the scenes where it's supposed to play and get the ADRENALINE flowing through you.for the consThe whole film does feel ""Been there and done that""Lack of risk taking makes it feel same old same oldThis film had plenty of opportunities to explore the character of Ethan Hunt in depth but instead it trades the opportunities for the same old ""Ethan Hunt is charming.My biggest issue? EXPOSITION. It took a very SPOON FEEDING approach. It was constantly reminding plot points. Over explaining stuff too directly instead of being subtle. Characters blatantly asking other characters what certain things mean so they would get a chance to explain it to us. The audience.The comedy didn't work in this one. Mission Impossible 4 had some great comedy with Benji And Ethan. This one? Awkward jokes and quips that don't really hit the spot. Please, don't become Joss Whedon. This film should be above cringe comedy.Another major issue. The story itself. It goes from A to B to C to D just the way we have known. It follows the FORMULAIC approach, the pattern of its previous films without really trying anything new.It makes up for that with amazing action sequences but over abundance of action sequences may burn some audience members out. I think LESS is MORE. MI 4 had only a handful of big stunts like the Burj Khalifa scene yet each one of them counted.Henry Cavill is intimidating. He LOOKS great. But I feel like he suits kind, innocent, straight forward and clean cut roles more. His acting here could have been better. He didn't come off as clever, experienced side kick he was supposed to feel like.Fall Out is an unnecessary addition to the franchise. It didn't add much to the over arching story. It was entertaining. Don't get me wrong but it didn't go into UNCHARTED TERRITORY and explore new ideas or character dynamics.It was AWESOME and THRILLING as heck BUT it was quite CLICHED and didn't bring anything really new to the tableIf you like action films and MI series, you will love it.I liked it and it had me pumped but I'd say Ghost Protocol and even Rogue Nation were better than this one.I'd say go watch it because there aren't a lot of decent action films out there these days and this is a pretty decent oneOnce again, props to the cast and all of the stunt people too.Final Rating 7.2/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Acting is spot on, camera work on point, settings on point, story is good... I say good because that's where my only real critique comes in; the typical M:I twists and turns are a bit too predictable in this installment. Rogue Nation was a bit smarter story wise and I felt that Fallout stretched the story a bit too much... 2,5 hours for an action movie is long. Because of that I rate Fallout a bit lower than Rogue Nation, but that doesn't take anything away from the fact that this movie is absolutely one of the best action movies in 2018.I highly recommend anybody to watch this movie, a guaranteed well spent evening.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The movie has so many great moments. I also don't understand how some are saying the plot is dumb, how? Maybe im the dumb one for thinking its incredibly smart... The action is heart pounding at a breakneck pace. The storyline is tight as every moment is important. Lets just say there will never be the right moment to go to the bathroom. If you do, you wont be able to ask what you missed because you'll miss something else in the meantime. I wont say much as nothing should be ruined when you see this movie. All i will say is this is the most human you have ever seen Ethan Hunt. Tom Cruise is fantastic in this movie along with all of the cast. There's a lot of heart, and i think that is the first time i have used that term for a MI movie.

When the three main stars, Cruise, Rames and Pegg are together for the first time, you expect one of them to say, ""I'm too old for this sh*&%."" while you privately agree with them, but from then on you are carried away by the show, some excellent scenes, some relatively interesting (but not too deep) moral choices. I laughed frequently, but with it not at it I think, because it carries you with it through ridiculousness; with fabulous action scenes, beautiful relevant shots of various cities (Paris, London) and Kashmir also, lots of plot surprises, not spoiled by my having predicted one of them early on; good cameos from Alec Baldwin and decent playing from Rebecca Ferguson, Henry Cavill and the rest of the cast. 7 out of 10.

535,warvignesh16,How best to call it the best!,10,22 December 2019,"I've seen the film three times; the first time being I wasn't able to make out its significance and thus I went with the conclusion of it being the extended version of the prequel. Then I decided to watch it the second time and it was then I became quite keen, indeed obsessed to watch it again on the BluRay version. That's is when I figured it's magnificence.In my personal opinion, the musical score is the best ever after Mission Impossible 2 composer Hans Zimmer's score. I felt that throughout the film the composer Lorne Balfe has done an enormously terrific job. If I might add ""The noise of the musical score was louder than the stunts.""The director Christopher McQuarrie has written and executed a terrific script, he's got his tone mixed up in it. The storyline was written complex. He's done certain callbacks to previous Mission Impossible films, and they are like ""under the surface,"" which means I won't know it if I haven't watched the previous ones. That's the genius of this writer and director.The cinematography was unique compared to the other films cameras being placed and shot from vast angles. Especially during the last stunt sequence between Tom and Henry. The London chase over the roof, and the scene where they break Lane out of Prison.Henry Cavill is the ideal person for the role of John Lark and he's got his own version of being an antagonist. Especially being a Dark tone, the scene in the cave in London when he turns around and goes ""Do you?""
That last stunt sequence on the mountains of New Zealand.And I won't have to applaud Tom, for he is indeed the guy who made me follow the franchise and I wager this is the best since Ghost Protocol.His absence from the world stage has had unintended consequences
His syndicate of rogue covert operatives continues to wreak havoc around the globe.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The sixth MI movie is a big exception to that: it shows a large number of next level and thrilling action sequences as part of a twisting but consistent story line with good acting.Actions are mostly shot without the silly use of blue/green background screens. 
The story line is consistent without far reached twists. Serious stuff is brought in balance with humour without the usual overacting as can be seen in lots of current movies.
Finally, the sceneries are cleverly chosen and will not disappoint you. Whether it concerns the mountain sceneries, Paris , London and other recognisable places.Go and see!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

540,hakrames,By far the best Mission Impossible film to date,9,28 July 2018,"Mission Impossible: Fallout, Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, starring Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, and a bunch of other fantastic actors. And this film follows the M.I. Crew as after a mission goes wrong, they set out to correct it and save the world yet again in by far the biggest production and biggest M.I. Film to date. Let's talk about acting first of all, not a single weak link in acting at all. Even with the writing of the characters, not a single character feels out of place or just there to have a big name in it. Cavill in this film though gives my favorite performance. Alongside a bunch of other characters as well. Even in the various action sequences they're a part of is just amazing for all of them. I haven't seen a film like this in a long time that properly used every character in it to their fullest potential and not feel off or just too perfect. Now the action, oh my god, there was so much amazing and nail biting sequences in this film that I'm still processing it. Each sequence in the film felt so original and fresh and so realistic. Like each punch and kick and swing in this film I felt to its fullest potential and it worked so so well in it. Especially the now famous helicopter scene in it, that scene could've been the whole movie and I wouldn't have complained one bit about it. That scene was so intense and felt so gritty and realistic that it reminded me directly of the sequences from Mad Max in it. The story is equally as impressive in this film with the twisting of some rested storylines that have come up in previous films and this film is also the first film in the series that feels like it flows smoothly into the next film as well. Coming right off of rogue nation right into fallout and felt like one continuous story which is so nice to see from these stand alone films that are somehow connected. The story did feel very fresh as well even though it is a storyline that we have seen before in a M.I. movie. With practically no complaints with this film and not a single flaw in sight. I highly recommend seeing this film for it being one of the best action films in years with every shot and sequence just flowing so smoothly and consistently keeping the audience on their toes.

The ONLY thing that carries this movie is the action that is pretty well done. Other than that - the performances are unbearable and the plot is ... well, I am not even sure there is was a plot. Tom Cruise has no lines - the only arch in his character is that he is sorry. He is sorry in English, in broken French, with painful facial expressions, grunt and sighs and so on. That is the only emotion his character communicates. This movie is just as awkward and barely held together as the press tour with its main actors.

548,collinsenosh,A Brilliant Typical Spy Movie,5,28 July 2018,"A Restless hero with a crew consists of a master technician, a computer genius and a badass female co-spy.A moral villan who speaks in quotes and thinks he is a necessary evil. Who accompanied by a beefy second villain to fight with the hero in the climax.A dispute between the various spy agencies and an always chasing domestic police which is French. Not to mention the fight for authority. A sacrificial haed of the agency. Poor Alec Baldwin.A meeting, the imposter face printing machine, convoy, abduction and the two hours to go timeline.A lead who can sprint endlessly and jumping buildings, a magnificent high altitude scene, a fight with the over powering second villain.At last the world is saved by Ethan Hunt.It's like every other MI movies. Did I miss anything?
But the screenplay is where they win us over. Bits and pieces of elements of surprises make us go wooooo hooooo. Even though it's predictable yet still feel fresh by the way it was shown.
The usual crew who has every bit of charm that need for us to love them. There is enough we already know about them. I absolutely love Tom Cruises facial expressions when the other people thinks his actions ridiculous or crazy.Swapped Clarke Kent instead of Clint Barton. Henry Cavill is the new addition which was well suited and cool in a way.
Gave the Superman hype here and there but ended up as Harvey Dent atlast. Half burnt face and death by falling from heights.Rebecca Ferguson melted my heart on multiple occasions (crazy for badass women). As usual Simon Pegg is the fun factor who made the audiences laugh.I like Sean Harris as Solomon Lane. Calm and collected. Did his part flawlessly. A genuine type of character.
Lorne Balfe did some things with brilliance. I had to mention it. It added so much to the movie. I liked the way he played with the original theme.Also I loved the minimalistic & occasional mutes during some fight scenes especially in the bathroom scene. Noiseless rendition made it seem like they were fighting genuinely.
Pure action with some breath-taking stunts which makes the movie so unique. Obviously it will be lot easier when you get an adrenalin junkie like Tom Cruise as the lead.Car & Bike chase scenes were awesome. Ethan spent a hell lot of time in the automobiles.They corporated everything with previous Ethan Hunt's experiences in the movie like hiking a mountain as showed in the start of the second movie.We too will get the question when Henry asks Ethan ""Will you ever not die?""",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

But was equal or better than the hype? Not even close. It did effectively create a situation that caused our main hero have to make a decision that was plausible and a situation that many people in real life must make. But at the same time there was a feeling of 'we knew that it wasn't going to happen' throughout the movie. Defeating the credibility of the movie. Out of all the Mission Impossible sequels I enjoyed this one the best but it still feel into the sequel tropes and the directors decided to make the action and 'intensity' of the movie the forefront of the movie instead of storyline and character development, which in the end would have made this movie epic. The 'enemy' of this movie was one dimensional at best, and if we are honest with each other, then we would admit that the 'enemy' definitively is the equal of the protagonist, if not their superior.

Maybe others could take note. The film was tight, reasonably well written with the exception of a couple forced trite lines. The action sequences are great, whether a car/bike/helicopter/foot chase or fight scene, everything is suspenseful and entertaining. The females were all strong characters and integral to the plot line. Ethan, like our 007, is starting to question himself and is showing a human side.

555,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,Cruise and McQuarrie return with fresh grit and excellence that leaves me wanting more from the duo,8,24 July 2018,"Fallout feels like a direct sequel to Rogue Nation, even though it doesn't take place immediately after in the timeline (based on some dialogue I believe it to be two years later). But a lot of things remained consistent: we finally kept a director around (I'll get to that later) and many of the characters have returned, including one Solomon Lane (played by Sean Harris) with more villainy than ever before. In the past, we would cruise through team members such as Maggie Q, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Paula Patton, and heck even Jeremy Renner who was not in this flick... but we have grown into others like Ving Rhames (whose character wasn't just there to look cool and throw in some one-liners, but rather to shed some actual emotional weight), Simon Pegg (who has finally earned my respect ""in the field"" where I feel he now officially belongs), flashes of Michelle Monaghan (the Jules factor!) and newcomers Alec Baldwin (underused again) and Rebecca Ferguson (dayum is all I have to say). Yes, they threw in some new characters in this film... I'd say one too many for me to keep track of... but they didn't interfere too much with the chemistry already in place with the other actors/actresses surrounding Tom Cruise and the bigger picture. I'm a bit iffy on Henry Cavill's character still, as he felt a bit out of place from the franchise we've been accustomed to, but he did work in this film as did his mustache. Even still, I think this movie demands a re-watch on my end to understand all of the character motivations again, particularly three of them. All told it does feel like a sequel to RN in the sense that you should not see this one if you don't see that one. I think it is enough of a companion to make 3-6 part of a larger something when all watched together, even though 4 is only loosely connected at this point from a story perspective. In terms of feel however, it is not like any of the other M:I films before it. Instead of going for sleek and stylish, they chose raw and gritty in more ways than one. It really had its dark and serious moments, even played by the score through the opening credits (which I had to close my eyes for because they tend to spoil movie moments lol) demonstrating it would carry more epic impact than normal. Sometimes it delivered on that, and other times I think its reach exceeded its grasp, but ultimately you would feel it. It still had light humor time-to-time, but this was not a light-toned film in the slightest. I don't know if ""grounded"" is the right way to describe the film's attitude (because any time it is literally off the ground it is quite ridiculous as far as action films like to go!), but any time that it is on the ground everything is pretty simple. This film isn't built around stealth and technology; in fact, outside of masks and GPS-tracking (and some thing reading off a mission), I honestly couldn't name a single piece of technology that was more advanced than that in this entire film (EDIT: I thought of one more thing but it really won't wow you, and you probably won't even think of what I'm talking about after seeing it). Outside of some of the camera work, it definitely had a throwback feel to it, pulling the reins a lot but not in a forced way. This one just didn't call for a lot of futuristic technology.The action this time around really was all about chases, gunplay and hand combat. I mean if you like hand combat, then you'll really have fun with 2-3 particular scenes in this movie. This is all good and great for an action movie, but good enough for Mission: Impossible? Because of the characters involved, YES. Outside of one of the beginning set-pieces, every action scene in this movie is heavily built up and driven by the story around it, and felt like the story's impact of the moment was always bigger than the stunts being pulled off. This is a good thing, but that also means it's not all surface-level entertainment. You could pop in your Blu-ray of any of the previous three M:I films and watch an action sequence and just go: ""Hell yeah."" In this film, each moment is earned a little more as the story progresses, and they are very character-focused moments. I can't say it really compares to the other films in terms of action, but it worked. At one point I think it got a hair too ridiculous, but I was on board because of the situation at hand. This doesn't really have the summer blockbuster tag that the last two felt like they did, though. I can see some high schoolers not understand the progression of this franchise and walk out going: ""That was stupid and boring."" Go watch Transformers, little ones.Now it's time to sing some serious praises for two individuals. The first one is writer/director Christopher McQuarrie. Given the state of this franchise, they found the right person to steer the ship. Even in the middle of this 2.5-hour-long film when the action feels a bit bogged down and mundane from something you'd expect out of M:I, McQuarrie does enough for it to still feel different. Many scenes are shot so practically, the music is always original, tongue-in-cheek moments are injected without taking you out of the scenes, and you're always exploring the space around you so that nothing is ever too stationary. There is one action setting that didn't work for me at all and I honestly don't know what was going on, but it dynamically moved away from there fast enough and continued on to the next immediate action moment that all was forgiven and I was caught up to speed again. He understands the characters so you're not left with thinking they're making irrational decisions, and he understands how to showcase his stars so they can give him all that they have to offer. He captures it in a nice wide frame and only cuts when he has to. Sometimes he mutes the score for the sound effects, and there is this one really awesome moment where he drowns the sound effects from the score and it works so perfectly. If there is another film, I expect him to stay a part of the team.The next person is Tom Cruise. Good. Lord. This guy is the reason we watch these movies. Talk about a guy giving it his all. Stunts in previous films may have had the panache that sells you watching the trailer, but I can tell you first-hand that nothing is as demanding as what he went through doing some of his stunts this time around. This guy doesn't age! When I say that, I mean he literally looks younger in this film than he did in Rogue Nation or Ghost Protocol! This dude shows you what it means to sprint, and his abilities handling a weapon, riding a motorcycle, now doing things off the ground (which means more than one thing really), and everything else just makes the action that much more convincing. You don't have to have CGI, green screen, stunt doubles, or quick-cuts to try and convince you otherwise (I'm looking at you, Taken 3). It's only unfortunately that you're actually taken out for a moment only to sit back and say: ""Holy ****, Tom Cruise is actually doing that in front of our eyes."" Kudos to what he does, and apparently it is worth every penny of everybody watching it as well. He will break bones for us to make this happen, and it really is a delight. He is an ageless wonder, and I can't wait to see what he is willing to do for us next! I just hope he makes it out the other side each time.I'll admit I was a little shook with how different this film was than the others, but it didn't make it any worse... just different. Connection-wise it feels more like a M:I sequel than any other one, but tone-wise it couldn't feel more separate. I have to wrap my head around some of the plot points and character motivations I didn't quite grasp watching it, but if I am going to grade it on M:I standards I can't in all good faith put it above 3 or 5. That doesn't mean it is a worse film, though. It was a great film, and by all technical merits it hit too many right notes, and I believe more so than any of the ones before it. Just a little bit of unevenness, but I like that characters were the focus and that they dug deep into what Rogue Nation gave us instead of just making something another wacky episode in the wide world of Ethan Hunt & crew. It was not as flashy and full of blockbuster moments as the other films were save a couple of items here and there, but I think if you are a fan of this franchise you would be way hard-pressed to find too many downfalls in the final result. Leaving the theater I award it a strong eight mustaches out of ten, and sandwiching it around the middle. If this is on the merits of being a film and and of itself, I would place it above Ghost Protocol easily and it could potentially top 3 and 5 for some. If judged against films for being in the Mission: Impossible franchise, GP may sneak above it by a hair. But because of the strong connection to Rogue Nation leading to some consistency for once, I'll currently place my ranking at:3

I can't wait to see this one again.- - - - - - - - - - - - - -P.S. I don't know where else to fit this, so I'll just place it at the end. There was this recurring line in the film that characters would say, along the ilk of: ""I'll figure it out."" It was always in response to a character asking how they'll approach something next. I don't know if this was a gaff in the screenplay or a wink at the audience in some way---maybe as a response to the previous movie having two different characters literally anticipate every outcome of the film's entirety since the planning stages---and now showing in this film that they have to improvise scenarios reactionarily to something that was unforeseen. I don't know what it was, but it felt like it was said a bit too much. I'd really like to hear McQuarrie bring that up in an audio commentary.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Ethan's words ""I won't let anything happen to you Benji"". The opening scene says it all. Ethan the man who values people than his mission yet again lands himself in trouble. Off course this mission is not a choice.It's been 22 years since the first Mission Impossible film hit the theatres, Tom Cruise hasn't changed. He is ready to risk his life for the entertainment of his fans and movie lovers. Every time he takes the risk meter a notch above the earlier one. Be it hanging the cliff, leaping between buildings, boarding a flying helicopter he is the man of action.Fallout is the recent addition to Tom Cruise's best ever franchise. Right from the word go Fallout is a treat. The movie never wasted a minute to suit up. The 148 minutes of entertainment is rich in action, marvel in stunts and brilliant in execution.Unlike other MI movies Fallout is a direct sequel to its predecessor Rough Nation. Off course this is a first time that a director has directed two movies in this franchise. Though the movie is a sequel, one doesn't need to know the story of Rough Nation to watch Fallout, the movie is clear in implying the plot even to someone new to the franchise.When Christopher McQuarrie was announced the director of Fallout, it surprised everyone, as this is the first time a director has directed two movies in Mission Impossible franchise. But, he proved to be the perfect man to direct Fallout. His direction has made Fallout the best in the franchise (According to my opinion).Technically the movie is brilliant, especially the locations where the stunts were performed, like the climax in Kashmir (Though not mentioned in the movie). Fallout stands out the best in the franchise. Music by Lorne Balfe is too good during stunts, his music has elevated the stunts a step higher through his music. Rob Hardy's camera speaks for itself. His work during the stunt scenes are exceptional.Above all the casting is perfect as a bullet. From Ving Rhames to Alec Baldwin, the cast has done justification to their roles. Roping Henry Cavil as Walker is the high point of the movie. Though we miss his action till the climax, he adds perfect flavour to the cast.Mission Impossible Fallout is the best in the franchise so far. Don't miss the action packed 148 minutes. The best action movie of the year.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

558,hughrcarson,An entertaining larger than life tale of espionage,7,12 September 2018,"Unlike James Bond, the Mission Impossible films seem to have that uncanny habit of consistently getting their recipe just about right. You'll doubtless have your own favourite from this long-running re-booted franchise, but it's hard to deny the quality of each and every chapter that unfolds.And according to many, Mission Impossible: Fallout is in fact the pick of the bunch.Not that it's in any way ground-breaking or indeed some sort of game changer. It's evidently not. But through a few well-placed tweaks to a familiar, tried and trusted story line, Mission Impossible: Fallout succeeds in being both entertaining and suspenseful enough to keep the old grey matter sufficiently engaged over the film's two-and-a-half hour duration.Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, Mission Impossible:Fallout continues Hollywood's current trend of acknowledging the ageing process in our big screen heroes, depicting them as getting a little long-in-the-tooth for the extra-ordinary feats that continue to be asked of them. They are of course, by and large, human after all.This has been very evident in the closing chapters of Daniel Craig's residency as James Bond, as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger's increasingly arthritic attempts to keep up with the machines that threaten both him and those that he attempts to protect within the Terminator franchise. Granted, Schwarzenegger's character is not exactly human, but the point still stands. Old age will eventually make us all obsolete.Accordingly, there are one or two ""Christ, not again... really?"" withered looks of despair that flash across the face of our resident Mission Impossible hero, Ethan Hunt, during certain more physically demanding scenes. A small yet tell-tale sign of an action hero who is fast becoming aware that old man time is finally beginning to catch up with him.Never is this more evident than when Ethan Hunt is paired up with a Government-appointed somewhat younger sidekick, August Walker (Henry Cavill), who, resplendent with 1980's moustache could ably be passed off as being Freddie Mercury's man-mountain Cyborg love child, were he to have had one.I'd imagine.The threat of terrorism-induced nuclear armageddon provides sufficient motivation for Cruise and his merry band of foe-foilers to dig deep, pull out all of the stops and once again achieve the truly extraordinary under nigh on impossible circumstances.Some things never change.Simon Pegg, whilst adopting his usual role of light-relief-bringer in otherwise super-intense circumstances, is however noticeably less jester-like during this particular outing. Ving Rhames once again portrays the dependably tech-savvy Luther. Rebecca Ferguson is all seductive glamour, beauty and know-how as agent Isla Faust, whilst Sean Harris is probably more weaselly than sinister portraying ideologue and all-round enemy of the state, Solomon Lane.But in a larger-than-life tale of espionage and counter espionage, it's once again our vertically-challenged shiny-toothed hero that steals the show.As he always does.Say what you will about Tom Cruise the high-ranking Scientologist and fully paid-up member of the Hollywood aristocracy. This is a man seemingly impervious to any and all attempts by media hacks to publicly assassinate his character by repeatedly calling into question his most private of private lives. But one thing remains undeniable:He's simply superb at playing these kinds of roles, in fact I'd go so far as to say that Tom Cruise is very possibly the finest exponent of our time of playing the Action Hero.The cracks may well be just starting to appear, but whilst there's still life in Tom Cruise, there's still life in Ethan Hunt, and that can only be good news for the innumerable fans of this most unfailing of film franchises.This and hundreds of other films are reviewed on my WaywardWolfBlog",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
559,cmayerle-41064,"Been there, done that",6,20 August 2018,"Probably because the other MIs were so good (except for 3, which was just awful), this movie seemed like it was rehashing old ideas and trying to tie up too many loose ends from the whole franchise. Sometimes it's better just to let characters and old plot lines fade into memory.Not that Alec Baldwin was a bad choice to play the bureaucrat, but McQuarrie went too far in trying to make him a badass fighter. Ving Rhames, at times, just seemed like he was trying to get over with his scenes. Pegg and Monaghan overacted while Cavill tried too hard to underact his role as superspy colossus. Vanessa Kirby made a great addition as the White Widow and pretty much stole every scene she was in. Angela Bassett, likewise, makes a much better hardened bureaucrat than Alec Baldwin. And Tom Cruise was Tom Cruise (not an insult or compliment, you either like him or not).",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

561,MoviesWithX,"Another satisfying entry, but honestly...",8,13 July 2021,"I'm not here to really say anything negative about this movie as I quite enjoyed it as a longtime fan of the series. I started with that because although I enjoyed it, I don't think it's the best one in the series as most people do. I personally feel that ""M. I. : Ghost Protocol"" is the best of the 6 movies thus far. I'm giving it an 8 but that's because I can't give it a 7.5 and don't think it's a 7. Maybe a 7.7 at best. Ah, close enough. That doesn't take away what I do like about this movie though. Christopher McQuarrie does a marvelous job directing the action, as he did with ""M. I. : Rogue Nation"". There's great stuntwork and editing as usual. I did like some setpieces better than others, but they are all impressive. Cruise gives 110% as always, and quite literally throws himself into the role as expected. All of the returning cast are great as always (Pegg, Ferguson, Rhames, Baldwin, and Harris), and the new additions are also. Angela Bassett is nothing to be played with, and is cutthroat. Vanessa Kirby... ooh-wee. (She's good in the movie though, not just good-looking, lol.) But yo... Henry Cavill. Dynamite. Really liked him in this movie. He absolutely brought it here. The plot is sort of what you'd expect from an M. I. movie (they must recover some plutonium), but what this one does have over the others is that they seem to want to establish some more depth in regards to Ethan's character. The opening scene all by itself suggests that, but also within a conversation that takes place later on between two people (won't say who). Going forward in the series, those things could definitely suggest some possible stakes for Ethan and other characters. So I like that also. There is something though in this movie that I think is the best out of all the films and that is the score. Lorne Balfe composed this one. I say get him back for the 7th film. Fantastic job. My only reason for not thinking it's the best in the series is due simply to the fact that I thought the fourth film was more fun. A more serious approach isn't unsuitable for these movies though. It didn't hurt this one. Looking forward to the 7th film.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

566,lucasespindola-91322,A lot more than simply an action movie,8,11 January 2021,"Another great entry in this epic franchise but, this time, with something different. Sure, the MI formula is still there, but there are so many characters, locations and interests that, somehow, all add up to a very simple plot.
This should be a complex movie, but it never feels like that. It is always clear what is happening, who is doing what and why. When something feels odd, it is because it is. Maybe it is simply a side effect of having so much baggage or maybe it is intentional, but it is a clear characteristic throughout the movie.
Cavill's acting can appear poor, but, at the same time, it seems like that is his character. Even the addition of another huge star can't shift the focus from Cruise, who completely dominates the screen, leaving gaps only to be perfectly filled by his co-stars.

It has nothing as calculated, clever, sexy, or as well put together as the opera scene from Rogue Nation.Fallout is like Ghost Protocol, a series of stunt ideas strung together in lieu of a well written narrative.Definitely worth watching, but don't expect the action classic many (most?) reviews proclaim.In my honest opinion.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

572,BlueFox94,Tom Cruise is Unstoppable in Mission: Impossible - Fallout,8,24 August 2018,"(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)""There has never been peace without first a great suffering. The greater the suffering, the greater the peace."" - Opening to ""The Apostles' Manifesto"", composed by John Lark (?????)Potential spoilers belowWriter-director Christopher McQuarrie has uninstalled the revolving door of directors for the Mission: Impossible (M:I) franchise......and delivered, in terms of pure action, perhaps the best Mission: Impossible installment to date.McQuarrie's screenplay for M:I - Fallout (hereafter referred to as just Fallout), on the other hand, is a step down from his last one, and no action, however masterfully crafted, can distract from that.Two years have passed since Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) of the United States' Impossible Missions Force (IMF) captured former British agent turned anarchic terrorist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). The remnants of Lane's group The Syndicate have reformed into The Apostles. Hunt and fellow IMF agents Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) fail to prevent The Apostles from obtaining three precious plutonium cores that their new client, the mysterious John Lark (?????), could turn into three portable nuclear weapons. IMF Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) tasks Hunt to impersonate Lark, who has arranged to obtain the cores from The Apostles in Paris, with black market arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis/White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) acting as broker. To ensure that Hunt does not fail, CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) dispatches Special Activities operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) to stick close to Hunt. Once Hunt meets the White Widow, she agrees to hand over all three cores in exchange for one favor: Hunt must break Solomon Lane free so that she can return him to The Apostles.Now if only British MI6 agent and past ally Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) did not have orders to kill Lane at the same time.One cannot discuss Fallout without first bringing up its fantastic and heart-pumping action sequences. The near-perilous HALO jump into Paris, the high-speed chase through Parisian streets the next day, and the insane helicopter chase towards Fallout's end all benefit the most from Eddie Hamilton's restrained cutting of Rob Hardy's cinematography and the intense sound mixing by Gilbert Lake and Mike Prestwood Smith. (Rob Hardy also shot Annihilation from earlier this year.) The bathroom brawl showcases Cruise, Cavill, and stuntman Liang Yang's commitment to Wade Eastwood's peerless stunt coordination and Wolfgang Stegemann's fight coordination. As the sixth entry in a franchise that has so far eluded Academy recognition, Fallout stares intently at each of the Academy's below-the-line-related branches and states plainly but firmly, ""Nominate me. Now.""I mentioned in my Incredibles 2 review from earlier this year that I had begun to regard that animated film ""less as a stellar follow-up and more like a stellar appendix"" to its 2004 predecessor. In light of 2015's Rogue Nation, I have a similar regard for Fallout. Nearly all of Rogue Nation consists of Hunt, his IMF colleagues, and newcomer Ilsa Faust reacting to a situation beyond their control and working tirelessly to prove their innocence against Solomon Lane's treachery, with the audience right behind them throughout. Thanks to Christopher McQuarrie's screenplay and direction, Rogue Nation harnessed its genuine and well-paced suspense and ferocious wit to earn its satisfying finale.Fallout, as a more direct sequel to Rogue Nation, starts with Hunt receiving his next mission as usual and failing it due to ""good intentions"". He and his team must then resume the mission, improvising where needed, and all while cleaning up the mess with CIA's star Agent Walker watching over their shoulders. In between Fallout's spectacular action sequences, the twists blow minds and the handful of conflicting interests among the characters give off the appearance of a complex action spy thriller. Yet upon reflection, these plot elements, which come to a head during Fallout's London bunker sequence, make writer-director McQuarrie's second M:I contribution more muddled than necessary, bordering on implausibility. Furthermore, even the most casual viewer will never doubt the heroism of Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. This is Mission: Impossible, not Collateral, and ingredients like a plan to massacre French cops cannot simply get brushed aside.My first viewing of Fallout left me as excited as anyone else by its enthralling and relentless action. In that respect, Fallout is the best Mission: Impossible movie and Christopher McQuarrie embraces his deepest directorial instincts to reach creative heights yet unattained. Likewise, Tom Cruise continues to cement his action star legacy, even as he approaches 60.Upon leaving my re-watch, however, I could no longer shrug off Fallout's confusing web of espionage double-crossings. Complexity has its place, but so does clarity. Rogue Nation had clarity and the wit to help its intricacies reach the minds of audiences, as did the first Mission: Impossible from 1996 and the fourth film Ghost Protocol from 2011. I wish that some of the clarity that so gorgeously marks Fallout's exceptional action sequences had rubbed off on its plot.Still working on it? A bit too late for that.(Parental Note: Mission: Impossible - Fallout has been rated PG-13 by the MPAA ""for violence and intense sequences of action, and for brief strong language"". It has also been rated 12A by the BBFC for ""moderate violence, injury detail,"" and ""infrequent strong language"", and rated A-III (Adults) by the Catholic News Service for containing ""much violence with some gore and gruesome images, acceptability of divorce, a couple of uses of profanity, two milder oaths as well as a single rough and several crude terms."")P.S. After all was said and done, keeping the mustache was worth it.R.N.B.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

574,almanjit25,Mission Impossible: Fatigue,6,28 July 2018,"To be fair, Fallout isn't a bad film. It simply isn't as good as it's being made out to be. Plainly put, it's very boring, dull as dishwater, highly predictable and unoriginal. It's a rehash of several of the previous films in the franchise and especially Ghost protocol in terms of plot. It's nothing a fan of the series hasn't seen before. Angela Bassett plays a CIA director who is eerily similar to her predecessor in Rogue Nation,. The action sequences give off a strong whiff of deja vu. I've seen similar if not identical ones in the James Bond franchise (Moonraker, Casino Royale, the Timothy Dalton and even Pierce Brosnan films among others), The Bourne trilogy and Godzilla (2014) even. When you get sick of action sequences and pinpoint the exact film you've seen it it, that's a problem. This movie, MI: Fallout, is a pastiche of other movies. It borrows heavily from other films and just pastes the parts together. I spent the bulk of the movie saying, ""seen that in this movie and seen that in another."" I was bored throughout the film. The plot was very run-of-the-mill, one that we've seen in countless films i.e they team up to save the world from radical terrorists and miraculously succeed even though everything's so obvious and treads well-worn ground. There are no interesting twists, you can see them from a mile away. Henry Cavill plays his character from The Man from U.N.C.L.E. except slightly and obviously different and even more boring. There wasn't any nuance to his performance. He reminds me of Sean Bean from Goldeneye except really snooze-worthy. Vanessa Kirby is wasted in this film! The reason I love Rogue Nation is that it's incredibly fast-paced, fun and features a brilliant Rebecca Ferguson. She's great in this film but has practically nothing to do and even her character motivations are a rehash from the previous film. Benji and Luther who are always a delight are wasted in this film and I severely missed Jeremy Renner. There were problems with character development.The plot aims at political relevance and emotional heft but that is it's downfall. We've seen this story before and the themes are so poorly and minimally handled. Every villain is so ridiculously cookie-cutter and cliche. It all reminded me of the Robert Langdon films based on the works of Dan Brown. I didn't see the point of bringing back Michelle Monaghan except for emotional manipulation which didn't even materialize. It was obvious she was brought back to close her chapter with Ethan so he can focus on Ilsa in the next installment. The sentimentality felt forced and cheesy. In addition the film lags for a huge part of it's runtime,. It's too long and on overall I was extremely underwhelmed.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

578,stani_cv,Did I watch a different movie,6,26 May 2019,"Not going into much details, since i see plenty was written about MI Fallout. I had very high expectations for this movie considering the reviews and the overall rating. While it was a decent action movie it was a bad MI movie. In the first hour and a half it was pretty good actually and then in the last 45 minutes or so it went completely downhill and became extremely predictable. I almost stopped watching near the end.
Witty writing and unexpected plot twists are what made the previous 2 movies so much enjoyable to watch. This barely had any plot twists or any plot at all, and the writing was quite lazy. In the end it's the acting that save the movie for me. Most notable: Simonn Pegg, Ving Rhames and Sean Harris. I was not impressed with Tom Cruise in this movie and definitely not impressed with Henry Cavill. He was such a boring villain. Overall, if you watch it on a big screen with loud speakers and pretend there's no script you might enjoy it much more. For me it was a disappointment.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
579,domsimmonds,2018 Carrot Gold,9,9 September 2018,"Dam!!!! This film was a blast. Thrilling, compelling and entertaining. Mission Impossible keeps getting better with age. The action in this film was so well directed, I didn't think it possible for film makers to achieve this....no shakey cameras or lens flairs or darkly shot scenes. I also love how the film treats the audience as adults, despite its simply plot, however I don't see this as a negative aspect, as it works to the films advantage. Tom Cruise is a legend in the film and I swear he's gonna push himself too far one day making these films. Some of the stunts are unreal!!! Loved the cast, loved the action, love the cinematography.

The film is also helped by outstanding performances by all the cast, including more than a cameo of Monaghan. Cavill was a great addition, as a fan of his performances in the likes of Man From Uncle, he fit in nicely. Kirby also played out of type-cast brilliantly and almost stole the show.The only one we don't get to see is Renner due to scheduling conflicts with the Marvel series, but we live in hope to see him under this franchise again.McQuarrie returns from Rogue Nation to direct again, and he does a superb job, the action scenes are flawless and captured vividly, but with out the hectic cinematics which have plagued so many actions films, making for an enjoyable experience rather than a headache inducing one.The CGI is good, again, with only minor flaws and some glitchy or shall we say less than perfect transitions.I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed the classic fast paced edge of your seat film they have created here, this series had some duds in it's middle, but this is definitely one of the best so far, and such a joy to watch.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

585,Reelnerd,Reel Review: Fallout,8,29 July 2018,"Reel Review: Mission Impossible: Fallout
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie
Starring: Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Alec Baldwin
 I have only seen one other Mission Impossible film prior to Fallout and that was MI:II with Thandie Newton. Tom Cruise as always gives his all in his performance as Ethan Hunt and even does a great many of the stunts in the film. In fact he actually injured himself during one of the stunts which caused a delay in filming. Henry Cavill plays a new character August Walker and he is so great and badass. I may be a bit biased as I am a huge Henry Cavill fan and he is a great Superman as far as I'm concerned. 
 Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg return as Luther and Benji and they really compliment Tom Cruise's performance. They have been in six of these films together now and they have really great chemistry. Rebecca Ferguson is such a delight and I've been a fan of hers since I first saw her in that Dwayne Johnson Hercules film and in The Greatest Showman with Hugh Jackman. 
 The film has some really great action sequences and some really great cinematography work. There are a couple of great car chase scenes in this movie and there is even a nail biting helicopter chase sequence unlike anything I have ever seen. Fallout ties up some loose ends seeded in some of the previous Mission Impossible films. 
 Ethan in this film comes to terms with some of the ""fallout"" of the kind of life that he leads. How it has affected his happiness and those around him that he loves and cares for. Ethan is different than a character like James Bond in that Bond has some moral ambiguity especially in the current films featuring Daniel Craig as the Bond character. 
 Ethan values the life of his team and will not sacrifice them in order to accomplish his missions. He tries to minimize the amount of collateral damage that comes with partaking in one of these dangerous assignments to the best of his abilities. There was one scene in the film that really epitomizes the value he places on human life including that of a complete stranger. 
 Fallout is a really fun and action packed film. McQuarrie does a great job not only tying up loose ends from previous films but this film is in no way an ending to the franchise. The door is still wide open for future films and if this film is as successful as previous installments then I am sure that there will be. I really enjoyed this film and I think you should check it out.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

I meant to say now a days you don't want to watch an entire film just trailers are enough. But MI Fallout changed my opinion. Movie is fantastic with super actions, story, Characters everyone acted very well. Tom is asusual awesome. Rebecca, Henry, Simon, Ving, Sean, Alec, Michele, Vanessa. Unlike other films in franchise this film is something different with emotions, bonding between Ethan, Julia & IIsa. And some laughable moments, intense action scenes.. Over all great movie to watch this weekend. Instead of 2hrs 28mins if little short it would be better.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
587,sajib-66432,Its One Step higher than Every other Top Action Movies,9,27 July 2018,"There is a Good reason why Actor doing all the Stunt make movies better . There is no face swapping cut scene, you can watch every action in a continuous shot without jump cut or any other tricks .Its like you are living inside that movie .The smooth flow of hand to hand fight ,car ,bike ,helicopter chase actually make you feel every pain ,scary parts even more .Its not just acting from Tom cruise ,you can literally see the effort in running & every other fight scene .This guy actually giving his 200% to make this movie more believable .I can't say i just watch a fake jump or run cz it wasn't .Another thing i loved about this movie is unlike other movies its not all Tom cruise fights ,His groups were also active & really have done as important Job as Ethan Hunt in this movie .Comedy was there but it wasn't for the sake of comedy ,there were funny as hell as they came at a time of great danger Henry cavel's acting ,action were great .He is really a good actor & showed his talent .I can enjoy another movie just about Henry cavel as his character was that good .Same can be said about the Female Bike Spy .She was great too kinda have a black widow type really important action scene in the movie .Action movies are as good as its villain .Well i guess this movie showed why its true .Great job in that part .Tom cruise showing he knows how to create a good villain & how important their role is",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

My biggest complaint about this - it *was* more like a Bond film - with Cruise at the front and the others far in the background as supporting actors. I enjoyed some of the other films because they walked through how they were going to pull off a heist - I know the don't want to spoil anything, but I would have liked to have seen more of that than things just popping up out of nowhere. Wish I would have rewatched the prior movie recently, I had no recollection of the relationships etc, and this would have benefited from a little more knowledge. But they do bring you up to speed.

The action gets more and more implausible, the stories more and more ridiculous (and confusing, with double- triple- and probably even quadruple-agents), and the stars get older and older.

597,tyelder,Thrill-Ride From Start to Finish,10,30 July 2018,"Your mission, should you choose to accept it; the words we all have grown to connect with action, spies, secrets, and of course, Tom Cruise.
 This sixth installment to classic, and ever improving, franchise series has proven to live up to the critics' hype. This film has surpassed its predecessors just as each installment has seemed to do. From the opening scene to the roll of the credits, this movie had me on the edge of the seat with palms sweaty and the steady sound of my thumping heart beat. 
 Conflicting situations that seem to have no possible solution fill the runtime, along with brilliant camera work that'll slow down the epic sequences into moments that'll be remembered forever.
 McQuarrie proves he has the masterful talent to carry out this franchise into the masterpiece each new installment has become. His filmmaking will leave you feeling for each character, whether good or bad, and feeling every punch they take, as well. 
 Proven with just one viewing, this film is a masterpiece. It's one for the shelf and one that'll entertain for decades and decades to come. 
 Calling it close, as the IMF team famously does, is exactly what this film doesn't do. It calls it as soon as it starts its first scene because this one has taken the top of its series and of the summer.
 Action, adventure, suspense, running, HALO jumps, helicopter chases, and one hell of an ending that'll not be confirmed nor denied, of course, without the approval of the secretary.

The stunts have always been a big part of the series since number 1, and Fallout is no exception. From helicopter fights to car chases, to motorcycles and skydiving, Fallout has a ton of amazing stunts performed. But before you walk away just because it sounds like a stunt film more than anything, Fallout also has incredible dialogue and plot.

In their bid to create excitement and thrills, they went the easy route by throwing a bunch of daring-do when it wasn't really smart or necessary.Compare this one to the very first MI flick, and the differences are abundant. Wasn't a fan of the tv show or the books, but there are better ways to make an MI movie and they already did it the first time around.Maybe I just prefer my spy movies to be more about the spy-game and suspense, rather than all-out warfare.

Its either nuclear or something to do with stuff like plutonium. I don't see the difference between these series and the James Bond ones only that those require a Brit to portray the impossible character. The idea of John Wick was way better but Wick 2 was disappointing.Its becoming ridiculous when you see its always about Tom Cruise in the movie. Its nothing to do with Mission Impossible. He gets beaten by one single Asian guy and the next minute he is beating up 5-6 trained killers like nobody's business. Its just awful and sickening. Then the shot where his bike starts at the last minute so the bad guys could catch up to take some shots which of course magically they miss with all that guns at peril. Not to mention how rides through the city in opposite direction so smoothly and meets an accident which has no whatsoever effect on him. Who's the Superman here? Cavill or Cruise?I'm surprised that this got above 5 star ratings. Cruise in cruise control with his impossible fans. Its just sad that instead of his talents, its the people around him that tries to make him look good still. The man is losing it. Should start considering softer or matured roles in a movie. Maybe a Lawyer or something. We are missing those sort genre for a very long time now.

I went to the theater very hyped because of I loved Rogue Nation, and the trailers for this one were so good. Andmy expectations where highly satisfied. 
The story of this one is a sequel for Rogue Nation, so the characters that I loved of the previous one are back. The way this film is writen and narrated is so good, dynamic and intelligent. The action stunts and sequences are incredibly good choreographed and are satisfactory real, no trace of CGI, greeen screens or any visual effects. 
The action, however, even though it's great, sometimes is a little exhausting, and the scene is over leaving you wanting for some air, but that feeling of intensity is something that makes you live the movie like you where there. The plot is full of twist and turns, but not any plot-hole. The way the situation changes from one scene to another is so chaotic that you need to give full attention to the movie all the time.

617,michielodb,Mission accomplished!,9,30 August 2018,"No one I think would have believed that the sixth installment of this franchise would actually be the best one yet. I have enjoyed nearly all previous movies. The first one being a classic in my opinion, the second one being alright, the third one being a great comeback, Ghosts Protocol being a very fun flick and however I found Rogue Nation to be a little underwelming, it was still a very enjoyable film. I think I could say that Ghost Protocol was my favorite...but then Fallout came out and wow did it blew me away.Everything that has been done in this movie is I believe the best what they could have done with it. The acting is great, the soundtrack is very thrillig by Lorne Balfe, the cinematography is absolutely mindblowing and with that comes a great amount of top level action setpieces. Tom Cruise absolutely delivers in pretty much every way (the fact that every setpiece is practical with hardly any CGI makes it so much better).Now for flaws I guess you could say that the story is a little bit ordinary, and by that I mean that it's nothing we haven't seen before. There's once again a nuclear subplot, Tom Cruise runs an insane amount as expected (not that thats a bad thing) and I also thought that the build up was a little bit rushed. Let's say that from the beginning until the opening credits is a little bit too fast for my liking, but that's only opinion of course. From the moment Tom delivers his first stunt, the movie is pretty much a non-stop rollercoaster that will keep you on the edge of your seat. To top everything off, there are also some nice twists and unexpected turns of events along the way, so I suggest to keep your attention on the dialogue constantly because otherwise you might lose track.A must-see movie guys!

The run through London was also fun to watch. However the connecting story was largely nonsensical. I guess some of the plot points stand on things that's happened in earlier movies. I don't remember anything about the previous movies. The CIA has use for some fencer who is a 27 year old blonde woman who runs a charity in Paris and controls a small amoral security force? Who did the tall thin woman work for? Why did Ving Rhames character have to give SO MUCH exposition, particularly about Ethan Hunt's marriage life? And then we get to the helicopter ""chase."" This was when this movie goes full-on into a bad Bond movie. Main characters easily survive helicopter crashes into mountains. And for some reason Hunt has to chase down a walker talkie to pull out a round thingy so the smart guys could cut a wire. I think these plot points would bother me less if the movie didn't take itself so seriously (ahem Tom Cruise.) The action scenes are pretty good, but you can leave after the London scene and not miss much. Forget about the plot.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
634,Lavnishkrsharma,Awestruck!!!,8,27 September 2018,"Julia: So, How is he?
Lucas: Oh.. you know.. the same old Ethan!This one dialogue from Fallout is the whole jist. Tom is still refreshing, energetic and ageless with his mind blowing stunts and coolness. Fallout is the 6th instalment of this action packed series Mission Impossible which was originally based on a TV series. The foundation built by the first three series was so strong that, now we can't imagine a MI series without Tom Cruise. Mission impossible means Ethan Hunt and Ethan Hunt means Tom Cruise, that' all! End of discussion! I know all of have had already watched the trailer of Fallout but still I will share it.We all know what Mission Impossible is all about. There is a villain who is trying to destroy the world and he believes in the philosophy that There cannot be peace without, first, a great suffering and the greater the suffering, the greater the peace' and to stop him from doing this, Ethan Hunt is set on a mission. Every instalment of this series has a different villain and different hurdles but Ethan will surpass them easily, and will save the world. The starting of the film was very normal, I thought that's why they were focusing so much on stunts, the story is very normal but they proved me wrong!! As story moves, the grip is tightened with each suspense and event there is a twist in movie and at last I was convinced that the ""very normal"" starting of the movie was necessary to give the audience a much more fulfilling experience in the later part. Talking about the ""impossible"" things of Fallout, first and foremost, Tom Cruise!! What a work he has done!!! Amazing work! I mean if there'd be an Oscar for commercial Cinema then I think Tom would have won it a long time ago. HE IS THE SAME OLD ETHAN!!!!! I mean, there is nothing left which he has not done to entertain us. With the same energy, same attitude and same coolness he has done his work. And the remaining gaps are filled by the stunts. I mean, you will think, ""Does he fear death??"" the answer is NOOO!!!! There is nothing left for him, he has done all the stunts by himself! In Ghost Protocol he climed Burj Khalifa and I was like OKAY! This is the limit but again in Rogue Nation he was hanging out on a plane!!! And in this movie he has crossed the limits he is hanging on a rope attached to a helicopter! I was like, ""man, you hate this life? huh??"" Second, best thing is Cinematography, and especially of the action sequences, that helicopter sequence looked sooooo big, soooo big on screen that I got gossebumps while watching that scene. Two helicopters flying over mountains, and Tom Cruise hanging on a rope. That's the beauty of that scene. In the starting you will think, when will the action come? When?? But when it comes, you will be like, please don't end this please!! But the film makers knew that apart from Tom, action is what audience will be looking for and yessss!! This film will not leave you unsatisfied. You will love Tom while he runs on bike in the streets of Paris, you will love him when he did the HALO jump, you will love his sense of humour, you will love him in every aspect!!The last and the most important thing which I observed was the audience reaction. In theatre, whenever there is a play going on stage, there is a big importance of audience reaction. Their reaction gives you an idea that how well the play is going on, is audience liking it? Such natural reactions were there in this movie. I mean on every big event or stunt audience was reacting. The scene when Tom jumped and broke off his ankle, even after knowing this fact, the audience reacted as if this was the first time they have seen it. What other thing a film maker wants apart from this, that audience so much related to their cast that if they are injured the audience is feeling bad. That's a beautiful thing in this movie, every incident, suspense, fight scene, on everything the audience reacted and according to me that's a great thing, it shown how much gripping your movie is. If someone asks me ""how's the movie?"" I would just say ""just like Ethan Hunt"".",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

641,brennandube,Perfect Action Movie,9,30 July 2018,"Tom Cruise and company have returned for a sixth installment of the long running (6 films, 22 years) 'Mission Impossible' franchise. Who would've thought they'd save their best stuff for the sixth film? Here is my review of 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout.'In the sixth film in the series we are reunited with Tom Cruise and his infamous 'Ethan Hunt' character as well as the rest of the gang, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames. This film is directed and written by Christopher McQuarrie. This is the second 'Mission Impossible' he has directed, the first being 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' (2015). Following all the hype mustered up by this film I found myself surprisingly excited to see it. I got to see the opening day viewing and I was not disappointed. Christopher McQuarrie is the perfect director for these films as proven by two back-to-back successful films as well as this being, in my opinion, the best film in the franchise to date. 'Fallout' is a sheer epic. It has everything you want in an action film and it does it all perfectly. While giving the audience some intense and top-notch barrages of action, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie balanced in a very strong and clear pointed plot. This perfect balance made for a perfect action film. Tom Cruise yet again delivers a strong performance and his stunts continue to be jaw-dropping. McQuarrie's direction with these action sequences are perfect and some stunning and edge-of-the-seat scenes do happen rather frequently in this film. Henry Cavill is also in this movie and it was great to finally see the now infamous-stache on the big screen. I had my slight doubts in him at times during the movie but continuously with each and every passing scene Cavill seemed to just get better and better. He brought a lot to the film and definitely served a strong purpose. Simon Pegg is entertaining as always, as is Ving Rhames. Sean Harris is also in the film and he brings a good strong presence as the films mysterious villainous character. Harris owns the role and brings genuine darkness to the film. What puts this film head and shoulders above other action flicks is the insane and pristine camera work. Some of the shots that were taken during this film are absolutely stunning and I found myself turning to the person beside me admiring these shots on several occasions. This all made for rather grand and certainly epic scenes. The moment I left the theatre I was ready to turn back around and head back in for more. While the story isn't necessarily fresh, Christopher McQuarrie does a good job at telling this story and unfolding a very picture-perfect spy film. There are some characters I definitely would have liked to have seen developed more. As previously stated, the brilliance in balance within the film is truly unmatched and story is not compromised at the hands of over usage of CGI or cheap jokes. This is the quintessential action movie of 2018 and the summer blockbuster we needed oh so badly.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

646,McScared,Mission Implausible - Cashout,2,30 July 2018,"Don't watch it in 3D. In fact, don't watch it at all. I couldn't believe the low quality grainy 3D cinematography. Did Tom Cruise get a deal on some Chinese 3D cameras. I saw it in a VIP theatre and it looked like this thing was shot on a consumer 3D handycam. The storyline was predictable and overly simplistic. I don't demand a lot from an action movie, but Michelle Monaghan's reintroduction was confusing, unnecessary and appeared to be written in as an afterthought. And all this talk about them doing their own stunts for added authenticity. Well, I for one would like them to go back to using professional stunt persons. This whole do your own stunts thing came off an an ego driven attempt to impress other cast members, that fell flat. Very flat. Finally, the writing was absolutely terrible. I couldn't help but wonder through the entire predictable movie if Tom Cruise also wrote and directed this himself. It was that bad. When I see the ridiculously high ratings on IMDB it makes me think that writing fake positive reviews is now just part of the industry. I really enjoyed the first few films in the MI franchise, but now it's just the same old rehashed storyline. I really wanted to like it. But instead I now feel obligated to expose this cash grab for what it really is. I'm confident that the truth will slowly come out and today's 8.5 rating on IMDB will eventually drop down to a 4.5 - which is still much higher than it deserves. No spoilers on the plot here. Just imagine a bunch of overpaid aged friends getting together to travel around the world to show off their fitness level. Even Baldwin dropped a few pounds. Come on guys.

648,john310,FallOut for the fans and the franchise.,1,27 July 2018,"A mission impossible film, leading actor Tom Cruise with a bunch of supporting excellent actors marred by an abysmal cinematography and plot. Every or a 2 year duration Tom Cruise presents his fans with a jaw dropping action packed film with thrilling set pieces. But alas how could he even agree to star in this project is beyond me. Not a SINGLE and i mean NOT ONE NEW Gadget or tricks in this film is showcased in this film which usually remains a central plot or highlights in this franchise.Each and every film in this franchise has offered the fans with the introduction of a futuristic but somewhat plausible mind boggling tech and gadget. NOT THIS ONE.Oh and did i mention that there IS NO IMPOSSIBLE MISSION here to be overcome? 
The ""Signature move"" or attraction of this franchise is missing. Yes you read that right. The main intense and jaw dropping sequence that is present in every film of this franchise up until now is missing. 
The very first film had a a sequence of hanging in mid air while copying some intel, the 4th was Burj Khalifa scene, the fifth had the underwater tank scene.
 
This had real stunts performed by Cruise but with zero style or substance. I waited and waited but it never came for this movie because there wasn't one.
This film is overhyped to hell as dubbed to be the ""one of the best action films of all time"" by the media. 
Apart from a few gunshots and fist fights, this film is a new low in the name of action. Two chase sequences are decent because of the cinematography and wide viewed shots and not because of the stylized methods of escaping/dodging. The hero ONLY RUNS/RIDES A VEHICLE during the chases and that too in as monotonous way. What was the use of even performing the stunts by himself Mr Cruise if your film doesn't even has some style to it.? 
oh i get it to cause hype because your film doesn't have anything new to offer. Henry cavill although a great actor is wasted here. i guess cruise wanted to earn some quick money using the franchise's name while it still lasts. A well deserved joke Mr. Cruise you have played on the unsuspecting audiences. Just take the money and leave giving one failure after another like The Mummy and then this.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Pay close attention, because Fallout has many plot twists & turns. I Highly recommend seeing this one in IMAX, as the HALO jump over Paris & helicopter chase over the mountains are worthy of the upgrade.

I give this movie a, ""Maaaybe, Scientology is REAL, Dawg"" rating.

Action, characters, story etc. but around London part it just drops the ball. Like they cut around 30 minutes of the film and left a lot of plot elements unresolved. And it really hurt the movie. Instead of interesting spy movie we got the predictable race against the clock. No tension as the time slows down just for our heroes to save the world.

656,troestrup,"Standard, but solid MI movie + New perspective!",10,19 August 2018,"I was very fortunate to see this movie at a discounted ticket price for only about 8 bucks, which in this case was an extremely good deal, since it would have been very much worth the normal price of 16 bucks (yes, tickets are usually expensive in Denmark).Tom Cruise has once again found a new way to fascinate and amaze us with the same, good old, intriguing spy story, we all love.Now, because of the standard format of this movie, which has been the template for all the MI movies over the years, I nearly rated it 8 only. But after watching and reading some of the ""Behind the scenes"" features, which is actually just as exhilarating and entertaining as the movie itself, I realized that the the three latest MI movies simply are on a whole new, advanced level:Not only do we get to see a lot of cool action scenes, ie. car chases, well-choreographed fist fights and the usual bomb defusing scene, which you should expect from a MI movie, but because of the fact that we know about Mr. Cruise´s aversion towards a green screen, this movie reaches entirely new heights.Just now, it is dawning on me, how much more effort and real life heroism went into making the later MI movies over the older ones.To bring this short review down to earth again, I can only submit it with the following statement: Tom Cruise´s movie career, like his looks, ages like fine wine. It simply gets better each time, which absolutely amazes me. What a unique actor indeed. However, of course I should not forget to mention the great job all the co-stars also do, because one man shouldn´t steal the focus for an entire movie, but since Tom + director, crew, countless instructors and stunt choreographers have put so much off-screen effort into it, I am going to make an exception in order to really highlight the hundreds and hundreds of hours of practise and preparation, which we don´t see. Because it seems to me that, in the case of Tom Cruise and his MI movies, the billable hours might just be much more numerous than most other movies.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

658,ninjachewit,It's okay,7,29 July 2018,"To be honest, I think the best action movies have to tell a story worth telling without pandering so much to the adrenaline seeking tantrums inside of all of us. Take for example, The Dark Knight where although it's an action film, it tells a more complex and deeper, even metaphysical story about its characters. This builds tension and allows the tension to seep into the story, and eventually culminate into the action.Well the story of this movie is sort of typical Hollywood- a guy has three bombs that he wants to use to blow up the world to fulfill his ""purpose"". So basically your stock character, evil ""i'm not a terrorist"" but secretly is dude who gets his ass kicked in the end.Is the action good? Definitely. The choreography for the action is really well done, and the cinematography is excellent. I think this movie honestly deserves 7 stars but because of that amazing and unexpected Motorcycle chase I will give it an extra star.I know there are people that would absolutely love the socks of this movie though, and for those people I will say my piece and walk away. But I also would like to say that the last scene with the helicopters seemed like something out of a GI Joe cartoon, although I did appreciate the adrenaline rush and stunts performed during those scenes, I could not say that I ever truly immersed myself within this movie due to its sort of laughable villain, cheesy story at heart, and somewhat generic set-pieces.Is it the best in the series? For me, no, because it still doesn't scream ""iconic"" to me as an action film. Is it a good movie with good action? Yes. Definitely yes, it's a good film, but in my opinion it lacks the consistent tension and general following with the audience to be a great one.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
659,okie-22843,Great but......,7,12 July 2020,"The action is non stop and well choreographed and the story is compelling. Cruise delivers his normal performance and he really puts his aging body on the line. However, the problem with franchises like this one is that you know the good guys are always going to win. And with this series, the more dire the potential outcome, the more sure you are the white hats will prevail. This doesn't spoil the movie or action scenes but you know the hero is going to prevail on the final page. And the sad part of this one is that the usual supporting cast has less screen time and less to do. I would have loved to see 1 or 2 fewer action scenes if it meant more screen time for The team as a whole.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
660,Alanaji_16,"""MISSION IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT"": MY REVIEW",8,30 July 2018,"You don't go to watch a Mission Impossible film expecting an out-of-the-world story. You know it's the same ""good vs evil"" story. But Wait....if u have watched the previous movies in the series, you would probably know how they all were engaging: a pacy screenplay, thrilling action set pieces coupled with the background score and good acting. Although I have not watched the first 3 film's in the series (which is not a must), i still enjoyed Ghost protocol, mainly for that vertigo inducing Burj Khalifa scene, and Rouge Nation. So the expectations for the 6th installment was tremendous. So, does it meet the expectations? The answer in short is a big ""YES"". But before going further, the plot...Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back for his next mission, which is to track down the terrorist organisation, The Apostles, and it's leader John Lark who is still unknown. He is also given the information that Soloman Lane (Sean Harris) (from the previous film) has a direct connection to The Apostles and John Lark. With him on his mission are August Walker ( Henry Cavil), a CIA agent tasked to look upon Ethan, former agents Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther ( Ving Rhames) and an MI6 agent Ilsa Faust ( Rebecca Ferguson). How they uncover the conspiracy forms the rest of the film...As I said before, the story is nothing new. But the screenplay is racy and thrilling and doesn't give you a moment to blink. The action scenes are the mainstay of the film. Not even one set piece were felt unnecessary. Let it be the fist fight in the restroom, the thrilling bike chase in Paris, that footchase in London or the climax action in Kashmir, all were spectacularly shot and a treat to watch in 3D. The movie also has a whole lot of twists which were engaging. The editing was tight. The background score was pulsating. The director, Christopher McQuarrie, has done a great job. A hatts off to him.Now to the performances. Tom Cruise has done a great job as Ethan Hunt, the most lovable rouge agent, and even at the age of 56 , does all the stunts with such ease. Henry Cavil was good in the given role and was at par with Tom. Simon Pegg is as always good, so is Ving Rhames. Sean Harris puts a good show. Vanessa Kirby has nothing much to do but the same can't be said for Rebecca Ferguson. The rest of the cast make their presence felt.So all in all this is a must watch in the series after Ghost Protocol. Make sure you make time for it.My rating : 4/5",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

664,werlingjakob,"""Mission: Impossible- Fallout"" is Definitely One of the Best Action Movies of Recent Years.",9,26 September 2018,"If you were to go onto Rotten Tomatoes and search up the Mission: Impossible movies, you would probably notice that the Mission: Impossible movies that come after Mission: Impossible 3 start to get increasingly better Tomatometer scores. That is definitely true for the latest entry: Mission: Impossible- Fallout, which has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 98%. And I am here to tell you that the reviews for the movie are more or less true and that it is DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST ACTION MOVIES OF RECENT YEARS AND IS THE BEST MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE MOVIE EVER!!! Fallout's story is great and full of twists and some moments of genuine shock (like the scene where I thought they killed off the Pope). But then again, some. The villain's plot is decently original and introduced a new idea- what if Ethan Hunt were to become an outlaw? Tom Cruise does a great job acting, as usual. But the supporting cast does an amazing job too. Henry Cavill does a great job as tough CIA agent August Walker, Ving Rhames does a great job as Ethan's longtime assistant Luther Stickell, Simon Pegg does a great job as Ethan's other longtime assistant and joke-cracker Benji Dunn, Rebecca Ferguson does a great job playing determined MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, Sean Harris does a great job playing former Syndicate terrorist organization leader/madman Solomon Lane, Angela Bassett does a great job playing rough CIA leader Ericka Sloane, Vanessa Kirby does a great job playing radical activist/terrorist cooperator The White Widow, Michelle Monaghan does a great job playing medical worker/Ethan's former wife Julia, and Alec Baldwin does a great job of playing smart, Ethan-faithful MIO leader Alan Hunley. Also, the over-the-top stunts and action sequences were definitely the series best, without question. From the skydiving sequence to the helicopter chase sequence, this movie's stunts have it all. The cinematography, special effects, and fight choreography are also stellar. The cinematography is breathtaking, with many beautiful breathtaking shots of mountains and cities. The special effects are very modern and up-to-date. And the fight choreography is very realistic and brutal (for a PG-13 movie, that is). However, this movie's music is somewhat forgettable- but the humor isn't at all. There are lots and lots of funny moments throughout the film that lighten it up a bit. And last but not least, Mission: Impossible- Fallout also boats good editing and sound and an ending that will leave you on the edge of your seat with your teeth chattering. Despite a few very very minor setbacks, this movie features tons and tons of hair-easing action and a near-perfect story which makes it a near perfect film.

666,battlecrusadersgames,A feast for the eyes but a headache for the brain,8,1 August 2018,"This, the 5th film in Tom Cruises most successful series is an action packed romp, with a gripping, if often confusing plot. The story (as i think it was), revolves around Ethan (Cruise) trying to get his hands on Plutonium bombs, but in order to do so, he has to get involved in a plot to capture an old nemesis. As for the rest, it's hard to say, because there are so many characters betraying and so many organisations with different motives. It's a wonder Ethan even knows what's going on himself. 
 Plot aside, there's much action to be enjoyed, but not so much as to deter from that confusing plot. The fight and chase scenes are among the best of the action and look so real, i'd be surprised if there wasn't lots of injuries in filming.
 As for the acting, well M.I has never been Oscar winning territory, but it is great to see returning characters Luther and Benji getting more screen time and both act well together. Cruise himself does a good enough job, but is really here as an action here rather than for his acting talents. Sean Harris however is great here and very convincing as an insane villain. 
 Overall then a very entertaining film, of you get your head around the story that is.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Very rarely do I meet a film like this where from start to end I am completely engrossed in it. However, let me say that this new Mission Impossible movie is exactly that. The mark of a good film is one that after watching, you think, ' My god, I am glad I watched that.' And I now believe it unnecessary for me to say what I thought after watching this. Seamlessly made and beautifully written. This is nothing short of one of the finest action films of all time.

678,chilichilipepper,This is just a fantastic action movie with a great storyline (An honest review).,7,27 July 2018,"I have found parallels with the MI movies and the Fast and the Furious series. Each one continues to improve on the original (with a few duds, actualy they kind of match up in both series with the second movie being the worst).Yet, like Fast and Furious, Mission Impossible keeps on going with better story lines, new and lovable characters, bigger stunts (especially in this movie, Tom Cruise is a mad man for doing some of the things he does in this and i guess not really a spoiler alert that Tom Cruise does almost all of his own stunts).Really there's not much else to say that this is close to Ghost Protocol on quality and storyline, except with bigger stunts and the newer members of the crew shining (Pegg steals a lot of scenes in this one as he tends to do), with also the old ones still doing their bit supporting parts yet still adding real depth to what should be really just an average action film at this point in the series... It is basically like I said, continuing the 'switch' that happend on MI3 and just every episode is borderline like the original TV show... just keeps on getting better and bigger and such a fantastic movie all around, not just for an ""action movie""Simply Put. I was tempted to give this an 8 but read dislaimer if you want on how i review. This movie again is kind of mirroring the Fast and the Furious. Each one somehow keeps improving the series (except tokyo drift in FF which actually brought us some cool characters for the later ones, or MI 2 which jesus...what a sloppy mess that was of John Woo's SLOW MO PEOPLE USING DOUBLE GUNS WHILE POPPING WHEELIES IN A MOTORCYCLE FIGHT GUNKATA STYLE???). In other words, if you are a fan of either either FF or MI series, (or an action film fan in general), this is a fantastic movie with a few sloppy moments, some script problems (nothing distracting), some plot holes that well, after 6 movies they kind of happen, but ultimatley, this is a must watch summer blockbuster. Disclaimer : People complain about my ratings... I tend to rate on a REAL scale. I mean 0 means the movie should not even exist and 10 means it's just something you must see because it's something MORE than just a movie. For me, a 5 means it was an average movie, worth seeing but nothing special, you will enjoy it or not. A 6 is ""above average for the genre"". So, a 7, especially for an action film, means that this is FAR ABOVE average for its genre, scenes, plot, acting, characters etc. Honestly, I'm tempted to give Fallout an 8 and i wish that IMDB allowed like 7.5 or 7.6 but well, they don't. So yeah, my 7 will make this balance out to this movie eventually being rated around a 7.6 which is exactly where it should be. No 8 because it's not QUITE there due to some predicitability based on the series, some sloppy writing at times, and some plot holes that, which aren't distracting and kind of start to develop when ANY series reaches 6+ films, it's just not quite an 8.... But it sure is close. Sure, I could rate every movie a 0 or 10 like everyone else does but um, that's not honest or possible. EVERY movie can't be 'perfect' or a total failure. Wish more people thought that way during their reviews, however us that review often get counted more strongly than the people who just post ""10 its awesome !!!!!"" or ""WISH I COULD GIV THIS ZERO STARS IT SUCKS"" idiotic spam basically.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

When are we going to get over this hump? why can't women simply can't be killed in action movies? Hollywood, if you want equality , then it has to be equality for everything. If not, it isn't equality.

Everyone from Henry Cavill to Simon Pegg to Ving Rhames to Rebecca Ferguson bringing their A-game (only Angela Bassett is ho-hum). And Cruise at his finest, be it running on rooftops or getting hurt in the mayhem or showing rare moments of tenderness as never seen before in any Mission outing.

689,niko-oinonen,Great first half,7,10 August 2018,"An interesting idea is introduced at the start of Fallout; if it would come to it, would Ethan Hunt be able to choose the mission and sacrifice his friend for the greater good. This idea is carried through to a certain point of the movie, but is ultimately dropped and the climax of the film is the usual save the world from a nuclear blast business. The old familiar faces return from Rogue Nation and Henry Cavil is introduced as a CIA secret agent who is sent along with Hunt to make sure he doesn't screw up the mission. Fallout is a sequel to the previous one. The plot here isn't anything new. A terrorist group wishes to destroy the old world order by blowing up couple of nuclear bombs. Their motives aren't interesting and in fact, the film itself isn't interested in opening them. They say a couple of preachy lines how suffering creates peace, but doesn't go deeper than that. Frankly, it doesn't have to. I'm here for the action. And there are some really good looking action scenes. The night time sky diving in Paris is visually impressive and the fight scene that takes place in the bathroom is very satisfying. It's always a funny turnaround when a big guy like Henry Cavil gets his ass kicked. The first half of the film is the part that works best for me. There's a clear plot and cool action scenes. By the time we reach the half point there's so much going on. The plot gets rather heavy with so many threads that it feels like the film loses its way. The villain and the MI6 agent from Rogue Nation return, there's a philanthropist who's actually a weapons smuggler, a distrust going on between CIA and IMF and also the mysterious identity of a plutonium buyer. The film focuses on heavily on the latter one for the first half. It goes so far as to at one point Ethan is suspected to be the said buyer. At that moment you can clearly see that there's a twist coming and how it's going to turn out. Luckily, when the twist happens the film takes an unexpected turn and doesn't go down the predictable road that has been taken so many times in so many films before. Too bad that its most interesting aspect of choosing between the mission and your friends turns into complete the mission or everyone dies in a nuclear explosion.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

It just beats out Ghost Protocol because of its incredibly tense and well done action sequences, a gripping plot, brilliant writing and great acting.Mission: Impossible: Fallout is one of those movies where I dont see Tom Cruise potraying Ethan Hunt, I just see Ethan Hunt. The movie is so riveting and well done, and Tom Cruise's excellent work as Ethan Hunt makes his character feel real. Most of the other characters feel the same aswell because the acting is just spot on.I havent seen an action movie this tense and enjoyable in a very long time. This might actually be my favourite action movie in years, and is definetely my favourite Mission: Impossible film.The plot is very heavy this time around, just like in the first film. You need to pay attention to the characters dialogue otherwise, you'll just get lost. The villian, Soloman Lane, was previously in Rogue Nation, becoming the first Mission Impossible villain to be the main villain in two movies. Mission Impossible doesn't usually have the best villains, my favourite being Owen Davian from M:I:3. Soloman Lane in this movie is good but i feel like he doesnt have much to do, Sure, he tries to blow up several nuclear bombs with the intention to stop the water supply for three countries, but before he is able to try that, he is really just a McGuffin. Thats really my only flaw with thee movie and to be perfectly honest it doesnt really matter to much.If you enjoyed any of the other movies (except the second one because...well...that was bad,...really...really...bad) then you are going to love this movie!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

I think the best scene for me is when the secretary showed up in the safehouse, TOTALLY UNEXPECTED but it made me feel like there were dire consequences here and the whole scene kept me on the edge. The drawback I have is that immediately when this walker guy came into the picture, well basically was forced upon Ethan I think we all knew he was evil, just from looking at that goofy looking mustache, I don't think he was fooling anybody,solid movie for a solid franchise.

The action scenes are great, the fight scenes look painful. I was wincing as Henry Cavill unloaded barrages of punches.

He absolutely carries the movie (he does his own stunts, but that's for another day) and with the intense action sequences and car/bike/running/? chases taking your breath away, you just sit there and have no choice but to appreciate how lucky we are to have Mr.Cruise doing things old school. Yeah, I'm gushing, and love him or hate him, but my goodness this movie/franchise is his. The plot is fairly easy to follow, but you probably have to be a die-hard fan to recognize some of the peripheral players and plot lines. The movie scoots along nicely and doesn't lose focus.

This is one the same level as the 3rd one. Great action, great pacing, good soundtrack, very cool chasing scenes. There is almost never a dull moment in this movie, which is what I like. I don't really care about deep dialogues, reading between the lines and political crap. Just give me great action scenes, stunning visuals and great filming locations. This movie really doesn't disappoint in that those regards. Highly receommended if you like action moves.

707,danamadeus,Best movie of the summer,10,22 August 2018,"Believe the hype. Mission impossible Fallout is the best film of the summer. It's the best of the series. It's one of the best action films of all time. Tom Cruise brings it once again as international super spy Ethan Hunt, in the first film in the series to directly follow up the previous film. That being the excellent Rogue Nation. The plot of this film deals with the aftermath of Ethan capturing the leader of terrorist organization The Syndicate, Solomon Lane, as his followers seek to carry out the fanatical ideology of mysterious associate John Lark. This film is absolutely full of twists and turns, even for a mission impossible film and it would be a crime to spoil any of the plot here. The set pieces are bigger and more exciting than ever. The action is more intense and high stakes. Returning players Rebecca Fergusson and Alec Baldwin continue to prove excellent additions to the cast while the all new addition of Henry Cavil is absolutely inspired; he is the series strongest nemesis to date. And of course Tom Cruise gives it his all yet again performing absolutely terrifying stunts and running faster than I've ever seen him run before. The film also has the strongest emotional moments of the series since m:I 3, which was my favorite film in the series until now.In every conceivable way, Fallout takes the series to a whole new level. In terms of jaw-dropping stunts, intense high-stakes action and character depth, this film exceeds all expectations and brings the entire series full circle connecting all its previously disparate strands in the most elegant way imaginable. It's also one of the best action films of all time.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

So I enjoyed seeing it. But it struck me that this was a radial departure from the other five MIs. In those, Ethan was always one step ahead. Here, he's sometimes behind, confused, struggling. The scene with Henry Cavil in the bathroom where neither one of them was up to the fight was funny (neither Ethan or Superman can take him!).

710,konporer,Action movie without a brain,5,16 September 2018,"Used to enjoy all the movies Tom Cruise churned out throught out the years and I really hoped i'd also do so for this one, but Fallout just felt too shallowy and empty. I really cant believe my eyes looking at a high rating of 8.1 on imdb. In movies or any story, usually actions are there to achieve a certain goal and to proceed to the next point in a plot, but in this movie it just feels like its the plot are designed around to make this and that kind of certain action scenes happen. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if that's how they put together their plot in the first place, nevertheless, as a result, the plot has gone to the point of even turning off certain percentage of brain will still not prevent you from thinking it as completely ridiculous and preposterous.If you just want to enjoy endless awesome action of top notch production value and visual, this movie wont disappoint, but if you're also looking forward to a story, like the ones in Edge of Tomoorow, Jack Reacher, etc, dont even bother.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
711,rohan-mahey,The best action movie of the summer or even 2018,10,25 July 2018,"This movie exceeded my expectations of the story, the action, the characters and the stunt work. This film is about Ethan Hunt played by Tom Cruise looking for plutonium which he lost in a gunfight in Paris. The plutonium would eventually been used to make a nuclear bomb. So the CIA decides to send August Walker played by Henry Cavill to help him retrieve it. But during the film they have a lot of conflict and a few twists and turns which make it thrilling. The director Christopher Mcquarie makes a thrilling story which from start to finish is brilliant. They also chose a great actors like Henry Cavill playing a villain is actually quite enjoyable and you also see the return of the films previous characters such as Ethan's ex Julia played by Michelle Monaghan and Solomon Lane played by Sean Harris. Now the actions sequences are really really good they are thrilling from the moment the scene starts and end brilliantly. The best actions sequence in this film is when Ethan is chasing August Walker after it's revealed he's a double agent. The amount of jumps from the buildings are tense cause you think he's gonna slip and he does as one the stunts he breaks his ankle and it was shown in the trailer and before in talk shows. The stunt work in this film is brilliant. Every time they do a stunt they top it off with something else later on which is worth it. I would recommend everyone to see this as it's good and watch it in imax so you can see everything bigger like the stunts and action.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
712,madypenn,Not enough gadgets,7,8 December 2018,For me the most fun from these movies comes from the new crazy technology they come up with for the mission and there wasn't any. There weren't enough shenanigans!,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
713,Booglu,Memorable action quality,10,13 October 2020,"I gave this movie 10 out of 10.Dont get me wrong. I gave 10 because the purpose of this movie is what it is claiming to be good at. And it is action, a sense to hold it together also aswell of course.I do not remember too much details about the movie. All I can remember is that my mood wasn't hype or down, it was neutral, and as I finished the movie and left the cinema, I was like wow! The action scenes are really beautiful.Imagine, not being fan of any movie like this in particular and just go to enjoy and you remember the sense that the action scenes were exceptionally well done. That is how I feel about the movie. And I am saying this in these times where making of action scenes are handful, everywhere.
All things considered, it was a remarkable success for me. 10/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

715,bitchard_black,"Spoiler ! Mission impossible is a mere ""meh""",6,11 August 2018,"The 3 sections of the movie that stood out: 1. Intro: i almost got an epileptic shock from the millisecond apart scenes and constant flashing of pictures. I was not able to read, see or understand anything from the intro. A flash of nothing. Not a good start to a movie.2. Middle section: fairly interesting. Sometimes too much plot twisting on plot twists, but still interesting3. This section is called ""the longest 15 minutes of my life""
In a display of pure cliche and a hard try attitude to make a whole movie out of 3 scenes, the 15 minute countdown to the explosion has brought the whole cinema to start laughing and joking each time the timer was shown. The laughter continued after the movie finished. I am not that sure that it is worth the ticket, but i am very sure i will never be re-watching this movie.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
716,forayof,WORTH WATCHING,7,11 June 2021,"Mission Impossible 6 Fallout is the sixth installment of Mission Impossible series. Oscar winning writer Christopher McQuarrie helms as director for second time after Mission Impossible 5 Rogue Nation. Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt for the sixth time and it is his playground and he has done it with elan. Be it bike chase or truck chase or running on foot or hanging precariously on cliffs is really unmatched for the actor at his age. He fractured his leg while doing the giant leap in London across buildings and shooting was stalled for a period. The plotline is complex akin to Mission Impossible first installment. The film opens with Ethan Hunt dreaming and wakes up from sleep in Belfast and hears the doorbell and a messenger delivers his assignment. From here action shifts to Berlin and the mission goes awry as Hunt takes split second decision to save one of his team members and loses out on the three plutonium cores which he is supposed to retrieve ands it ultimately falls into wrong hands that plan to use it for water contamination. CIA chief played by Angela Bassett wants to take over the mission from IMF headed by Hunley played by Alec Baldwin and Ethan Hunt team. So CIA chief sends one of his special operatives assassin August walker played by Henry Cavill to oversee and also somehow claim the credits for the mission by recovering the stolen plutonium. Both of these jump from air to Paris. From this moment it is almost nonstop action. We have arms dealer John Lark and arms broker played by svelte Vanessa Kirby nicknamed white widow who is the daughter of Max from Mission Impossible first part, Solomon Lane, mastermind anarchist played from Sean Harris from Rogue Nation and also Ilsa Faust, a former MI6 played by Rebecca Ferguson with vigor also from Rogue Nation with a mission of her own and Julia, Hunt's ex-wife played by Michelle Monaghan. Hunt is supported by his usual Benji played by Simon Pegg and Stickell played by Ving Rhames. It takes a while to understand and identify the real antagonist of the movie which is revealed with the stabbing of IMF chief. Technically brilliant with excellent visual effects support along with taut story and screenplay as it will enthrall many movie lovers which is rare in the current technology driven days of movie making. Lorne Balfe does justice as composer aided by charismatic Lalo Schifrin theme. Cinematographer Rob Hardy needs special mention for capturing all the aspects in alluring galore which is an asset to this action espionage thriller. Definitely movie lovers who are also lover of sound effects can very well go in for IMAX version. Worth watching hard hitting action thriller in recent times.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
717,tkmcc-08780,Fun but too many inconsistancies,5,4 August 2018,"Based on the reviews I guess I was expecting too much from this movie. Where were the technical consultants? It wasn't long into the movie before I wondered if there were any on the movie staff. The abundance of bad science, Roadrunner physics, medical miracles and technical mistakes really started bothering me early and just got worse. I almost want to see the movie again to count up how many unexplained gizmos there were to increase tension or simply to keep the plot moving. The writing is lazy and depends more heavily on crutches than a ward of amputees. Crack shots that miss at the critical time, elite police forces that can't take the most basic precautions, a pilot who can barely fly makes perfectly timed critical mistakes to move the plot while expertly flying through canyons, equipment that fails at just exactly the right moment - it never stops. And trying to figure out why some characters suddenly do inconsistent things will give you a headache. At some point every hero should have been dead at least once, but were inexplicably spared. I'm pretty sure if they'd fixed all the stuff discussed above the movie would have been an hour shorter.On the plus side, if you can ignore the details the story is fiendishly complicated and twisty. Yeah, you can see some of it coming but I'll bet not most of it. While some of it is a bit silly and over the top, there's lots and lots of action. The camaraderie between the characters is nice to watch - they really click. The acting probably isn't Oscar worthy but pretty much everyone is entertaining.Overall, it's dumbed down entertainment at it best.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

738,gwyckoff,Absolutely *incredible* action sequences. Story makes no sense at all.,6,29 July 2018,"""Action, Action, Action"". Walking into an MI movie (since about #3) you have to accept the fact that there will only be just enough story to setup the incredible Tom Cruise action sequences. MI6 pushes this paradigm to the absolute limit. Some of the shots in this movie will leave you utterly speechless in their beauty and heart-stopping suspense. ""Story? We don't need no stinking story!"". The story, however, is so full of holes and nonsensical events that it does not even merit analysis. It falls apart at the slightest touch. Fortunately this is not a problem; before we have the time to ask questions like ""Why doesn't character X just do Y, it would be so easy?"" we are swept up in another wonderful action sequence.Definitely worth a matinee ticket. Definitely worth seeing in the theater if you love the action genre.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
739,stevenaisbitt,MI = Tom Cruise vanity project.,5,17 February 2019,"Don't get me wrong I like Tom, always have. Great actor, seemingly decent guy (overlooking the scientology). The first two Missions were good. But as they've gone on, they've gotten more and more preposterous, frankly. Each new mission outdoes the last in set pieces designed to do just one thing - show you Tom doing his own ludicrously dangerous stunts. Or fooling you into believing its all Tom all the time. No plot spoilers in this review.There isn't much plot. Nuclear threat, blah blah. Rouge former agent turned anarchist with a personal grudge against Ethan Hunt, blah blah blah. Stupidly inappropriate humor injected at every junction between the members of Tom's IMF team. I mean, they're supposed to be saving the world, yet they can stop to piss about and quip the damn time? This one has Henry Cavil roided to hell and playing a dumb thug with a neck bigger than his head. Over hyped and over rated. I was playing with my phone forty minutes in, to be honest. I give it a 5, for the obvious work put in to make this. Story wise however? Very weak and absolutely nothing new or remotely innovative.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
740,iamarnold,THE NEW TOM CRUISE MOVIE.,10,27 July 2018,"In 2015, I watched MI Rogue Nation and saw Tom Cruise clinging of an Air Bus 5000 feet high. I thought, how is any movie going to match this stunt? Three years later, the same Tom Cruise did a HALO jump from an altitude of 25,000 feet. Now I'm thinking, HOW IS ANY MOVIE GOING TO MATCH THIS STUNT?! 
I mean you can't just do things like this at the age of 56. Mission Impossible Fallout is the best mission movie yet. It's the coordination of the stunts that amazed me the most. The opening scene and the events until the first stunt scene gave an excellent boost for the film. The story takes off rapidly and keeps jumping from one action scene to the next. 
Every bit of action gives you a sense of enthusiasm. You can actually feel it's environment. The cinematography and editing stand out. And this time, the music really heightens the thrill. Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt is finally fully unleashed. Every mission movie is about Ethan doing the extreme but this time it's more like exploring what's beyond the extreme. The way Tom handles every scene is a spectacle. Putting your body on the line to give the audience the best cinematic experience, how many actors do that these days? 
Henry Cavill without the cape is a perfect fit for the film. 
Also, it was good to have Rebecca Fergusson back with the classic mission cast. Vanessa Kirby impresses as the ""White Widow"". Helicopter sequence, Paris motorcycle chase, London rooftop chase, HALO jump, bathroom fight, I love everything about Fallout. Again, all the stunts are practically done.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

About The Action Sequences, Only the Paris Chase and ""Tom Running"" Scenes Stood Out. The Last Helicopter Chase Wasn't that Good. They were cutting back and forth to Benji and Elsa which made it less intense. To Simply Put, This Movie has A weak Plot and The Villain's Motivation isn't that Clear. Also, Michelle Monaghan's Charater was tottaly Unecessary. Remove her and the Movie would still Work. PS Tom Acting was a bit dull(due to Age?) But I Can Forgive that. He's A Great Actor Anyway.

This is not in the same class as Raiders or Last Crusade. But as a spy action, this is the best. I marvel at the acting, everyone brings their A game. Mr. Cruise and Mr. Cavill are fantastic. Henry Cavill is mountain of a man who is both believable and a monster. Tom is Tom. Believable, charming, and a powerhouse. I will say this, his zest for doing stunts is outrageously fun to watch. He has all my respect because there were timeS with an S I said WOW! outloud. He truly gives it his all for his craft to give the audience something special everytime and draw them in closer. The rest of the team is equally fantastic. I can't get enough of Rebecca Ferguson. She is a pure pleasure to watch. This movie is long, but there is so much to be had and something for everyone. I can't say enough good thing about this film. Mr. Mcquarrie writing and direction are fantastic and someone who DC should look to to bring on to direct Mr Cavill in the next Superman.

751,thejasvi,Truly brilliant,10,28 July 2018,"I tend not to write reviews here for films that kind of don't need them, for example if a film is something I feel is under or over rated, I'll review, or if something just really completely irks me I'll review. I rarely if ever review something that is really good, and critically well received. So why am I reviewing MI6? Because it was just that good, and I can't think of a single visual franchise with the, whether it be books, or games that tops itself in it's 6th iteration. Fair enough, you could argue, the MI films are about spectacle rather than character, so much like James Bond, it's not hard to repeat and improve. I would argue however, that especially in today's wealth of excellent media available to us, that such a feat really isn't that straightforward, and that MI6 is somewhat of a marvel. And it's star is someone who is not without controversy. Maybe not the damning controversy of many others in the industry, but I know people who just can't ignore the fact he is a scientologist. Frankly I've never cared, because he's such a good actor, unlike others, you never see him give anything less than 120%, and that's personally all I need to know. And in this film he literally brakes bones and bleeds for the audience, and the guy is in his 50's. There's a almost primitive and macabre nature to his performance in MI6, akin to Chaplin, Keaton and Chan. It's easy to ignore just what he's doing and assume we're watching CGI trickery, for sure there's countless safety measures in place and clever VFX, but still, I cannot commend the man enough for his physical performance in this film, it's simply breathtaking.That alone could be enough to deem the film worthy in it's own right. But then, you get bonus upon bonus, a truly outstanding action thriller script by McQuarrie, and virtually faultless direction. Everything in this film is on point, the pacing is near perfect, with the action, save for one main chase scene, always pushing the story along, leading up to one of the best finales I can think of seeing in recent memory. The only real flaw I can point out is that some of the supporting characters get somewhat relegated by the 3rd act, as a result of needing to appease too many pre-existing storylines from previous films, but it was a tricky puzzle to solve for a writer/director coming into a franchise after 4 films, where the main character is meant to be a vehicle, a tool if you will, rather than be a character weighed down with too much. It's a fine balance to tread. But in today's world it's not enough to merely have an action lead like Bond, who has zero backstory and zero personal stakes, beyond saving the world and saving the girl. McQuarrie, Cruise, Abrams and co have done a very good job of taking the character beyond his first 2 iterations. (For the record I HATE MI2, it's just dumb AF). I may need to watch it again to appreciate any flaws or shortcomings, but from the initial viewing, and from someone who went in expecting a lot, I have to say I was not disappointed in the least, along with Avengers Infinity War, this was a sequel and major tentpole film that exceeded and delivered on my expectations. Something I haven't been able to say for some time when it comes to huge budget films. This is most definitely a film you HAVE to see in theaters, if anything for the genuine rollercoaster that is the last 20 minutes. If you like action/thriller/espionage films and aren't overly concerned about absolute realism, and appreciate that films can be an escape and sometime tool for fantasy and imagination, then you will completely adore this film.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The story of this movie has a lot of twists, & changes with time. There are a lot of sudden & unexpected dramatic twists that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.
As we have seen in previous parts the humor of Benji (Simon Pegg) issame as his all previous parts. He maintained his character as it was in previous. There are no changes. The oldest cast member from first part is still in this movie with tom cruise who is none other than Luther (Ving Rhames).

756,forchennfederation,One of the Best Spy/Action Movies Out There!,10,10 November 2018,"As a fan of action movies as well as someone who enjoys spy film, I dig the Mission: Impossible series starring Tom Cruise. So, naturally, I was very much pumped to the return of the franchise in Mission: Impossible - Fallout, as well as the return of Christopher McQuarrie in the director's chair (who previously did the 5th film the series, Rogue Nation) and the return of Cruise as Ethan Hunt. The critical acclaim that this film got upon release also increased my anticipation for it, as I feel that a great action movie is one that is not only technically well-made but also one that can grip you and have you on the edge of your seat during the set pieces. I am more than happy to say that Mission: Impossible - Fallout did not disappoint me in the slightest. I can go on, with full conviction, in saying that it's the best M:I film by far (the favorite one was previously Rogue Nation, but now it's Fallout), it's one of the best action films of the past 10 years, and it's the best spy film I've seen since Skyfall of the 007 franchise. Now, all that being said, I'm gonna dive right in and further elaborate on why I feel the way I do about this movie.First of all, the action scenes are very well-made and very impressive to say the least. Christopher McQuarrie very much has an eye in shooting his action sequences in a way that immerse you. Whether it's a sequence involving Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) skydiving out of a plane or an intense car/motorbike chase in Paris or a helicopter dogfight, the action scenes in this movie are shot and directed so masterfully and they also evoke so much tension to make the viewer hold their breath whenever things are about to go down. It also very much helps in adding to the suspense when it's Tom Cruise himself doing all the stunt work in the movie; it adds an extra layer of realism and suspense seeing this man actually doing these death-defying stunts, thus making you care about what's gonna happen to Ethan Hunt even more.The cast all-around does a great job in this movie. Tom Cruise definitely brings his A-game as Ethan Hunt; he's intense when events that transpire in the movie call for it, and he can pull off providing some levity when he needs to. Cruise has also always been great at providing stunt work throughout the M:I films, but, in Fallout, it's like he took that experience he got as his own stuntman and honed it in over the years and then it all paid off in a big way. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames both do a great job as Benji and Luther respectively, who bring in some great comic relief that doesn't compromise the movie's overall tone. Rebecca Ferguson returns to her role from RN as Ilsa Faust, and seeing her come back as the badass spy who has her own goals in mind (goals which carry over from RN and which one can understand) is quite a treat. Henry Cavill (along with his mustache) plays August Walker, a CIA agent brought in by Angela Bassett's character to watch over Hunt after he and his IMF crew failed on an important mission which sets the plot in motion; Cavill does a great job playing off of Cruise with the banter amongst each other and Cavill also does awesome work in the action in the movie, including in a brutal fight scene set in the restroom. Sean Harris returns as the villain Solomon Lane and he gives a menacing performance as he did in his character's debut back in RN, except here there's the extra layer of menace added to this character as he seeks revenge against Hunt and the IMF for taking down his Syndicate in the last movie; you totally get why Hunt would want this guy locked behind walls of concrete with the key thrown away, making Lane the only villain in the M:I movies who can rival and even surpass the menace of Philip Seymour Hoffman villain character in M:I III.The plot/storyline, while it's certainly not much that we haven't seen before in other spy movies and even certain twists can be seen coming, was still very riveting. Our heroes, particularly Ethan Hunt, made the mistake of saving one of their own from the bad guys, the newly-anointed Apostles, in priority over securing the plutonium, which was their real mission; that error would then bite Hunt and company as they have to find a way to correct it before the Apostles could use the plutonium for diabolical means, and one would be rooting for Hunt and company because of their comradery which makes them very much likable and worth caring about. It's the characters being worth caring about that also gives that much more weight to the action and suspense that has the viewer white-knuckling throughout the film. Even the certain twists that take place in the movie have purpose and they all line up and make sense within the plot itself and given what's established throughout this series.When it comes to the score, Lorne Balfe has done an incredible job providing the music for the film. People would consider the score for the film to be very similar to Hans Zimmer, but one has to keep in mind that Balfe was a protege of Zimmer's. And, I can honestly say that the student has become the master as Balfe did not just do a fantastic score in M:I - Fallout, but he even made a score that was better than Zimmer's within the same franchise (with Zimmer having done the score of M:I 2).When it's all said and done, Mission: Impossible - Fallout was an amazing action/spy film and was an overall great time at the cinema. The cast was great, the directing was beyond top notch, the action scenes were wonderfully-crafted, and the movie itself has set a new standard in what to expect in action films. I'll very much look forward to what we get down the road from this series, although this film is certainly gonna be a hard one to top. M:I - Fallout gets an absolutely strong recommendation from me; it's among my absolute favorite movies of 2018 and it is also one of my favorite spy films of all time.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

758,VicTanner44,Excellent movie all around (8.5 stars),8,27 July 2018,"This is as good as an action movie can get and an amazing sequel of sequels. It's good enough to warrant the absolute recommendation to see it IN the theater (Dolby is my preference). I'll also point out what the movie did not have, which contributed to my 8.5 stars. I didn't recognize too much PC hidden agenda crap. It was just a great action movie, acted well, written well, and filmed well. I believe in the 10 star continuum, so I'll mention that for me 10 is reserved strictly for films I found truly extraordinary, and always will (not likely to exceed 5 in total). 9 stars is obviously just short of that and still must have significant long term impact for me to attribute. Thus, I'm just providing context to convey that MI Fallout is definitely a 10 with respect to action movies in my opinion.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The plot twists are so heavily signposted you can see them coming a mile off. The only thing that makes this film barely watchable is seeing the usual Tom Cruise stunts and knowing that he broke his ankle doing one of them.

The plot, the twists, the chases, the fights, the sky dives and oh boy the action sequences.....pure thrill and fun.
While being over-the-top has been the name of the game in the franchise, the movie adds so much natural element that every thing seems so real and takes the film to a whole new league of Action super-blockbusters, within and beyond the franchise.

763,jsimbumbu,Good movie. Exceeded expectations! WELL DONE!,8,25 July 2018,"Ok. Where do I begin. 
Pros:
Before watching Mission Impossible 6, I rewatched Mission Impossible 1 (Tom Cruise 1996) and also watched Mission Impossible 5. Both films I couldn't complete watching. They were too long and just seemed to drag on. That did not happen this time! It started slow (first 5-10 minutes) and then suddenly exploded into an action packed great movie. Music was revamped and sounded better than in any previous MIs. Fighting scenes were exactly as they would be if I was directing the film so this is by far the best sequel in the history of sequels for a 6th in the series. They worked hard. They didn't cash in. All star cast too. 
Cons:
1. The fake English accent from one of the women (Rebecca Ferguson who plays Ilsa). For some strange reason Americans love fake English accents. We (English) hate it! You wouldn't like to hear a fake American accent, why on Earth do you expect us to tolerate fake English accents! Stop it! Seriously. You're alienating an entire country just to please yourselves.
2. Too long. They're all way too long. 
That's enough to drag the mark down to 8/10. Perhaps 7/10 but that would be unfair considering the numerous positives and the fact that this is by far the best film I've seen in at least 2-3 years. 
Was I entertained? Yes. Was it an enjoyable movie? Certainly.Therefore it deserves a 9. Great scenery. Great stunts. Great chasing scenes with the correct dose of realism & humour. Good acting. Great music (I know I've said this before but they really improved the Mission Impossible score).The plot has been kept reasonably straight forward. In some of the previous Mission Impossibles they tried so hard to complicate the plot you'd have been forgiven for thinking you were back in school studying for an exam! Too many cooks spoiling the broth. This time it felt like they fought against making that mistake for as long as they possibly could.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
764,jsimbumbu,Great movie and I'm very difficult to please!,8,26 July 2018,"I'll keep this brief and simple and there's NO SPOILERS.
Pros: Music/Score is brilliant 10/10. Scenery: Excellent. Plot is kept simple & straight forward. Acting: All star cast pretty much. Very good. Pace is reasonable. Entertainment factor, which is why we go to the cinema and watch a movie in the first place is 10/10.
Cons: 1. Loses marks because (being English) I can't stand fake English accents in movies. Rebecca Ferguson's (Isla) accent is fake. -1. Simon Pegg's is authentic.
2. Film is too long but then they all are. 
In summary. Go and watch this film. You will be entertained.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

However, while the stunts have become increasingly dramatic and unique, each has simply been very entertaining. The acting has always been good and the story plausible, I'm not saying otherwise, but they were just action movies.This one is different. Is it perfect? No. Few movies are. It has a very good, deep storyline. The acting is still great. The stunts are just amazing. The cinematography is good. Locations are fun and exotic. It's the first one that as the scenes happen, most of them you can look at and go ""that could happen"".Definitely a must-see.

777,mesun-716-429723,"Good Graphics, Weak villian and plot",6,3 August 2018,"I am a staunch fan of MI franchise, Tom's deep dedication and chemistry among actors like Benji and Luthor. But this movie was little too much let down.
Why and why in this world Henry Cavil was taken in a villainous role ? CGI Movies like Avengers fares better because of a convincing villain like Thanos but in this case Walker and Lane's character has been shown so weak and stupid that it really spoilt the tremendous work done by Tom. I am not even going to explain over the top plot holes like why certain character was doing what for which reason because this is a movie, not a novel study but this installment was not engaging at all, the tricks were same old and story so predictable. Isla Faust's role is hardly justified although her performance is really good while doing action scenes. Photography is good, not so a great piece of art but you must see this movie in 3D to really enjoy the stunts and scenes. The literally non-existent challenger to Tom's spy prowess was biggest disappointment for me. I would watch it again for Tom's stunts and may be for Benji's humour but nothing else.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
778,Zenblonde,We burn the bridges when we get there...,10,24 July 2018,"Tom Cruise did it again. This movie is full of outrageous, impossible and breathtaking stunts.

The backdrop are beautiful locations in Europe as well as in Kashmir. The ensemble cast including Alec Baldwin don't disappoint and deliver the funny one liners and masks we are used to by now. The last great movie star and or stunt man knows how to entertain even today, when movie theatre owners have to compete with Fast Food joints, Second Screens, Social Media etc. If you get to watch this picture on an Imax Screen, even better. Enjoy the ride, while it lasts and try not to fall off this wild runaway train. How about doing a Ethan Hunt James Bond face off, mesh up? Spoiler Alert: The elements are already in the works in this fine movie Picture.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
779,Maugeh,What was this?,3,11 August 2018,"I didn't even recognize this as a mission impossible movie. All the characters felt somehow different. 
The action was quite unbelieveable and not in a good way, it didn't have any wit to it as in ghost protocol. Most of the action scenes were just mindless car chasing with nice camera angles, nothing else. Bathroom scene felt like taken from true lies, and van scene felt like it was taken from dark knight, hell even the music sounded the same as in dark knight. 
Just when I felt the plot suprised me a little, some other plot twist comes which dumbs the last one down and makes the movie feel more stupid. 
Near the halfway mark I was ready to leave the theater. 
If you're going to see this movie I implore you to reconsider and watch ghost protocol or some good action movie like Taken instead.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
780,anubhavchakrabortya,Ethan Hunt saves the world again.,7,25 August 2018,Probably the best of the series with the team going around world to prevent the nuclear weapon to blow. The action sequences are breath taking but we can see the age factor getting the best of Tom cruise. Henry Cavill played an impressive antagonist and had a good supporting role. The story is quite monotonous with the team just someone saving the world in the nick of time which was the only thing which lacked genuinenes. Overall it was a thrilling experience and a must watch.,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
781,omarmazin,Breath taking action movie,9,29 July 2018,"With ""ghost protocol"" they really perfected the MI formula, so with the last 3 MI movies they keep getting better and better.
For a generic story of (bad guy with mass destruction sort of a weapon) this one is one if not the best like i said it's cliche but the way the story unfolds (the script) it's amazing woth twist and turns you can't trust anyone either they're wearing a mask or they're double agents , and that really adds tension to the plot.
As for the action it's really good -mad max fury road kind of good-. In conclusion you love action movies/spy movies you owe it to yourself to see this film.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

785,alleykirstie,"Please, bury this franchise.",3,15 August 2018,"Maybe I need to flip a coin, because I don't know which is worse; Giving 10 stars to promote the movie or giving 10 stars to save Tom Cruise's ego problems. Movies with pay-per-hype ratings are destroying the film industry by drowning their credibility. This franchise is a joke. Rating a movie before anyone has seen it is a dead giveaway. It's a repetitive, predictable, and has zero heart. This is an over-hyped, cliched, boring magic trick. 10 star reviews might trick people out of their cash, but it will also destroy careers and the industry creating bait & switch films.Two years after the capture of a bad man; the remains of his organization reform into another all white terrorist group. Tom Cruise is given a mission to return stolen plutonium before they sell them to a ""fundy"". Tom recruits Ving Rhames & Simon Pegg for the mission. They fail when Tom chooses to save Ving's acting career over the lives of millions the plutonium will surely cause. They then decide to capture a nuclear weapons expert from a country that doesn't have a single nuclear power plant, because ""Why not?""CIA boss Angela Bassett instructs Mustached-Superman to secretly follow Tom Cruise while he tries to get the plutonium. But Tom easily recognizes Mustached-Superman without his Clark Kent glasses. Soon Tom and Mustached-Superman sneak into a fundraiser party for arms dealers together. They track a man they suspect is a ""fundy"", but that guy is killed by the Swedish lady from the other 'MI' movies (She was in 'Life' with Ryan Reynolds). Tom quickly puts on the same terrible make-up disguise he uses in the other movies (a beard, but not one he's married to) and he meets up with another Swedish actress - the woman from Netflix's 'The Crown'. Tom warns her that terrorists have been sent to kill her and they run. Mustached-Superman tells Angela Bassett that Tom Cruise has always been the ""fundy"" he's disguised as. I went to the bathroom, because I had a Big Gulp an hour ago.Here's where it gets really dull and stupid: In order to get the plutonium, the woman from Netflix recruits Tom Cruise to rescue that same bad guy he captured two years ago (The guy from 'The Borgias' ... kinda looks like an old Prince Harry). Coincidentally (or lasily) enough; the bad guy is in a the back of an armored van convoy right there in the same city as Tom Cruise. The Netflix chick gives one of the plutoniums to Tom as a payment, so at least he's accomplished 1/8 of his original mission. It was about here I wondered where the hell did Ving Rhames & Simon Pegg go? Tom and Mustached-Superman do a bunch of unnecessary stuff that becomes a car chase through Paris. Ving & Simon reappear to save the Borgias bad guy. That first Swedish lady from before comes back (She was in 'Life' with Ryan Reynolds). She wants to kill Borgias to prove that she's loyal to the British CIA. But she doesn't, so I guess she's not. They rescue the bad guy and Netflix woman instructs the team to deliver the bad guy to London. I started looking at my watch wondering if it was ending - It was not.In London, we learn that Alec Baldwin is the secretary of the Impossible Mission Force (IMF). Alec confronts Tom about being the ""fundy"". Tom denies it. Alec Baldwin gets knocked out. It ends and I don't know what the point was. Tom, Ving & Simon trick Mustached-Superman into admitting he is the real ""fundy"". Apparently Mustached-Superman is working with Borgias guy and the terrorists. Let me try to explain this elaborate nonsense - They stole plutonium to get Tom Cruise branded as a nuclear terrorist. In reality Tom Cruise felt threatened by Mustached-Superman's goodlooks. Tom tells Angela Bassett, who instructs a United States team of agents to detain all of the United Kingdom agents. Tjhis movie is way too long. The CIA team has somehow been taken over by the terrorists and Mustached-Superman orders them to kill everyone. Mustached-Superman kills Alec Baldwin and escapes. Tom Cruise chases Mustached-Superman, but for all the running Tom does in everything he's in - he doesn't catch him. Mustached-Superman then threatens the life of one of Tom's estranged wives, Michelle Monaghan (She played Maggie in 'True Detective' - Oh, she did the voice of Wonder Woman in Justice League War' - neat). The Tom Cruise Flunkies decide that the Borgias guy will detonate the two remaining nuclear weapons over a glacier and contaminate the water supply of China. With a third of its population affected, the Chinese will get mad and Borgias hopes Hollywood will stop using them to make their films overseas. Borgias activates the weapons and gives the detonator to Mustached-Superman. Tom Cruise pursues him in a helicopter, leaving Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and Rebecca Ferguson (The nicer Swedish lady) to stay on the ground too watch Tom pressumably die in a helicopter, because that's how predictable the plot is. Ving Rhames and Wonder Woman find one bomb and poke it with a stick, but they are unable to defuse it. Rebecca Ferguson and Simon Pegg are also on the ground to worry about Tom when he eventually rams his helicopter into Mustached-Superman's invisible jet. They find the second weapon just as easily as Ving and Wonder found the other one, but they also capture the Borgias bad guy. It looks like the movie is rapping it up. After a long waste of time ( as predicted) Tom Cruise crashes his helicopter into Mustached-Superman's aircraft. Both of them survive and start fighting on a cliff edge where Mustached-Superman is killed. It seems to me he could have just dies in the crash. Tom Cruise gets control of the detonator, allowing Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, and Wonder Woman to deactivate the bombs, because that's how simple and basic nuclear weapons work. Angela Bassett hands the Borgias dude over to MI6 through the Swedish lady who gave Tom some plutonium, which somehow earns the other Swedish woman her exoneration. Tom Cruise recovers recovers from his injuries with the help of vitamins and exercise while Wonder Woman and the other cast join him in victory. The credits roll and there's a warning that noone will stop making these movies - especially in China.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

From my perspective the best action movie and overall one of the best cinema experiences in this century. Usually not a big fan of 3D but in this movie it really works well and I never felt 3D was as good in any other movie I have seen before. The action is always fabulous but never seems ridiculous or too much over the top. Also, if you enjoy movies like Inception, True Lies, Interstellar, Tron, Ronin, etc. you will love this movie. The diversity of action scenes and of visual impressions throughout the movie is really immense and absolutely enjoyable. The cast really acts very well together and the script delivers funny moments throughout without diluting the movie and making it too much of a comedy. It is also really great to see Tom Cruise running full speed and full of adrenalin through the entire movie in a way we have seen him doing in so many other movies before (I first noticed that he enjoys running through his movies when watching the Firm in cinema). If you bear in mind that Mr. Cruise is a superstar of cinema for more than thirty years and you see him delivering such a superb performance in this movie, you must admit that still being on top of things after so many years is really an extraordinary achievement hardly matched by anybody. A movie which deserves a lot of credit, an extraordinary rating and much box office success!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Tom Cruise is super human lol at the age of 56 he still pulls off a great action sequence and does most of the stunts himself. This movie brings some of the old characters together, kind of enclosing the entire saga. And ended with a similar scene like the first MI cliff hiking scene, almost like paying tribute and saying ""This might just be the end"". Hoping not though. The direction was on point. The pace brilliant. I was always edge of my seat, so much so that my freind was like dude you okay?Only drawback was it did get a bit confusing in the beginning and it got over so sooon! Henry Cavill seemed a little off and trying hard im the movie.Other than that..its this years blockbuster!!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
801,daflixx,Wow...,9,15 August 2018,"The most complete action movie i ve seen in a long time and i ve seen a lot. It was stunning. It felt intense and very real, just as it had almost no cgi in it. The screenplay was very convincing. Cruise was (again) just great although i dont like his real ego. Anyhow : Hunt owns Bond. A very pleasing production. Lets hope they add aa few movies to the franchise.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
802,opszanski,Tom Cruise is Apparently the Greatest Human Being that has Ever Lived,6,17 August 2018,"I'm not a big fan of the ""bash a movie just because it's popular"" mentality that you see here on IMDB. It is literally impossible for a blockbuster to appear without hoards of butthurt assholes posting reviews complaining about how it's ""the worst movie ever made and it gave me leprosy"". So I never want to do this, but this movie.... something about it just pissed me off.The movie itself is perfectly serviceable as an action movie and well made. Went to see it in one of those interactive D-boxes and for the most part it was fun with lots of crazy set pieces - which is all everyone really comes for in a Mission Impossible movie. In that sense, What I say here probably won't change any minds since people are just looking for a fun time. And hey, if that's you, then go and enjoy yourself with the biggest screening you can find because this movie gets pretty insane.So what is the problem I'm alluding to? It boils down to two words: Tom Cruise. Christ, does this movie idolize him (he pretty much is Jesus Christ). Behind the crazy action, you start to see what this movie truly is - a $200 million vanity film. I mean, I guess it's not uncommon since a lot of times these movies are made to make these Hollywood actors feel like they're the most awesome and badass human beings alive, but this is just childish. Everyone in this movie cannot shut up about how brilliant Ethan Hunt is; how changed a life, how he is protecting the world, how he cured cancer and saved the rain forest while bringing world peace on his way back from ending hunger in Africa. Oh, but in spite of his irresistible charm and inhuman physical endurance, he is such a tragic and sympathetic character. He has so much weight on his shoulders that we must all marvel and how all he copes with all the hardships he must deal with. What a hero, we must all love him because he is just so wonderful.If you hadn't noticed, the character worship completely took me out of the movie. I think the moment it truly hit me was when people wouldn't stop yapping about how ""Ethan can never make the cold choices and is too merciful"". This culminates when Ethan and his entourage are fleeing the French police and almost make it before running into a simple patrol officer. Everyone thinks she should be shot before an alarm is raised, but not Tom Cruise - because he is such a gentle and wonderful soul. And of course since this is just a random patrol officer in the middle of France, she has to be ridiculously attractive with the look like a supermodel, so Ethan does everything he can to let her go. But then the evil bad guys show up and shoot her instead. Oh no! What is Ethan going to do before the bad guys finish her off? Of course he's going to go into ""white knight"" mode and shoot 5 armed men before anyone can move, and then going to help the supermodel officer before she dies of her injuries. What a wonderful man. Have we mentioned how awesome Tom Cruise is?In short, everything in this film is done to make Tom Cruise look like the perfect man. If you ever watch ""Going Clear"" the Scientology documentary, there is a part on Tom Cruise where they say everyone is ordered to treat him like a God. The entire church of Scientology is essentially there to pump up his ego and make him feel like he's the savior of mankind - and wow, do you see that same mentality in this movie. It must be nice to have everyone in your little bubble tell you how great you are, but it is nauseating to sit through a two hour film of it.This isn't just me being jealous or envious or something like that. I mean, who wouldn't love being a Hollywood actor and make so much money, right? But this is all just stuff I really find pathetic about some people. It's like a 8 year old's idea of a perfect life. I wouldn't be surprised if Ethan sleeps in a race car bed with posters of himself all over the walls. Or maybe that's just Tom Cruise.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

805,mkbbd,Thought this was a typical Mission Impossible movie like the previous ones with gadgets but no this MI was bit different,9,24 December 2018,Tom Cruise and Henry Cavil...though odd combination did an excellent job in this movie and I am impressed by the stunts of Tom Cruise. The movie is highly enjoyable and there are some scenes that reminded me of The Dark Knight when Batman was helpless but not stoppable. The action sequences were top notch and excellent and the music felt more engaging like the first Mission Impossible movie. This time there was no James Bond Stuff and it felt like Ethan's Team did a great job along with Ethan Hunt. I would highly recommend everyone of all ages to watch this movie once if you like the Mission Impossible series and this one I think is the best of all previous ones.,Mission - Impossible - Fallout

807,Amritz101,My top 5 action movie of all time!!! And NO annoying shaky cam!!,10,16 August 2018,"The plot is easy to follow. Ensure you've seen the last 3 MI movies to enrich your viewing experience of this one. Tom Cruise rocks! This is why I love seeing his action movies because he does most of the physical stunts amazingly himself. Also, there are no annoying shaky cam, fast edits, close ups, and/or off the center framing of the action scenes to hide: lazy action sequences, actors' terrible physicality *cough Scarlet Johanssen cough* and/or blatant stunt doubles! Total viewing immersion and the suspension of disbelief does not get broken at all! I'm not sure if Rebecca Ferguson and Henry Cavill used stunt doubles because that's how great the action stunts are - all perfectly seamless between actors and stunt doubles! My pet peeve when seeing action movies is when the stunts including even running are so blatantly done by the stunt doubles *cough Scarlet Johanssen's lame Black Widow cough*. BTW Emily Blunt or Rebecca Ferguson would've played a better Black Widow because they have the physique/stature, athletic physicality, and a great wide range acting chops which would've done justice to the comics Black Widow!Fallout has great pacing, great action scenes/stunts, great acting, great directing, great music, great locations, great cinematography...........just all round great/amazing! I can't believe the time went by so quickly. This movie is total entertainment and deserves B.O. success, awards, and recognition. Fallout is best viewed on the big screen. Fallout is the best MI movie followed by Rogue Nation.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
808,kuan-joe,"It's not Mission Impossible. It's more like Tom Cruise, the greatest showman.",5,22 August 2018,"Mission Impossible is all about the cleverness team work and gadgets together to pull out the trick and retreat without anyone notice. This style of agent movie has been long gone after the first Mission Impossible. These days Mission Impossible movies are just about selling how great Tom Cruise is. One man band, the other team members are just chauffeurs and fill in the dialogues.Twist on top of twist on top of twist on top o twist. When it comes to agent movies (I watch every single one, I am sucker to agent movie), the number one requirement is to keep it (the story) simple, stupid (KISS rule). That's why (The Bourne Identity) was so good and with great actions.The uninspired & convoluted story is to give Tom Cruise the chance to full out the stunts. He has the balls of steel to pull the stunts but as far as the movie goes, the whole package is just lacklustre.

813,CalebBee,All the movies have lead up to this moment!,9,27 July 2018,"Creatively written and beautifully pieced together, Mission Impossible: Fallout satisfies the desire to see Tom Cruise and his team impossibly complete the mission and come out alive. The sixth installment of the MI series blows me away when it comes to piecing together a movie in a franchise with a long history. It isn't perfect, but is about as close as it could be.It's stressful, intriguing, and fun. There were many callbacks to the past films, right alongside a fresh one, and that is why this movie gets a 9/10. you",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
814,The_Dman313,Mission Impossible: Fallout Aims High and Hits its Target,8,3 September 2018,"The lights start to dim, the movie screen widens, and I am subjected to the many company logos that made this film possible. Suddenly, as I sit there in the movie theater, notepad by my side, the iconic Mission Impossible music begins to play and immediately I am sucked in.Mission Impossible: Fallout is the 6th film in the Mission Impossible franchise and by all accounts the best one yet. It follows Ethan Hunt, played by Tom Cruise;who has been playing this character since the first Mission Impossible, back in 1996. He's the type of heroic character that we have all grown used to. He's smarter, stronger, and wittier than any of the bad guys that he fights, and has a habit of getting out of any situation in just the nick of time. This time, after a mission goes wrong, him, the IMF team, along other familiar faces will have to combat the terrorist group known as ""The Syndicate"". With one or 2 characters from the previous movies, this time he'll be accompanied by the loyal Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), the tech expert and comic relief Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), and the arrogant August Walker (Henry Cavill), who seems the get in Ethan's way more than he can help. With that I can't give anymore away, without spoiling the last two films in the process . I do find it necessary to watch the last 2 films, (Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation). For the fact of how much it adds to the film to know the relationships and backstories of these character, and in order to understand the characters involved and the role of which ""The Syndicate"" plays and the characters involved and they are also both solid movies that deserve at least part of your time.One of the defining aspects of this movie is the action. From the opening mission gone wrong, to the skydiving sequence that seems to all happen in one uninterrupted shot, to the harrowing helicopter chase near the end, this is a story that's told through its action. Acclaimed film critic Roger Ebert from The Chicago Sun-Times described it best, when speaking on the 4th film Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, saying that it achieves a sort of action poetry. The script, for what it is, is great. One of the best parts about is is that it allows for these action sequences to happen one after the other, and this fast pace keeps the film from possibly being bogged down by its complex plot or use of exposition. Another thing to admire about the writing of this film is the constant use of the twist. Things in this film constantly change from being one thing to the other and the same with the majority of the characters. There are constantly moments in the film which lead to my jaw being dropped with an ""oh my god"" expression on my face. If I were to give any flaws to this film, it would probably only have to do with the Mission Impossible franchise and the style of these movies as a whole. I find that some viewers might get annoyed with the overt complexity of the plot and action, feeling that what it leads up to could be done much quicker, instead of this film's length of 147 minutes (I must add that however long that may seem for a movie to be, it does not feel that way. The fast pace means that something is constantly happening to the point that this almost two and a half hour movie only feels less than two.). I can also understand some viewers becoming annoyed with some of the conveniences in this film, how Ethan Klein seems to get through everything even when by all accounts he shouldn't have, or how him and his crew always seem to get rid of the threat just 1 to two seconds before it would have been too late.In conclusion, this is a film for just about anyone. Its action packed but it's well-written at the same time, it's funny but also serious and melancholy when it has to, and it's a crowd pleaser but at the same time critically acclaimed (look no further than the 97% rating on RottenTomatoes.com). I remember seeing an elderly couple at the showing I went to, and seeing them gasp at the same twists, laugh at the same jokes, and after coming out of the theater looking satisfied just as I had. This is a movie that I feel has a little bit for everyone.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
815,FredTipp,A short one....,9,9 August 2018,"First, Fallout is definitely one of the best movies in the MI-series. Just see it because of that. However - together with the IMAX/3D experience it is absolutely AWESOME!!! It's filmed in a way that will suck your stomach out whenever they parachute or jump from high buildings.

816,zero-to-HERO,Should I Choose To Accept Rating This Film? Yes! Because It Was Worth Every Penny! Now It's Your Mission To Go See It!,9,30 July 2018,"Good lord where do I start? Mission: Impossible - Fallout had it all in regards to being an action packed espionage themed film. There's so much to talk about that instead I'm just going to try and keep it simple... Was there a lot of action (Yes). Was it suspenseful (Yes). Was the cinematography done right (Yes). And was the plot at least half decent (Yes).As for the actors/actresses, everyone did a splendid job! Tom Cruise (playing Ethan Hunt) at 56 seems more fit & agile than most people in their teens, twenties or thirties (let alone forties & fifties). The insane stunts he pulled blew my mind! And although he was the lead actor in this movie, he still knew how to divert your focus on the other actors/actresses equitably. And of course Ethan's trusty sidekicks Benji Dunn (played by Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (played by Ving Rhames) did their part as always but this time with seemingly more seasoned acting capacities.I feel with this film it's quite easy to 'accidentally' give parts of the movie away, so instead in correlation with the other actors all I can say is you won't be disappointed. From Henry Cavil (playing August Walker), to Rebecca Ferguson (playing Ilsa) and more... everyone seemed to have been made for their roles in this installment of Mission: Impossible. Mission: Impossible - Fallout was simply a Mission: Successful rating! Go watch it - it's actually worth every penny (considering the cost of going to the movies these days).",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

820,zdfranz,"Wonderfully fun, if lacking depth.",8,2 August 2018,"""The Last Movie Star.""If one were to write a biography of Tom Cruise, that would have to be the title. Over the past several decades, Hollywood has come to rely less and less on the draw of large personalities. Most blockbusters are now marketed with spectacle and imagery, not names above the title. Yet Cruise remains. Like a dogged survivor in one of his films, he's living history stalking the tall grass of change, continually proving his own industry wrong.And, if ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is any indication, he has no intention of slowing down. Not only is the movie the most action-packed of the series, it may also be the best. Mind, this doesn't mean it's a masterpiece; the bar hasn't been set especially high when it comes to depth and intelligence. But if you enjoy the franchise, particularly the last two entries, it would be a true chore to dislike this one.The plot-always secondary in these films, always a bit too complicated for its own good-begins in Belfast. There, IMF* agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) learns of a splinter group of assassins who call themselves the 'Apostles' and have essentially become terrorists-for-hire. They're trying to get their hands on a trio of recently-stolen plutonium cores (you can guess the reason). Also involved are an anarchist named John Lark and the previous film's villain, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris).After a botched exchange in Berlin, in which the plutonium is lost, Hunt and his team (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames) are tasked by IMF Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) with recovering the cores through a meeting in Paris between Lark and a black-market broker known as the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby). Still with me? Suffice to say aborted directives, double-crosses and general chaos follow the key players from Europe all the way to the edge of the Himalayas, where Hunt's past finally catches up with him.One thing I greatly admire in movies is ambition. As evidenced by the story, ""Fallout"" holds nothing back. Whether or not it covers the most geographic ground in the franchise, it plays like the biggest entry. Whereas past missions were stop-gaps, this is a culmination. Stakes rise, secrets are revealed; lives change.At least, on screen. Oh that such emotions extended to the audience. But, for the most part, that effect has been absent from M:I's M.O. for quite some time. Not since the third movie did the narrative forsake its glossy, stunt-riddled surface to mine genuine feeling. And M:I-3 made the least amount of money in the franchise, so it's understandable that such a personal direction would be rerouted. But without it, ""Mission: Impossible""-and ""Fallout"" specifically-is destined to be the prettiest belle at a second-rate ball. For all its globe-trotting, it's only a partial experience. We see all-and are amazed-but feel little, and remember less. Each character is more caricature than human being, trading the details of life for the whims of a streamlined script. Like ""Marvel"" or ""The Fast and the Furious,"" ""Fallout"" doesn't present reality; it paraphrases it.Some may call this nitpicking, and they wouldn't be far off. But the bar must be raised when it comes to depth, because it's already been surpassed in nearly every other aspect. Visually, ""Fallout"" is a ball of frenetic joy, a feast for the eyes. The scenery is always changing; we can imagine the cameras struggling to keep up with such a rapidly unfolding plot. That plot, though, can be its own worst enemy. There are only so many twists a story can stand before each one starts to mean a little less.Thankfully, other factors maintain our attention. Lorne Balfe's score adds some taught variation to Lalo Schifrin's classic theme. And while each member of the cast does fine, Henry Caville stands out as a mysterious CIA officer. The role fits him better than Superman's tights.But in the end, it all comes back to Cruise. He's the reason we watch, and his relentless energy fuels the entire franchise. ""Fallout"" runs Hunt through the requisite gauntlet of stunts: hanging from a helicopter above mountainous terrain; speeding through the packed streets of Paris on a motorcycle; skydiving from thirty-thousand feet. But more than death-defying acrobatics is the quality they signify: devotion. When an actor who has nothing left to prove consistently gives everything he's got, admiration is easy.* In case you were curious, 'IMF' stands for Impossible Missions Force.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
821,jyuktirat,Great Action but Erratic Storyline,4,31 March 2019,"It feels like they're trying to misdirect the viewer so much so that the storyline itself is erratic. The action hands down is really good. But a lot of the time it feels like someone couldn't make up their mind as to which way the story should go. It unfortunately misses the mark on what makes the mission impossible series so great. The characters usually have a ""game plan"" story that you follow with them. Something goes array and then you get to see how the characters improvise.

10 years ago when mission impossible 3 came out. Critics were talking about the end of Tom Cruise, comparing his movie to the likes of Bourne ultimatum and Craig's James bonds, calling it old, lost and boring. That was right. At that time Bourne was at his best (before fallout Bourne ultimatum was the best spy thriller in my list )and Craig brought new visions to bond.
Ten years later, guess what, Bourne series is almost dead after two crappy movie and bond had an average installment but mission impossible is at its best. This franchise is like Benjamin button, getting better and better in every installment. Tom Cruise has secured his role as Ethan hunt by doing those crazy stunt himself, going further and further in each movie. He is Ethan hunt and he deserves a prize for his dedication.
Considering that even mad max left Oscar almost empty handed i don't have much hope that they consider Cruise for any prize. But they should. His dedication and efforts should be admired. He has become the real life super hero.

824,TrackArtist8,How good is Mission imposible? The usual,8,29 July 2018,"Mission: Impossible - Fallout continues the natural progression of the last two installments. It is what you expect if you are familiar with other Mission: Impossible movies. In fact, the movie already suppose you are, because it tries to surprise you with innovative action scenes and a high number of plot twists. And it manges with some breathtaking scenes, like the fake news issue, the awesome arrival at Paris, the bathroom fight, the scene in London underground or the rooftop chase. But once finished with surprises, its rhythm is difficult to follow in the last act. From my point of view, it could have ended with 15 minutes less. Because it gets a little bit lost in action scenes and the really interesting issues are recovered at the very end, in the hanging helicopter scene. Appart form that, the film is highly entertaining. Perfect pop-corn movie for a summer night. Tom Cruise never lets you down, and he is in his iconic role. Henry Cavill is a good addition, Simon Pegg is good as always, Ving Rhames shows he is at the level for the team, and Rebbeca Ferguson reprise an increasingly interesting role for the saga. Vanessa Kirby does a magnificent job with her mysterious White Widow, And finally, I missed Jeremy Renner after his performances in last two movies.Mission: Impossible - Fallout is what you expect: action, surprises and entertainment for the summer.

831,cj120uk,An adrenaline charged thrill ride!!,9,27 August 2018,"What makes this a strong franchise entry is that most of the same team members from the previous films are kept in play here. They are characters that you know, they have the chemistry of an established team, which helps the audience care about their fates. The story isn't anything too complicated, neither as elaborate as the first film or Rogue Nation, basically the IMF are searching for a couple of bombs designed to cause a new world order but its enough to drive the plot along. As the bad guys from Rogue Nation are the antagonists again, this allows no time to be wasted on developing their motivation so it's straight into the action. Which is where the film really impresses, as every action sequence ustilises practical effects with refreshingly minimal CGI, only used to enhance events otherwise unfilmable ie an adrenaline charged motorcycle chase through Paris. For me, the main problem with the film is that no attempt is made to hide who the traitor is, which is once again, unoriginally, a rogue agent. That said, this is a minor flaw and when the finale occurs it is a pulse pounding assault to senses that leaves you on the edge of your seat. Fallout is a well made action film that never bores, always entertains and definitely needs to be seen on the big screen.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

I can now say that it has definitely surpassed all of my expectations! The cast are fantastic and belnd well together as they have done previously with the inclusion of Henry Cavil. Fallout is a roundup of all previous Mission Impossible films it combines the old with the new and Director Christopher McQuarrie (Obviously from previous box office hits) knows how to direct a Tom Cruise film. From the screeching tires and roars of motorbikes and helicopters whipping through the wind and tom cruise running in typical cinematic fashion and stunning scenary in the backdrop from London, Paris, Beligum, Kashmir and so on. Its a beautiful film and is even enchanced with the terrific soundtrack. The action is most likely the best i have ever seen in a movie. Tom Cruise loves a risk with all his extreme stunts and it really does take your breath away. Henry Cavil (Walker) Nicknamed The Hammer, definitely fits the name! Not to smart but packs a hell of a punch.. So much happens its just a stunning and intese experience, you definitely should not blink as you may miss something.

However, I left feeling just as baffled by most of the design choices made in this movie. (That said, the one thing that I actually really did enjoy was the fight choreography during the sequence that took place in the men's restroom near the beginning of the film which I thought was pretty fun.)I felt like this film abandoned the cool, sleek, and sexy M.O. of the two prior movies in favor of over-the-top, balls-to-the-wall action in a vaguely similar vein to the tonal shift when they went from MI1 to MI2.The film really begins to go off rails after the first act by overcomplicating the plot by having an ADDITIONAL character - other than the double agent working against the US that the audience has already been informed of - to seemingly double-cross the IMF, rehashing chase scenes that we've not only seen before, but seen in THIS very movie before, and in the later half of the movie (MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD) by having Alec Baldwin's character fight against Henry Cavill's character (that's right, you read that correctly... Alec Baldwin's character fights, albeit briefly, Henry Cavill's character in this movie). By the final act, the movie just turns into a parody of itself. Half of the people in theater I was in last night were laughing AT the film and NOT with the film at regular intervals during the last act, because what was being shown and said made so little sense. (i.e. By pure chance Ethan serendipitously meets his ex-wife Julia at a camp in the middle of nowhere b/c she just happened to become a doctor and wound up volunteering at the very medical camp where the nuclear bombs that Hunt's team have been chasing all across the globe the entire movie happened to be deployed to. The pacing and the tone shift with Ethan and team when he bumps into Julia is just mind-boggling as we watch Ethan's team stand idly by in the background while he and Julia have a conversation while everyone in the audience knows that in mere minutes two nuclear bombs in the immediate vicinity will be detonated unless they do something to prevent that from happening.)A poor plot, and not forgetting to mention some lackluster acting, and the numerous spy/action film tropes and clichés aside, the movie was too cheesy and overly dramatic to boot. One scene that illustrates this, is the scene where Cavill's character, being chased by Hunt, gets away on a helicopter leaving Hunt behind standing on top of a tower in London while blaringly loud, overly dramatic orchestra music plays in the background ALTHOUGH Hunt wasn't ever even close to catching up with Cavill's character during the chase in the first place. Jarring stuff. And really, 'jarring' is the word that I'm looking for here in describing this movie. There were WAYYY too many scenes in this movie that simply snapped me out of the immersion/enjoyment of the film b/c they were either wayyy too cheesily written/acted OR because they were too silly and implausible.All of this resulted in a rather forgettable and bad MI movie IMO. That said, I hope that they're able to get the franchise back on track when MI8 inevitably is released.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
835,isisinhouston,Superfluous and Superscillious,2,8 July 2019,"Okay, I'm not a Cruz fan but have enjoyed most of the franchise. At least until this film. Now it's time to rethink that.
We always expect to see Tom run and jump and drive and fight and fly and roll and ride, but not for an hour. This is the longest film in the franchise at 147 minutes but it's a 100 minute movie. Running and running and running and running isn't acting. It takes no lines, no talent and no audience. It's just an excuse for poor writing and big egos. I'm really glad I didn't see this in the theater where there are no fast forward buttons.
There are still some good things though. Benji finally gets to wear a mask. Twice. Yay. They wrap up the Julia story line, nicely. They wrap up the Hunley story line, nicely. Ilsa finishes her entrapment with MI6 and there's a great shot of Notre Dame before the fire.
Bad things. They lost analyst Brant, Jeremy Renner, because Tom's antics delayed filming so long that he had other obligations. If the team would have had an analyst they would have known who Lark was the first time they saw him, like the audience. Would have been a short story but would have made more sense. It was so contrived and predictable. Lane didn't die. He should have. He should have died in Rogue Nation and this film wouldn't have been necessary and maybe there would have been a good 6th installment instead of what it turned out to be. Angela Bassett is not an asset. Get the CIA out of the autonomous IMF. Finally, they are getting too old. Surrounding Ethan, Luther and Benji with youngsters just makes it worse. So, to quote the last line, ""don't make me laugh"".",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The actors does their best with what they are given, Henry Cavill being the most captivating of them all. But the looks can't make up for the weak writing. The story contains a few plot twists and keeps the viewer guessing, a quality a look for in a movie.But... if the writing isn't strong enough plot twists can lead to serious plot holes and this movie has a lot of them. I couldn't take this movie serious halfway in because the story and the characters didn't make sense at all most of the time. It's way to obvious where the studio put their effort and money, on the awesome stunts and the great visuals. But that, unfortunately, can't make up for the sub par script.I don't know if it was the script that was weak or if it's a result of bad editing and rewrites but the movie doesn't work for me in its entirety.Still, it's worth watching for the visually stunning action... and Henry Cavill :)",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
847,rorymarsh00,The new king of espionage thrillers,9,15 September 2018,"The genre the Mission: Impossible films occupy has always been contested between the likes of James Bond, Jason Bourne and Kingsman, however, 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' concludes an excellent trilogy of spy films that began worth Brad Bird's 'Ghost Protocol', furthermore, it proves the strongest instalment in the series thus far. Regardless of your thoughts on Tom Cruise, his unquenchable charisma and devotion to these films is impossible to ignore, with the multiplicity of action sequences being as pulse-pounding as they are technically impressive, heavily influenced by frequent collaborator Christopher McQuarrie. This combination results in a film brimming with excellent action, whether it be beautifully choreographed first-fights, one-take halo jumps or inconceivable in-camera helicopter chases. The imagination required to create these sequences is only surpassed by the technical audacity and skill required to actually pull them off. Besides from these action sequences, Rob Hardy's lens helps make it a visually stunning film, building on the visceral nature of these aforementioned segments, resulting in the most beautiful spy film since 'Skyfall'. The plot proves an intriguing progression for the series, continuing the narrative threads set up in 'Rogue Nation', culminating in the development of several character arcs that ultimately prove more emotionally fulfilling than anything we've previously seen in the franchise. Furthermore, the progression of the story is complex, but avoids becoming convoluted, allowing for equal parts immersion and enjoyment, as opposed to potential confusion which all too oft becomes the downfall of similar films. Besides this, the performances featured here further enforce that strength of the film as a whole, with newcomer Henry Cavill proving an intimidating, brutally intriguing counter to Cruise's protagonist. These two are bolstered by a stellar supporting cast, another feather in the already polished cap of 'Fallout', despite the number of background characters coming dangerously close to causing befuddlement in the audience. Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise have, in this film, made one of the strongest American action films in recent memory, forging a visually stunning and technically fantastic film. It is emblematic of their talents that the sixth film in the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise is not only a competent addition, but the best thus far.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
848,john_titmus,The stunts carry this tired format to spit out yet another MI film.,3,2 June 2019,Can't believe this hasn't been put out of its misery yet. The format has gotten stale and it relies on over the top stunts and Tom cruise (dwindling) star power to churn out more movies that like a poor mans Bond movie.Ving Rhames looks like a tired Baluga whale who doesn't contribute to the story as the Simon Pegg (everymans comic side kick Q wannabe) all of a sudden had become a field agent.Such a shame that anything else Tom Cruise tries falls short (The Mummy) these days so these movies will keep getting churned out every 2-3 years.Henry Cavills and Sean harris was the only redeeming characters onscreen. Angela Basset and Alex Baldwin did their bit.Opening Credits were lame And the directing overall was not Christopher Mcquarries best effort. Seems to have played it safe for the pay check.,Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Tom Cruise and rest of the cast were phenomenal. The action scenes were one of the best I've seen in a movie.

853,sportsnut-66935,All Hail Tom Cruise!!,9,27 July 2018,"This movie was awesome! It's everything great about the previous MI movies and more. Christopher McQuarrie provides arguably the most well written mission impossible yet. This movie has heart, humor, a surprisingly dense and complex story and of course, the edge-of-your-seat action this franchise is known for. Ethan Hunt is tasked with tracking down missing plutonium after a failed mission in Berlin. The Syndicate has been mostly destroyed but those who survive call themselves the Apostles. The plot isn't easy to lay out without spoiling the movie, which brings me to my first praise for this film. The story. Ever since the first MI film, the stories have gotten less complex. Until this one. With twists and turns, and welcome surprises, this movie subverts expectations very well. The story is filled with double crosses and some well-written dialogue for an action heavy movie.The second praise is the action. I mean come on. Some of the stunts may seem familiar (motorcycle chases, hanging from aircraft) but they are executed in a such a way that it feels fresh. For a movie with this kind of run time, the story never drags thanks to set piece after set piece. There are some truly thrilling moments and it is by far the most intense MI yet. Third praise is the characters. While obviously it's the Ethan Hunt show, I feel like the other characters were well used. Cavill was great as was Ferguson. I just love Sean Harris though. His voice is so calm yet menacing at the same time. The best part about the characters is that they can be unpredictable. Throughout the whole movie you can't really tell what side people are on or what they'll do next. It adds intrigue to what could have been a by the books action movie.Fourth praise is the subtle nods to the older movies. This movie also points out its on absurdity at times in very funny ways. Most of the complaints I've seen is that this movie is too improbable. But to all of you people this movie is called mission impossible. What do you expect? The movie even recognizes that. The only negative I had was that this like most other MI movies has a large plot macguffin. It would be cool to see if there could be a MI without some nuclear weapon being the driving force of the movie. Last praise, to the king of action, Tom Cruise! This guy must just push his body to the limit every day. I mean the stuff he pulls in this movie is crazy. For a man in his late 50s he is unbelievable. He may be kind of nut, but you have to respect this mans abilties and sheer balls to pull these stunts off. I have mad respect for the guy. Absolutely the must see movie of the summer and probably in the top 3 movies of 2018 along with Infiniti War and A Quiet Place",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
854,kapilarasankavi,Ethan Again on a Mission,8,31 July 2018,The way they have conveyed other parts connection were really awesome. Tom cruise is he 56 or 26 still got the vibes and always top in the stunts. He learnt to ride helicopter just for this film that shows how much he dedicated to his work. Henry Cavill with that Mustache and Beard he rocked the show. No one can do that Walker better than him. Pepole will never have second to blink in the climax. Also the movie have fun parts.The Theme was missed out in many places. Cinematography was also good. Editing was a perfect one. Slight slow down in the screenplay. If you are a Mission impossible Fan you are gonna love this. If your a Action movie fan you will like it. Finally Mission impossible not only best movie in this Franchise but also a good action movie in that last decade.,Mission - Impossible - Fallout

859,supergye-43876,Good but predictable...spoilers,7,31 July 2018,"The movie starts out with a botched money exchange to buy three plutonium casings. One male shooter working for the bad guys calls Eathan by his name and this is glossed over later on. The bad guys get the suitcase of plutonium casings from IMF team.Bathroom fight scene prevails. After Ilsa a spy for the MI6, having to kill middleman John Lark in self defense to protect Eathan, the team goes to meet the White Widow. She is an attractive bomb broker and is found in record time. Eathan decides to pose as Lark depite misgivings of team, thinking broker is ignorant of what Lark looks like and not aware of previous botched plutonium exchange Eathan was a part of.White Widow holds the keys to exchanging the plutonium for money but she must have a client that never gives any key info on the fact that IMF and Eathan Hunt were just hours ago the ones posing as a radical group. The ones the bad guys stole the plutonium casings from. I think this a major plot hole. Since you would want to make sure you are not caught, and are selling the most dangerous of product. You would have told broker, oh yeah don't sell to this guy Eathan Hunt he is a spy. Audience, try to grit teeth and suspend disbelief.The movie follows with standard fallen agent, played by Henry Cavill. Apparently honest agents are Impossible to find as witnessed throughout the franchise. You never really develop any emotions toward our main bad guy Lane since he is just another chess piece dropped in between action scenes. Cavill although more feelings may be adopted, only briefly since the movie gives zero time for audience to really know him one way or another. The action scenes must go on as they say.Near the end of movie there is a helicopter action scene where Ethan jumps into a helicopter. One of the members announces over the com, ""hey I didn't know you could fly helicopters"". Yes, Ethan Hunt can't fly a helicopter, never flew one, and should not be able to make complex manuevers that only an experience pilot could make, but the audience knows Tom Cruise can. So no worries there, but suspend disbelief and grit teeth and try not to laugh cause I think this is an inside joke.You have to judge this movie (and most MI movies) mostly by action scenes because as an acting piece its just average. I did enjoy the movie but it was about 20 minutes too long. I just wanted it to end. The predictable ending and IMF saving the world are standard fare for the franchise. Final note: I do wish the MI script could follow more of the 70's franchise. Whereby, the team causes the bad guys to politically self-implode. Aka bad guys kill each other. Oh well, can only wish.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

They're purely kept up because of nostalgia.The probably best action movie I have seen in 2018, Tom cruise is about 56 years old and still hanging out of helicopters and riding motorcycles in the most busy street in Paris, by himself.

I found myself rolling my eyes everytime there was a ""twist"" which could be seen a mile away and I caught myself checking the time to see when it would end. Perhaps the worst offense of all is the way that this film distrusts the audience to handle its formulaic and simplistic plot (even resorting to show us a flashback of something we saw just a few minutes earlier.)

872,belikerev-532-859651,"Over the top action, mediocre story",7,30 July 2018,"Having recently watched two action movies in theater this summer - Jurassic World, and Skyscraper, I went into this movie expecting it to be clearly better than the other two. I came out a bit underwhelmed to be honest. What bothered me most is how hard they try to explain every single thing that happens in the movie. Ethan's character's motive is explained by so many people at different times and its just the same old cliche boring and patriotic speech (he's out there to serve the country, save the world and he can't look away when something goes wrong yada yada). They do the same with the bad guy's motives too. When I think of Mission Impossible, I think of it as an American Bond movie but it simply lacks any sophistication. Yes, MI is also typically big on action and stunts and can be quite in your face, but is it really necessary to dumb it down so much? Part of what makes movies great is to keep people thinking. Here, it's pretty clear - someone is going to blow stuff up. But they still want to spell it out and make it clear incase you couldn't guess that Tom Cruise was going to jump on that Helicopter. Plot is pretty mediocre and unbelievable - the bad guys already have hold of the small pox virus that can potentially infect close to 3 billion people in the region (in Asia), yet they are after a nuclear device (which would cost far less damage). And they want the nuclear device not to kill people but incinerate a glacier in Himalayas that would cut off water supply to the said billions of people, hence starving them. Okay, not very practical but whatever, it's a movie. Apart from that, the action sequences are pretty great, what you expect from MI. The scenes in Himalayas are visually stunning. 7/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

That's about it. Actions scenes were good, yet certain ones like the car, bike and even the helicopter chase scenes felt somewhat drawn out. The aerial views of Kashmir were great and in a hard to describe way, helped me to stay on for the bland ending.Questions remain as to how the CIA was infiltrated, how they started to suspect that the special agent was the one working with Solomon, etc. Maybe these will be answered in future sequels or director's cut?Would not recommend watching this in the theaters.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

We are often swayed by the action and stunt sequences in movies these days ,we tend to forget the journey each character takes to reach the apex of his character development ,this is mostly forgettable in FALLOUT (read...the Batman dark Knight) ,the MI SERIES could use some good antagonist in the next movie .THE SCORE - this time its the score that has upped the ante of this movie,Lorne balfe has found a rich sound that matches with the fast paced storyline. it is adept at most scenes and does not lag in the tone or the pacing. Lorne balfe has a great perception when it comes to what is on screen and the right tone to match it.OVERALL A GREAT TAKE IN THE MI SERIES. fallout is the movie u have been wishing to watch with friends ,colleagues and family . go for this movie and let your weekend be jolly and entertaining.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

There isn't a moment in this film where action isn't either closely behind or right in front of you. It left you engaged enough by the quirky usual narrative but the action was beyond abundance. Tom doing his own stunts, showing off his dare devil nature gives you such a thrill. No one does it like he does. And you simply have to respect it. Well admired. Surprises were also a big pleasing factor in this one. But without the visually pleasing, adrenaline pumping action in this film, I think it would lack in every other category.

877,tonitinsood,"A very watchable film, but definitely not the stand out in the MI series",5,11 August 2018,"Mission Impossible delivered a new installment in the series. It boasted of the typical MI pedigree - a good looking, sharp star cast, a fast paced, high pitch storyline with gravity defying stunts and continued twists and turns in the plot. But as a sequel, it did not lift up the game, rather it came up as a rehash of the same. The movie was definitely watchable, but not a stand out vs. the MI series. Its stunts, acting, editing were superb but just a copy from the past. The movie definitely took a beating in the storyline and in sketching out the characters, the plot. It descended too quickly into the usual shoot and run scenes. I blinked repeatedly to tell myself that this is Mission Impossible and not an import from Fast & Furious. On the positive side though, Tom Cruise acted the part. He was sharp, fit and looked the role. There was some subtle humor and subdued glamour that was refreshing. Overall it was a movie that comes and goes like the waves on a sea shore. There are little or no remnants that it left behind and soon it will be all but etched from memory.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The director always had his frame full, no empty areas, moving quickly with the story to reach its end.The movie succeeded to win both critics' and audience's reviews, it had a meaning and it was an interesting one, the movie wasn't just about if/how will Ehan Hunt save the world, but how will Hunt save it without breaking his rules and beliefs.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

But, since it made lots of cash and his Scientologist friends will profit from it, I doubt he is sorry in any way shape or form.I wanted to walk out after the first 15 minutes (I was generous), but I thought maybe there would be a twist. I waited it out until the bitter end and what a waste of my time it was.The script was a zero on a one to ten scale. I couldn't believe the stupidity of the IMF in the first 15 minutes of the film. (Damn, it's the IMF! ""Stupid"" is not their middle name in any other film of the franchise.) Okay, maybe Nathan Hunt has become a victim of PSTD and is generally dysfunctional after the events of the previous and better films. But I waited for that excuse and it never came.I thought at first it was a big IMF scam a tradition dictates. It wasn't. They really lost the ball in the first reel and it was their very stupid fault (not to mention that they never really got it back)! The IMF doesn't DO that in such a simple situation! I kept waiting for Nathan to wake up from ANOTHER nightmare for the rest of the film. He and his team were incompetent and insensitive (since the bad guys were obvious), but even though I thought they knew that and were playing the great, traditional IMF long game, I was wrong! They were dumb. There were only mediocre chase scenes with completely disoriented paths through Paris (I know Paris and those scenes could not geographically been sequential... excuse me... let me translate for the American millennials : That route would make no sense for an intelligent, so-called ""international agent"", let alone an intelligent IMF agent) and would have taken over 1 hour and a half even at those speeds. It went in circles and covered over 20 miles, i.e.,nowhere fast, but illogically and very badly.Yes, there were some interesting action scenes like crashes and such (thanks to the second team director). But there have been 10 times better action scenes in films that don't have a ""canon"" to follow. The first ""Taken"", for example, or the first ""Transporter"". There were also a few (very few) respectable performances despite the crap script. I suspect the actors were pressed into following the script word for word by the loser of a director (and the loser of a producer, Cruise).I liked the rest of the MI franchise, but this film made me hope it was the last. The approval of this film is just another example of how so very many critical standards in the US have degenerated.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
893,manojative,"Even though the plot is predictable, I was still on the edge of my seat!",8,25 July 2018,"Right off the bat, we know what we are going to get in MI series. Some villain on World armageddon plan, some action/chase sequences, some questionable/predictable mask usage and Ethan Hunt saves the day (I don't count this as a spoiler, but oh well). 
However, what is different and better about this edition of MI is it goes through these checkpoints in a way that you can never relax. The action sequences are so well done that you never know what is going to happen. The fights, the car chases, helicopter chases are all worth watching. Kudos also to the marketing team that I couldn't not know that most of the stunts were real (not CGI) and performed by Tom Cruise. This information that Tom Cruise is himself driving the motorcycle, piloting the helicopter, or dangling from a helicopter all adds to another level of thrill. 
 Then there is humor. All actors, especially Simon Pegg add amazing situational comedy with perfect timing. 
 So even though you know what is going to happen, you never know how it is going to happen. It is not a ground breaking cinema, and won't win any oscars for acting, writing or directing; BUT boy you are in for a ride, if you choose to accept this mission and watch it on the big screen!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
894,brandonk93,One of the best MI's yet,9,23 August 2018,"This is definitely one of the better, or perhaps the best mission impossible movie yet. The fight scenes were extremely well choreographed, especially the bathroom one! This movie has the typical plot twists but does them in what I thought to be a somewhat unique way. They did push the bait and switch twist moments right up to the line of where it would have been ridiculous and possibly too hard to follow though. I give major credit for Cruise performing most of the stunts for this film and opting to do many scenes in camera instead of CGI and green screen, it adds so much depth that many action films lack due to studios leaning too much on advanced CGI technology. The last thing I'd like to praise is the continuity of characters, Fallout does a great job by not introducing us to a plethora of new characters. His team, some of his enemies, and his wife remain the same across most MI films which is great to see. The cinematography was also quite nice, some unique shots and camera work over the major cities. The run-time was a little long but pacing was okay up until the last thirty minutes, but that was my only issue I'd say.I'd recommend checking it out! 8.5/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

If they keep pushing the envelop, Ethan Hunt will be a member of the Avengers in no time.Seeing the gorgeous Rebecca Ferguson reprising her role again was a delight, and her thigh twist neck choke combat signature move is something I want to experience myself, her fighting moves are so hot.I do like the usual ensemble team of Ethan, Luther and Benji, I think Ilsa would make a great addition to the team because everything needs a woman's touch. I also wouldn't have to worry about the franchise killing off Ilsa either because she's practically stronger than Ethan in combat.I never expected this franchise to keep going strong like this, but M:I just may have become Tom Cruise's showcase franchise.As long as they bring back McQuarrie to direct the next sequel, I will have no doubt that M:I will be worth watching and stronger than ever.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

900,ymandayawon,Mission: Accomplished - Making a great film,10,23 August 2018,"Disclaimer: This is my first review. If you have any tips on making a review, please help. I don't know if I'm doing this right but I hope I'll make more reviews for the audiences to be aware if the film is any good or not. This is only my review. My own opinion of the film so, don't go crazy if you and I have different perspectives on a film. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the 6th film in the Mission: Impossible franchise and stars Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames and other characters mostly from Rogue Nation. Henry Cavill as well. It's about Ethan Hunt and the rest of the IMF agents looking for missing Plutoniums after a mission gone wrong while being monitored by CIA assassin August Walker.To me and other critics, this is the best installment in the franchise. The performances are top-notch, the direction is precise, and the stunts are phenomenal, making it the highlight of the film. The story involves weapons of mass destruction which is something we've all seen before, but it is the most character-driven story the franchise has to offer. Hunt and other characters are constantly being tested and challenged physically and emotionally, making them compelling to audiences. They're not robots, they're not super powerful agents, no. They're human beings. For Tom Cruise, great performance as always. Ethan is a character torn apart and fearful of the possible outcomes, making his character believable. As for the stunts, the best since 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road. Tom Cruise's dedication to the film made it seamless with all the practical effects and the lack of CGI. Even the rooftop scene was real. It really happened. One thing that the franchise has struggled with is making a good villain. Of course, they're the ones who make the protagonists drive the plot but they're not developed enough as a character. The only villain ever achieved this is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character Owen Davian. This film, Solomon Lane, played by Sean Harris achieved this as well. He was intimidating, sinister, well-developed. His performance made it all the more interesting. The action sequences are also great. The use of wide shots made it clear and made the stunts even more clear. The humor in the dialogue is also on point. It never felt really flat. Overall, I enjoyed watching Mission: Impossible - Fallout. It's the best installment in the franchise and possibly one of the greatest action films of all time. All the cast were great and the stunts and the cinematography were at it's best. 10/10-Yman Dayawon",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

903,nicar127,The Summer Blockbuster of 2018 and Movie of the Year,9,11 August 2018,"Wow! Double WOW! This is the summer blockbuster of 2018, and movie of the year! 2 plus hours of thrilling nerve-racking non-stop action, with only an occasional moment to barely catch your breath, then you're back on the edge of your seat again.My movie viewing has been disappointing this year, one can never believe the hype that's out there for so many films. But MI: Fallout is the reason we go to the movies; to be thrilled! (Let's just say I'm glad I'm not a heart patient!)One thing I very strongly dislike about modern films is the over-saturated use of CGI, it just always looks fake, and keeps me away from a lot of films. (I was dragged to see the latest Avengers movie, which I did not like, case in point!)
MI: Fallout's use of CGI is minimal at best. We can see, and appreciate, the real work that went into making this film. So much, much, more than just the lazy use of a green screen and a computer. The true art of film making seems lost today. But that's not the case with this film. The makers of this movie are true to their art, and we the fans of real film making appreciate it!The plot is refreshingly complex, but not difficult to follow (if you pay attention!) So much more intricate than the usual fare of the latest ""super hero"" genre, which is really wearing thin. (The ""we have to kill the bad guys before they kill us!"" routine is getting really tired.)The best MI yet. This is what a great action movie looks like, with a few (just a few!) hearty laughs thrown in for the icing on the cake.Tom Cruise and company work really really hard to bring us a great action movie, and they deliver. Well done, cast and crew of MI:Fallout.

In regards to the Mission Impossible movies I like almost all of them except 2 but this has to be the best in the series. The plot maybe an issue for some people as its a bit hard to follow if you don't pay attention but I like the fact that the movie is not just a collection of mindless action sequences but it requires you to invest in the plot. The issue with the mission impossible movies has often been the villain but here we got the second best antagonist in the series after Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character in MI 3.

919,bjwils-46211,Expectations Subverted.,10,4 October 2018,"Mission Impossible, is a franchise I had only just truly discovered last year. I was aware of the award winning theme and that Tom Cruise was the front runner for the series, but had never sat down or gone to a theatre to see one. I started for some reason watching Ghost Protocol (MI4), and from no prior knowledge I had incredible enjoyment with the set pieces, thrilling action sequences and fantastic character and actor chemistry. Then moved on to Rogue Nation (MI5) with the change of director from Brad Bird to Christopher Mquarrie and my god... what a film. He managed to go above and beyond by delivering an intense, darker and satisfying enstallment to the franchise which in my opinion went above the quality of GP. So in my head, I thought there was no way that they could top this. How? I mean there is already so many generic action films out there. How do you shock and entertain audiences, while still maintaining the ""campyness"", that the franchise has kept running? While I never thought that Mquarrie, would embrace the predictable and excecute with artistic type film making. Fallout, thrilling delivers on action, characters, villains, music, and another satisfying entry to the Mission Impossible franchise. Cavill delivers a thrilling performance. Tom Cruise alone is a force to be reckoned with. It probably helps that we as an audience have prior knowledge of his insane tradition of doing his own stunts. Mquarrie takes advantage of this by shooting in a style that presents his skills and drive to entertain an audience and puts it next to a breath taking score and fantastically choreographed sequences that have set the bar for all action films to ever be released in the coming future.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

922,elijahcassidy,Doesn't get much better than this.,9,2 August 2018,"Getting right to the chase here this is my favorite movie in the franchise so far. All other movies have been somewhere between meh and pretty good but this is the first I believe to be truly great.Honestly every action scene was one of the best action scenes I've seen. The motorcycle chase was the best motorcycle chase I've seen. The Halo jump was the best skydiving sequence I've seen. So on and so forth. All this is mostly because of how obviously real it is, with Tom Cruise laying it all on the line for the audience and a team of people who clearly cared about making the most fun movie possible. Also it definitely helps that it's really well filmed, Christopher Mcquaries direction is intense and sleek. It also has a much darker and ominous tone than the rest of the franchise, which I think was also in part because of how much the score deviates from the traditional 70s spy score in favour of something much more like a Hanz Zimmer score.Another thing I really enjoyed about this movie was how it was a true sequel to Rogue Nation and brought in aspects that weren't simply meant for an anthology movie. This extra awareness made the movie alot more engaging.There are a couple of things you could point to as negatives if you wanted to, but honestly they're so overshadowed by the positives that it won't bother most people but I'll mention it anyway. The plot itself is pretty regular mission impossible affair and in the end it does wrap up in the same sort of way that they all do so the next movie won't really have to deal with any crazy consequences, which I felt this movie could've been setting up considering how much darker it was.Besides all that this is one of the best action movies around, and after watching this most superheros movies look like they were made by babies. Definitely don't miss it.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
923,Nagfilms,Make It Your Mission to See This Movie!!!,9,31 July 2018,"What a fun time it was watching 'Mission Impossible: Fallout', the 6th installment of the very popular and profitable Paramount Studios franchise based on the 1960's television series. It stars Tom Cruise once again as Ethan Hunt with Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, and Alec Baldwin back in their roles from previous MI films. This is the epitome of a summer movie. Multiple car chases through exotic locations, a brutally exciting bathroom fight scene (brilliantly choreographed), and a 'take your breath away' helicopter chase sequence. All of this supports the continuation of Ethan and the crew's involvement with tracking down The Syndicate and its new followers appropriately named The Apostles who are hell bent on wreaking nuclear havoc upon the world. The real stars of this movie, however, are the Director, Christopher McQuarrie (who also directed the previous MI film Rogue Nation which began this story arc as well as previous writing responsibilities for The Usual Suspects, Edge of Tomorrow amongst others), and Editor Eddie Hamilton (Rogue Nation, Kingsmen: Golden Circle, Kick Ass, Kick Ass 2 and others). Together, McQuarrie and Hamilton deliver a rapid-fire, edge-of-your-seat roller coaster ride that is an absolute joy to watch. Cruise, who produced the film and did many of his own stunts, once again shines as a bonafide action movie hero. So your mission-which you should definitely choose to accept-is to buy a ticket, get some popcorn, and sit back and be prepared for an exhilarating viewing experience.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

927,samanjamaal,Loved it.,9,22 December 2019,Action and 3D was very nice. As mission impossible is known for its action it lived up to it. I enjoyed the HALO jump. If witnessed through 3D it will be a treat. Tom cruise at his best. Henry cavills acting done very nicely. The restroom action scene done by both tom and Henry was real good.

928,PapaDobie,The Mary Poppins of Action Movies!,9,27 January 2019,"Why Mary Poppins? Because it's practically perfect in every way. Unlike previous MI films, this one continues on from the end of the excellent Rogue Nation. Sean Harris returns as the villainous Soloman Kane and Henry Cavill joins as the hard as nails CIA operative tasked with keeping Ethan Hunt on mission. From the opening set piece to the literally cliffhanging finale the pace never lets up. The script is the best of the MI movies to date and the action is thrilling and at times brutal. You have to hand it to Tom Cruise, even at his age, he still.finds ways to amaze and enthrall his audience with his incredible dedication to stunt work and entertainment. He doesn't make bad films! This film is in my 2018 Top 5 and will probably end up in my all time Top 10 Action Movies. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to seek out and enjoy this movie.

It's not that it's bad, it's just that it's been seen thousands of times before in movies or tv shows. There is absolutely no surprise, no twist, one see everything coming from a mile away.

933,mtl429,Eh....it was alright.,6,3 August 2018,"Just to be clear, I like Mission Impossible. They just need a new actor playing Ethan Hunt. Don't get me wrong, I liked Tom Cruise playing him in the first 4 movies. But the last 2, have only portrayed the ""oh...we're all getting too old for this"", and ""we've been through a lot together haven't we?"". Ugh...I was just hoping this was going to be a movie to wrap everything up so they can revamp it after a few years. You can only watch someone who can be a grandpa by now jump around and shoot people and get the young 20 year old chick for so long. I guess the point of my review really is that it was hard to watch at times because common sense tells me anyone close to 60 shouldn't be doing any of this, and it's not such a bad thing to step aside so a new generation can keep the keep the franchise going. Hopefully this will be the last one regardless.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

i was really hoping for a story where there is an antihero like the joker that we can hate and love at the same time, im fed up with this kind of stories where the hero is the only one who never miss , smarter than anyone else, and wins in the end.

939,llsabathia,"Fantastic stunts, immaculate cinematography, ultimate summer blockbuster",8,3 August 2018,"Tom Cruise steps out of his comfort zone and does the most intense stunts AN ACTOR has ever done. This is one of his best acting roles (outside of his dramatic accomplishments). He represented an experienced veteran, but showed the same level of intensity and fighting that we see in the previous 5 films Chris McQuarrie is a genius. From the time that Rogue Nation came out in 2015 to now, he completely shuffled his team. He intended this movie to look and feel different than the rest of the franchise, yet still be in line with his vision. I believe if a movie is well made, the same director should return and do the sequel just as McQuarrie did here. The plot was complicated and had me holding my breath at several points. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames add their comic relief and continue to sustain 2 supporting roles that are essential for these films' success. Rebecca Ferguson was a great addition to the team and her story perfectly coincided with the main plot. Many films these days tie in plots from prequels and sequels just to have another A-list actor to increase production value. However, she was meant to be in it and it didnt feel rushed or forced. She also lost an incredible amount of weight which may have taken away from her attractiveness; but maybe that's just me. Henry Cavill FINALLY portrayed his action movie acting potential. His fight scenes were some of the best I have ever witnessed. His muscle memory from man of steel, BvS, and JL, came in handy. THANKS DC, AT LEAST YOU GAVE US THIS!! I have never been more happy with a secret villain casting. I totally didn't see it coming. Probably because I was paying more attention to his mustache. I felt the punches and I felt his demise. Wonderful depiction. I loved how Solomon Lane intended on Julia's arrival in Kashmir. I thought that hiding the fact that she was there until the end was precisely well thought out. He is a revenge driven villain, which are some of the best developed and 3 dimensional villains that the audience can covertly relate to. 
Now.
What is the reason I didn't give it a 10 if all I have to offer is praise?
One of my biggest gripes for Hollywood is the in-authenticity of recent films and the anxious need to push out films for a quick 200 million. If you HAVEN'T seen Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom yet, don't read any further...So, what is happening with these massive franchises? The studios are INSISTING that they continue past their prime, and clearly, past their expiration date. Jurassic World was good in itself. It served the purpose of showing a new park and a new take on the control of the dinosaurs; etc. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was a filler, trash movie that was sloppily put together and contained a plot that collapsed on itself. The end presented an opportunity for the franchise to stop making reboot sequels. All she had to do was not press the button that opened the doors that would release the dinosaurs into America. But the little girl did. The difference of justifiably ending a reboot sequel duo and forcing yet another reboot sequel just to make another 200 million or so, was to press or not press that button. It just grinds my gears that these studios think that we will continue to spend money on sloppy reboot sequels. How does this have to do with the end of MI6? During the second to last scene, where TC is climbing the cliff to defuse the bombs, the scenes cut to Benji and Luther defusing the bombs in the village with all of the other main characters, including Julia. As TC gets to the top of the cliff, and is about to pick up the detonator, a huge white light erupts behind him. This sequence had me on the edge of my seat, as the other films final ""race-against-time"" theme, did. But this was different, when the white light went off, I was at peace with the franchise, I was so exhilarated that the franchise had bravely decided to go in this direction. But I was wrong. He had defused the bomb and the white light was just him blacking out from his serious injuries. I was devastated. I couldn't believe they would flirt with this idea. It just blew me away that they had that opportunity and bypassed it, effortlessly. No one in Hollywood has the guts to think outside the box anymore. This ending could have set this film apart and truly made a name for itself, but instead it proved, yet again, that no mission is truly impossible for Tom Cruise. That ending could have even warranted an interesting MI7 where Ethan has to deal with his failure and the fact that everyone he loved and cared about was dead because he couldn't get the job done. Maybe it shows him getting revenge on the apostles and going full Kill Bill on all of them as a rogue, independent operative. I dont know but come on guys, START TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. You will still earn 200 million plus for these sequels if you go in a unique direction. PLEASE.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

You'd think holding on a plane door during takeoff is the furthest Cruise can take his stunts; wait till you watch this!!! The script was so good! Out of this world! Best actions scenes in a long time! The cast was superb too! The first act takes its time setting up the plot, but a certain chase sequence occurs, the whole film becomes a roller coaster ride!

Not only does it have the best action, it has a great story, locations and cinematography. It has an incredible musical score, which enhances every scene, whether it involves action or an intimate moment. The cinematography is very dynamic. The performances of all actors are great, and the script is is smart, occasionally hilarious and touching.It is a rare action movie which satisfies completely and is nearly flawless.

946,skbpirocks,A formula for sequels (maybe),10,26 March 2020,"The MI franchise is now home to six action-packed sequels pushing it to a tier populated by many sagas. The many sequels are criticized for not carrying the same magic or for not adding anything new or intriguing. However, Fallout provides an excellent time with thrills and stunts beyond what the franchise has shown before. The most interesting part to me was how the movie correctly used the character's' pasts to help build what may have been the strongest storyline for the franchise. I feel that other sequels could do the same thing by building off of the magic made in the original while using the history of the characters to influence the plot. Fallout also had a great score which surprised me a bit, in a good way. Every stunt or reveal is topped by a piece that elevates the scene to intense heights. The cinematography was the best of the franchise with many stunts and fights filmed as one shots which puts the viewer right at the feet of Ethan Hunt's various quarrels. Overall I gave this movie a 9/10 because it shows how a sequel can surpass views on the original and because it was one of the best action movies of recent times (in the same tier as John Wick and the sequels).",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

952,milenaidaki,"Cliché story, excellent action",7,7 September 2018,"I rated this movie with 7, but it could have been much less. 
In this movie the story is so weak and already seen many time before, that I could easily rate it with not more than 3 stars. For the worse, while they obviously tried to make it more complicated, in contrary it is more childish and boring. Finally you have to catch that story just by the fast conversation between characters and almost nothing is to be seen in the plot of the movie itself. 
Acting also can be rated with low mark, since you don't need such thing for running and fighting. Maybe 3 -4 stars for that, nothing more . Although I like Tom Cruise in the movie, he still has his charisma. Don't doubt on that. I like that character Ethan Hunt, no changes on that course. It is naturally that he is getting older. 
Things that are worth high marks are excellent stenography (we are flowing movie plot in London, Paris, and Kashmir), and film makers used it very much to hide that empty story. That worth 10 stars for sure.
Finally, if you going to see this movie for its action (non stop), you are going to be very amazed and satisfied! That is what you expected from this movie, didn't you? That definitely worth no less than 10 stars.

955,Yeary72,Action Packed Fun!,6,29 July 2018,"Mission Impossible: Fallout is the 6th movie in the Mission Impossible franchise starting the one and only Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise is main focus of this movie and all of the other Mission Impossible movies. He is the driving awesome force that brings his enemies to their knees. And this movie is no different. Tom Cruise acting in this movie is strong and true to Ethan Hunt I'm past movies. And again Cruise does all his own stunts in the film and this blows the movie out of the water. This lets the camera not have to cut away or shake when action starts with Cruise. They don't have to hid the stunt doubles face because their is not stunt double just Cruise. This is the main selling point of the film and the main reason I went to see if. And it paid off. This movie is packed with some of the best action I have seen in years. Every single action scene felt strong and quick and fluid. Amazing action.Where the movie has some flaws is with the story. This is a generic save the world from terrorists plot we have seen a hundred times. The only thing that keeps it from becoming to stail though is the clever spy gadgets and tricks that are often used in the movie. This often add originality to an other wise unoriginal story. This sounds like a large gripe but for this movie it really isn't. Because of the amazing action and not worrying about politics and governments like most movies do these days. But just sticking to the action and Tom Cruise's adventure has Ethan Hunt, the movie keeps it fresh all the way through.Overall, Mission Impossible Fallout is great (8). It may have a weak story at times but makes up for it through the best action scenes I have seen in a movie in years. Highly recommend for action fans and fans of the movies before in the series.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Yes I know The Dark Knight is a DC superhero movie with one of the best directors of our time and arguably the best villain of all time but this movie reminded me of The Dark Knight. The cinematography is mind blowing! Fantastic looking shots on real locations with hardly any cgi used. The story is adult, complex, twists and turns and it requires you to think. The score is also is awesome and reminiscent of The Dark Knight with its dark ""wubs""The action in this is another thing entirely. Firstly it's so refreshing not to see fake backgrounds and millions of $$$ of CGI in every shot, it feels like actual shots, like an old fashioned movie. Standouts are the bathroom fight, the vehicle chase and the foot chase. The stunts in this are insane and looks and feels real (because 95% of it is I guess)Only negative for me but I can't go into too much detail is there is a reveal about halfway though the movie that I saw coming straight away.. Overall I loved this movie, it gets your heart pounding, it's exciting and more action movies should be like this these days.. superheros are cool and all, but this... this is an action movie!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

962,drakeripley,The fallout of this film,10,25 July 2018,"Mission impossible fallout is one of the best action movies I have ever seen. The way Christopher Mcquarrie directs this film and how the actors are used in each scene shows that every action scene, every dialogue scene is the best way they could've shown us. And for a major blockbuster like this in the summer, it treats the audience with respect knowing that they'd have to pay attention to what's said during the film. Tom Cruise is obviously amazing in this film
Simon Pegg is hilarious as usual 
Ving Rhames is great as Luther 
Rebecca Ferguson returns as ilsa from Rogue Nation and is awesome 
Sean Harris returns as Soloman Lane from the previous film and for me this was a big worry because I didn't particularly buy that he was this dangerous villain. But in this film they sold me on it. 
Henry Cavill is absolutely amazing as the main antagonist of the film, clearly he's the best antagonist of this franchise. 
For me this is the best mission impossible film without a doubt and I don't see how they can top this if they do another one10/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
963,Movie-Dart16,Probably the Best Action/MI film of the year,9,25 August 2018,"A pumped, full of adrenaline, exhilarating and fun action film that brings both critics and audiences alike a more solid take on the MI franchise. Tom Cruise once again nails it at his performance as Ethan Hunt, with Simon Pegg and many other very likeable cast that you can like the most from the film as well. While introducing August Walker played by Henry Cavill was excellent though my own flaw with the him is that he didn't get much fleshed out like the rest yet still likeable anyway. The villain we know is very basic as well as the plot which doesn't deliver nothing new. Yet Mission Impossible does what a summer film flick can and without a doubt delivers some amazing stuntwork with outstanding and white nuckled action sequences that surprises till the last act. At times around the 2nd act of the film, I felt a little mixed but picked the pace back which got some confusion. The film can feel somewhat forgettable, though can be a film that exceeds it's predecessor. Overall MI Fallout is best of itself, loved the action sequences, stunkwork was flawless and amazing, kept me into the edge of my seat, very great and likeable cast and characters, some plot points felt a little confusing but I still loved this film and feels like a rewatchable film I would see again. 9/10",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

965,alljesus88,This is what you go to the movies for,10,4 August 2018,"They packed so much into this movie, but it made for a wonderful roller coaster ride! My favorite feature was that they often didn't have music playing while the action was going on. You just hear the noise of the action, which made it seem so much more real! Kudos to the director on wonderfully planned and executed action scenes. I've never been a big fan of action movies, but I found myself often admiring the genius and hard work it must have taken to make this happen. Not too much CGI just a bunch of the world's best stunt doubles and actors doing what they do best. I can tell that everyone on the team put in their best efforts, and it paid off. Well done!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

967,pierceborchardt,Best action movie since Fury Road,10,27 July 2018,"I don't say this lightly, Mission impossible is the best action movie since Mad Max: Fury Road.
I loved this movie and for good reason. 
It is extremely skillfully made. Beautifully shot, well written, well acted. 
And on top of it being well made, it is so incredibly entertaining. 
I walked into the theatre hoping for a cool little blockbuster nothing more. But from the first minute I was absolutely sucked in. I haven't been this enthralled and involved in a movie in years. This movie put me into the world I felt like I was right there with Ethan and his crew holding on to every breath till the credits rolled.
All the action scenes had a real sense of stakes and intensity which made me literally out of breath by the end. 
I love this movie. You will too. Watch it!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

969,robjohnwolfe,Don't burn that bridge!,9,21 September 2018,"""We'll burn that bridge when we get to it."" is the stand out line from MISSION IMPOSSIBLE FALLOUT. But dialogue comes second to the building intensity of fists, knives, guns, motorbikes, helicopters, tall buildings and cliff faces. Yes there is actually action in this movie that is done in ways we haven't seen and a motorcycle chase second to none. Regardless of your personal feelings towards Tom Cruise, he is certainly a master of his craft and the 'Mission' movies certainly bring out his best. Supported by a great ensemble of Simon Pegg, Ving Rhymes, Alec Baldwin and, try not to drool girls, Henry Cavill. If you're looking for an action treat, this is the most thrilling ride in the park, worth every penny you pay and you will come out of the cinema humming the theme.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

There was a time when you heard the theme song in the theatre with loud a surround system, you got this goose bumps, wanted to jump off the buildings like Tom cruise and save the world.... and now I just wanna pull my hair every time I fall for this mission impossible crap.i truly thought the critics would be fair about their ratings but I guess everybody got themselves a nice lobster and champagne dinner with a nice Rolex. Sometimes I think Tom cruise just wanted to be a sprint athlete and all he wants is running..running...and more running. This movie has the same bs formula used 100000xtimes.

The action is breathtaking, it includes the most amount of time in the film but you never get bored. Characterization is not perfect but it has been developed. All of them are involved in the story and has an important role; plus we have Solomon Lane which I believe is a respectable villain. The story and events however are not that deep and exciting. A man who wants to destroy the world with the help of a corrupted agent has become an overtold and predictable story.In conclusion, Mission Impossible- Fallout is a very enjoyable movie. It has fascinating action and visuals, memorable characters, good acting and directing along with a medicore story and plot.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Well, they did it again this time and I can admit that my nerves were on edge in several scenes due to the camera placement being 'unorthodox' and seeing the action differently OR just thinking of the pain that can come if something goes awry.
Fully entertained; a true summer blockbuster popcorn movie! Can't wait to see the next one.
P.S. Vanessa Kirby and Rebecca Ferguson are absolute babes! Thanks for casting hot women Tom!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
981,ryanmdtrainor,I don't understand the praise honestly,6,9 February 2021,"For me, this was probably the worst mission impossible, although not that it was bad but that it was merely ""decent,"" but definitely a rung lower than the usual brilliance that I'm used to seeing!Maybe I saw another movie than everyone here, but really? The ending wasn't just fantastical, it was painfully against physics, which is something that normally is adhered to with MI movies. I mean, the hook flies through the air and snags a rock to stop the helicopter? Also, before that, it was some stroke of brilliance apparently to figure out how to take the other helicopter down except it really wasn't. It was obvious, just like most of the movie. Some scenes had that flare of originality and adrenaline but definitely not the ending, which was rather lackluster given all of the predecessors.Also, they couldn't come up with a new villian so they used an old one, but didn't really make him seem as impressive as before.And the cherry on top was the knowledge that they wouldn't allow Henry Caville to wear a fake mustache so that the other Superman movie producer didnt' have to spend 20 million dollars to CGI it out! That's just poor class on top of a mediocre movie.They had better raise the bar back to their usual standards of craftiness and originality because if I just wanted to see a big budget action film, I could watch Fast and Furious or any other number of counterparts out there. But MI has always had something most other ones didn't - and frankly it wasn't in Fallout.

984,niall-mcmahon-2,Great action movie (so-so story).,9,1 August 2018,"Tremendous stunts, terrific action, fantastic fight scene - what more do you want from a summer blockbuster? Of course it is unoriginal. Of course there is very little logic or plausibility to the plot (apparently there was no completed screenplay when filming began - it shows!) No, it doesn't have the most intelligent storyline (or even the most intelligent MI movie storyline) but then how many action movies do?Without question, what we have here is a series of conceptual stunts linked together with a passable, generic-action-movie sequence of events. Usually I'd give a movie of that sort about a 7; this gets a 9 because those concepts are so brilliantly executed and shot that you have to take a step back and applaud. Don't overthink it - let it wash over you, accept it for what it is (and isn't) and you'll have a whale of a time.

The story is 100% predictable and clichee, double cross after double cross, a few cheap surprises and the most implausible turnout of events you'll ever see. I mean EVER.

Like fine wine, these movies just keep on getting better and better. And to top Rogue Nation and Ghost Protocol? Damn, Fallout is AMAZING!
Even though it's meant to be a typical summer blockbuster with cool ass action sequences and badass shots, this movie doesn't compromise on the plot and the message it delivers. Most of the summer flicks are forgettable, meaning you enjoy it once in the theatre and that's about it. But Fallout is different. There's a psychological aspect to it. We don't get action scenes at the expense of certain characters (well even though the action sequences are something we haven't seen before). And coming to the action sequences and stunts, boy oh boy! They're too bloody awesome and guess what, ALL OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY PERFORMED! HOLY HELL! From that incredible HALO jump to the final helicopter scene, all of them were actually filmed with the actual actors. 
Tom Cruise is at his best... at 56. The stunts he's preformed for this film are surreal. Henry Cavill is an actual badass. That bathroom brawl is one of the best action sequences I've ever seen, period. Simon Pegg's Benji is great as always. Sean Harris as Solomon Lane is all the more menacing in this film than ever. 
And the cinematography is phenomenal. We go from Berlin to Paris and then to London. And finally, to Kashmir. Everything is beautifully captured and is a visual treat.
Like everything make this one of the best ever action thrillers. You have a storyline which makes sense, really good cinematography, a dope track, memorable characters and probably the best ever action scenes!

Have no problem with the unrealistic scenarios and bonkers stunts. I like Tom Cruise well enough, and thought the addition of Simon Pegg in recent instalments has been brilliant. 
This movie was pretty good, but far from superb - and so when I came onto IMDB to see how other viewers had found it I was gobsmacked by all the hyperbolic reviews and 10/10. Some of the comments just stunned me ""best action movie of the last century"", ""flawless"", ""the best movie I have seen in years"".
I'm just glad I didn't read these and base my decision to watch the movie on them - I'd have been bitterly disappointed .
I can only believe what other reviewers say; that these inflated scores are from paid reviewers. Which is lame. 
The movie was Tom Cruise hero-heavy for me, I would rather have seen other characters have some hero time - where's Jeremy Renner? I loved him in the previous movie. This was the Tom Cruise show, and really over the top in that regard, that insane miles long run over the roofs of buildings was actually funny by the end.
I liked the bathroom fight scene which was visceral and entertaining. The vehicle chases were good too. The helicopter chase was over long and beyond unrealistic. The attempt to defuse apparently undefusable bombs, with the nurse ex wife helping was stupid, the use of previous characters again was lazy - although I like Rebecca Ferguson's character. Henry Cavill was underused and Angela Bassett pointless. 
A very mixed bag for me with long sections where I was quite bored and underwhelmed. This is not in any way a flawless 10/10 movie, and miles away from the best action movie ever!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Mission impossible films have always been considered as fun and worth the watch but they've never been considered great films. This however is a great film. With Tom Cruise portraying the main man Ethan Hunt with style, and with the background knowledge knowing he broke one of his legs whilst doing a stunt is truly remarkable. Henry Cavill is a perfect choice for the villain in this film as Walker is very nicely built both in character and size. You have to see it to believe it.

You cannot expect these movies to be pieces of intellectual social commentary. But they should still offer mystery and suspense, along with the action. I think the main problem with this incarnation, is the complete lack of a mission. Instead it just seems to jump from one action sequence to the next and the viewer never gets to experience the big reveal for how they pulled it off.

1021,aaronbandley,How Long Before A Man Like That Has Had Enough?,10,27 July 2018,"9.9/10*minor spoilers ahead*Starring Tom Cruise and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the perfect MI movie to date, with the stunts bigger than ever and action sequences stunning to watch. The film starts with Cruise's Ethan Hunt and his team (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) losing several cases of plutonium to a group known as 'The Apostles', an organization formed from the remains of The Syndicate, and are teamed up with the CIA's Agent Walker (Henry Cavill) in an attempt to retrieve it. In a franchise of great action and stunts, the third act of Mission: Impossible - Fallout pushes it over the edge with a shootout in airborne helicopters, which was arguably the best stunt of all time and raises the stakes in multiple areas. The cast of the film were also phenomenal, with many reprising their roles from previous entries in the franchise, several of which (Alec Baldwin and Rebecca Ferguson) were able to steal the scenes they were in. Overall, Mission: Impossible- Fallout is the best MI film yet and is a film worthy to see in a full theatre.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1022,Iykman,Awesome action!!!!,10,5 August 2018,"This movie ticks all the boxes an action movie should... Kept me at the edge of my seat for most of it! There was never a dull moment! Fallout delivers and tops Rogue Nation. Felt good to have parted with my money for this. Great car chase, hand to hand combat and gun fire scenes. Interesting storyline as well. 3 words - Go and Watch.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1023,gringopaul,Tired Reboot,5,8 November 2018,"When I say tired, I mean physically tired. Tom Cruise may not be over the hill, but in several of his action sequences his reaction time appeared noticeably slow. Ving Rhames looked geriatric, especially in the quick cuts of him getting in and out of vehicles. Simon Pegg seems like a much older man as well. Henry Cavills first speech when he meets Tom Cruise was delivered like a practice run with a new script. I can usually suspend disbelief and get into the World of Mission Impossible, but this time watching these aging, cigar store indian actors phoning in their performances were SO BAD it was hard to watch.JJ Abrams has produced so much great entertainment, it's hard to imagine the fault is all his. The only acting standout was Vanessa Kirby, who lights things up as The White Widow.I have learned that a high, early score on IMDB is often misleading. Do studio hack writers get paid to write glowing reviews with 10/10 ratings? It's hard to believe good ratings for Hollywood blockbuster movies any longer. When you've spent $178,000,000 making a film, what's $1,000,000 more to influence critics on metacritic and get a couple hundred glowing reviews for IMDB? As someone who has enjoyed the other movies in the series, I was disappointed.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1024,riovegaz,One of the best in the MI series,9,3 August 2018,Yep Tom Cruise once again nailed it over the top with various beautifully shots action sequences.

Or try and lick his own elbow.We all love the high octane action scenes and stunts.Perhaps people would relate to it more if it was on their level.

Just when I was about to give up on Hollywood for its recent obsession with stuffing movies full of formulaic story lines and trendy one-sided politics, M:I 6 comes along and reminds us how a blockbuster action movie is supposed to make us feel and provides the mental and emotional escape that going to the movies is supposed to deliver.

1037,theredbird-2,The final nail in the coffin,1,17 September 2019,"The very first film made a me a tom cruise fan. This one has put a stop to that.Mission Impossible was a promising movie franchise. Tom Cruise took a much loved tv series and brought it to the big screen. While I had issues with the way it was done. Namely making the character of Jim Phelps a traitor and killing off the whole team but Ethan Hunt. I stuck with it. The movies were always supposed to be about the missions. This last one was all about Ethan Hunt, or rather, Tom Cruise.This movie was a shameless tribute to Tom Cruise' ego. We get it Tom. You like to do your own stunts. You want to be seen as the hero. You're a nice guy. Men should want to be you and women should want to be with you. Enough already!The plotline was so thin I honestly wondered how much the writers were paid for it. The talent within the cast that was so underused was both frustrating and painful to watch. Some actors had maybe one moment on the screen. Others were simply there as extras to fill the space. I honestly wondered if the other actors names were used as bait to lure in fans, only for the trap to be that we barely get to see any of them while Tom is hogging the camera.Congratulations Mr Cruise. You killed this franchise for me. I'm done. I strongly recommend that everyone save themselves the trouble and don't bother with this farce of strung together stunts and cringe worthy dialogue.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

This 147 Min installment of the Mission Impossible franchise has delivered on this promise. Although I am not generally a fan of action movies - especially the ones that are filled with nonsense unrealistic senses were the hero never dies, for some weird reason, M:I and Tom Cruise get an ""Exception à la règle"" as the entertainment overcomes the nonsense and keeps you in the movie throughout.

It's a Hollywood action movie, right? So cardboard characters are welcome... Ok, lets go on... Still don't understand why Hollywood are so afraid of realism. I don't mind having to suspend my disbelief for a while, specially in an exhilarating action movie like this one, but for more than 2 hours? And in absolutely every situation? I'm almost Ok with those crazy stunts involving cars, motorbikes and helicopters, and even jumping from 1 rooftop to another and people slamming themselves against solid concrete. But when they put 2 guys in a bathroom getting beaten by a martial arts expert, receiving all kinds of deadly punches -with feet, fits and metal pipes!- to their chests, necks and heads and then they walk away as fresh as if they were getting a 2 hours session of Thai massage... That's really too much for me... What's wrong with adding some realism, for the love of God!? I think these movies would gain a lot if they leveled up the common sense bar, just a little, so the audience don't have to feel so cheated and dumb!Anyways... the same old story. And yes, Paris looks awesome, deprived of all its beauty and rich cultural significance, reduced to a mere background for car chasing stunts.Can't wait to see more of this!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1049,norbertog55,A true surprise and masterpiece of action. Excellent,10,31 July 2018,"I really was pleasantly surprised by this Mission Impossible: FallOut. It is one of those few films that one sits in the cinema chair and knows how it ends, that the world will be saved by the hero or the heroes, but even so it can not be detached from the edge of the seat, nor take one's eye off the screen. The more than two and a half hours that it lasted seemed like only 1 hour, and in the end I ended up asking for more. This more than known that Tom Cruise knows what he does and knows what the viewer likes, as well as the director Christopher McQuarrie. Excellent action scenes, combined with much suspense and good performances, far from me, the franchise has been rising in meteoric quality from Ghost Protocol, and this last one to be one of the best in the series. Long live Ethan Hunt and IMF",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

It's ridiculously predictable, the plot mostly feels like your average 24 or NCIS episode. The action scenes are mostly well made (apart from some physically impossible stuff, but well... it's an action movie), so the movie is okay for a brain off action on session, but it's really nothing more. The acting is at best okay overall.
The worst thing is that this movie just doesn't do anything to deserve all these absurd 9 and 10 ratings, making me wonder how many of these are just paid for.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1055,romonocapprotti,Was a good movie not a great movie didn't quite meet expectations,7,27 July 2018,A few of us went to see this movie last night it was a good movie I enjoyed myself but it wasn't a great movie. To me a great movie is a movie you immediately wanna watch again. This movie didn't do that for me I put it in the top two of the six Mission impossible movies the problem is at least for me is I shouldn't read what critics say because they get your expectations up so high and when you watch the movie and it doesn't quite live up to that you feel a little disappointed. Usually at least three or four of us will go and see a movie and then we get outside if were out there for a while talking about it it's either because of bad movie or it's a good movie none of us really had a lot to say about this movie there were scenes in it that left you wanting to see more like the bathroom fight scene that was great of course some of Tom cruises crazy stunts but there wasn't a whole Lotta memorable things about this movie. But I will say this to me it was better than infinity war and black panther. I'll tell you movie I really love particularly the last 10 or 15 minutes because there's one scene in a movie and you know what I'm talking about my jaw hit the ground when I seen that was the first sicario movie. I thought that was a great movie but this is just my opinion I thought this was a good movie go judging for yourself and have a good time,Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1059,burgerbrogaming,An impossibily great film.,9,2 August 2018,"Mission impossible fallout is easily the best action movie this year an maybe one of the best of all time. Mission impossible fallout is one of those rare experiences where you have high expectations for a blockbuster and your expectations are not only realized, they are surpassed. Whether it's a badass chase sequence or jaw dropping stunt work this movie always has your adrenaline spiked up to the max. The action is almost all practical and uses no stunt devils so when the action goes down it feels that much more intence. Another reason the action is better than most movies is because it progessively gets better with each scene until the ending, and considering the first set piece is a real halo jump all in one take with no stunt devils you can assume the action is amazing. However not only is the action amazing the story is very intence and filled with surprises at every turn. You never know who you can trust and the clock is always ticking and as it does that the mission gets more and more intence. I don't want to spoil the plot of the story because it is truly something special. All of the characters are fleshed out and put to there maximum potential showing there dark side and vulnerability when under pressure. This is easily the best performance I've seen by Henry Cavil playing agent August Walker in particular. Talking about flaws with this movie it's very hard to find any important ones, some nitpicks are that the comedy sometimes doesn't stick but the comedy is never put anywhere that undermines the plot so it's not that big a deal. And maybe they could of played up the conflict between two characters a little more but me telling you who would be a spoiler so you'll just have to see. Over all though mission impossible fallout is one of the best movies of the year and also maybe one of the best action movies of all time and is easily the best in the serious. Go see this movie NOW.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1060,mandar-61353,Tom cruise style action adventure,5,11 August 2018,"Everything is tom cruise here. The story, the action, the stunts, smashing, jumping. His performance is marvellous and I watched it for him only. However the plot is interesting but the ending is something we've already seen in past franchise of MI. The helicopter sequences though looks thrilling, I felt it somewhat overstated or exaggerated. I was expecting something newer or fresher than typical 'diffusing a nuclear bomb' style ending as tom had already done that. Still its worth watching for Tom Cruise.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1061,FilmfanSweden,WOW!!! Just wow! What a great actionmovie!,10,1 August 2018,"I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!! Just saw 'Mission Impossible: Fallout' and it knocked me out! Hands down, it's one of the best actionmovies ever made! Just when you thought Tom Cruise can't give the audience anything more - he surprises you and give more than ever! I got to admire the script and direction by Christopher McQuarrie, who is the mastermind here. It feels like two movies in one - with extra cheese! It's 2 h, 27 m but when it's over you feel immediately like a drug addict already wanting more before the end credits barely starts to roll. I've seen so many actionfilms but this is something extraordinary! The action! The stunts! The high octane plot! Gosh, gosh, gosh - what a great piece of work this is! Of course we KNOW it will be a helluva ride, but still - to actually come up with the ideas and then doing it too! Maaaaan, that is some serious...wow...I'm loss for words! And that makes me HAPPY - because I'm not easily impressed by actionmovies, believe it or not! This sixth film actually feels like a first one, because it's SO INTENSE! You know what I mean? Please, Tom Cruise, never stop doing these high quality actionfilms! We ALWAYS want more - especially after this one! RATE: 10/10!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1062,mccabeharris,M:I does it again,9,30 November 2018,"Hollywood's most consistently entertaining franchise churns out another winner. What started out as an auteur-driven James Bond has evolved into a consistent blockbuster factory. Starting with 2011's Ghost Protocol, Tom Cruise and his M:I filmmakers found a very satisfying formula for delivering summer thrills, and Fallout might be the best version yet. Don't expect anything revolutionary or new. That's not what this is about. What you will get is another up-tempo, dazzling rollercoaster full of beautiful people doing incredible things. You might poke holes in the plot or roll your eyes at some of the more predictable twists, but you'll still enjoy every minute of it. The craftsmanship is such that Chris McQuarrie and company managed to keep me on the edge of my seat during the climactic chase sequence even when I know damn well what the eventual outcome will be. They should keep making these for as long as Tom Cruise can still look good running.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Since the release of Ghost Protocal in 2011 the mission impossible franchise has been solidly progressing with excellent action set pieces. This film wastes no time with plot or character development and just throws setpiece upon setpiece at you, and I loved it. It is thoroughly entertaining and Tom Cruise pulls off some truly impressive stunts. The plot- like in porn- is just there to give a ""reason"" for the impressive feats committed by the actors. I recommend you catch this flick while it is still in cinemas, not going to be as impressive if viewed at home.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Protracted and very predictable action scenes, a lot of clichés in order to appease today's PC society (and Portland), a very old and overused plot, strange image quality - have they deliberately added grain? Not the best acting either.... the list goes on.Some stars given for the quality of the stunts and the camera work is very good, it's just that it has all been done before and when will Hollywood learn that we are all bored of their traditional formula. Come on, stop being so lazy. Realism is what we want and no, realism is not boring.

Tom Cruise does an amazing job and is as stylish, debonair and daredevilish Ethan Hunt as ever. The movies plot is terrific and all the actors play their roles exceedingly well. The only negative comment is that the movie takes too many ideas from the 007 / Bond films and implements them into this film. For example, the villain in this film sounds like Mr. White in previous Bond films. The winter looking Hunt looks very much dressed like Bond did in Spectre. The use of the helicopter crash seen looks like that of the airplane scene from, again, Spectre. Great movie as a whole but as a fan of both franchises I found too much content from Bond injected into MI.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1082,julienpinault,Mission Impossible: Fallout,9,6 August 2018,"'Mission Impossible: Fallout' is directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who previously directed 'Rogue Nation,' and is the first instalment of the franchise in which a director has returned. 'Fallout' has proved this excellent decision. McQuarrie has taken everything that has worked within the series, as he did in 'Rogue Nation,' and escalated them through stunning tension. The action set pieces the series has become known for are combined with refined emotional stakes in 'Fallout.' McQuarrie is clearly aware that intense action is not intense without the audience being emotionally invested in the characters.The stakes in 'Fallout' are ridiculously high involving a nuclear threat, which we as audience members have become accustomed to due to constant 'end of the world' scenarios we are faced with in most blockbusters today, yet McQuarrie keeps the story rooted within character, bringing the film above other generic action films with these plot points. Sean Harris's brilliantly menacing 'Solomon Lane' makes the threat personal to Tom Cruise's 'Ethan Hunt.' This personal element is escalated with the return of Michelle Monaghan reprising her role from J.J. Abrams's 'Mission Impossible: 3' who is at the heart of the story from the very opening shot. McQuarrie has created the most emotionally intense film of the series by developing its characters before placing them within the action. Rebecca Ferguson, returning as 'Isla Faust' from 'Rogue Nation' is given a rivetingly unpredictable role. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames also reprise their roles. Although underused, Rhames has a surprisingly emotional dialogue scene, increasing the tension in proceeding action scenes involving his character. The film is set up unpredictably in a way which means you actually feel the characters are at real risk, and of course, Tom Cruise gives a fittingly vulnerable, strong performance as Ethan Hunt especially in scenes involving Monaghan's character and in interactions with Sean Harris as 'Lane.'The jaw-dropping action sequences are made jaw-dropping due to their practicality. Cruise has shockingly topped the C-17 stunt in 'Rogue Nation' with a terrifyingly brilliant helicopter sequence filmed using IMAX cameras, performed for real in typical Tom Cruise fashion. The Paris motorcycle sequence is so intense it is difficult to watch, yet you won't be able to take your eyes of the screen. What makes these action scenes is that the stunts are combined with perfect camerawork whereby McQuarrie isn't attempting to imitate the shakiness of 'Bourne' as J.J. Abrams tried unsuccessfully in 'Mission Impossible: 3.' He is doing the opposite. The camera is placed within the action and showcases the stunts in all their glory, following objects/characters or even being attached to them, a style recently brought back with a few films such as 'John Wick.' There is a stand-out action sequence in a bathroom which is far more grounded than larger scaled stunts within the film, yet it is made just as intense, maybe more so, through stunning choreography and the casting of 'Liang Yang' whose menacing facial expressions alone elevate the intensity of the sequence. Unusual for hand-to-hand combat film sequences, you feel the impactof every punch. This feeling of impact is obviously brought out through the choreography, but is also heightened with sound design. Every punch is bone crunching and brutally heard. Every gunshot is joltingly loud. In contrast, McQuarrie has also used silence in moments of action, most notably as a result of a lightning strike during the nail-biting H.A.L.O jump sequence, and in a brilliant one-take shootout sequence in order to give it the surreal feeling it required.Furthermore, there are quieter scenes of tension throughout created by performances and writing. The writing is often predictable, and is no 'Usual Suspects,' also written by Christopher McQuarrie, yet it is often very good in terms of creating tension. A scene which stood out for me was one involving a French policewoman for its tension. Humour is also cleverly balanced with tension and darkness, especially evident in this scene - a scene of initial humour which unfolds into extreme tension and weightiness.In conclusion, 'Fallout' is the best entry in the series yet with its culmination of incredible stunt work, performances and a personal story to the characters which serves to heighten the intensity.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

It's cliche, you know nobody in the team is going to die, at the beginning of the movie you just know who is good and going to turn out to be bad and just like always a happing ending so people go out the theater with a good feeling.

1085,leantom-95768,Impressive. Best of the Series,8,31 July 2018,"I've got to say that I'm very impressed with the recent iterations of the Mission Impossible series. The first three were what I would consider ""solid"" or ""good"" films, but nothing memorable. The most recent three, however, rise to the level of being very good action movies, with Mission Impossible: Fallout being the best of these three.The movie starts as a continuation of the last film, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, with the cult-like adherents of Solomon Lane, the antagonist of the last film, waging an espionage war against formal governments. To make matters worse, U.S. intelligence have learned that these adherents are trying to step up their game by securing plutonium (for what purpose, we find out later in the film). Enter Ethan Hunt and the IMF. They're hired by said U.S. intelligence agencies to intercept a deal involving the Syndicate (i.e., the name of the group formerly run by the now-imprisoned Solomon Lane) and an arms dealer selling weapons-grade plutonium, posing as the Syndicate in order to fulfill the transaction. However, the deal in interrupted (by whom, we don't find out until later), and the plutonium is stolen in the process owing to a decision by Ethan Hunt to save one of his personnel rather than watch over the plutonium. Interestingly, Ethan Hunt and his associates aren't harmed in the botched transaction (without revealing anything, we find out why much later in the film).What starts as a process to obtain the stolen plutonium leads to various intricacies and plot twists, the likes of which top any Mission Impossible movie heretofore released. The action sequences are also quite breathtaking (especially the bathroom fight scene). Keep in mind, however, that the movie's also fairly intelligent, and the plot twists actually form a coherent whole by the end of the movie.Good work, Mr. Cruise.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

With top notch acting from Tom Cruise (playing Ethan Hunt) and cinematic action shots framed more like a Wes Anderson art piece, this movie was a non stop thrill ride with unexpected twists (per usual) and iconic ""I knew it moments"" that stayed true to brand. The only hiccup in this movie was Henry Cavill's terrible first half acting.

I get trying to reach as many markets as possible, but the story simplification was affected by that. Cavill came across incredibly wooden, and dislikable . I couldn't see Hunt trusting him in any way from the outset. Both Rhames, and Pegg are good actors but seem ill-suited for field work. I laughed when Pegg pulled off the scuba mask. The action was great, and Cruise does fantastic work as usual. The bathroom fight was unbelievable outside a Terminator movie. The highlights are the action/ camera shots, Cruise, locales, Vanessa Kirby, Baldwin and CNN as fake news. Drawbacks were poor writing to compliment the story (the emptiest nightclub washroom in history), underutilized Sean Harris, Cavill's character, Bassett's CIA character (impulsive, arrogant).",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Henry Cavill is a great addition.All the stunts, big and small, are amazing, including the best fistfight of the series. We don't see stunt-work like this much anymore. A breath of fresh air amidst the CGI-fueled summer. Mission: Impossible is as strong as ever.Some might argue that this is just more of the same. They're right.

Story - 4 - The usual run of the mill. really sad becouse i was expecting a lot more; the timebomb is ticking and guess Ethan is going to cut the wire at the last moment (sorry is that even a spoiler?) 
Acting - 6 - Usual Tom Cruise; harry cavill and Sean harris were pretty decent.

1136,jcoen-01516,"Great start, unforgivably weak third act",6,4 August 2018,"The movie started out extremely good. Top notch action & great writing with a good amount of humor. It was completely on par with the best movies of the franchise until then.
Somewhere in the second half the movie turned really bad. It's painfully obvious that McQuarrie tried too hard to write a smart script, so he added an unoriginal, redundant plot twist a la ""I knew exactly what would happen so All of this is actually my plan"". It's pretty much the same type of twist as in Rogue Nation, but this time McQuarrie made it overly complicated and yet somehow predictable (I mean did anybody not expect Henry Cavill's character to be a bad guy?). It actually made me wonder if McQuarrie adds a twist of that kind to every single project he writes.After that, the movie doesn't really recover. The finale is just a collection of absurdly unrealistic scenarios. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect M:I to be 100% realistic, after all that's part of what makes me love the films so much. But many of the things happening in Fallout could've just as well been in Sharknado. A helicopter falling if a cliff but conveniently being saved by a random hook somehow attaching itself to the stone ground? Even Mission Impossible 2 laughs at this. Snother example is the moment when the detonator is rushing towards the edge just to slowly stop right before it after a cut. That's right, the movie actually managed to make continuity errors between cuts a plot device (there were actually quite many errors in the lighting/color continuity between cuts as well, though this is nitpicking). Even ignoring this, the occurances in the finale were much too influenced by luck to be considered anything but messy. To be fair, the effects for all of this were obviously as great as you'd expect them to be (nitpicking: the bullets of the LMG Walker uses from the helicopter are weirdly animated to look like lasers), my only problems are really with the action itself. Oh, and of course the bombs were only defused one second before they would've detonated (even though I found that moment was quite well-justified).Overall this movie was really great in the beginning but felt like the screenwriter was replaced by a first year film student for the third act. I was really looking forward to this movie as I loved its predecessors, but sadly I left the screening disappointed. Of course a bad ending might not affect your overall opinion of the movie as much as it did for me or you might disagree that the ending is bad in the first place, but to me it really dragged down what started out to be a great addition to the franchise.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

From my point of view they have exaggerated with some phases of action, especially the fight in the helicopter, how he managed to escape without any fracture. I understand, it's a movie, it's not really reality, but we're not kids, so we can sell anything, no matter if the special effects are spectacular or good at cinema.

This was a fantastic movie. The action is nonstop. The sound and the music is electrifying. There is a specific scene where he is on a motorcycle and riding through some pillars and you can feel the sound weaving in and out of the pillars as he drives by them. There is such attention to detail here. The only negative I have about it, is that there is some cliche action movie stuff involved here.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Saw today in Chennai S2 Theyagaraja Multiplex...
. 
This is the latest in the franchise. Runs like a sequel to the earlier Rogue Nation
Tom Cruise does not slacken his pace and is there in almost every frame. This is a non-stop, high on adrenaline actioner and does full justice to the genre.
The visuals are spectacular, photography is excellent and the chases are breathtaking- a total paisa vasool if you are looking for just that...
But still it gave me a sense of deja vu, (been there done that ) thing, as most of the repetitive sequences of Bombs, terrorists and several Govt agencies running behind them with their own moles and double-crossers has been tried and tested in earlier MIs and and other such movies ...
The regular IMF team is in place, to help Ethan Hunt, along with Alec Baldwin and Michelle Monaghan and Henry Cavill (playing villain) also pitching in, in this venture/ adventureGo see for the sheer spectacle of action unfolding but do not expect any outstanding twists or suspense. 
It is quite straight forward.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

We can't expect a clearly drawn story(like specifying ericca Sloane's disagreement with IMF)because since the given time is limited you may need to sacrifice action sequences which are actually at the heart of mission impossible series but what Fallout does is creating moments that are powerful,well laid out and properly played even having a not so good story.
Don't expect this movie to blow you away in every way ,it's fantastic overall but has some weak points here and there .Expect a good action movie and you'll get more than that.

1163,externaltestaccount,A quite brilliant action movie... in the classic mould.,10,16 November 2018,"Mission: Impossible Fallout is the sixth entry in this series and it has no right to be as good as it is.Just like the classic Bond movies from the 60's - 90's - It's not about the plot or characters. It's about the stunning set pieces. It's about the stunts. The gadgets.But more than that, it is about the fantastic direction and editing.Christopher McQuarrie has done an extraordinary job in directing the action that I have hope again that Hollywood can do action cinema right when produced properly.The editing was perfect, Eddie Hamilton (yes I had to look it up, yes I will pay more attention to great editors in future) ensures that you see all the action you want, unnecessary quick cuts that have been the bane of action movies in the past 10-15 years are not present.
The sense of adventure - and humour - are present in most scenes, as they should be of a movie of this type. Grizzled cynicism is all well and good, but it's good to see an action movie changing things up a bit.If you don't like Tom Cruise, then why are you reading this page? I can't say I'm fan of the man, so if you're bored and want to see a great action movie, get over yourself and go in with an open mind, the production is top tier and it delivers an old fashioned Hollywood action movie that we don't see often enough.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Next was Equalizer 2 today (wed), it's the best Equalizer movie out of the franchise. Critics are idiots. I'll be watching Skyscraper is tomorrow (Thurs) and Friday will be the Spy Who Dumped Me.

Absolutely spectacular, with great shots, great action scenes and great fight scenes.

1173,euricodcosta,Without doubt - The best MI movie ever made,10,27 July 2018,"Whilst i have enjoyed the MI movie series, they were never great movies. They were never in the bracket 'OMG guys, you'e gotta see the film'. So when this movie started I was not expecting to see a 'Great Tom Cruise' flick. Oh was I wrong. Without giving too much away, this film connects with the last MI instalment No. Some over the good guys and bad guys all return alongside some new ones. The storyline has merit (albeit a little over the top but thats what you would expect with such a movie) but what stands out are the stunts scenes. Not much CGI was used and you could pretty much Mr Cruise did his own stunts. The film was that good it didn't feel like a 2 and a half hour movie and the pace, emotion, adrenaline, suspense kept me glued to my seat. Go a watch the best Tom Cruise movie in years.This message will self-descruct in 5 seconds.....",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1174,veronicadiall,Boring and Predictable.,5,27 July 2018,"There's a theme I've noticed with the MI films. I have liked all the odd numbered ones and disliked all the even numbered ones and this one was no exception. I loved Rogue Nation (or to be frank the character of Ilsa Faust played by Rebecca Ferguson). But she wasn't allowed to shine in this film. She had more agency in RN, in this she's just the woman action heroin.This had none of the drama and intesinty of Rogue Nation. It was essentially one action scene after the other. The plot was paper thin, and the motivation of the villain was laughable. Henry Cavill as Walker was just obnoxious. An American meathead. And Angela Bassette' s actions really served no purpose.I was also very irritated at the resolution of the marriage. I had been under the impression that Hunt lived with his wife in secret to protect her, and it was an important aspect of who he was and it kept him anchored. It just seemed that the kiboshed the marriage so that they could make Faust his love interest. It was just forced and contrived.The only thing I liked about the film was Hunt's willing not to sacrifice even one innocent life. And the cinematography. The film is a great advertisement for visiting Paris and London.
To be frank near 75% part of the film, I was just tempted to walk out and read the plot resolution online.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1175,morenmonis,I would watch this again,10,2 August 2018,This was the sixth instalment and yes it was freaking awesome. Without a doubt this is the best one in the franchise! Tom still has it.,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1176,jorgelujlrcn,The Most Impossible Mission Yet!,10,1 August 2018,"This sixth installment of the long running action franchise gives us an experience like never before. The film features amazing and realistic action sequences that look and feel exhilarating in IMAX, a brilliantly written plot that presents twists and turns that intrigue the viewer and leave them wondering how the story arc concludes, and an excellent cast chemistry from returning members as well as new additions. This may be not only the best film in the franchise as of now, but also Tom Cruise's greatest achievement in film. Mission accomplished!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1177,douggarr,Seriously. Terrible,1,27 August 2021,"This is an embarrassment. I can start with the laughably phony endless chase scenes in Paris.

Although I thought the action scenes in the trailers gave away too much and left you KNOWING what happens next, I can say that most of the film included a lot of surprises that were not spoiled! Simon Pegg's, Tom Cruise's and Henry Cavill's performances were great! Overall I loved the film, it left me on the edge of my seat waiting for the unexpected and I can't wait to see what the future of these movies brings!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1180,goyalatul-94187,Couple of great action scene and that's it,6,5 August 2018,"Normally, I am not a huge fan of Tom Cruise but nevertheless, I still enjoy watching MI series. But this time when I saw that review are this great so i thought may be there is something different from earlier and it will nice to see something different.
Movie start with a usual and set the plot for the whole movie ..and then there came the Toilet scene which was awesome and I thought so may be movie is going to be great as Critics were raving about.
But I am keep waiting waiting and more waiting but nothing new happen ..I almost start thinking to walk out as I was not seeing anything new which I haven't seen before like Car/Motorcycle chase scenes..But somehow I still stay back as I was hopeful that something great will happen otherwise why the movie is getting so big rating from critics. I am glad that I waited as the last helicopter scene was beyond my expectation and it was the best scene of the movie. Except these 2 action scene, there is nothing new. I understand if Tom Cruise'fan like this movie but Critics too? They will be loosing credibility if they keep rating this kind of movie this high rating. It misguide people like us who trust them.
But even after all this, I like TC's movies for fun not for my craving for a good movie.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1181,tilakboinapally,Good movie - keeps you glued to the seat,9,4 August 2018,"Thus movie makes a great watch for its screen play , direction and some good acting from the lead actors . BGM is impressive . Some cool action scenes with equally interesting locations makes it a treat for the eyes. The only drawback is the story line; the villains motive is not very convincing but the screenplay makes up for it and does not disappoint.

1182,jasonpachar-74665,The Best of the 6,10,30 July 2018,"Following on the heels of Rogue Nation, Ethan Hunt dives back in the game with an all new spin on the word: Dangerous. Things aren't what they seem in IMF (Impossible Missions Force), because this time the same enemy attacks, but through someone that Hunt and his team trusted enough to get the job done. 
 This movie franchise has beat the odds against time and time again over the last decade and a half. For 22 years we have seen Tom Cruise at his finest, but with this new installment in the franchise, like I said, things aren't what they seem. 
 The franchise has seen its directors from Brian de Palma to John Woo to J.J. Abrams to Brad Bird and the last Christopher McQuarrie. Props goes to Chris for making this movie and Rogue Nation being the most dangerous missions that Ethan Hunt has ever faced. 
 I would definitely recommend this movie to any high speed, jump out of your seat adrenaline junkie. It has its ultimate highs, but the lows are very minimal when it comes to cliffhanging and jumping off moving trains and getting nearly killed in the process.

Probably one of the best movies I've seen in 2018, and probably one of the best movies in the Mission: Impossible series, Mission: Impossible - Fallout was full of action and twists. I also want to add that the actors in this movie were phenomenal. The plot was simply great, my heart was pounding throughout the entire movie. I would have to say my favorite thing about Mission: Impossible - Fallout was that even though it was a fast-paced, action film, there were parts in the movie that were funny and that's how I know it is a really good movie- that there can be a good balance of comedy, drama, and action.

While I appreciated some of the action scenes which were truly great, this movie was very boring. The dialogue was so set up I guess which character was going to say what next.
Also Lane isn't that great of a villain. Get someone new. In fact how about a fresh take on the whole series entirely.

I see a lot of reviews saying the action was great the plot was rubbish. At the end of the day the main selling points is the action and amazing scence that keep you in suspense. Quite honestly that's what draws me in. Plot holes don't matter and that's the joy of this franchise. It's mission impossible and the amount of crazy stuff that the characters do, means you don't worry about them. I've watched this film countless times and still love the plot, characters and stunts better each time. It's a film that gets better each time you watch it as you think of different reasons why each character did that. Overall a must watch 😄😄",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1203,Olivia-Nightingale,They did the Impossible- MI: Fallout is the best film in the series,10,11 August 2019,"This movie is incredible. Mission: Impossible: Fallout is the best movie in the franchise, and one of (if not the) best action movies in recent memory.In a sea of mediocre and uninspired action movies, Christopher McQuarrie managed to keep the genre tense and exciting.My main gripe with the previous instalments of the franchise is that Ethan Hunt felt too invincible. Even though he was constantly doing dangerous stunts, I always knew he'd eventually get back up. All the way throughout this movie, I feared for his life.Throughout the course of the film, Ethan Hunt is constantly misjudging his situation and making mistakes. This not only humanises Ethan, but it also makes us think that he may actually be capable of death. All throughout his climactic battle with Walker, I thought that he would make that fatal mistake that leads to his downfall. Of course, this never takes place, as the franchise is simply too lucrative to axe the main character. That doesn't take away the fact that the movie managed to make me believe that Ethan Hunt may in fact die.The highlight of this movie is undoubtedly Lane's effect on Ethan due to the effects of Rogue Nation. Because of the events of that film, most notably the threat to kill one of Ethan's best friends, Benji Dunn. This event leads to Ethan to decide to jeopardise his mission in order to save one of his friends, Luther Stickell, early on in the film.This not only proves Ethan's loyalty to his team, but also arises suspicion to his intentions, which allows Walker to propose the theory that Ethan may have turned against IMF to the CIA. All of this makes Lane an excellent villain, showing how he can break down Ethan's psyche while doing very little.Even though the film contains staples of the franchise, such as the masks, unrealistic technology and crazy stunts, the film feels like a breath of fresh air to the franchise, making me excited for the 7th movie.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1207,debadityasinha,The best of the series,10,9 May 2020,"Mission Impossible: fallout abandons all the mistakes from the first four films and focuses to the mission. Minimizing all the broodiness and the romance. This is what Mission Impossible suppose to be. Non-stop action and more craziness. Everything is intriguing and somewhat innovating. Director, Brad Bird, shows more of his talent as a director. Tom Cruise is cool again. Mission Impossible gets it right with its storyline. It's the best part of the movie series and also the best action movie of the year.The story here moderates all the drama unlike the other Mission Impossible films. The action is the real deal in these films. Throughout the movie is all about the plans, escapes, and thrills. The subplots were little, which is good. The best thing about here is the focus. Keeps things moving. Every sequences are innovating and exciting. The building climbing scene and the running through the sandstorm scene are both ridiculously exciting.The actors are the gravy to the action.Tom Cruise proves that he is still an awesome actor. He makes all the action compellingly fun.Rebecca Ferguson is a good female backup. Cavill and Simon Pegg gives plenty of personality to their roles and makes a good comic relief. The villains are just being villains. The praise goes to the director, Christopher McQuarrie. His animated films proves that he can be a great action movie director. Here, he makes all of the action crazy and fun. Puts jokey feeling in some parts, it fits perfectly to the absurdity. The thrills are also there and always there. The CGI is good.Mission Impossible: fallout is a satisfying experience. They made it all simple, throw a lot of decently made action sequences. Mission Impossible doesn't really need a lot of drama. this is what all action movie fans strive for. Hope we get more of these in the upcoming sequels.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1209,griftingforattention,More than Just Action Scenes,10,28 October 2021,"I remember not being hyped at all to see this film, and yet it was one of the best cinema experiences I had. Back than I was a MCU Stan. Mission Impossible was a franchise I never really cared for, however three years onwards I can say that it is the best modern action franchise.The action is incredible. This movie alone has better action scenes than all of Daniel Craig's Bond films.However, Fallout isn't the best Mission Impossible movie just because of its action scenes, which are incredible, Fallout excels in it's writing. Christopher Macquarie's and Tom Cruise's acting have crafted the ultimate action hero in MI Fallout. Ethan Hunt completely outclasses James Bond(Daniel Craig's). He feels like a flawed human being trying their best and giving it their all to accomplish the mission. The same can't be said for Bond from Skyfall onwards, who felt like a dull plank pretending to be James Bond.Speaking of Skyfall, one of the most overrated pieces of modern cinema. Fallout doesn't feel the need to hide behind pretentious themes, because the competency of Christopher Macquarie knows that actions speak louder than words. Every action Ethan Hunt takes drives the story forward. He doesn't feel like he has to overcompensate with fancy suits, expensive watches and cool cars. Even though there is an M5 and classic 5 Series. Not an Aston, but still pretty awesome. Hunt is a hero in the actions he takes. The dream sequence and French traffic cop scene highlight why Ethan Hunt outclasses modern Bond. However, the tide can turn if they get the Chad, Henry Cavill, as Bond and also directors and writers who understand actions speak far louder than pretentious themes and nice suits. Cough...Skyfall...cough.Mission Impossible has been a franchise that excels because it doesn't follow the modern Hollywood trends, it sets them. And it sets them very high, to the point of being untouchable.High hopes for MI7.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Tom Cruise is clearly over the hill and the plastic surgery done to his face makes the use of facial expression during his acting totally impossible. The whole movie is just full of cliches and the acting is average.

This is by no means the best movie of the franchise (for me that's either 1 or 4), but I must say I was very entertained. It is in many ways the same thing we already saw 5 times, but I never had the feeling 'not this again' or 'I know what's happening next'.

I was really excited to see nice panoramic shots of Tom Cruise HALO jumping, however all the shots were up close, blurred, and really didn't give Tom Cruise's efforts the light of the day. Same thing with the helicopter shots. I've been a massive fan of the Mission Impossible franchise. This movie had some funny moments, but left me very upset at the end of the movie. A big let down. Nothing new, terrible camera work, almost seemed like a money grab.The worst movie in the MI series.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1215,shreejit-sugathan,Tad too long,7,30 July 2018,"Definitely one of the best in series of MI. Action packed with lot of wow factor. Henry Cavill character was refreshing and did justice to his personality. The series definitely need a refresh with new characters who replace Luther and Benji to bring some fresh perspective.
Movie is 2 hour 27 minutes which according to me could been done in 2 hours at max. I always have complaint with the villain played in MI series. I feel character of Solomon played Sean Harris (he was in the previous version as well) should have been played by someone who has a huge screen presence, who can truly be villainous and enthrall audiences in thinking that the world need Agent Hunt and his team.

1221,pmk1384,Mission Impossible - Overhyped,7,27 July 2018,"The trailer was awesome, and I have been excited to see this for awhile. I am a big MI fan, and both Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation exceeded my expectations. This film, while still enjoyable, was a bit of a disappointment in terms of the media hype and love fest that has gone on with the reviews of this film. A few years from now, we will look back and both Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation will stand above this one.Most of the action scenes were great, the motorcycle chase scene especially. My main issue with this film, was the lack of authentic suspense. Everything just felt a little off, a little forced, a little predictable, a little manipulative. Cruise also seemed tired. He's getting old, which they did play into with the film, and that did work to a certain extent. It was a little sad to be honest. SPOILER: I also didn't like the way they used the Henry Cavil character. I thought he had good chemistry with Cruise, and I was disappointed that they turned him into a villain. I really think they got too cute and clever and missed out on that potential. I thought it would have given the MI franchise a chance to continue on with Cavil as well, and Cruise as a sort of mentor, but obviously that wasn't the plan. It really reminded me of the latest James Bond film, Spectre. Skyfall was amazing, and Spectre just couldn't really deliver in the way Skyfall did. It was still enjoyable, but just left me feeling a little bored and not satisfied.Fallout was still fun, just not nearly as good as all of the hype. Cruise definitely has his die hard fan core that are out in full force, but as I said, when some objectivity and perspective take hold over the coming years, this will not be the highest ranked MI movie as I've read more than one review state. I have a feeling this might be the end of MI for Cruise, but I wouldn't bet on it, as Cruise has that ability to transform as he ages. I just think he's at that age where high-octane action is in his rear view mirror.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Tom Cruise, my favorite actor, is great in this blockbuster. It's a movie full of action, suspense and unpredictability.

1240,deanlk-1,Near perfect action thriller,9,1 August 2018,"58/2018. Dendy. If all the other MI movies got together and had an orgy and invited Casino Royale for some extra good times, this would be the result. This is a near perfect action thriller that deserves to be experienced on the biggest screen you can get to.The cinematography is nothing short of stunning. The framing and camera moves are perfect, close ups catching every look and line just right. The fight choreography and vehicle chase sequences are on par with Ronin, perhaps better. If this doesn't win awards for its editing I'll, I don't know what I'll do, it'll win; the cuts are sublime. The score and sound design make your heart leap and your mouth gasp. It's as if you're being played like an instrument.MI fans will love the story that weaves together elements of all of its predecessors. If you really want to get every drop out it, you'll go back and revise the first, third and fifth in the series, paying particular attention to the first.The casting is great. The banter between Cruise, Rhames and Peg is on point. Ferguson's return gets points but the standout this time around is Vanessa Kirby tipping her hat to Vanessa Redgrave.As a fan of the series (save the second), I went in with high expectations and I was not disappointed.

A thrill ride like no other in the Mission Impossible franchise, bouncing from one action set-piece to another in style. I came into this movie expecting what I had experienced during the last few MI movies- a good, fun action movie that is then forgotten about after a few weeks. However I think this one is different! A compelling rivalry between Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill keeps you on the edge of your seat during a flurry of chase scenes and fight scenes. This is the best rivalry in this franchise since MI3 when Cruise was up against the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Ethan Hunt's team all return and are n fine form as always! Be prepared for a long sit! At two and a half hours this is a very long movie, and frankly exhausting! Whilst it is good fun, it is too long and you can find yourself having viewers fatigue. However do not let that keep you back from what is the best instalment from the MI franchise!

The plot, (if there is any), has bigger holes than Ozone Layer and the movie seemed completely focused on reassuring audience that whatever Ethan was doing, was totally impossible, which includes him climbing on a rope, upto the helicopter and slip while holding the heli's landing gear. (Perhaps he is old now, otherwise, Ethan used to hang with one hand from canyons for an incredible long shot).First time in the series, the movie opens without a bang, rather with a THUDD and from that's where the torture begins. Please don't watch it if you think you want to live with the great memories of great prequels, where ethan actually pulled off impossibilities. In this one, he is just trying his best to save the movie, which he probably has therefore, the mission impossible in this one was to save the movie from a loss and make some quick buck out of serious movie goer's pockets.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Henry Cavill did pretty good in his role. I thought he improved as the film went on. Vanessa Kirby's character was brilliant. Glad to see Ving Rhames get some extra screen time also.

This film easily takes the franchise to another level and proves that with a great cast, crew, director and writers that sequels and series can progress the story and get even better.This film picks up 2 years after Rogue Nation and we get a better insight into Ethan Hunt as a character and his motivations. We learn although Ethan stopped the syndicate, the syndicate agents left alive now call themselves The Apostles. Due to a tough decision Ethan makes the Apostles now have Platonium and so begins our heroes globe trotting heroics to stop a nuclear disaster. The bond of the team (Cruise, Ferguson, Cavill, Pegg and Rhames) is what makes this work and the chemistry of the cast is amazing. I loved Michelle Monaghan in this film for the few scenes she has. The chemistry with Cruise is emotional and I love their story together and where it has gone.Sean Harris is just excellent at playing the yin to Cruises Yang.Henry Cavill is a welcome addition to the series and honestly probably steals the film with his reloaded fists. The bathroom fight scene is easily one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen. It was great to see him get his teeth into a different type of role. He won't disappoint. I also loved that that for the first time they referenced the other sequels which was brilliant but for anyone who hasn't seen the previous movies it will not go over their heads or need to have seen them. Now, the action sequences which is what we all go to a mission impossible film to see. Tom cruise takes them to the next level and although you know he is well. It's crazy to watch on the screen knowing he did that for real! The helicopter fall scene, rooftop jump are all deep breath moments. I actually said ouch at the rooftop jump knowing he broke his ankle for that scene. I applaud him and the crew for raising the bar. The man is a legend and honestly shows that CG is a long way off being as good as live action scenes. In my opinion Mission Impossible: Fallout is easily the must see action film of the Summer.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1268,jonpaulpiques,Definitely a watchable action movie.,8,30 July 2018,I went in with no expectations. Solid movie. The action sequences were fantastic. The sound design of the whole movie is incredible. The storyline could have been better but was good enough to keep the whole theatre entertained. The comedy that popped up was not corny or cringeworthy. Tom Cruise is a fantastic actor and it's on display throughout. Worth your money.,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1269,breakingvideoonline,BORING TRASH - HOLLYWOOD SETS NEW LOWS!,1,20 April 2019,"PROS:ACTION SEQUENCES O.K - but completely diminished by the fact that you KNOW none of the characters are ever REALLY in danger. Remember the first movie when they were actually scared for their lives alll the time, well not anymore - they're basically super heroes who dodge EVERY bullet and jump out of EVERY two story building and just brush it off. Hollywood knows that this is TRASH and that only the DUMBEST of audiences will continue to suspend disbelief.ALSO Con, the PATHETIC product placement by BMW and LAND ROVER. Its just so obvious it hurts - thereby distracting from the movie. On multiple occasions the cars are literally waiting to be hopped in and lined up as if in a show room. its just so sad, how about showing the cars getting used properly and the characters having fun in them.
First we get a new BMW then we get a mix of Range rovers the baddies get around in, then we get an OLD and (INVINCIBLE) BMW that gets shot / crashes multiple times but just keeps going of course - unlike any new BMW . LOL . THEN for the cherry on the product placement cake we get an OLD LAND ROVER later in the movie.... wtf... it probably broke down 200 times while filming.ALSO ALL car scenes were aimed at the LOWEST possible common denominator - NO pedestrians for multiple minutes of the movies motorcycle scenes - racing along sidewalks (IN PARIS) at 100mph ... ok ... sure wake me up when its over because thats dumb.CONS:THE STORY .they Bring back grumpy BORING Villain from last film ( LAZY ) , create some UNBELIEVABLE life or death tension between characters who are meant to be ON THE SAME TEAM. Cause severe audience confusion by attempting to create multiple plot lines that stop as soon as they're started - force in a romantic story arcs that have NO substance in case you offend someone for a kiss scene ... oooooh noooo can't do that but we can show multiple police officers getting murdered in a tunnel. There's something very wrong with current US censorship when abhorrent violence gets into PG-13 but a KISS between the main characters - who are in love - is NOOOOT allowed.THE HELICOPTER SCENE,Whoever came up with the idea to have two helo's chasing each other - pat on back, whoever executed the filming / plot points, go back to school.I understand creative licence in a film and the need to apply it occasionally, however when a chopper gets shot in the engine ( this chopper only has one ) and your entire warning display shows in RED then its going down sooner than later. However here we see nearly INVINCIBLE choppers racing each other to the bottom (literally) of an action sequence that should have been much more creative and believable, Hunt finally crashes his chopper into the SPINNING rear tail rotor of the one in front - but doesn't even get a scratch. The choppers both crash but their airframes are like solid METAL spheres bouncing along the mountain like balls. - I'm sure everyone is well aware that choppers are NOT strong, they are as light as possible and squish without hesitation.NO real spoilers, but the ENDINGSo the bombs are meant to be undefusable, simon peg says so for like a whole minute - so it MUST be, then 5 mins later he announces that HE CAN defuse them ..yah horruh we as an audience were ALMOST subject to some sense of danger. nope not anymore. so we KNOW the bombs will be defused before the bomb defusal scene even STARTS! this is a failure of movie making 101.Then the cherry on top is that the movie outright FAKES a nuclear explosion with a cut to a white screen for 3 seconds and a very very very bright sunrise that tom cruise is looking at for no apparent reason other to make it seem like he's looking at a NUCLEAR bomb going off. and for a brief second i thought wow - a redeeming factor, those characters will have to be replaced for the next mission - good, we need some fresh faces. but NO we were simply lied to and the rest of the movie was so predictable you might as well walk out early, the whole get together in a nice place - whoo that was a tough one... again .... yeah we just saved a remote medical camp in the middle of nowhere, well pats on backs everyone. Also the main villain wanting to stay and die, C'MON!, really, with no reason but that he says he's sick of being chased - WHATEVER!. ITS A TRASH BRAIN-DEAD MOVIE that SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE VERY DIFFERENTLY> Over and out.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1270,DNukemFan,Raises the bar for all movies,6,22 December 2018,"After watching this movie, your Mission Impossible will be to find a movie as good as this one because it really has taken cinema to a bold and enjoyable and scary new place. The bar has been raised for all movies after watching this movie. It will be very hard to find movies as good as this especially from previous years because no movie I've seen has this much high octane action and jaw dropping stunts and just stellar action scenes. Other movies will pale in comparison to this one so yeah good luck trying to find better movies than this after watching this.ProsTom Cruise is awesome
Henry Cavill is awesome
Everyone acted well including the actor playing Lane
Great action/stunts
Very amazing story
Exhilarating flickConsTom Cruise looks somewhat old in the movie and it made me sad because I wanted Tom to never age and keep giving us great movies (Tom has made some of the best movies ever made and throughout his career his given one hit after another with each new movie especially the M: I movies being better than the previous ones). But his acting was even better than usual and I still wonder how he makes some exact and awesome expressions and makes it all look so easy. He is truly the greatest actor in the world.One thing which is minor but in the beginning of the movie anti religious sentiment is demonized a bit with one of the bad guy characters having been anti religion. This character is expelled because of anti religious sentiments but this I thought was a bit bad and thankfully it wasn't a major subplot because well religiosity is at the heart of corruption and religions are behind most evils in the world so to stand up for the bad religions like this was a bit of a downer but not a major subplot so it doesn't hurt what is otherwise an outstanding movie which deserves awards for a lot of things like acting, writing, direction, stunts, action etc etcIn the end credits they say special thanks to UAE Armed Forces. I don't know how come Tom doesn't know but but UAE is one the world's biggest allies of Saudi Arabia and a brutal dictatorship whose leaders have killed for power, gotten away with murder and routinely abuse human and women's rights in brutal ways that the whole world sees and then turns away and says nothing. I don't blame Tom in anyway I just don't know what the UAE armed forces could have done besides try to blow up US and Israel that they got special thanks for in this movie. Never forget UAE was one of the countries that attacked US on 9/11 and got away with it. Well so that was a bit of a downer in what is one of the best movies of the year, decade, and of all time. Again no fault of Tom/Chris/crew/cast.Could have had more female nudity and sex. This would have made the movie better. Ferguson is great but you know female nudity and sex can really really make a scene and a movie great but this is an action movie. Just saying the movie could have been even better with this but they probably wanted a non R rated Mission movie the whole family could enjoy.Overall this is the best Mission movie so far and I really hope Tom delivers even better movies than this in the future. The way Tom ran and did all his other acting and stunts was truly mesmerizing.Tom's filmography truly is amazing and he excels in his role as producer and star of Mission films. He truly excels.Watch this movie because its truly a great entertainer.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1276,edwardjohntaylor,*rolling my eyes,2,25 November 2018,I constantly rolled my eyes throughout this movie.

1277,uzaycetin-32479,Action-packed Drama,10,7 August 2018,"As a huge M:I fan, i loved this movie. After seeing Jason Statham or Dwayne Johanson movies, M:I 6 (Fallout) was the taste i have been looking for. Despite Tom Cruise,Simon Pegg,Ving Rhames etc. we saw Henry Cavill as August Walker which has satisfying background story. Also we saw Rebecca Fergunson (Ilsa Faust) again and i loved her role more than M:I 5 (Rogue Nation) role. And as i saw, they made something different in this movie. The shots were not same with other M:I movies. They tried to make a cinematographic movie. Some moments shoted with one camera which is helping you to connect with movie.
 In the end i can surely say that M:I 6 was the best M:I movie maybe the best action movie ever made.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

One could tell that the cast and crew really cared about delivering a good movie for the audience: the plot was surprisingly good (for a 6th movie you'd expect something completely exaggerated and dumb because it's a commercial movie); the script and dialogue was good and complex (but sometimes had very cheesy, cringey , and awkward lines); the action scenes were very enjoyable, bringing pleasure to the viewer (unfortunately, some scenes were produced in a unenjoyable CGI and you could notice how fake they were); the acting was very good, but nothing out of this world.

1290,JawwadH7870,Same Same But Fun Nonetheless,8,6 October 2018,"We all know what a mission impossible title will bring. when we see a title like this we know there will be action sequence and there will be tom cruise trying to save people in unsolvable situations. the movie is targeted to those people who lives to have some fun watching these movies. gives them a little thrill while we are at it. this movie however can do that pretty well. 
I feel like its unfair giving this movie an 8 but as most of the action movies lose their sense of reality and becomes so weird and unnatural that it becomes painful, giving this movie 8 seems fine to me. less than that seems harsh because to be honest this movie could've went easily in the direction of fast and furious. 
I don't want to reject the possibility of this movie getting less score than what i gave but all in all this movie is fun to watch, a bit thrilling, has some psychopathic activity, a story of revenge and heroism and at the same time contains minimal unrealistic scenes.

1291,tjdeignan,Mission Impossible - Fallout is Awesome!,8,19 August 2018,"Mission Impossible: Fallout was no doubt the best movie I've seen from this year. This movie was completely breathtaking. Very little have I been awestruck by action to the point where I'm physically excited. This movie is so real and exciting that it's one of the best theater-going experiences I've ever had. But it's not perfect. The plot is definitely labyrinthine. Several times I felt myself behind on the plot, wondering who's who working for what organization. But that's also partly my fault, since I'm not invested in the Mission Impossible franchise, and don't know too much about the history of the films. But this movie is written in such a way that you don't need to know anything. The plot isn't the focal point, it's the incredible action. Every sequence is expertly directed and choreographed. They're so well done that they're some of the best I've seen. Sure, the film's very long, but literally, 20 minutes of the movie is one of the most unforgettable action sequences I've ever seen, up there with The Dark Knight's Harvey Dent chase scene, Children of Men's one take roaming shot and The Matrix's hallway scene. Plus the fact that a lot of it was REALLY done just adds to my amazement. Just a fantastic movie you really should see. My only fear is that, since the plot isn't there, it may become forgettable in the future. But it's still a great movie. Tom Cruise is phenomenal and you've got to respect him for doing his own stunts. Henry Cavill is great and perfect in his role. Ving Rhames is amazing, as always.

Love the background music, especially during the halo jump and Tom Cruise is a BADASS when he runs. However I have to admit one thing. It is a little bit slower during like halfway of the middle to the middle then it picks up the pace again. Plus the plot is a bit predictable. Rouge Nation however is full of surprises and flows much better then this one. Honestly this movie is good, don't know why people are hating on it, maybe there just used too the CGI slugfest in which case don't take there reviews seriously. Fallout, Rouge Nation and Ghost Protocol are pretty even within in each other and are all good.

Today I just finished watching the 6th episode of Mission Impossible and this evening with 4DX technology and wanted to tell you that from one set to the other, the whole audience was bored, Because it was Tom Cruise's real acting without using the substitute and helping me, so I did not appreciate it. As for the performance of each character and the Stunt scene, the whole process of the story is to observe that there is little use of CGI. And what I like about this in another is that from the beginning to the end, there are squads, shootouts, riding motorbikes, and helicopters jumping from the high skyscrapers, which leads to this. Suitable with 4DX and IMAX. Hope everyone is happy to share my interest!

Although, darker and less humorous than the previous instalments but the stunts that Tom Cruise and how much dedication he puts it upon himself to perform such dangerous stunts to please the viewers is absolutely fantastic. The IMF team is amazing and they have great chemistry as well as the new characters such as Walker, Sloan and White widow add so much authenticity and connections. Although it's sad that Jeremy Renner's character is hugely missed and his involvement was a must but due to his commitment with Marvel he couldn't make it and hope that his character will involved in future instalments as his absence was obvious.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1317,slouche,Your mission: find a decent story as an excuse for show-offy stunt acts,4,30 August 2018,"""Your mission, should you choose to accept it"" is to pack the thinnest and least original script since the invention of ticking time bombs with as many stunt opportunities as possible 
(here is a clue: got an appointment with the deadly attractive but irresistibly poisonous brunette du jour in the very heart of Paris? Forget about riding the good old subway: simply sky-dive from stratospheric heights overhead with some cumbersome scuba diving equipment - thereby ensuring a good 10 minutes of adrenaline-infused free fall), 
to endow characters predictable from frame one with impossible moral dilemmas (should I save the whole of us 7 billion earthlings or just spare this one single life?) and bizarre fantasies (said brunette cannot help flinging herself on charismatic hero about twice her age), 
and to revive desperately cliché dialogues and situations (IMF teammate #1, looking concerned: 'there is one solution but it is way too dangerous'; IMF teammate #2 (a woman), jaw dropping in disbelief: 'you mean we might all die on this mission?'; IMF chief operative glances across from the steering wheel and shrugs his shoulders; IMF teammate #4 flashing a sympathetic smile: 'Gotta do the job, guys!') with breathtaking views of familiar city skylines and Norwegian fjords masquerading as some Asian inter-border war zone. 
 
Guess what ? They pulled it off... the Irreversibly Monetized Franchise delivered on all counts. Let us hope the next message they receive will provide more inspiration - or the IMF may simply Fall to Pieces, for all its superb filming and awe-striking stunts.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1320,champaignwildcats,How many chase scenes does one movie need?,8,27 July 2018,"First off - terrific movie. The technical expertise is probably unsurpassed. The cast is outstanding. Hollywood at its best.But, 2 problems kept this from being a nearly perfect movie1. Henry Cavill is SOOOOOOOOOO obviiously one of the bad guys that the reveal is a big nothing. Would have been more effective to set him up as the bad guy and then have it be someone else. 2. There were times - and in a movie this length, a LOT of times - where it seemed that we were watching just one chase scene after another so that we could then watch another chase scene. They could have easily taken out 10 and maybe 15 minutes and gotten down to about a 2 hour run time and not diminished any other aspect of the picture.So pluses - technical brilliance and engaging characters - FAR outweigh minuses. Just a little more work on the screenplay and a few less high-speed chases and this would have been 10 of 10 hands down.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1323,justinmart-79548,The Skyfall of Misssion Impossible,10,30 July 2018,"Finally a great summer a movie has peaked it's head out of the shadows! This summer has been a little dry other than Infinity War and Hereditary. That doesn't matter any more because Mission Impossible Fallout makes up for all of it! You would think that after 6 movies the series would run out of steam but hey Christopher McQuarrie makes the best one instead! Fallout begins with Ethan Hunt still on the lookout for the rest of the syndicate, he's just following the bread crumbs when the CIA gets involved carrying over that plotline from Rogue nation as well. That sounds simple enough but this movie is a lot deeper than that, it has layers and they are good layers! This story is very different from the other Missions. I love the exploration of Ethan Hunt's morality, you get to see what goes through his head. This movie shows you why Ethan's character is so great and it celebrates that! Henry Cavil could not have been more perfect, he is a force to be reckoned with and he worked so well along side Tom Cruise. It reminded me of Dwayne Johnson in Fast Five. He is just this ""hammer"" that you don't want to be locked in a room with. I also liked how it showed the vulnerability of the heroes, they aren't squeaky clean, they get beat up, they get dirty, and things don't always go the right way. We always route for Ethan and the IMF but this film takes a different approach and asks the question. Sure it's badass to see these giant set pieces and crazy fight scenes but when the chips are down and hard calls have to be made, how far are you willing to go? I love when a movie can ask that question. It adds a whole layer to an already fun film. The direction feels epic. This feels like the biggest challenge Ethan Hunt has ever faced, it brilliantly carries over previous storylines that didn't have the best resolution in other films and it delivers excellent action sequences that had me on the edge of my seat. It's like the ""Skyfall"" of this franchise. Guys Mission Impossible Fallout not only met my expectations, it subverted them and exceeded them! See this in Imax by the way, it's worth the extra money because this was an experience in the theater.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

There is more great stunt work from Cruise, it may not be as big and as daring as his previous two films but still great to watch nonetheless. 
What this film does best in my opinion is showing what kind of a person Hunt really is, one who cares about a life so much that he's willing to put millions of lives on the line to save that life. They lost the plutonium because of his love for one person and shows Hunt is more than what meets the eye Best Mission Impossible so far with its terrific set pieces and a familiar finale, yet a very dramatic one",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

(seriously that last line by Sloan was killing me so bad). I swear I have seen this all before, not even fazed anymore.Sound familiar to you? maybe if you just watched the 007 series too recently.

1344,lafaye-50387,Not as good!,5,19 August 2018,This Mission Impossible was not as good as the first two that came out. First Tom Cruise is way to old to be running through the movies like he use to when he was young. As I watching him running on the top of the building I saw where it was not him. His face changed and his butt got bigger. I could see where it was edited. I am very disappointed in this Mission Impossible. It's time to let it go. I would like to see him come back with the Mummy part 2 but I do hope they have a very good story to tell for him to act in a a rival for him to combat with his new face. I don't want it too end of being like Ghost Rider part 2. It was a very poor movie. I couldn't believe how they down graded Nicholas Cage to a dope addicted to combat being the Ghost Rider. They could have done a better story then that. I was so disappointed. If only you would stick to the animated versions and find more creative writers to enhance and bring in a better storyline then you would have a better high rating an people around the block waiting to watch. Lets get it together or leave it alone!,Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Lame and lazy screenplay makes movies like ""Mechanic"" appear masterpieces of art in comparison. If you're satisfied with realism on a par with ""Road Runner and Willie E. Coyote"", go for it, right now.
The behavior of the characters, gadgets used, apart from being paper-thin, would be fairly in place for a 1930-ies detective story (a C-class one). Posing for a high-tech action movie, it's sooooooo lame.

Most of the other parts have the climactic action set piece half way through the film (the Langley scene, Burj Khalifa, the Opera or underwater heist) but not this time, the ending was crazy and I held my breath until the last second.
The director outdone himself this time and outdid his masterful work in ""Rogue Nation:.
The acting is amazing, especially considering that Tom Cruise had to act while performing all these INSANE stunts! Henry Cavill kept the moustache for a very understandable reason and it totally paid off, the best was made on the right horse. The rest of the cast: CHAPEAU!
Every character was very well utilized in the story, based on their capabilities and were tested accordingly. Even the fighting styles, you can see clearly the fighting style and signature moves of each character utilized in each fight, which made for very smart call backs to previous scenes and fights from previous parts. 
My only problem maybe is that I wished seeing Jeremy Rener's character as it would have been a great addition to the team.
All in all, I am afraid if they aim to make another part. For me this should have been/be the proper send off for these characters and the appropriate goodbye for Ethan Hunt. I am highly doubtful that they can top this film.
I can safely claim that MI6 is the best action blockbuster of the 2010s, and one of the best action films of all time. A true masterclass in action filmmaking, along with the greats such as: Die Hard & John Wick (yes, John Wick is among the greatest action films of all time!)",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The continuatous reference to the previous movies was what impressed me and not some disjointed storyline which HollyWood are always fond of doing. Ethan (Cruise) stole the show with his defying stunts throughout the movie. In all fairness after watching the movie, I want to watch it again. I won't say no more.

I've always been a Tom Cruise fan which is why I'll reluctantly give it 2 stars. These types of movies always seem like a waste of talent.

The film storyline is not FRESH and NEW. We have seen so many times the same plot. EVEN th missions were acheived very easily by TOm CRIUSE while in previous films the missions were really SPECTACULAR to watch. ONLY HIGHLIGHT OF THE MOVIE WAS THE HELICOPTER SCENE OF 5 MINUTES AT THE LAST.
The villain Mr. SOLOMON LANE looks very LAZY, DULL and WEAK. Moreover, Rebecaa Ferguson was totally wasted in this movie and also the WHITE WIDOW's love for ETHAN HUNNT was not explored seriously in the movie. 
The old trick of FACE MASKING seems to be old enough for the audiences.
MI:FALLOUT really misses the thrill and charisma of previous film like GHOST PROTOCOL.The director, Mr. Christopher McQuarrie, shuold stop spoiling this great series as he has done with JACK REACHER.

Portrayal of Henry cavill is very bad and his part is not suiting this franchise also as antagonist- bad casting. Except for bike chase in France nothing is good in this film.Climax is also similar to ghost protocol. Another thing for such a mass film they couldn't even hire a good composer , Lorne Balfe remade most of sound from the dark knight rises. He couldn't even make chase scene interesting with horrible composition. Joe Kramer did a fantastic job in MI5 mainly I liked Moroccan pursuit. Michael Giacchino also good in MI4. My expectation from Christoper McQuarrie is also very high. His The Usual Suspects is my all time favourite. I thought MI2 will be worst film in the franchise.

The best thing I recognized in this part is even how deep Ethan love Julia, he still cannot protect her. That's her job. And if she doesn't have the capability to do that, they cannot stay together. They are 2 good person who have 2 different lifestyles: Ethan kill others to protect his world, Julia heal people. They're the different pieces of a pie which have a line between them even how hard they try to be together. In the contrary, Ilsa is the 2nd woman which is matter most in his life. And she has the same direction with Ethan, she can kill to save people, she can protect herself, she can do everything for her love so she and Ethan can stay together.
Of course in the real life, there's no such thing like killing as this movie, but it's admittedly that to protect and maintain the love, we need to be in the same direction, need to be the best one of ourselves before become the best couple. It's the constantly fight and challenges for each other, both ones' jobs.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The whole plot of the film is so unnecessary and too complicated to only tell one thing that Henry Cavill wants to bomb the world and Tom Cruise has to stop him, and making everyone confused who side you are? Most of the characters is not useful, no meaning and crucial factors in the film, just adding some new faces to make movie fresher. In brief, all the conspiracies in this film are contradictory and predictable, so it fails; most of the characters' existences are only for distracting the background, so the film seems to be more surprises, but it didn't work, it fail; the last thing, this film wants to combine box office and depth, so too much CGI and unnecessary plots inside, to the most reviewers it works, but I think that it ruins this classic series, and totally disappointing.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1427,chunksterstud,One of the best in the action genre!,7,9 November 2020,"A thrilling action flick filled with break-neck car chases, intense and swift combat scenes, and a multitude of twists that always keeps you guessing, MI: Fallout is highlighted by its subtle yet impeccable CGI/SFX and creative cinematography, along with the aforementioned plot twists/action sequences. It gets bogged down by the somewhat mediocre acting, but this is mainly caused by poorly written dialogue so the actors aren't all to blame. All in all, this is definitely an above-average action film, and if that's the genre you're into, I highly recommend seeing this worthwhile addition to the MI saga.

1430,aidanmurphy29,Best Mission so far,8,6 August 2018,"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is not a documentary of real CIA missions, this is not Mission: Somewhat Difficult. This is Mission IMPOSSIBLE. I cannot believe people would give something like this a poor rating due to a lack of realism. The greatest strength of this movie, which is something all the MI movies have done, is they really give a sense of the ridiculousness and epicness of the stunts performed in the movie. No one goes into an action movie expecting the characters to fail, but this movie uses superb visuals and soundtrack to show (not tell) the audience how the characters must pull off ridiculous feats. I didn't really believe Hunt or his team were going to die, or that the bomb was going to go off, etc, but through shots like Halo jumping into a lightning storm, riding a motorcycle into oncoming traffic (one of the most well done chase scenes I have ever seen), or the mountain helicopter scene, I was left in awe and on the edge of my seat to see the resolution.
Of course, this film had its limitations. The plot was better than most movies in the genre, although there were some poorly explained parts and they probably went a little overboard with the double crossing. Character development is limited outside of Ethan. The villain was poorly fleshed out, although it was refreshing to see an idealistic villain who wasn't standing on his soapbox and yelling at the audience for half the film. The acting was great, but I didn't really care for Cavill in this role.
Regardless, this is a must see film. If you cannot enjoy the visual and audio spectacle that is Mission Impossible-Fallout, you probably need to relax and take your movies a little less seriously. Plenty of movies have ridiculous, over the top stunts, but this movie is the first in a long time that made those stunts look fluid, unpredictable and even believable, even if we know they are absurd.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

I thought it was so long because they had so much good stuff to put in it.I must admit, the movie is very well made. Shots are breathtaking, and the stunts are phenomenal. The problem for me was the storyline, or lack thereoff. If you spend so much budget on a movie, why not make sure the underlying story is just as strong as the stunts? The plot was questionable, unrealistic, outdated, predictable and boring. And that makes that the chases, the running, the accidents and so on nice to watch, but not very thrilling.

Predictable plot, out of focus shots, grainy images, obvious cgi.",4,27 July 2018,"I don't if it is because I had really high hopes for this film, but it was sort of disappointing. I saw it in imax, which was great especially for the sound and for the couple imax scenes the film had. The helicopter chase scene was really good and it alone is worth going to imax for if you know what to look for in image quality. But if this movie was good for anything, it was to show how much different the image from 35mm is to imax, and gosh I wish it was all shot in imax. The cinematography was really lacking in this film and at some points the really grainy images were too distracting to be enjoyed. The camera crew who are probably used to shooting digital tried to apply same techniques on this film by shooting with super fast lenses and guess what, there are more out of focus shots that you can count which was also annoying, to the point that it took away from the story. This film's biggest mistake was to choose to shoot it in 35mm film, sorry guys not the imax experience I was expecting, all imax did was to really emphasize the filming mistakes. The plot with all the predictable face changes is what is to be expected from a MI movie. However the action scenes are very well crafted and do put you at the edge of your seat, especially knowing Tom Cruse did all the stunts for real. Overall it's a very good movie that you should enjoy, don't see it in imax as it really only has one imax scene and it's not worth the extra money, especially because it will annoy you with all the image mistakes, so you are better off watching it in a regular 2k projection.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1458,akennell5753,Good but not great,7,30 July 2018,"Fallout, the sixth installment of the MI franchise turned out to be a decent movie following it's now typical story arc. Unfortunately I think that is part of the issue here. The story was very predictable. In fact the movie itself pokes fun at the fact that it's the same, old same old; close calls, ridiculous fight and chase scenes. Don't get me wrong, I love those and appreciate what the movies brings to the table action wise. My next complaint was that this one lacked the dramatic feel that the previews led you to believe it would conjure. The ominous music, dark foreshadowing and title displayed during the original trailer all led me to believe it would have a darker more desperate feel that I just never felt during the movie.

1459,domuensterer,Whole movie is based on stupidness of the main actor!,6,14 August 2018,"The movie contains lots of very catching action scenes, however the plot is very childish, many things don't end up and seem unrealistic.
Warning, spoiler:
The whole movie is based on one event in which Ethan Hunt, the main actor, loses attention of a suitcase which he throws reluctantly near an armored car instead of putting it inside.
He is then forced to move away from the suitcase and, surprise, discovers it's gone when coming back.
Remember, this suitcase was the sole purpose of the whole mission.
After that, helicopters crash, dozens of people are killed and all that because he wasn't smart enough to put a bag into a car.
I had this stupidity in the back of my head all the time, that's why Mission: Impossible - Fallout is only rated for 6 stars by me.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

I do not know how this rating can be so high as this is really one of the worst big budget movies I have seen in a long time.
It just is a full on Tom Cruise fest only to be watched by Cruise aficionados. The sheer amount to times Cruise walks away with just a scratch while dozens of people get killed and the too lame to watch soppy end really is too much for even the most die-hard fans. The story is predictable from the start, has not depth at all and at no point is there any scene that is just the tiniest bit believable.

1471,DmytroPuyda,A Sequence of Incredible Action Scenes Glued by Something That Attempts to Look like a Story,7,13 January 2019,"What had we known about ""Mission: Impossible 6"" before the production started? In February, 2017, Empire posted an article that shed some light on the movie. In his interview, Christopher McQuarrie revealed that the new film wouldn't start with an action scene and promised to go deep into Ethan Hunt's character. ""I've seen five of these movies and I don't know who Ethan Hunt is"" - McQuarrie said. Key phrases from his interview also include ""I want to know who Ethan is in this movie"" and ""It's a very different Ethan Hunt, I can promise you that"". In addition, McQuarrie teased the return of some old faces from the franchise (""including people you would not expect to be back"") and hinted that the new movie would be more like a meaningful story with giant action scenes rather than a sequence of action scenes glued by something that struggles to look like a story.With these words said by the director of ""Rogue Nation"", the new movie was sold to me at that point and immediately became the most anticipated movie of 2018. Now let's see what we've got.STORYThe movie begins with Ethan's nightmare. As promised, not an action scene. Well, I wouldn't call this ""very unconventional"" as McQuarrie did, but the idea's accepted. Ethan still dreams of his former wife, which is perfectly understandable.What's next? Well, unfortunately, the story itself begins. ""Unfortunately"" because one of the first things it mentions is a guy capable of assembling three atomic bombs in seventy two hours or so. Come on, Christopher! I'm not an expert in nuclear weapons and I can't know whether it's possible or not, but the key point is that I don't believe. It sounds ridiculous to me and makes me chuckle at a point where I'm not supposed to.What happens next? Ethan saves his friends and loses the plutonium. Another option was to save the plutonium and lose the friends. Is this unexpected of Ethan? No. Of course, it is not. Thanks to the previous five movies, we already have a feeling of what kind of person Ethan is and this decision of his is not surprising. What would one normally expect after this? Yes, of course: Ethan's immediate dismissal, rigorous investigation of the incident, Ethan would probably go to prison for the rest of his life or, at a minimum, considering his previous striking achievements, would be sent to feed penguins somewhere in Alaska. What do we have instead? Actually, this doesn't really matter. No one cares about the story anymore because no one takes it seriously. No one can take seriously a movie that shows three or four people going after nuclear weapons threatening the humanity.Could there be a way out? Yes, of course. The director and the screenwriters had plenty of options. E.g., consider showing Ethan save the plutonium in that scene. At least, that could have been a complicated moral quandary indeed. You are screenwriters after all, think of something non-trivial!CHARACTERSEthan Hunt. Remember they promised us a very different Ethan Hunt? ""Ethan, that's not who we are!"" - said Luther. ""Maybe it's time to reconsider that!"" - Ethan replied. In trailers, they even showed us Ethan killing a policeman in Paris. This does create an intrigue but forget it. This all is just a deception aimed to increase your interest in the movie. The scenes are there but they don't mean it. In reality, we still see the same old Ethan we've seen before. On the bright side, it's a rare case when the expectations fail for the better. On the other hand, if we didn't know who Ethan is after watching the first five movies, we still don't know. There is nothing new about Ethan in this movie.Solomon Lane. His return in ""Fallout"" was highly anticipated, but ask me what his role in the movie is and the only thing I can tell you now is that he was the reason of an incredible action sequence in Paris. Everything else just wears off. This fact becomes particularly frustrating when I recall that Solomon Lane is the only villain in the ""Mission: Impossible"" series who gives me chills when I watch ""Rogue Nation"".Julia. That's where, in some sense, they succeeded. Of course, her appearance in New Zealand(crossed out) Kashmir looks artificial to me and her monologue at the end of the movie sounds like a prepared speech, but the authors wanted to finish her storyline and they did it. She's married again and she doesn't regret anything. I think that's all we might want to know about her.Finally, where is the return of an old character we didn't expect? Was it Julia? No, her appearance in the movie was spoiled in trailers. Was it Solomon Lane? No. Was it Max? No. Mentioning Max in the movie was pleasant but it's not a return. So who? Probably, it's no one. Just one more point on the list of failed expectations.DECEPTIONUnfortunately, how they showed Ethan in trailers is not the only deception involved here. It all began when, according to rumors, they filmed Ethan, Ilsa and the White Widow walking together in the club in Paris for the trailer. Filming something for a trailer only is cheating, no excuses can be accepted here.Also, recall the white screen and the Sun when they cut the wires at the end of the movie. The shots are aimed to create a brief impression that the bombs have exploded, but in fact it's nothing but one more cheap deception. Hope no one would even think of comparing this with the powerful (even though absolutely ridiculous from the rational point of view) ending of ""Rogue Nation"". There is nothing to compare.LOCATIONSThe locations are great but there is one major thing to mention. Showing the Norwegian Pulpit Rock, which is a known and quite recognizable tourist attraction, in Kashmir? Come on! There are lots of outstanding locations in the world, but geography matters! Can't just show whatever you want anywhere to create a good scene. If you wanted it, you should have brought your story there.STUNTSSo what's best about the movie? The stunts! The stunts are absolutely incredible and amazing! Especially when you have an idea of how they were filmed, it's hard to find words to describe how good they are.SUMMARYSo what do we have after all? We have the HALO jump followed by the incredible action sequence in Paris (everything they filmed in Paris is perfect!) followed by the foot chase in London and followed by the bombastic helicopter sequence filmed over picturesque landscape of New Zealand. This all is glued by a couple of dialogues and complementary scenes that struggle to form a story. The impression is that the authors started with a list of stunts and locations they wanted to show but failed to combine this all into a decent script.Although, to be honest, there is one more scene I like in this movie. It's the dialogue between Ethan and Ilsa before they leave Paris. It's nicely filmed, although it doesn't save the story by any means.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1478,mgheyath-138-120247,Excellent action packed movie,8,30 July 2018,This is probably one of the better ones in the series. It is really hard to keep the excitement and engagement on after the third installment of an action movie with difficult plot and action scenes like mission impossible. But Tom cruise pulled it off most probably because of the superb stunt scenes he performs. The movie scene are filmed to expose the reality of Tom performing his own stunts which makes the scene so enjoyable and watchable and gives the director the luxury of long shots and one uncut shot.Well done Tom Cruise and Chris McQuarrie,Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1479,Cruiser007,Forget MI series! It's one of the best action movies ever!,10,29 July 2018,Loved the movie. Have watched it twice till now. Cruise nails as Ethan as always but special mention goes to action sequences. AMAZING! He nailed every single stunt on his own take a bow Tom. Chris seems to have peaked this series once again after what brad did in MI:Ghost Protocol (MI4). A director to look out for in future. Henry has done a good job and glad Rebecca had good screen time in this she was really good in all the scenes in which she appears. Ving Rhames and Pegg too make their presence felt by having a amazing chemistry with Cruise. Alec and Angela too did their parts perfectly same goes to Vanessa Kirby (loved her accent and expressions). Basically not even a single character was wasted every one of them did a great job. For me apart from adrenaline action sequences my favourite scene was Julia meeting Ethan (for real). Story was pretty much condensed in a way to make sure it doesn't get diluted by cliched story line. Screenplay was tight...in fact very tight at times. Easily the best MI and tops my personal favourite MI4 without a hint of doubt.,Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Definately some great footage and some cool action scenen, but it stops there. Everything from the dialogue to the acting to the plot itself is plain awful!I have been a life long fan and supporter of IMDB, but the fact that this movie rates at 8,2 (a large part on why I watched it in the first place) just makes it too obvious that the majority of these votes are bought.

Mission: Impossible- Fallout will leave you believing it is the best movie of the six and maybe even the action movie you have ever seen, because it is. Considering the big fan I am of this franchise and of Tom Cruise, the movie appealed to me emotionally. Tom Cruise's dedication is visible and it pays off. Henry Cavill: Excellent. Cruise and Cavill make a superb duo; enough to get your money's worth. The storyline is great for any action movie.

It is quite apparent when you see him on a big screen, especially when he does all the actions that distort his face. Still, Ethan Hunt remains the manifestation of destiny in his movies. One thing I like about the MI series is that they keep the characters simple and charming. Nowadays all the superhero movies are digging into the ""dark side"" of their heroes, and with all the crap that Hunt's been through, he still has integrity and courage as he had 22 years ago. He doesn't kill innocent people. He's protective of his teammates. He never hesitates when it comes to the choice between good and evil. Not for one second. That's what makes the series shine. Of course he has nightmares, but when he wakes up he's always knows what he's doing. Another thing I like about Hunt is the way he treats women. Like equal. I'm not going to pull all the feminist stuff on action movies, but it's nice to have a handsome agent who doesn't sleeps with EVERY SINGLE pretty girl in the movie.

The plot was obvious with no surprises, screenplay short and half of the time I was able to guess the dialog. Of course as any MI movie it comes with pretty much impossible acrobatics and very bad science (bad is actually an understatement). I do understand this is a blockbuster and we cannot expect much but I've seen a lot better ones with far lower score. I have to ask those who praise the movie - are you out of your minds?",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1513,deependraratedrstar,Tom cruise at his best! Revamped the definition of action movie.,10,26 July 2018,"The movie is the perfect example of how exactly the combination of technology and human powered action packed movie can be directed. Right from the start of the movie to climax it is bang on target. Tom cruise is probably at different level. And by giving one of this finest performance in the movie, he has set a new benchmark. Who would say he is doing an action flim in a body of age 56! A true legend!
ThaysT not it, each and every characters with in movie did Fab job as well.
What really makes this movie insane?
1) breath taking actions
2) the chemistry of technology and action.
3) good cinematography
4) good story
5) great plot.
6) legendary tomb cruise
7) good acting by supporting characters as well.If you are fan of action movies, then book your show right now.
I highly recommend this movie.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1516,doctoryakub,Attended UK Premiere,9,14 July 2018,"An excellent spectacle with a solid story line.The main draw is the characters themselves, many whom we have become familiar with over the last few films especially.This latest entry sits on par or just behind Ghost Protocol, which was the best in the series in my opinion.The action sequences are excellently choreographed and cinematically shot with the motorcycle chase being a great stand out.The first fight scene in the toilet really steals the show for me, left me wanting more!Overall, enjoy it guys!",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1517,spy-72287,Very predicable and almost boring,5,3 August 2018,"Apart from great scenery and brutal fights the film failed to give me the reason to be on the edge of my seat mostly because all the ""fool the bad guy"" scenes were exposed right from their beginning. Overall, for me it was more of a bad combination of the previous series rather then something new and original. People always have high hopes and expectations for this kind of titles as they go to MI 6 and not just some random action film. I personally feel that guys behind the production should have known better. (imho)",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1520,xxjacksonhermanxx,Best of them all!!!!!,9,9 August 2018,"I personally didn't have a single complaint after seeing this. It is way more than I expected it to be. Everything just felt better about this one, Tom Cruise' stunts were incredible, the acting was fantastic and the new characters were great. Henry Cavil was my favorite character, just a total BA! Most critics biggest complaint was that the plot wasn't different enough, because of the nuclear background. This does make sense but the way the Christopher McQuarie dealt with it was perfect. The last 15-20 minutes literally had me shaking, the suspense was killing me. This came from the ""racing against time"" part in the plot summary. With all that said, this is easily the best of them so far.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1521,daytimes-37611,What's done is done when we say its done.,9,1 August 2018,"Mission impossible fallout is the sixth film in this franchise, a movie I was really excited for but also very nervous about.Mainly because this film is being directed by the same director as the last mission impossible film. One of the things I have always appreciated about the previous M.I movies was how they always felt unique and different as they were all helmed by different directors. So I was a little nervous about having the same director direct 2 M.I movies.I was so pleased to walk out of the cinema with one of the biggest smiles on my face. Because not only do I think this is the best film in the series but I also think this is one of the best action films in recent years.Tom cruise and all the actors on screen are amazing, everyone has their time to shine. This is particualr for the villains as well because they are actually really good, which is something most previous M.I films have struggled with in the past.As always, the action scenes are incredible, they are filmed and choreographed so well and they all feel tense and real, it looks like people are actually hitting eachother. They are backed up with amazing cinematography and great one liners bouncing back and forth between all our characters.This movie is amazing, go and see it on a big screen as soon as possible.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1523,wherr-54943,Wow. One of the best action movies of all time.,10,28 July 2018,"As cliche as the word, Wow is, I think it is the appropriate word to describe this movie. It was a top notch action movie from start to finish. The jaw dropping stunts along with the well crafted story really make this an enjoyable experience and is definitely worth making a trip to the theater to see. I'm a big fan of the series, and MI:3 was always my favorite followed very closely by Ghost Protocol, but this one is better than both of those. They went all out on this one. Not sure how they can top this one, but I'm sure they probably will. If you like action blockbusters, just go see it. You won't be disappointed.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

No longer can you count on a funny, action packed larger than life scenario when you hit play. This time it was 90 min of the same old car chase through Paris, a plot twist you could see from miles away and ""action"" scenes in slowmotion set to string music to really drive home the boring!

If you don't care about plot, character development or acting, then this movie is for you.

Some Missions Are Not A Choice.
It was my first movie of Mission Impossible series which I experienced on big screen. And it was Amazing, Hilarious and Mind blowing. I couldn't control myself to clapping and hooting again, again and again.
First, Grand Epic Salute to #TomCruise for such a realistic blood-curdling stunts. He is fantastic like every time. The special thing is that their 56-year-old age does not stand in the best action sequence. Otherwise, the first film of this Mission Impossible Series came in 1996, almost 22 years ago. Since then, Tom Cruise has extended this on its own and every time has given a better action sequence. Also, I would like to thank to writer & director ""Christopher McQuarrie"" and Cinematographer ""Rob Hardy"" for presented this action epic with a very beautiful and superfine sequences.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Oh, well, I think that it deserves that. So, what I didn't liked:
character Ethan - it gave me an impression of a very impulsive and a stupid guy... which should have been killed a million times alreadyA lot of scenes were very exaggerated and predictableThe whole story line was not great - actually really weakIn the final, there are 15 minutes where the guys are having time to defuse a bomb.

1541,gabitirsin-61996,Simple,8,25 September 2018,"Hey, for me this was one of the best MI of all series, action, twists, little romance, and happy ending. Dear cristics, from your point of view is a : boring, self centered, bad(from twists to plot) etc etc. Why you still watch Hollywood movies then just to expose your ""well argumented and documented"" negativity. Its not bad at all, although not perfect, but hey, if you want a philosophical, sex centered thriller you are in a wrong place. 
I know, i know, im not a critic but im a fanatic movie watcher and i have seen few in my life, especially action. I sit down and more than 2 hours i could not stand up, it captivated me the pace, set-up, twists which made it perfect to loose yourself next your fav snack and drink and savor non stop action from a to z.
I have seen far worse and boring James Bond's.
So, for all who gave 1 out of 10 shame! Next time watch some bollywood action flicks it might be better and start rating them.No offense, but you are too subjective in your evaluation because you got upset and cannot think.

Something that you don't notice in the fighting scenes. Also, some people may find the plot quite complicated, and it is. You really need to pay attention.

All the actors performed there character wonderfully.
The sound effect is top-notch; you can hear every tiny details of engineered sound system waving in the cinema hall.I really like the way that some comedy scenes were added in-between the action scenes. Specially the one in which Benji was directing Ethan to catch Walker and at one point Ethan had to jump out of the window, than Benji said ""What do you mean that you have to jump out of the window? Oh sorry, I was looking at the map in 2D"".NOW, let's not forget about stunts. All the stunts were real. They were choreographed in such a way that they really look genuine. I watched Mission Impossible - Fallout behind the scenes shots on YouTube and let me tell you 'Tom Cruise himself performed all his stunts'. He himself performed the HALO jump stunt from the plane and to complete that scene he had to jump from the plane more than 100 times (including the practice jumps). He jumps from one building to another by himself. And also lets not forget that he himself flew the helicopter. The straight mountain that he had to climb really reminded me the intro scene of Mission Impossible 2 where he has to climb the rock mountain.So, I will recommend you all to really watch Mission Impossible - Fallout in theatres.Now, in the end I just have to say it ""Ethan Hunt beat the crap out of Superman"".",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

Then came the second half of the film. The action was still good but it became far too predictable and became over complicated. This film tried to be more than what it should be, dumb fun, but in trying to add a second layer to the story it seemed to lose the quality that the first half of the film had. This film all in all would also have been much better as a stand-alone because this film is very similar to all the previous films in the franchise.

Fallout is almost completely boring. The script is near-devoid of memorable or interesting dialogue, and it is complemented (for lack of a better word) by acting which ranges from passable to mediocre. The plot is stupidly complicated and (likely as a result) is full of holes and conveniences, including Ethan Hunt's insoluble (even for an action movie) ability to dodge every bullet that comes his way. 
Towards the beginning, the film contained one interesting drama scene that actually subverted my expectations to a small extent. There were a few fight scenes that I suspect were well-choreographed, but frankly, I can't tell. This is due to the fact that the film insists on having a cut EVERY. GOD-FORSAKEN. MILLISECOND.
In conclusion, it's incessantly boring, devoid of substance, and full of holes. 
Kind of like my ex.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1588,vansh-11352,Does not live up to the hype,7,11 August 2018,"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out why critics are going gaga for this movie. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad movie and worth a but it is definitely not the best of the series. It has that Nolan stamp of a mysterious aura but it fails to replicate his style. First things first, Jeremy Renner is missed. How I wish his absence was explained. The action scenes were very cool but not as immersive as MI scenes normally are. The villain was absolutely pathetic. The script was weak and you were expected to fill in the blanks more than a couple times. How did the villain, who just broke out of jail(and he was in full isolation before) somehow manage to create this masterplan to blow plutonium bombs? It was just not satisfactory. On a positive note, the background music was very powerful, there was some good comedy(courtesy of Simon Pegg as Benji) and Tom Cruise was excellent. But in the end it was just not enough. It seemed like a haphazard movie where they randomly got his wife, Julia, out of the blue. Whether it was August Walker or Solomon Lane who was the villain in this movie seems to be one of mankind's great mysteries(another weak attempt to make it all mysterious like a Nolan film). It took the series in a new direction but it seemed to have forgotten it's roots. The mission was accomplished but not with the same enthusiasm that is normally seen. I would say that both MI 4 and 5 are better than this one.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1589,mediaworkscpv,WOW - By far the best MI installment yet.,10,1 August 2018,"There are a great number of reasons I loved this film, but what I am most impressed by is Tom Cruise's performance. Far from the hero's of what most action films of this era define as ""action hero"". Cruise's performance is vulnerable and very much human, with the right amount of emotions, and human qualities. Which most movies miss the mark, this movie is spot on. The action sequences, and fight scenes are realistic for the entire team. The story is good and connects some of the other films without being dumb about it. In other words not overplaying ""oh there's and Easter egg"" . The movie just flows from start to finish. I felt engaged through the entire film. For me it is the best Action Film of the Year. I was really down on Cruise and though his performances were getting stale. But MI: Fallout has proven me wrong.

The usual MI special face masks and face mask peeling. Nerve-racking, high octane, thrilling, absolutely well written movie that literally had me at the edge of my seat, eyes glued to the screen, heart in my mouth. All this magnified because you know Cruise is doing all the stunts himself.Not a single body moved in the theater. Not even the sound of popcorn crunching. Nobody stirred, fidgeted, looked around, checked their phones, talked. The entire 2.5 hours. I wasn't surprised at Tom Cruise's handsomer-and-handsomer-as-he-ages looks, his youthful agility, his single-minded dedication, the heartstopping stunts, the locales, the dialogues, the acting. What did surprise me, however, was that this movie shows you what it means to really, really love someone. What surprised me was that there was a catch in my throat and tears in my eyes at this particular relationship. I cried, and that has never happened to me before in any MI movie. In spite of everything else, as spectacular as they all were, this is what I will remember the most from this film.

1599,suren_rajamohan,Your Mission Should You Choose To Accept It...,8,29 July 2018,"Well, when has not Ethan Hunt, not taken the challenge. When has be backed down nor leave a mean behind. The 6th installment of the MI franchise, you see Tom Cruise, single highhandedly revive this for a few more movies, I am sure. At 56, this man is dope, his dedication and commitment is unquestionable. He can call it quits for the money he has amazed throughout his illustrious career. Yet, he comes back on top and hard to give us one of the best movies in a long time. Tom, spend 16 hours a day to get his rotorcraft license in just 6 weeks and that impressive. You would see in a breathtaking final scene of some air action. The next was the Halo jump ( High altitude, low Opening) from an aircraft. This part of the movie was shot in UAE, where he had to jump off from 25,000 - 35,000 feet in the air, and by doing this he became the 1st actor to do this stunt. They had only one take each day, due to the time of natural light and a three minute window for the perfect shot. TC trained over 6 months to get this shot, impeccable.Jumping from building, running mad on the streets of France, mad driving, hand to hand combat, this movie is one fine take. The action sequences are tight and will keep you at the edge of your seat. The plot keeps you hooked onto each word and move as you cant expect what comes next. from mistaken identities, plots to subplots, rogue agent to face masking, Director and Producer Christopher McQuarie has done an excellent job.
 Ethan's mission, which he chose was to track down the Apostles, a crazy bunch of cronies who's plan to blow up three Nuclear bombs in 3 strategic locations, destrory a large part of humanity, to start again. Hunt needs to retrieve the nukes and stop the syndicate from doing so. Sounds simple but never in the day of the most prolific IMF agent, Hunt.
The movie sees Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames back together to add a lighter shade to the movie, a much needed break to catch your breath. Henry Cavill, dropped his superman drapes to take on a more darker role here, does massive justice to his screen time on the movie. He is buffed a bit from his last movies and does play a subtle antagonist towards late ( oops.. did I say that :) )
I am predicting, the Fallout is going to break the bank and set many records for the franchise. The movie is such a fantastic take and you can watch it several times. The acting, screen play, locations, cast, the the limit these action scenes have gone into, all make it a winner. Yet, there will be many nay Sayers comparing this to Fast & The furious, James Bond, but forgetting they all are different pedigree of movies, so as MI. You, listen to your heart and go watch this movie. You will surely want to see it twice. Fallout is FANTASTIC!!!

1610,rejuj-77155,"""Same old Ethan""-Exhilaration Guaranteed 10/10",10,29 July 2018,"Watched Mission Impossible:Fallout Today...Awestruck....One of the most impressive action movies I have ever seen...Words wouldn't suffice to describe the visual spectacle..The full throttle approach by director Christopher McQuarrie will sent shivers down your spine.The stunts leave you breathless, the acting is well done, and the cast dynamic is better than ever.I can't get this film out of my head and hope Cruise and the cast get the recognition they so truly deserve.Tom Cruise with his swashbuckler swagness is willing to die for your entertainment. This movie would have been just another action flick without Cruise. Sure we have a stellar cast, but did not Mr. Cruise steal every scene? He is perfect in the role of Ethan Hunt, a spy whose whole team is rubbed out in a convoluted cover up at the start. It is up to Ethan to uncover the plot behind the failed mission. The movie is a series of unveiled plot twists that becomes implausible after a while. But that's not the fun behind Mission Impossible. The fun is watching the great action scenes with their suspenseful turns. So much so, we are willing to suspend disbelief to enjoy the ride. And to let ourselves be swept away by Mr. Cruise's undefinable quality to take us there.And the stunts are performed by Tom Cruise himself. The daring set pieces are well choreographed and acted in a way that looks real and genuine that puts most of this year's other action blockbuster movies to shame. Halo Jump-.One of the first stunt scenes in the film, it is not just another jump. In the film, Henry Cavill's August Walker and Cruise's Ethan Hunt get hit by a lightning bolt as they take the jump. Due to which Walker loses consciousness as well as his O2 cylinder. What transpires on screen next is heart-stopping, to say the least. And let me remind you all, it's no CGI but Tom Cruise. The toilet fight sequence will leave you spellbound. How I wish this scene was longer in length than it already was. To see Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill getting reciprocated by one man is oddly satisfying and hilarious to see. The paris chase scene-.Who doesn't love Tom Cruise on a bike? Give the man a bike and he'll give the best bike chase scene you have ever seen. This one is too thrilling to be real but Cruise cruises past the busy roads of Paris like a cakewalk.Director Christopher McQuarrie uses gliding camerawork and razor-sharp cutting to heighten the excitement of Hunt's improvisation, which results in a car-and-truck chase down the very narrow streets of Paris, followed by some white-knuckle motorcycle work by Cruise; his ride through a roundabout, seemingly sliding within inches of dozens of other vehicles, is truly terrifying.Helicopter Chase-In the climax of the film, Tom Cruise goes behind Henry Cavill in what turns out to be an edge of the seat chase sequence and probably the best chopper sequence seen in any film till date. And what makes it even better is that Tom Cruise learnt how to fly a chopper to bring authenticity to the scene. I can watch this film again just for this epic climactic sequence.Foot Chase-It's Tom Cruise and he is running, enough said. But what makes this scene iconic is the fact that he broke his ankle while filming this scene. This whole long sequence is one of the major highlights of the film and has been shot beautifully.Its a must watch.Don't miss it.My rating is 10/10. And don't waste your time reading this article, go and watch the movie as soon as you can. It's totally worth it.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1611,yuvipuri,Good but definitely not the Best From the Mission Impossible series,7,28 July 2018,"The story line was stretched too long and the plot was very slow & boring at times. The action sequences were all par excellence, hats off to the entire team. It was delight to watch such difficult stunts being performed which are hard to otherwise visualize.

About a half hour in, I realized that I didn't care and had lost interest. And to add to all of this, I'm not sure if the action sequences were supposed to be silly or exciting. They came off as silly but that might be because I had lost total interest in the movie. If I had gone to the theater alone I would have left. For the record, I do not have this problem with James Bond. Probably because the plots are followable with fewer triple agents who are really double agents wearing a mask of an enemy double agent.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

I would probably forget about the mission until he sends me a reminder. I won't be able to keep it a secret as WhatsApp doesn't have a self destruct feature and if I would break the phone after reading the message, I would be destroying company property.I will quickly dress up, except it won't be quick as I won't find half of my things, such as matching shoes (happened to me very recently). After much kerfuffle, I would come down, hunt for my car keys and just as I will be stepping out of the door, my dog will insist that I give him a ride first. On my way, I will get late as someone will drive way below the speed limit in the fast lane and none of the drivers will give way or yield as my exit approaches. Finally when I reach, I won't be able to get in, as the reservation clerk would have screwed up the spelling of my name, and won't be able to find me on the guest list.When finally inside, I would very quickly get distracted by the single malts, down a few and chat to random people, totally forgetting about my assignment, until my super efficient secretary would call me and ask, ""Boss, did you get the password to prevent global annihilation as per the instructions?"" I will quickly, (okay drunkenly), swing (okay lumber) into action, locate the villain's girlfriend (or boyfriend), start seducing her (or him) and just as she (or he) would be about to give me the password under the influence of my irresistible charm, Monica would FaceTime me and ask, ""Where are you? When will you be back? Should I leave dinner on the table or would you eat out""?And then bomb will detonate and the world would end.Luckily, the real Ethan Hunt has no such constraints. So he rides, drives, flies, kicks, punches and shoots his way through US, London, Paris and Kashmir, to give us what is the probably the best Mission Impossible movie to date. The plot is complicated enough to keep you interested for the slightly longish 2.5 hours and Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are brilliant as usual. Sean Harris, even in a straightjacket, is menacing, and leather has never looked as good as it does on Rebecca Ferguson. The chase sequences are brilliantly shot, and since they don't have a background score, the roar of the motorcycle and the growl of the car gets the adrenaline pumping. The much talked about helicopter sequence lives up to the hype and Paris and London have never looked so exciting before this.I have only two gripes. One, the main villain is not threatening enough, He comes across the guy who will not only help you undress before, but also help you dress after the act (wink).The other, more serious one, is that I saw the movie in what is probably the most horrible location in Singapore. The wine was off, the chips were soggy, the beer was warm and it took me an hour to come out from the car park after the movie was over.So Mr Hunt, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to drive out of the Vivocity car park in less than 24 hours, on a Sat night.This review will self destruct in...errrrr.....ummmmm....2 years?",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1639,edwardgillett,"Great stunts, everything else is a mess",3,13 August 2018,"With the exception of John Woo's undercooked second instalment, Mission: Impossible has been that rarest of things: a major action-movie franchise which improves (or at least avoids diminishing) with each new iteration. 2015's Rogue Nation was arguably the best of the lot, with Sean Harris excellentl as the implacably villainous Solomon Lane, and Rebecca Ferguson the most engaging foil the series has yet found for the tireless Tom Cruise. With these two returning alongside the ever-present Cruise, Fallout could and should have been a slam dunk.Instead, it's a damp squib, bogged down by a plot that manages to be convoluted and predictable at the same time, alongside turgid dialogue and stilted performances.On the upside, Fallout's stunts are as adrenaline-pumping as any previous M:I film, with eye-popping visuals throughout, all shot and performed superbly. These sequences noticeably lack the innovative staging and high-wire tension which characterised their predecessors, though: the classic suspension-rig routine from the first film, or the projection-based subterfuge inside the Kremlin from Ghost Protocol.Instead, we get a succession of blunt-force traumas: big, muscular punch-ups, car chases and explosions. This kind of uncomplicated energy is fine for your average big summer blockbuster, but the absence of the inventiveness which characterised previous M:I films is a disappointment.When the action-sequence dust settles, this lack of ambition becomes more of a problem. Harris and Ferguson, along with the otherwise-excellent Angela Bassett, are given relatively meagre screen time, dominated by tedious exposition, unintentionally hilarious attempts at pathos and smirking pantomime villainy respectively.They're shunted aside to make room for Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames to go through the motions once more, Vanessa Kirby as Cruise's latest age-inappropriate object of sexual tension. and Henry Cavill doing his usual turn as a very angry man with big muscles who is incapable of expressing any emotion.All of them are pulled along by a plot whose strings are always visible, suspended haphazardly between those big action sequences: where previous films felt taut and incisive, and generally managed to fit some interesting character development between the tentpole moments. This time, we get some poorly-written one-liners, a couple of hopelessly signposted plot twists, and a bit of half-baked musings on Ethan Hunt's morals.The overall effect is deadening, and lowers the stakes to barely-perceptible levels. We don't understand or care about these characters, despite the elaborate peril they're placed in. An hour or so in, it starts to feel like the spectacular stunts have been left to compensate for the dramatic hole at the film's core; by the end, it's clear they've failed.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1643,chryzann,JAW DROPPING AWESOME! Definitely worth watching in the cinema!,9,15 August 2018,"This is the sixth installment of the Mission Impossible franchise. Normally franchises that continue for so long tend to become boring and just predictable with mindless action and a plot that doesn't make sense! but definitely not this franchise. Writers Christoper Mcquarrie and Bruce Geller definitely bring an exciting and refreshing take on this movie with stunts that keep getting better and better which were all performed by Tom Cruise himself, which leaves us thinking ...Was there anything that this man could not do? The action sequences were all very realistic, terrifying and just jaw-droppingly awesome that made me gasp in awe.Tom Cruise who reprises his role as the legendary Ethan Hunt along with Simon Pegg (Benji), Ving Rhames (Luthor) whose characters have matured and they've done a fantastic job playing them. Rebecca Furguson (Ilsa) returns from Rogue nation and has improved quite a bit and portrayed her character impeccably. Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Alec Baldwin and Michelle Monaghan all return and do a great job portraying their characters as well. The chemistry between Pegg, Cruise, and Rhames works well as always. Even the jokes were not over the top but fit in perfectly with the scene and the storyline. Henry Cavill is the new addition to the cast and shines in his role portraying August Walker. At least this character had some depth and wasn't one dimensional. The locations where they shot the movie was just breathtaking and mesmerizing.This movie had incredible visuals, an interesting storyline though some revelations were a bit foreseeable, MI6 definitely stands out in this franchise and does outshine Ghost Protocol ( one of my favorite movies in the franchise). I absolutely enjoyed this movie and I was riveted to the screen from beginning till the end with all the fast-paced entertaining scenes. This is definitely a thrilling action summer blockbuster film surpassing Skyscraper though, in my opinion, I feel you can't compare these movies as they are on different levels.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1647,delfibravo,Exceeded my expectations,8,27 August 2018,"Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the 6th movie of the Mission: Impossible series, written, produced and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, it stars Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill.
 The film is about Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruise character, an agent that, with his team, has to track stolen platonium while being followed by a CIA agent.
 This is a great and entertaining movie. The action scenes and the special effects were terrific. The acting and cast was pretty good, Cruise stunts were amazing as usual, he never dissapoints in high- risk scenes. 
Otherwise, the storyline, altough it is good, it has too many plot-twists, many of them, needless. Anyway, this movie exceeded my expectations, it's really entertaining and one of the best of it's kind.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
1648,tania-31964,3/10 only for the great scenery. MI Fallout was a big miss in so many ways.,2,20 August 2018,"Where was the tension; suspense; class, style; intrigue; excitement; mystery; thrills and creative inventive story writing? I think it got lost in the messy plot of cartoon character action and poor acting with an uninventive story line.Please bring back directors John Woo, Brian De Palma or Brad Bird!!! and leave McQuarrie to direct teenage cartoon films. MI Fallout had no guts or raw moments and where did the sleek stylish filming and directing go? this wasn't high class slickness. This MI didn't even come close to paying homage to James Bond, where past Mission Impossibles' did! This film was just painted with 1 coat of cheap vanilla paint which was left to dry and then just started flaking for the next 140 mins. No trimmings or embellishments, it was just dull, plain, grey, ugly and boring.This installment in the MI series was suffering from a throbbing bad headache and nauseating hang over with nowhere to go but downhill. MI Fallout didn't really need any sound, you could watch it in silence and still know what was happening. You feel no connection or care for any of the characters and they all seemed emotionless & expressionless. Atleast Tom Cruise made an effort in his stunt roles, but sadly McQuarrie destroyed the Ethan Hunt character and made his personality seem weak, hopeless and embarrasing. Compare Ethan Hunt's personality in past MI films and you will see the change in MI Fallout. Michelle Monaghan's face was expressionless and emotionless throughout the whole film, even in a supposedly tense and traumatic scene while attempting to cut wires to a bomb which was about to destroy the planet, her facial expression does not change through the whole ordeal, its quite laughable. What a mess! I left the cinema angry, disappointed and extremely let down as an avid and faithful fan of all past MI films. The audience also left quiet and with no comment, they probably wondered what just happened and did they really just watch an MI film, or a comical farce?Terrible acting, weak story line, cartoon character violence which became laughable, awful CGI effects, bad plot, the actors didn't take this installment seriously and either did the film itself.Was it intentionally a black comedy that got lost in translation about 20mins into the film? I drifted off in the last 30mins only to be waken by crash, bang and noise. Oh yeah! I am watching Mission Impossible Fallout? or was I just woken from a bad dream?
Even the musical score was as boring and dull with huge similarities to Sicario, but atleast Sicario's musical score suited that film and had purpose.There was nothing new and nothing to make you go ""wow"" Past MI films always brought something new and exciting to the table, but sadly not this time.What happened to Vanessa Kirby half way through the film? did she realise what a mess she had entered into and then walked off set? Alec Baldwin decided to die a quick death, with Tom Cruise telling him ""sorry you had to die Alec"".Enough is enough, I will go back and enjoy the exciting roller coaster ride on the past MI films and throw this one into the ""what a waste of time bin"" .3/10 from me, the 3 was for the location and fabulous scenery in Paris, Norway and New Zealand.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

1651,jiamianhuo,A must see,10,8 September 2018,"First time (and probably last time) writing a review in IMDB. Spare me for my English because I'm from China and not even close to a native speaker.
 Big fan of the Mission Impossible series as I have watched 1-5 many times each, and I don't hesitate to say that this is the best among the six. I've already watched twice and is still considering the third time.
The characters are mostly from the previous one, Rogue Nation, with Sean Harris as the villain and the ever-beautiful Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa. It's also great to see Luther and Benji, but to me the absence of Jeremy Renner is a pity. Many of the supporting roles are also very eye-catching, such as the White Widow and the female police officer. In other words, they don't feel unimportant. One thing I didn't really like is the fact that Henry Cavill is the antagonist. From my perspective, he just doesn't look like a bad guy. His acting is great, but it just seemed a bit weird. On the other hand, Solomon Lane was acted very well through Sean's unique voice and facial expressions.
 The plot is as usual, great. This time it was even more intense, with plenty twists and turns in 2 hours and 30 minutes, which is very satisfying. High-tech wasn't really emphasized in this film, they might have just run out of new ideas anyway, which is a pity because high-tech was a recurring element in the series and gives people deep impressions. Talk about the safety system which appeared in Mission Impossible 1 and the magnetic gloves and the moving curtain in the 4th film. Those scenes are all seen as classics. In this film only an upgraded version of the mask-printing machine appeared, which was never put to use.
 To make up for it, Julia reappeared in this film and got the plot running smoothly. The film focused more on the relationship between Ethan and Julia, Ilsa and his partners, which made the character seem more realistic and vivid. Ethan is willing to save Luther instead of the plutonium, and also there was a slight change of facial expression after hitting Ilsa with a car, and of course, Julia. There is just more emotion in there rather than just fighting bad people and saving the world.
 The film doesn't lack action fighting, but the focus was kind of shifted away. There was just one proper fighting scene which I have to compliment, because Ethan finally met someone better than him. There was more car (and motorcycle) racing scene than usual, which really got my heart beating. I was told that those scenes didn't use CGI and there were no stunt doubles. For a moment I was thinking Tom Cruise must be out of his mind. He rode the motorcycle without any protection and I was truly surprised and impressed by the act. One flaw: obviously we know that this film is sponsored by BMW, but it wouldn't be realistic to find a random car and they all happen to be BMW. Not just in this film (Range Rovers also appeared) but it was more evident in the previous films. Also, a must mention is the ever-famous Tom Cruise run, which took up a pretty long time in this film.
 One thing that the previous films didn't have was humor. There were plenty of scenes that gave you a chuckle and temporarily took your mind off the intense plot. They also leave people with deep impressions. Some scenes I could think of: the bathroom scene where they are scanning the face, and Benji telling Ethan to jump (also appeared in the trailer) among other scenes.
 I'd have to dedicate a paragraph to Tom Cruise. Now, I'm still a bit skeptical about all the no-CGI and stunt fad, but if everyone is talking about it, it must be real. And if it's real, then I have the deepest respect to Tom. As I mentioned above, riding a motorbike with no helmets and performing a HALO and jumping from a building to another and driving a helicopter in to a mountain having just learned it, that's just insane. It's unbelievable that he dedicated so much into this, just to make a better film.
 I'd also like to mention about the connections to the previous series, which is really exciting for the fans of the whole series. In the scene where the White Widow is giving a speech, she mentioned her mother ""Max"", which was the armsdealer in Mission Impossible 1, and her daughter was essentially doing the same. The last fighting scene and mountain climbing is connected to Mission Impossible 2, where Ethan is climbing a mountain at the very start. Julia is from the 3rd of the series. I couldn't think of any in film 4 other than Benji. Rogue Nation doesn't need to be mentioned. But what's really good is that even if you didn't know about the previous films, there are sufficient explanations to guide you through the plot so there wouldn't be confusions, but also not too much to bore you. It is a subtle balance.
 There is still much I want to say about the actors, the plot, but I guess it'll have to do. I'd probably say it's the best action movie of the year and definitely a must see.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout

The movie was filmed on location in different places: Paris, UK, New Zealand, Norway, Berlín.
The film is the sixth sequel of the Mission. The story begins when Ethan Hunt and his team were assigned to intercept stolen plutonium cores in Berlin while being monitored by the CIA. The movie has a complex plot because it shows different stories.

1679,ashvinpatel-10641,Law of diminishing returns.,3,18 December 2018,"In all honesty, I was expecting a far better movie than the one I got here. It's M.I. Fallout with Tom and Ving and Simon, but that's about as good as it got. Because of the directors propensity to try and cram as much action into the movie, it just became more and more unbelievably preposterous the further it went. And it did carry on a bit too long. Look at some of the helicopter scenes and numerous other action sequences and you could be forgiven for thinking that you're watching a cartoon. Amongst all the explosions and bullets and fights and car crashes and helicopter smashes, Tom Cruise somehow never seems to get badly hurt. He jumps out of cars doing 110 mph and not so much as a limp. He jumps out of buildings from 40 to 50 feet height and after dusting himself down, is haring after the bad guys again. Not so much as a chipped fingernail. This is done time and time again, it really does start to grate. Where is the realism? I know it's only a movie but this is ridiculous. All good spy thrillers have a couple of really cracking plot twists that are usually completely unexpected. This movie has about seventeen million of them. And do you know what? I stopped caring after the first three. I think this particular franchise has run its course and it's time to call it a day. Get out while the getting good.

1687,joegreco-12222,"Pretty Good Overall, But Lacks Realism At Times.",7,2 March 2019,"Very cool, great action and interesting plot. Most of the movie was excellent. The action, the realism, the stunts, etc. Pretty cool and exciting. Along with the twists and turns and trying to figure out who's the true secret enemy is.What causes this film to lose 3 stars is the phoniness in a few of the scenes. Like the bathroom fight scene..... Seriously??? I understand why they potentially did the scene that way, but it definitely isn't realistic. The few phony scenes are the bathroom scene, the police/bad guy chases scene, the fight between Ilsa and Solomon in the house, and lastly the scene and fight between Ethan/Tom Cruise and Walker/Henry Cavill at the end. The lack of realism in these scenes really took away from the film, as this is an ongoing series, and it seems that the quality of realism and action was lacking in some scenes in the movie. What doesn't help is that they could have made it a lot more realistic like past Mission Impossible scenes and others in the film.To be specific, being tossed through bathroom walls, easily ripping pipes out of walls, zipping through traffic without being hit over and over again, having the vehicle tires spin instead of the car just driving away in an attempt create greater suspense of getting away, Ilsa, despite being an Assassin is easily captured by Solomon, the hanging out a window with a huge gun (seemed like the storm troopers in Star Wars who can never hit a target, and just used to create
false suspense), the fight scene between Ethan and Walker, where the fighting just seems ridiculous based on who these characters are supposed to be. Highly Trained Killers/Assassins, this fact seemed to be over looked to force a back and forth/odd fight at the end and ending in an anti-climatic way.The only reason I bring this up is because the lack of realism made me zone out from being dialed into the movie. Which took away from the experience as a whole. If these scenes were more realistic, this movie would have been a 9.5-10. As overall, I would have enjoyed the movie from start to finish and not zone out due to the blatant phoniness of the scenes. I expected a lot more realism from a movie franchise such as Mission Impossible.Overall, Pretty Good, But Lacks Realism Occasionally.",Mission - Impossible - Fallout
