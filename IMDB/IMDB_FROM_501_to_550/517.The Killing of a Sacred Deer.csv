0,Leofwine_draca,Hugely pretentious,1,26 April 2018,"One of the most pretentious films I can remember seeing in a long while, THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER tries to be a family-centred psycho thriller but instead turns out to be a long-winded and interminable bore. The film stars Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman as a married couple whose lives are ruined when a strange and obnoxious boy comes into their lives and makes them a deathly ultimatum. The plot's okay in itself, but not when things are dragged out to this interminably slow length. The worst thing about the movie by far is the direction, from a Greek chap who couldn't direct traffic, let alone a proper movie. Every single scene is distracted by his stupid camera tricks, with slow zooms in and out being particular favourites. The film is icy, cold, and has no heart at all, and at times there's blaring noise on the soundtrack that just annoys you. Farrell and Kidman do nothing with their underwritten parts while Barry Keoghan is no more than one-dimensional as the supposed antagonist. It's the kind of awful viewing experience that never seems to end.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
1,SnoopyStyle,artistic endearvor,6,3 March 2018,"Surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) and wife Anna (Nicole Kidman) have teen daughter Kim and young son Bob. He is befriended by Martin (Barry Keoghan) who is the son of his dead patient. Martin insinuates himself into Steven's family and Kim falls for him. Martin reveals his threatening predictions with a devastating solution.After his interesting weird The Lobster, Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos creates another oddity. His insistence on the mannered monotone dialogue delivery has a hypnotic effect that puts me to sleep. I had to rewind to get back into the flow. Keoghan's dead-eye serial killer performance is too obvious. I can't believe that Steven would bring him into his home. While I appreciate a lot of the outsider oddity flavor, I cannot take any reality from any of the characters or situation. The first thought I have as Steven is that the boy poisoned my family. At a certain point, these are no longer realistic people but rather artistic installations. There is some value in the artwork and I can imagine this story as a shocking psychological thriller in another person's hands.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
2,Horst_In_Translation,Deus vult,6,3 January 2018,"""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is the most recent work by Greek Oscar-nominated filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos, writer and director here. It runs for pretty much exactly 2 hours and features Colin Farrell again, who gets to act next to Oscar winner Nicole Kidman here, and Alicia Silverstone is probably the third somewhat famous cast member. Apparently there is a strong connection to Greek mythology in here, but I don't know about that, so I'd rather elaborate on the film in general: This is the story of a family whose order gets destroyed when a teenager enters their lives and starts taking revenge for what the father has done to his father a while ago. Or we should say, he is rather witnessing the drastic events. The longer the film goes, the more you will understand that there won't be a logical or medical solution and explanation offered to the audience eventually. Tragedy is inevitable and occasional ideas that the husband or wife will take the suicide route to solve the issue quickly disappeared from my mind again. Sure not everything here felt really realistic, but most of it did I guess and it was a tense thriller, a good watch from start to finish that never drags and for a movie with this runtime, it is quite a success I'm sure.Maybe my least favorite moment was the scene in which the daughter wants to sacrifice herself for the well-being of everybody else. But one of my most favorite moments was how she collapsed while singing. I also think that the relationships between children and parents are very special here. It is interesting to see that father and daughter as well as mother and son have clearly stronger bonds and there is an excessive deal of violence, emotional and physical, involved for the other parent-child directions. Lanthimos is not scared of including graphic sexual references here, mostly about handjobs and female periods. The latter and its constant inclusion early on made me wonder if there is something very wrong in the family too before the boy gets in charge. There seems to be a lot going on under the surface I'd say and the sterile, almost robot-like, behavior of the family members feels very bizarre when they are talking in the most calm and reserved manner about all kinds of contents that deserve all kinds of emotions attached to them.All in all, a pretty good film and I can see why it got so much awards attention. I cannot really see ""The Shining"" references, but Lanthimos' style is easy to identify (also in terms of all the sounds you hear while watching the tragedy on so many occasions) and it's another success for him, quality-wise certainly not worse than ""The Lobster"". I recommend seeing it to everybody who loves psychological (family) thriller films. The very last scene at the restaurant was pretty telling too. The girl could walk again, the mother could still walk, but the cost for their health was gigantic. Speaking about Kidman's character, I liked how they constantly made us wonder with certain situations if she was about to be paralyzed too and fall to the ground the very next moment. But it is not required to happen for the film and story to succeed. The bait is definitely enough. It's not a truly great film and I don't see much potential for it to be included as one of the best 10 (let alone 5) best films of the year and it probably won't end up underseen or underrated, but this should not take away anything from your intention to see it. A definite thumbs-up for me. Don't miss out.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
3,Prismark10,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,3,13 October 2019,"Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos makes a film based on a Greek tragedy, Iphigenia in Aulis by Euripides.Heart surgeon Steven Murphy's (Colin Farrell) life is in turmoil after he befriends a troubled teenager Martin (Barry Keoghan) who is the son of a patient who died while Steven was treating him.Martin blames Steven for his father's death. His wife Anna (Nicole Kidman) finds out that Steven had been drinking when he treated Martin's dad. Now Martin is threatening harm to both of their children and he wants Steven to make a deadly choice.The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a weird arthouse film and not a very good one. It starts out with the Murphy's comfortable lifestyle and everyone delivering lines in a monotonous cold way. It is too self consciously trying to be offbeat, dark and pretentious.It then becomes unpleasant, surreal and violent as Martin can somehow make the Murphy's children fall ill by some form of magic. This compels Steven to act in a way to somehow rescue his family. It is essentially a demented version of Sophie's Choice.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
4,claudio_carvalho,"Weird, Intriguing but Absolutely Disappointing and Overrated",3,15 December 2017,"The renowned heart surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is married with Dr. Anna Murphy (Nicole Kidman) with two children, the young teenager Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and the boy Bob (Sunny Suljic) that are their pride and joy.

Steven brings Martin to meet his family and the teenager invites him to have dinner at his home with his mother (Alicia Silverstone), who harasses Steven. He rejects and on the next day, Bob gets sick without walking. Steven and Anna bring Bob to the hospital and after a complete checkup, the doctors do not find any problem with the boy. Soon Martin meets Steven and tells that he killed his father; now he has to kill Anna or Kim or Bob; otherwise they will all get sick and die. Who is Martin?""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is a weird, intriguing but absolutely disappointing and overrated film. The plot and the performances are cold, without heart, and has scenes absolutely unnecessary, like Anna masturbating Matthew in the car or the cameo of Alicia Silverstone. However, the screenplay holds the attention of the viewer that expects the clarification of the mystery. Unfortunatelly the conclusion is awful without any explanation for what is happening or who Martin is or has done. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): Not Available",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
5,kosmasp,Weird alternate reality,9,26 March 2018,"Dialog is going to be weird. Suffice to say that you won't feel anything close to something familiar. The movie is way off and if you are familiar with the work of the director this will not come as a surprise. Obviously for some this was the first experience with him. And it can be intimidating and rather confusing. There are certain rules that are there and even the structure is quite ""normal"", but other than that ... all bets are off.The acting may seem wooden, but it's intentional. As are the pauses and the ""humor""/comedy. Not for the masses and definitely more confusing than trying to explain anything. But therein lies the charm of the movie - if you can see it and have an open mind about it.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
6,classicsoncall,"""Here it is. That time is now.""",6,17 January 2020,"Ahh, so this is the same director that brought us ""The Lobster""; somehow I'm not surprised. I read a few dozen reviews of the movie posted here on IMDb, and of course a lot of them state how absurd the story is. Of those that commented favorably however, they seemed to attach some credibility to the events that occurred in the picture. That's where my criticism of the film actually lies. First off, it's undeniable that the film starts out with an oddly creepy vibe. The relationship between Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) and Martin (Barry Keoghan) is shrouded in some kind of mystery that the viewer is not privy to. My own sense was that there was an aberrant sexual relationship between the two with all the various allusions made by the characters, like meeting in secret and the gifts bestowed on Martin by the esteemed cardiac surgeon.But when we come to learn that this is a revenge tale on the part of the young teen who's father died on Murphy's operating table, any attempt to decipher reality from what's going on goes astray. The main question one must ask is how Martin was perpetrating the illness that was about to decimate the Murphy family. I came up with two possibilities - poison or voodoo magic. The poison angle was immediately set aside by the various experts called in to diagnose Murphy's son Bob (Sunny Suljic), who was exhibiting the symptoms Martin warned Steven about. As for the voodoo magic, well, I'll let the reader make up his own mind on that.Perhaps we have to take Martin's own advice at the moment he took a chunk out of his own arm while detained in the Murphy basement. He stated to Steven, ""Do you understand? It's metaphorical"". Which then puts it in context with the Greek tragedy aspects that other reviewers have commented on of which I have no knowledge. Following a perverse instance of Russian roulette performed by Murphy against the members of his own family, the revenge goal attained, some semblance of normality is restored and the remaining Murphy's are allowed to forge ahead with their existence. The diner scene at the finale offered an opportunity for some sort of confrontation that wasn't going to happen. The trace of a smile by daughter Kim (Raffey Cassidy) appeared to be well out of context with the situation given her willingness to sacrifice herself for the rest of the family.So what's the message here? Darned if I know and I'll be darned if you know either. I generally go for symbolism in film, but it's tough to find anything of value here. Maybe it is metaphorical, but of what, I really couldn't say.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
7,jboothmillard,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,13 December 2020,"I heard and read a good few positive reviews for this film, and I remembered it for the leading actress, and I'm relieved I eventually found the time to watch it, after missing it a couple of times, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster, The Favourite). Basically, in Cincinnati, Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is a skilled cardiothoracic surgeon, specialising in open heart surgery. He has recently been meeting up with teenager Martin (Barry Keoghan). After spending time with Martin in a café, Steven returns home to his wife, Anna (Nicole Kidman), and their children, teenager Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and younger son Bob (Sunny Suljic). Anna and Steven have sex where Anna pretends to be under the effect of anaesthesia. Steven tells Anna about meeting with Martin, he has been helping Martin deal with his grief following the death of his father who died in a car accident ten years earlier. Martin comes to the Murphy household for dinner; Kim seems rather taken with him. Martin returns the favour by inviting Steven to his mother's home for dinner. Steven tries to leave following the meal, but Martin insists he watch a movie with them. Martin leaves halfway through, and his mother (Alicia Silverstone) makes a romantic advance on Steven by complimenting his hands. He immediately rebuffs her attempting to kiss and suck his hands and goes home. Over the next few days, Martin's demands on Steven's time grow increasingly frequent and desperate, but Steven does not reply. One morning, Bob wakes up to find he cannot feel his legs; he has become paralysed. Steven and Anna rush him to the hospital, but a medical examination determines that nothing is physically wrong. Meanwhile, Martin visits Kim at the Murphy family home. She tells Martin that she loves him and undresses, but he makes an excuse and leaves. The next morning, Martin meets Steven and tells him the truth: his father did not die in the crash but during surgery that Steven himself performed after the accident. Martin blames Steven for his father's death. Martin explains that, to ""balance"" the act of destroying a family, Steven must kill one of his own family members. If not, the Murphys will slowly die after four stages; paralysis is the first stage, followed by self-imposed starvation, bleeding from the eyes, and finally death. Steven dismisses these claims, but later finds that Bob is refusing to eat. Soon after, Kim collapses during a choir rehearsal at school, her legs go completely numb, and she also becomes unwilling to eat. Kim receives a call from Martin at the hospital. She regains the use of her legs during the conversation, but when the connection is broken, she loses her mobility again. Anna is convinced that Martin has the power to follow through on his threats. She visits Martin to ask why she and her children must suffer for Steven's mistakes. Martin responds that ""it's the only thing...that's close to justice"". Anna suspects Steven, a former alcoholic, may have been drinking on the day of the operation on Martin's father. She speaks to Steven's anaesthesiologist, Matthew Williams (Bill Camp), about the surgery and wants to see the medical records. Matthew does not give her the file but reveals that Steven did make an error and did have two drinks before surgery that morning. He reveals this in exchange for Anna masturbating him as payment for the information. After many hospital tests on Kim and Bob, and with no solution found, Anna insists that the children are brought home, where they are tube-fed. Steven then kidnaps Martin, brutally beating him and demanding that he reverse the condition of the children. Martin is tied up in the basement and warns Steven that time is running out. Kim and Bob argue over who their father will choose. Anna claims that killing one of the children is the only option they have. Attempting to reach a decision, Steven meets with the school principal (Drew Logan) and asks which of his children is most academically gifted, but the principal does not give a clear answer. Kim drags herself to the basement and tries to persuade Martin to heal her again so they may elope She is unsuccessful and attempts to save herself by escaping and crawling through the neighbourhood. Steven and Anna find her. As Steven disinfects her wounds, Kim tells him how much she loves him and volunteers to be the one to die. The next morning, Anna releases Martin as holding him captive was no use. Bob begins bleeding from the eyes, causing all to panic. Rather than make a choice, Stv ties up Ki, Bob, and Anna to chairs, covers their heads, and covers his own face. He loads a rifle and fires recklessly. The first two shots miss, but the third kills Bob. Sometime later, the family visits the same diner where Steven met with Martin. The family briefly lock eyes with Martin when he enters and stares at them. No explanation is given as to how Steven got away with shooting his son. As the family leave, Martin gazes after them, and Kim turns to look back at him as she leaves. Also starring Barry G. Bernson as Dr. Larry Banks. Farrell gives an interesting performance as the respected cardiovascular surgeon who must make an unthinkable choice, Kidman is also intriguing as his wife, but it is indeed the emotionless and sinister performance of Keoghan, whose sanity is questionable, that stands out. I can see why this film would be described as ""Weird Wave"", it has great use of cinematography which adds to the eeriness, the dialogue being overtly precise is perhaps laughable, but in a way, it adds to the strangeness, it slowly builds with tension until the warped finale, a surreal and interesting psychological horror mystery thriller. Very good!",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
8,Quinoa1984,"Brutal, off-key, an amazing Keoghan, pointless",6,12 November 2017,"Lathimos is one twisted (bleep). I mean that as a compliment, but only sort of; I wonder after this film, about a 16 year old who's father died (presumably) under the watch of a surgeon and now is using his (uh) psychic abilities to tear his family down into sickness and possibly death, if he can find a story to tell that isn't so, so, so... his usual. The first half was so promising, like 'oh, the director of Dogtooth and Lobster doing a Lifetime-y stalker thriller, the Single White Aspergery Teen Boy' story, I'm in.' And then it... Didn't go where I thought and not in any enjoyable way. My instinct is to compare to Kubrick - certainly in visuals that is the direct descendant - but Lathimos makes SK look like a bowl of sunshine and lolly-pops. His movies had humor, as dark as they were. This is closer to the unpleasant vibes from Haneke, but the stilted approach to directing the actors from the other films doesn't carry over so well. You need some kind of context for this to work which those two films had.Eventually as the characters become more desperate and the (psychological) horror amps up, it feels totally divorced from reality coupled with the freezing coldness of the thing. This is unsettling filmmaking, but it needs a point, or at least some kind of portal for us to get into the characters world. As strong performance-wise as Farrell and Kidman and are (the former does have a good continuity with his tone from the Lobster, and especially the truly great performance by the kid who plays Martin, the context for how they talk and act and their decisions and motivations at some key points either don't ring true or come off as WTF for the hell of it (also, minor spoiler, why is Kidman never afflicted by the paralysis and other s**t but the kids are one after another?) I find this filmmaker so compelling, original, affecting and worth seeing anything he does if only because no one else IS his work now, and this has a concept that drew me in, and it's ultimately an ambitious misfire. Sacred Deer is not unlike the problem that Mother! had a couple months back: we know there's a metaphor going on for something, and it may be too obvious. Only that film built up to its insanity, while this is the same uncanny, eerie tone throughout.Also, cool off with the music cues, Yorg.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
9,BandSAboutMovies,A comedy standout!,2,5 December 2020,"You know, I've put off writing this review for a while because I had nothing wittier to say than, ""I wish I could beat up every single person in this movie."" But seriously, a few months and another watch later and I still feel the same way. Nothing upset me, nothing moved me, I just felt like my life was slowly slipping away when I could have been watching something, anything else better than this.Maybe it's because this movie is based on the ancient Greek tragedy Iphigenia at Aulis by Euripides and isn't a movie where Bobby Rhodes turns into a demon at a cinema, but I could see what director Yorgos Lanthimos was doing in every frame, just like the last movie of his that I struggled though, The Lobster.I am not made for this. I am made for screaming at Jess Franco movies, for knowing all the strange dialogue to Fulci films, for crying during Mario Bava homicides.Colin Farrell plays a surgeon who screwed up and Nicole Kidman plays yet another wife who has a husband that she pretty much hates, a role that she seems to do in everything I see her in. She also pretends to be under anesthesia while she makes love to her husband in a car and then jerks off an anesthesiologist, so I have no idea what this movie has to say about putting people under other than it's really hot.Barry Keoghan is the weird kid that screws up the whole family and gets them to stop eating. He's a laugh riot, in the way that I guffawed that anyone took any of this remotely seriously.Reviews like this are why I'll never make it out of the genre gutter and get to be part of Rotten Tomatoes.

However, it is reasonably interesting and kicks up a notch when Martin makes his request.From then on it has an element of intrigue, as the Murphy's now have to make a choice, and which one will it be?The movie deserved a better conclusion though.

Now he's given us ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer,"" and I'm starting to think I should have just stopped at ""Dogtooth.""Film history is full of directors who have asked their audiences to work. Not content to allow their audiences to sit passively and consume movies like they do their popcorn, these directors instead challenge them, make them uncomfortable, make them participate. I love this kind of film making. However, I think this approach only really works when a director is willing to engage in a conversation. Some directors forget they're making a movie for an audience or decide that what they want more than anything is to dare their audiences to sit through their movies. I'm afraid that Lanthimos is starting to fall into that category. ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is so unpleasant to sit through that I found myself making fun of it to make it tolerable. Forget trying to engage in Lanthimos's themes or try to understand what he's saying.

15,ferguson-6,pick a kid,8,26 October 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. When we become a spouse and a parent, we immediately develop a mode of protection never before experienced. We would do anything possible to protect our kids and spouse – even die for them if necessary. One of the most gifted and imaginative filmmakers working today forces us to consider a terrifying scenario: what if we had to select one of our family members to die?Yorgos Lanthimos delivered the most bizarre and interesting film of 2016 with THE LOBSTER. This time out he re-teams with co-writer Efthymis Filippou, although this story eschews the dark humor of their previous film, opting instead for a type of gut-wrenching psychological warfare we have not previously witnessed on screen. The goal here is not to make the viewer uncomfortable. Mr. Lanthimos wants us downright miserable from the tension. This is obvious from the opening scene as Schubert accompanies a close-up look at open- heart surgery, and continues through the awkward conversations and speech patterns as we get to know the characters. A terrific Collin Farrell plays the surgeon Dr Steven Murphy. Nicole Kidman is his wife (also a doctor), and their kids Kim and Bob are played by Raffey Cassidy (TOMORROWLAND) and Sunny Sulgic, respectively. The wild card is Barry Keoghan (DUNKIRK) who plays Martin, the most charming and oddball stalker who is hell bent on revenge and retribution. Keoghan is quite brilliant in this most difficult role.Beyond the psycho-revenge plot lies a story of survival and atonement, making for an excruciatingly unsettling time in the theatre. We feel the vice tightening on us as the tone shifts from uncertain awkwardness to dark sinister intentions. Director Lanthimos and his regular cinematographer Thimios Bakatakis are in perfect sync with the various harsh angles (high and low spiked with screeching violins) and the necessary tight shots to emphasize the uneasiness and confusion of the characters.Alicia Silverstone is quite memorable in her one scene as Martin's mother. Frustrated that her flirtations with Steven aren't reciprocated, she belts out the year's greatest line of dialogue: ""I won't let you leave until you've tried my tart!"" Of course, we couldn't expect sexual relations to be any closer to normal than the conversations, and Ms. Farrell and Ms. Kidman ensure this to be so. Truly at the peak of the acting profession, Ms. Kidman has never shied away from tough material or less-than-ideal characters. Her strength and determination come through in every scene here, and it's her scene at Martin's home where she really puts her stamp on the film.As difficult as it is to describe the film without giving anything away, one thing is certain – it's a horror film. It's difficult to imagine a more frightening scenario than what shakes out here with touches of both SOPHIE'S CHOICE and THE DEER HUNTER, while also having nothing in common with those films. The film's title comes courtesy of Euripides, and its suspenseful awkwardness at a level rarely seen.

18,gradyharp,"'He should have come out of that surgery alive, but he died.'",3,2 January 2018,"Writer (with Efthymis Filippou ) /director Yorgos Lanthimos (Kinetta, Dogtooth, The Lobster) has created another controversial film that is unsettling, slow, accompanied by an unlistenable musical score, disturbing, and over overwrought.
For those who can think along the same plains as Lanthimous the film may satisfy. Summarizing the plot is a challenge - After the untimely death of 16-year-old Martin's (young Irish actor Barry Keoghan) father on the operating table, little by little, a deep and empathetic bond begins to form between him and the respected cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell). At first, expensive gifts and then an invitation for dinner will soon earn the orphaned teenager (Martin lives with his mother Alicia Silverstone) the approval of Dr Steven's perfect family (wife ophthalmologist Anna - Nicole Kidman, daughter Kim -Raffey Cassidy, and son Bob - Sunny Suljic), even though right from the start, a vague, yet unnerving feeling overshadows Martin's honest intent. Martin confronts Steven with a long-forgotten transgression that will shatter the Murphy family's domestic bliss. And then, unexpectedly, the idyllic family is smitten by a fierce and pitiless punishment - lower limb paralysis, anorexia, bleeding eyes - while at the same time, everything will start falling apart as the innocents have to suffer. In the end, as the sins of one burden the entire family, only an unimaginable and unendurable decision that demands a pure sacrifice can purge the soul. But to find catharsis, one must first admit the sin.The bizarre story teeters on magic and mysticism but fails to engage the audience's compassion. The dialogue - even by great actors like Farrell and Kidman - is delivered in a rushed monotone and the screeching background music buries the story. If you have a lot of patience and strong endurance you may make it through to the unsatisfactory end.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

The story is that of a well to do family lead by heart surgeon Steven Murphy(in a good turn from Colin Farrell) who has a trophy and elegant socialite also doctor wife Anna(Nicole Kidman in a sexy turn love her in that gray colored bra!) and their two young children Bob and Kim make up life.It's only when Steven has a friend in a young man named Martin(Barry Keoghan) that he and things change for his family one by one things become more unsettling with drama and doubt and worry. It's like something that happened in the past is now a curse that the Murphy family has to face. Overall the film is nerve challenging as you wonder will this evil ever come to wash away , overall good one to watch as the cast also has great working chemistry.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
21,lasttimeisaw,"this parable lands on its feet alright, but precariously veering into a missed opportunity",7,14 December 2017,"Greek social satirist Yorgos Lanthimos' modern-day re-construction of the ancient Greek play IPHIGENIA AT AULIS, THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER preserves his maverick wheezes in the film's textual composition: a curse of tit-for-tat disregarding any logical explication, and bolstered by a robust cast, Lanthimos' pull-push machination of its camera's slick movement, this parable lands on its feet alright, but precariously veering into a missed opportunity. Its eye-opening gambit is a close-up to a pulsating heart during a real-time open-heart surgery, a metaphor one might conjecture that a process awaits to unpick something vital, seismic, but hidden under the surface and taken granted by us. The story follows Colin Farrell's Steven Murphy, a cardiologist who apparently has a perfect family with wife Anna (Kidman) and two children, Kim (Cassidy, sturdily braving herself in a both emotionally and physically challenging role) and her younger brother Bob (Suljic, an angelic guardian of curly long hairs), it is polarized from the quirky domestic setting in DOGTOOTH (2009), Lanthimos' stepping stone into international auteur-dom. However, the quirky part is infused through the advent of Martin (Keoghan), a soft-spoken teenager whose relation with Steven appears at once cordial but fishy, blokeish but insidious, and when Martin's aggression into Steven's household hits that invidious note, something psychic occurs, which blatantly exhorts Steven to choose a sacrifice from his family to atone for his misconduct. Remolding a Hellenic tragedy into a contemporary scenario requires a critical revamp to modernize the precept of source material, and this is precisely what Lanthimos fails to do, it is Steven's remorse, that doesn't crystallize in his behavior after his offspring being subjected to Martin's punitive curse, he is distraught, desperate, but it seems that the proposition of trading his own life for one of his children, has never floated up in his mind, after all, the deer are innocent, he is the sinner of, to say the very least, medical negligence. Through a cacophony of discordant soundscape, Steven and his family's psychological strains have been pushed into every nook and cranny of our sensorium, nerve-racking, absurd and bedazzled with gallows humor (crawling critters are a part of the furniture of horror flicks), till the uneasy Russian roulette solution. Performance-wise, Farrell competently parlays his reserved, imploding mode from THE LOBSTER (2015) into this familial turmoil, but his portrayal of Steven inclines to malign a man's softness, in a sense, he is punished not only for his slip on the operation table but also his namby-pamby indecision/immaturity, which in turn, gives Kidman's Anna a stage to shine in her more controlled, sensible, motherly sway, and Kidman seizes our admiration with her scathing gaze and haunting resignation, when she realizes the inevitability, incidentally, Anna's mobility becomes a constantly distracting concern whenever she moves because she is prophesied to be the next one falls into paralysis. Although Martin's psychic power is the elephant-in-the-room conveniently mythified, Barry Keoghan is a bracing discovery of the next big thing, a joli-laid in appearance but effortlessly connives to consolidate Martin's not well-adjusted psyche beneath the camouflage of benignancy, a chilling but also ensorcelling bravura. Lastly, let's digress back to the conjecture of its opening gambit, what does TKOASD unpick? Overall, it doesn't acquit itself as a forensic allegory of any modern malaise (as in his three previous works) but is considerably taken away by its surrealistic flourish and the time-honored moral debate it provokes, it is an old-wine-in-the-new-bottle dilemma, however luscious does the wine taste, it is always the design of the bottle needs to be updated, preferably, in a progressive direction.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
22,Hellmant,"So dark and disturbing that my friend, who I was watching it with, had to leave the theater three different times!",9,20 December 2017,"'THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A psychological horror flick directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, and written by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou (the duo also performed the same duties on such critically acclaimed indie hits as 'THE LOBSTER' and 'DOGTOOTH'). The story revolves around a doctor who befriends a teenage boy, and then later learns that the boy wants revenge for the death of his father, years earlier, on the doctor's operating table. It's based on the ancient Greek play 'Iphigenia at Aulis', by Euripides. The film stars Colin Farrell, Barry Keoghan, Nicole Kidman, Raffey Cassidy, Sunny Suljic, Alicia Silverstone and Bill Camp. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's now playing in indie theaters. I found the movie to be incredibly creepy and disturbing, but it's also undeniably effective and well made. The story revolves around Steven Murphy (Farrell), a very skilled surgeon, and his wife Anna (Kidman), and their two kids (Cassidy and Suljic). Steven has befriended a young teenage boy, named Martin (Keoghan). Martin's father died ten-years earlier, and Steven was the operating surgeon. It's soon revealed that Martin blames Steven for the death of his father, and he wants revenge. He explains to Steven that he's put a curse on the Murphy family, and Steven's wife and children will die, unless Steven picks one of them to kill first. Steven at first does not believe Martin, but after the symptoms of the illness Martin described begin coming true, the whole family becomes frantic for survival. The movie is so dark and disturbing that my friend, who I was watching it with, had to leave the theater three different times. I'm used to really creepy and horrifying movies like this, but it even got to me a bit. It's definitely not a happy or pleasant movie at all, but it is effective at what it sets out to do. Which is to just make the viewer completely uncomfortable and disturbed the entire time. So I have to give it a good rating just for that. Keoghan's performance in it is also outstanding as well (it's arguably Oscar worthy). I'd definitely recommend the movie to film fans, and especially horror movie lovers, that can handle disturbing subject matter that is.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
23,thesar-2,We Need to Talk About Martin,8,26 August 2019,"Colin Farrell must really like animals to have starred in so many recent titles involving them: Dumbo, The Lobster, Fantastic Beasts and a doomed Deer.Aside from some incredibly odd acting choices (or direction?) from the family and one gaping hole left unanswered, The Killing of a Sacred Deer was an incredible little dark fable worth watching for any true horror fans. In fact, I would surely recommend this and the enormously similar in tone, depth and mood Hereditary as the perfect double feature.We begin with an odd relationship with a married surgeon with two kids and an obviously off-boy. Slowly, and it's deliberately slow, we realize who that ""outsider"" is and his motives. It's almost fun trying to figure out the relationship between the grown and very hairy man (trust me, not just my observation) and the young lad, probably 15 years old.But, be careful for what you wish for. Soon, the ""happy"" family man has to make a decision so drastic, sad and horrific, it shouldn't be even wished upon anyone's worst enemy.I put happy in quotes because everyone seems so wooden and it's hard to figure out why. In fact, I never did to this minute. The movie is beautiful, like incredibly shot and the mood is great with some gotcha dialogue here and there. But, as for why everyone acts like they're carved from wood, I'm still puzzled. In the aforementioned Hereditary, there are MANY reasons for the family to be in shock or stilted. Here, I really can't think of one reason the group are a bunch of marionettes without strings.That all said, I'm giving this a high rating and a recommendation for true movie lovers, not just people who see less than 5 movies a year all with budgets exceeding $300 million. This is for film lovers to relax, sit back and enjoy. (And I totally mean that considering how, again, slow paced it is and its runtime is just past two hours.)Not sure I'd call this horror, but it should also satisfy horror buffs like me. It's certainly creepy, moody and you will have great emotional reactions.No hunter here. I don't even like guns. But, if you get a chance, you should see the killing of this sacred movie.***Final thoughts: No spoiler, but briefly mentioned above: I have a huge question for the closing, but I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say, there may not be a huge plot HOLE, but it's not explained and I demand an explanation to...yeah, just see this and maybe someday, we can talk about Martin.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

25,MOscarbradley,One of the best films of the year,10,1 May 2018,"The cinema of Yorgos Lanthimos is an acquired taste; luckily it's a taste that many cineastes have embraced wholeheartedly. He is clearly one of the great directors working today, utterly idiosyncratic and inhabiting his own very specific world. In other words, he doesn't make films that are easy to watch or 'realistic'; if his characters seem realistic they too inhabit worlds of their own.He came to prominence with ""Dogtooth"", about a man who keeps his family locked within the comforts of a palatially modern Greek house. ""The Lobster"", his first film in English, was a dark fairytale that won him the Jury prize at Cannes and an Oscar nomination and now we have his masterpiece, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" which combines elements of a genuinely disturbing horror film, a very black comedy and even Greek tragedy to awesome effect.From the get-go it's virtually impossible to get a handle on which way the film is likely to go. His use of architecture, sweeping tracking shots and discordant music is sure to throw us off balance as is the metronomic dialogue and almost robotic acting. This time we are in, not a fairytale, but a fully fledged nightmare as surgeon Colin Farrel's ambiguous friendship with a surly 16 year old boy, (a terrific Barry Keoghan), goes not in the direction we anticipate but down a much darker and dangerous road altogether. Farrell's excellent though ultimately the film belongs to Nicole Kidman as his hard-nosed wife and to Keoghan as his nemesis. This is cinema at its most visceral and one of the best films of the year.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Though the drily dark dialogue isn't as at home here as in the director's previous work, this is still a mysterious and off-kilter film that is interesting and engaging.",7,3 November 2017,"Yorgos Lanthimos' latest film features much of the same daringly dark and dry dialogue that has essentially become both his and writing partner Efthymis Filippou's signature style. However, it isn't quite as removed from reality as his other work - especially the fantastic 'The Lobster' (2015) - and, as such, is occasionally at odds with the way it is told (especially in the few jarring moments this crooked cadence completely slips away and a more contemporary vernacular comes into play). This is only to the point where some of the off-kilter ominousness is slightly lost or sometimes seems strangely undercut by some darkly comic moments that don't quite fit so well here considering that they fade away almost entirely in the final act. Still, it is perhaps this brazenly bizarre tone that adds to the sense that something is simply not right straight from the operatic off. Right from the moment the piece hits you with its startlingly gruesome (and 100% real) opening image, you know that you're in for something both strange and sinister - a fact that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone familiar with the director's previous work. It actually transforms itself slowly from a mysterious dark comedy to an even darker yet equally mystifying thriller that doesn't give you any easy answers or leave you with a satisfying conclusion. It's engaging and interesting stuff, though if I had one main complaint it would be that the piece feels too long due to the fact that the second half meanders enormously. Still, even this is thematically and narratively appropriate in hindsight, as both the film and its characters do whatever they can to prolong the inevitable. 7/10.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
27,dromasca,disturbing parable,8,21 November 2017,"The movies of Yorgos Lanthimos are hard to compare or include in a category. Maybe they should be declared a genre of their own. Dogtooth or The Lobster provided dystopian perspectives of family and love. With 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' it looks that he made steps ahead. Both in assimilating and processing myths and social relations, but also in creating a disturbing atmosphere. This is a disturbing film from many points of view. Because or despite of it it forwards a strong message that makes the film impossible to forget.The story starts as a medical drama. The successful surgeon dr. Murphy (Colin Farrell) has it all - a beautiful wife (Nicole Kidman), two manageable kids, and some kind of a tutoring relation with another teenager of lower social condition which he may lead to becoming a surgeon as well. Yet, the apparent solid fabric of his life is slowly deteriorating as the kid friend starts showing signs of becoming somebody different, who shares dark secrets and has reasons to punish or even destroy his life. The film slowly slides into horror, fantastic, myth. It ends in a very different place from the one it started. It's shocking and frightening.The art of Yorgos Lanthimos combines the fluent story telling with the mastering of the different genres, but his roots are deeper, as the hints to Greek mythology that is included in the title. He also makes no effort to avoid controversy of break taboos. It's not easy viewing, but it's impossible to get out of the mind if you immersed in his world. Strongly recommended.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
28,ThomasDrufke,Unsettling,8,6 November 2017,"The Horror genre keeps on taking leaps forward in terms of creativity. The Killing of a Sacred Deer, along with It Comes at Night, are two impeccably original horror films that don't play out at all the way you expect, and that's largely the reason why I love them both so much. I haven't seen Yorgos Lanthimos' other work, but what I have seen, is a good number of David Lynch's work. And The Killing of a Sacred Deer sure feels a whole lot like one of his films. Aesthetically, tonally, and Lanthimos' direction all feel straight out of something David Lynch would make. Interestingly enough, as memorable as this film is with its terrifying plot, everything is often very quiet and soft spoken. It's almost like the characters aren't surprised at the events that unfold and that makes it all the more unsettling when horrifying things start to unravel.Contributing to that horror, is the films main antagonist, Martin, played by Barry Keoghan. He was good in Dunkirk over the summer, but his performance as Martin is just about as close to perfection as you can ask for due to how that character is written. I don't want to say too much about what he does, but it's some of the most unsettling things I have ever seen in a movie, period. It's these psychological thriller/horror films that scare me the most. Much of this film is left in ambiguity and up for interpretation, which is part of the reason why I'm not revealing much of the plot at all as I just don't have the answers. But when a film captures the perfect tone and mood, especially in horror, the events tend to speak for themselves and you don't need things to be explained to get what the director wanted you to feel.Overall, The Killing of a Sacred Deer is an extremely difficult film to watch, but not because of gore or violence, more because of the dire events that drive the plot forward. I don't think I'll ever watch the film a second time, but it sure was worth more than a glance.8.5/10",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
29,Cineanalyst,Iphigenia in Aulis,5,2 December 2018,"What a strange filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos is. Had I not already seen ""The Lobster"" (2015) (and have since seen two of his earlier Greek productions), I probably would've been completely taken aback by this one, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer."" Like its predecessor, its characters seem to occupy some alternate reality entirely dominated by egocentrism, deviant sex and magical retaliatory justice. Again, the acting is intentionally stilted, and there seem to be archaic literary references. I found the eye-for-an-eye pun of ""The Lobster"" amusing, but the source of Ancient-to-Classical Greek mythology here is quite a treat for me. At university, I took a class, not unlike the daughter in this movie, that included reading the play ""Iphigenia in Aulis"" by Euripides and, then, viewing the 1977 film adaptation ""Iphigenia"" directed by Mihalis Kakogiannis. Unfortunately, the result in ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is rather muddled.In the Greek myth, King Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter, Iphigenia, at the behest of the goddess Artemis to allow him and his troops to proceed on the warpath to fight the Trojans. In some versions, Iphigenia is replaced by a deer, hence the title of this movie. The reason I don't think the effects work as well here as they did in ""The Lobster"" is because whereas that movie took human shortcomings to absurd extremes, this one takes what was already by modern standards an absurd myth and attempts to make it modern and more ordinary. Gods are dead and replaced by doctors, and if there is a god, apparently, he's a pockmarked teenager seeking revenge for his dead father. I suppose a surgeon's wife role playing during sex as a patient under general anesthesia and a father recalling to his son the time he masturbated his father is more in line with some of the sexual perversity one finds in some Classical Greek literature, though. Yet, overall, it comes across as disjointed. If this were supposed to be a psychological thriller, it seems difficult to lure the spectator in without being able to identify with the characters--whereas this was unnecessary in the black comedy of ""The Lobster"" (and contradictory to the intent of the Greek movies). But, the stilted acting and illogical premise of the narrative works against identification. I don't think any amount of tense scoring and camera movement from distant perspectives can alleviate that--in a world where nothing is sacred.P.S. I still don't quite get the point of ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) as the film-within-the-film. Is it just because characters in both are prisoners of fate or something? I prefer the self-reflexivity of the director's prior ""Dogtooth"" (2009) and ""Alps"" (2011).",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

32,nairtejas,Capsule Review: The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,14 January 2018,"The Killing of a Sacred Deer can be called a gradually numbing experience. What it does with a cliched story and robotic characters is take you by the end of a cliff and create a scenario where it feels like it is constantly pushing you over. Colin Farrell plays a cardiologist and a father of two who develops a friendly relationship with a psychologically unstable boy (Barry Keoghan) who seems like he has a sinister plan. It is too late before Farrell's character and his wife, played by the radiant Nicole Kidman, realize that things are out of their control. Even though Farrell is a personal favorite, I have to say that it is Keoghan who transcends the screen with his nuanced performance that even has me believe that he really has issues. Also seen in Dunkirk (2017) recently, he is definitely an actor I'll be looking forward more of from. The arresting background score is one of the most appropriate and effective things I have seen in a film in a long time. You could also say that director Yorgos Lanthimos takes advantage of scary soundtracks to drive his story ahead which has shades of The Lobster (2016), a film that The Killing of a Sacred Deer has a lot of semblance with. Although the characters spewing robotic dialogues hampers the proceedings, the experience that you get from subtle references to perversion, psychological imbalance, obscure habits of the characters, and the overall progressive plot is one worth relishing. Lanthimos is known for obscure dramas and this is as good as it gets. It's almost a film that is very difficult to explain, but is very easy to comprehend. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is highly metaphorical and best suited for people who love and can understand metaphors. TN.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
33,tomgillespie2002,"A touch of Cronenberg, a hint of Bunuel, and a large dollop of Haneke",7,23 January 2018,"The films of Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos are polarising to say the least, deliberately tailored to the art-house crowd seeking something new and potentially shocking, but rarely sitting well with general audiences. Both Dogtooth and The Lobster were difficult movies to watch for many different reasons, yet what makes Lanthimos so interesting is the skill in which he makes an audience feel uneasy. His latest, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, is his most troubling picture yet, and I mean that in a good way. For the first hour of the film Lanthimos allows us to gaze through the windows of a seemingly happy middle-class family, before peeling back the layers to reveal the dysfunction beneath. Think a touch of Cronenberg, a hint of Bunuel, and a large dollop of Haneke, and your somewhere in the right area.Highly-skilled surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) has battled through alcoholism to maintain a position of respect and authority at the hospital he works. He is happily married to Anna (Nicole Kidman), and enjoys spending time with children Bob (Sunny Suljic) and his teenage daughter Kim (Raffey Cassidy). The impressively-bearded Steven also maintains a relationship with a confident young man named Martin (Barry Keoghan), walking and talking by the lake, and meeting in a diner to eat together. If it was anyone other than the subtly unnerving Martin, it would be easy to interpret their first scene together as some kind of strange first date, but it's clear they share some history together. Out of nowhere, Bob suddenly loses feeling in his legs, leaving both his father and specialists baffled at the mysterious condition. As Bob declines in health, Martin grows in confidence, dating Kim in secret and turning up unannounced at the hospital to see Steven on a daily basis.To say any more would spoil the 'joy' to be had with The Killing of a Sacred Deer, as you spend the first half of the film out of the loop and likely expecting Steven and Martin's relationship to be revealed as sexual. Lanthimos takes his time to provide answers, carefully guiding you into the blood-drained Murphy household and taking you on long walks via Steadicam down endless, cold-white hospital corridors, before unleashing a revelation that will take Steven to the brink. Not all the big questions are answered however, and Lanthimos makes sure they don't need to be. As the mystery illness worsens and others start to show similar symptoms, the film keeps the focus on the central conflict between the handsome, successful doctor and the quietly menacing teen. Farrell continues to impress as he moves away from the pretty-boy roles that dogged his early career, but Keoghan, last seen in Dunkirk earlier this year, steals the film as the delicately threatening Martin. He's rarely anything less than pleasant, but there's just something not quite right, and Keoghan underplays the role to perfection. It's a touch overlong, and a sexual encounter in a car feels unnecessary, but Lanthimos is only fine-tuning his craft, and it feels like his masterpiece is only around the corner.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
34,zkonedog,Intentionally Stilted Acting Makes This One Tough To Enjoy,3,5 March 2021,"After seeing ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" pop up on numerous lists of psychological thrillers and being intrigued by the cast, I finally gave it a watch. What I discovered, unfortunately, was a film that certainly has an intriguing nature, but was also so oddly acted that I found it almost impossible to truly enjoy.For a very basic overview, ""Deer"" sees Dr. Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) routinely visited in awkward fashion by teenaged boy Martin (Barry Keoghan), the son of a patient once under Steven's care who passed away. As the relationship progresses, viewers learn that Martin is out to extract a vendetta against the Murphy family, and slowly Steven's wife Anna (Nicole Kidman) and children Robert (Sunny Suljic) and Kim (Raffey Cassidy) are drawn into his hideous--perhaps even supernatural--scheme.I came into this movie completely unaware of plot or themes, and that is not a good recipe here. I clearly intimated that it was a metaphor film about halfway through, but for the life of me I could not determine what for. While usually excited by viewing experiences like that, this one left me more puzzled than anything.Upon further research, I learned that the story here is based on a Greek myth, and director/writer Yorgos Lanthimos is adapting it for the big screen. Learning that knowledge definitely helped with the ""intrigue"" factor, but I still can't give ""Deer"" a tick over 3 stars.The reason? I've never--perhaps in my life--seen a film featuring acting as strange as this one. At first, I thought the actors were just turning in bad performances. But after a time, it became pretty obvious that the stilted, wooden dialogue and delivery were very deliberate choices. For the life of me, however, I can't understand the reason behind such a decision. Within a viewing experience that makes almost no logical sense (at least in a literal interpretation) to begin with, also removing the opportunity for the actors to emote was the death-knell for ""Deer"" for me.Overall, I can't really recommend ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" to any audience. The plot and themes are certainly intriguing at times, especially when their origins are known, but the complete and utter lack of traditional quality acting (on purpose, no less!) renders it more ""bad"" than just ""odd"".",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Quite a different type of a film in which many people will not like this film as it isn't quite mainstream in its plot and tone.With no expectations coming into the film, the Killing of a Sacred Deer is quite an enjoyable yet disturbing watch at certain parts. With solid acting from the cast, this film is a step above the Lobster which was not funny in the slightest and more tedious.

I...I just need a moment to gather my thoughts and catch my breath. A cardiologist and his family welcome a seemingly innocent young boy to their home. What simply was one dinner has now turned into a psychological game of life and death. That's the best plot description I can give without spoiling this twisted story. The pure dementedness, the uncomfortable dialogue, the uneasy monotonous acting and even the psychologically challenging characters. Everything about this was emotively brutal, and I absolutely loved it. Loooooved it! Lanthimos has outdone himself, his directing style was clean consisting of distant static shots and gradual zoom ins, increasingly enhancing the apprehension. The concision of the dialogue was genius, everyone communicates with utter clarity with no interruptions or talking over one another. The lack of emotion and manners adds to the tormented nature of these characters. There comes a point where the father is faced with an ultimatum, and the fact he actually considers one of the options is scarily horrific. I questioned my own sanity. These characters are terrifying, and the unpredictability of the plot will keep you on edge. Kidman and Farrell were perfect, but Keoghan was exceptional. Every body movement and every word spoken was ominously edgy. The pacing dipped towards the penultimate act and a few scenes could've been cut for a tighter story. However, I was so uncomfortable watching this, as if the film was crawling under my skin, that it worked. Contemporary darkness in all its psychological glory.

""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is his and co-writer Efthymis Filippou's most challenging, sanity-testing effort yet.In previous films ""Dogtooth"" and ""The Lobster,"" Lanthimos created worlds where the traditional rules of society do not apply. That was especially the case in the monogamy dystopia of ""The Lobster."" There's nothing about the wealthy suburban world the Murphy family lives in that seems unusual, other than it being perhaps too immaculate and pristine. This ""normal"" setting makes it tougher to completely buy this film's concept compared to the others, but the filmmaking is still top-notch.Of course, Lanthimos and Filippou throw the Murphys lives into a slow, inevitable chaos. When surgeon and family head Steven (Colin Farrell) takes teenager Martin (Barry Keoghan) under his wing and introduces him to his family - wife Anna (Nicole Kidman) and children Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and Bob (Sunny Suldjic) - he's eventually faced with an impossible choice that tears at the neatly woven fabric of his family's existence.As anyone familiar with this duo's writing would expect, the script contains lots of matter-of-fact exchanges of simplistic, awkward dialogue and it serves as the foundation for the polite and tidy Murphy family. At the same time, Lanthimos' quiet, dutiful pacing is its own form of foreshadow and utter dread. After a bluntly straightforward line of dialogue sets up what's to come, the story then becomes an unraveling as Lanthimos and Filippou expose the Murphys' flaws and make them suffer.Keoghan, however, steals the show away from Farrell and Kidman. The 25-year-old has an uncanny ability to command a scene. The story assigns him a certain power that lacks tangibility, yet his presence alone manifests that power and creates true tension between him and the actors he shares scenes with, especially Farrell. Once the story shows its cards, ""Sacred Deer"" becomes a bit more divisive. Before then, it's rather plain albeit eerie, but then it goes off the rails without going off the rails, i.e. the film is very explicit about where it's going yet you just can't believe it goes there. Consequently, what begins as a suspenseful drama in the way it looks and operates turns into a fable or a Greek tragedy. If Lathnimos and Filippou had bent the rules from the beginning, ""Sacred Deer"" probably would have avoided it dropping a giant gate in the middle of their film requiring all who pass to suspend further disbelief.Consequently, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" pushes us to explore human psychology in ways we couldn't dare to imagine, and it wields a certain honest if not cynical and cold humor. Yet even when this script most calls for wild, fervent drama and emotion, Lanthimos and Filippou continue along at their preferred methodical, calculated pace. Their reasoning perhaps defies reason and it will drive some emotionally inclined viewers mad, but to their credit, they continue to push. So while ""Sacred Deer"" is a tougher film to swallow, the rigor and thought process behind Lanthimos' films continues to function at a high level.~Steven CThanks for reading!

40,paul-allaer,Off-center psychological family drama is not for everyone (and certainly not for anyone in a hurry),8,5 November 2017,"""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017 release; 119 min.) brings the story of Steven and his family. As the movie opens, with a gruesome open heart surgery scene, we get to know Steven, a heart surgeon, and his colleague, an anesthesiologist. Ne Steven meets up with Martin, a 16 yr. old boy whom Steven seems to be mentoring. After that we get to know Steven's family over dinner: his wife Anna, also a doctor, and his kids, 14 yr. old Kim and her younger brother Bob. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to reveal more of the plot would surely spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Greek writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos, whose previous movies (2015's The Lobtser, 2011's Alps, and 2009's Dogtooth) have established his reputation as a daring, if off-center, movie maker. Here he goes in a seemingly very different direction than any of these previous movies, namely how a 16 yr. old boy manages to exercise a stronghold over Steven's family in ways that are difficult to understand (sorry, can't say more so as not to spoil). This is a psychological family drama unlike anything else you've ever seen. Beware: the movie is slow-paced on purpose and it takes a good 45 min. before we finally start to understand what is about to unfold. There are plenty of outstanding acting performances, including from Colin Farrell (who also starred in The Lobster) and Nicole Kidman (as the ice-cold wife/doctor). It wasn't until the credits rolled that I realized Martin's mother was played by Alicia Silverstone, now in her 40s if you can believe it. But the best performance of all is by Barry Keoghan (playing Martin), whom we saw earlier this summer in Dunkirk. What a talent that guy is! And for us Cincinnatians, the movie, shot entirely in Cincinnati, brings an extra layer of fun to recognize the many local settings (Christ Hospital's Brain and Spine Center, the Hilton's Hall of Mirrors, the Blu Jay in Northside, downtown's Red Fox Grill, etc., etc.).""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" opened this weekend at my local-art house theater here in Cincinnati (on 2 screes, no less), and I Couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, somewhat to my surprise. In discussing this after the movie my friends and I felt it probably was due more to the film having been shot in Cincinnati than anything else. Bottom line is this: ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare and not for anyone. I for one happen to enjoy this movie a lot, perhaps because of its weirdness. The best advice I can give is this: if you liked ""The Lobster"", I'd encourage you to check this one out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
41,jtindahouse,Original and brilliant,9,16 February 2018,"After watching 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' I asked myself whether I would recommend this film to people or not? I absolutely loved it, but I could see people absolutely hating it as well. It's one of those very polarising types of films. The first thing you'll notice very quickly in the film is that it has a very unique style. The characters converse in a bizarre fashion and say very odd and unexpected things with complete normality. The story is also told in a unique way. The audience aren't let in on things like we usually are. We keep asking ourselves when the answers will come, and in most cases they never do. It's certainly a film for people who like to think, that much is for sure.Style aside, I found the storyline compelling. The scenario that is set up is a perfect setting for a film. There's so much to work around for the characters, and this is explored excellently. The whole cast also give superb performances. Nicole Kidman in articular shows she still has the chops to act with the best. Barry Keoghan was brilliant too and was probably the one who took most naturally to the bizarre side of the characters that they were asked to portray. 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' is utterly original and utterly brilliant in my opinion. If someone told me they hated it I wouldn't be angry at them, because I think I could understand that point of view. For me though this is good as film making gets.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

How this kid was able to hold such a huge price that he felt was owed cause of his father's death I never fully understood.Feel the movie thought too much of itself. Looks like the director who also director the Lobster with Colin Farrell got too big for his bridges.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
43,billcr12,Just Plain Weird,5,27 December 2017,"I watched this based on Yorgos Lanthimo's previous movie, The Lobster, which also starred Colin Farrell. I had that film as one of my best of 2015. Lanthimo's also wrote and directed Dogtooth, which I thought was strange but good. Sacred Deer goes beyond the beyond, as Farrell and his wife, played by Nicole Kidman, are medical doctors with a son and a daughter. Farrell is a heart surgeon who has lost one of his patients during an operation. Barry Keoghan is the son of the dead patient. He holds Farrell personally responsible for his father's death. suddenly, the doc's kids begin to experience some fairly nasty physical ailments. Keoghan's character has transformed into a Carrie White (Stephen King) type of individual. Farrell is given a Sophie's choice type of deal and it all goes down hill rather quickly. This is not a Disney, feel good about life kind of film, and so if you are not in a positive mood to begin with, avoid Sacred Deer at all costs. It might be the last film you see before jumping off of a bridge.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
44,jadavix,The best Lanthimos yet,8,10 February 2018,"With ""Dogtooth"", Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos made a disturbingly realistic arthouse film out of a however unlikely situation. With ""The Lobster"", he completely abandoned realism with a situation less unlikely than impossible; however, I believe the emotions and questions it was supposed to evince were intended as recognizable to the viewer.With ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"", Lanthimos has finally struck a balance, dealing with an unbelievable situation without getting bogged down in it, and allowing the realness to come to the forefront.Much of the movie reminded me of ""The Seventh Continent"", a typically confrontational film by the hyper-realistic Michael Haneke. At first the manner the characters speak seems deliberately stilted; after a while it dawns on you that there is something wrong with this family, even before their relationship with an outsider turns sinister.""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" has shades of a horror film in it, but Lanthimos, I don't think, isn't interested in horror itself. He's interested in the feelings that come after the horror, and that precede it.Lastly, I will say that Colin Farrell and Yorgos Lanthimos are turning out to have the most interesting actor/director relationship currently going. I hope and pray they will continue to work together; this was their second outing. I want more.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
45,iquine,Revenge Delivered Nonchalantly,9,6 July 2018,"(Flash Review)It'd be an understatement to say this is not a lazy Sunday movie. It opens with an aggressive first scene accompanied by an unusual and unexpected music score. Then you are inserted into a normal looking world with characters who are typical yet have a very peculiar way of interacting with each other. Especially, how frank they are about topics that aren't normally discussed in such a manner. Anyway, the story is about a very persistent and obsessive boy attempting to befriend a doctor who is married with two kids. He does so successfully in such a manner he'd be invited over for tea and crumpets. Previously you learn the doctor operated on the boy's father and the results were grave; avoidable mistakes are in play. With a calm and creepy demeanor, the boy soon forces the doctor to make a horrific decision. To what degree will the boy take his revenge? Will the doctor have him apprehended? The boy actor adds just the right amount of eeriness to his rather normal character and does an excellent job. Cinematically, the film has striking scene framing, camera movements, a peculiar score and sound effects that not only command your attention but TAKE it! The heaviness of the doctor's predicament becomes heftier pressure as the story builds. This is a very compelling viewing. If you liked The Lobster, this is better; same director, same eccentricities.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

As the story progresses, the relationship takes a turn from the slightly weird to the out & out bizarre. Claiming the doctor had killed his father, the son evokes revenge on his family where they'll get sick, lose their ability to walk & eat & then die painfully. What for me felt akin to Michael Haneke's Cache, whereby a long ago crime comes back to haunt the perpetrator, Deer's story continues to open up like the layers of a sickly onion.

One thing that is becoming apparent is while the United States becomes obsessed with franchises and never ending stories, foreign filmmakers are picking up the slack and making actual self contained ""stories.""For one thing, even though we know very little about Steven we know he has a dark past. He only needed a few lines and you learned his entire past, similar to Jack Nicholson in Chinatown. In fact, all of the characters have very little explained back story, but those little nuances are easy to figure out.The most compelling aspect of the film is how the battle of wills ultimately plays out. Steven is put into a horrendous position and everyone-and I mean everyone-plays their angles. Most American directors wouldn't have the guts to do something like this. When all is said and done, the ending is a massive gut punch.Watch this film if you desire a story that is dense, dark, and takes you into the furthest reaches of the human psyche.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
51,questl-18592,The Killing of a Sacred Text,4,3 January 2021,"Oh the things I'd heard of this movie. The way people have bickered back and forth about it's greatness, or lack thereof. Obviously, with such turmoil surrounding it, I had to check it out and all I can really think is that this director may not be quite on my wavelength. Lanthimos is clearly talented. He has such a skilled deft hand with the camera, crafting shots that are ponderous and purposefully drawn out. He can illicit a response just with a prolonged shot and that's really something spectacular. The man also really excels at crafting a sense of awkward discomfort meant to suit the narrative and keep the audience enthralled. He did it in The Lobster and he did it here.All that probably seems like high praise for a movie that I'm giving an unfavorable grade to but that's because from a strictly technical sense, I think Lanthimos is really exceptional. My problem is with his dialogue. In both this and The Lobster he employs this very wooden, robotic verbage that feels as though he fed a script to a computer and had Siri and Alexa read it back. It's so monotone and dry and weird that it just feels clunky and awkward to me. While the concepts are terribly intriguing and the cinematography is exceptional the performances and dialogue are just so devoid of emotion that it makes it hard for me to really invest in anything that's happening. So, while it is strong in logos, there is an all but complete lack of pathos and that's a hard hurdle to jump. When the credits roll I feel as though I watched something that was brilliant but clunky, awkward and unsatisfying.I'd really love to see a movie by Lanthimos that was written by someone with a little more passion and emotion, someone who could really put excitement into things. A Sorkin or Tarantino mash-up with him could be spectacular and I would race to see something like that. Until then, I have these films. They're technically proficient but devoid of something more and that really hurts it. I find myself getting dejected, bored and just groaning a bit as I watch and that is compounded by the fact that there is obviously skill here, it's just not well rounded enough to really check all the boxes. I want to like this more but just can't bring myself to do it.I can't even properly recommend this because I think this is a hard pass for the casual movie watcher. Film buffs and movie nerds (as I like to consider myself) should give it a shot just for the experience of it but beyond that I don't really know that I can proclaim this to be must see viewing or even really worth going out of your way for. It's weird, and if that's appealing to you then it might be worth checking out but beyond that it's just hard to recommend this over some other great films. If you are going to check it out, as of this moment it's available to stream on Netflix, I'd watch it there before spending any money on this.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
52,valleyjohn,I loved this,9,19 December 2017,"Yorgos Lanthimos is a really interesting director. Previous films include the very unorthodox Dogtooth & Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer is very much in the same mould but for me this is his best work to date.
This is a psychological thriller about a surgeon who is forced to make an unthinkable sacrifice when a teenage boy from his past gives him an ultimatum. His life starts to fall apart when he realises he must pay for his past mistakes.
When you start to watch this the first thing that hits you is the dialogue and the way the actors perform it. It's very monotone , robotic , almost emotionless . This is a group of people that acts unlike any other and it's mesmerising to watch. The acting is great. Colin Farrell , Barry Keoghan and Raffey Cassidy are superb and Keoghan takes creepy to a new level . 
This is based on a Greek mythology story about retribution and reminds me a lot of Michael Haneke's Funny Games. It's one of those films that sticks in your brain for a long while after watching it . It leaves you with lot's of questions ( in a good way) and the answers are pretty obvious when you sit and think about it.Highly Recommended.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
53,truemythmedia,Surreal and Fascinating,10,11 September 2019,"As I studied theology in my early and mid twenties, I would run across questions like these all the time. What would you do if a person who wasn't a Christian came forward for communion? What if God had decided to send Christ during the time of Abraham, instead of Pontius Pilate? What if you were hiding Jews and the Nazis asked if you were hiding anyone?These are the sorts of questions that this film takes seriously. What if you had to kill your wife or one of your children in order to save the other two?Steven, presented to us sublimely by Colin Farrell (""In Bruges""), wrestles with this question like a tortured Sisyphus, always coming up with ideas only to have them come to naught. Repeat until despair settles in.The rest of the cast, Nicole Kidman (""Eyes Wide Shut""), Sunny Suljic (""mid90s""), and Raffey Cassidy (""Vox Lux"") perform brilliantly, but the real stand out for me was Barry Keoghan (""Dunkirk,"" ""American Animals"".) If you aren't watching this actor's career, you are making a mistake.Barry's character, Martin, is interested in Steven's medical practice so Steven takes him under his wing, even presenting him with gifts. Martin is an odd duck, however, obsessed with Steven's body and how his own might be similar or dissimilar, seemingly trying to hook his mother up with Steven, and ultimately presenting Steven with the most horrible decision.In many ways, Martin seems more interested in having Steven as a father than a mentor (not surprisingly as revelations emerge) and when these efforts are rejected, he lashes out with an ultimatum. At times, it feels like Martin is in control over the diseases that wreak havoc on the small family but at others, it seems like it is not a think he has agency over, no matter what Steven believes.This character is wonderfully enigmatic and complicated making him feel like a stand in for God, the Devil, all manner of impish tricksters, and on top of it all, broken innocence.These are the main focus of KOASD, though I was not able to see it at first. I'm glad I re-watched it and feel that if you dismissed this as Yorgos Lanthimos' lesser film, you should really give it another shot. If you haven't seen it, now is the time to do it, with his latest film ""The Favourite"" being nominated for Best Picture. Just, be ready for something a little different from his comedically motivated films.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

55,Reviews_of_the_Dead,An Uncomfortable Arthouse Film,8,18 April 2020,"This was a film that I heard about through podcasts and I was intrigued to check it out. I knew a few different things that I heard that the movie was odd and that was really about it as I avoided walkthrough reviews and spoilers. The synopsis for this film is Steven (Colin Farrell), a charismatic surgeon, is forced to make an unthinkable sacrifice after his life starts to fall apart, when the behavior of a teenage boy he has taken under his wing turns sinister.Much like the synopsis states, we're following Steven Murphy. We see him interact with Matthew Williams (Bill Camp) who is an anesthesiologist. From there he goes to a diner to meet with Martin (Barry Keoghan). Martin is late, but Steven doesn't seem to mind. Martin grabs some food and they chat. The two drive to the river where they talk about different subjects and Steven gives him a gift.We also get to meet Steven's family, which thus far he has kept Martin from. Steven is married to Anna (Nicole Kidman) who I believe is an eye doctor and runs her own clinic. He has a daughter who is Kim (Raffey Cassidy) who is into choir. I got the feeling Steven prefers her to his son, Bob (Sunny Suljic), who is younger. He is a bit defiant toward his father's wishes.Steven then invites Martin over for dinner. He brings flowers for Anna and gifts to the two children. Steven really wants him to spend time with Bob, but he is attracted to Kim and she feels the same toward him. From here though, Martin invites Steven over for dinner. He tries to decline pretty much coerces him to come. He wants him to stay and watch a movie, but when he goes to bed, Martin's Mother (Alicia Silverstone) comes on to him. Steven rebuffs the attempts and then tries to distance himself from Martin.Something that should be pointed out, there's a reveal that Steven was to perform a procedure on Martin's father. It was considered pretty routine, but the man died. Steven seems to feel guilt for what happened, hence why he's reaching out.Things take a turn though when Martin warns him what is going to happen to his family. They will lose the feeling in their limbs and no longer able to walk. They then will refuse food followed by their eyes bleeding which will result in death. In order to stop this from killing everyone, the ultimate sacrifice will need to be made. Steven is resistant to believe and once things start to happen, Anna gets involved and decisions are made, some of which are unimaginable.The first thing I really need to lead off here with is that this is an odd movie. I know many were talking about the way people talk and I tend to agree, it feels like it is written by someone where English is not their first language. It does give me a vibe of a movie where we're seeing a classic tale, something like a Greek or Roman myth that is playing out in modern times. It gives me an uncomfortable feeling for sure.Now I normally stick with fleshing out my ideas with the story, but since I've already leaned into the eerie and uncomfortable feeling that I get, I want to talk about the soundtrack of this movie. I watched it on Netflix, with the subtitles on, and they would legit state the feel of the music. It is dead on. There were a few times where my anxiety went way up and a lot this was the score used. It is louder in some places to the point where you can't hear the characters talking, but that is the point. It isn't important to hear them, but you're given the feel of those scenes.Back to the story though, I did read that this is based off of the 'Iphigenia in Aulis' by Euripides, who was a Greek if the memory serves. I'm not familiar with this, but I found it interesting that Kim actually wrote an essay on it that is referenced by her principal to Steven. I feel this is an interesting meta aspect to the film. Now since I'm not familiar with this work, I had to look this up after the fact, but I will say that when I heard it in the scheme of the movie, I thought there was a connection for sure.The last thing I want to go over before moving on is that I wondered what the title had to do with the movie. It makes sense when Martin tells the rules to Steven and then it clicked home. There's a supernatural angle here that the teen is getting revenge on Steven for allowing his father to die. What I like about this though, he doesn't seem malicious in his intent, despite the hurting that is deep inside. He does really seem to like Steven. Steven claims to Anna that Martin has something wrong mentally, which I somewhat agree with. There's something off about the boy. This is where there's a slight detriment with how the dialogue is done as that could be where I'm feeling this from. Regardless, I do think that the trauma of what happened to him has effected Martin so deeply that he is seeking his revenge.Shifting over to the pacing, this movie drags, but not necessarily in a bad way. I think a good portion of this is the uncomfortable feeling I have throughout it. The movie does run just over 2 hours long. I'm not going to lie, I checked to see how far I was into this about 30 minutes in and then felt another sense of dread coming over me. I never got bored though, I do want to point that out. This is really a slow-burn and has art-house flair to it for sure. I did like the ending and the bleakness of where things ended up. I just think there was some that could have been trimmed to tighten it up.That will take me to the acting, which I thought was good across the board. Farrell is an interesting actor to me as for whatever reason, I don't really care for him, but I can't really think of a bad role he's done. I think that he does really well at playing this arrogant doctor who is refusing to take responsibility until he's faced with the most difficult decision of his life. Keoghan is amazing as well. There's something not quite right about him that we get from the beginning. Socially he's awkward. This is compounded by how the script is written, but I can still tell despite that. Kidman is really good as well, especially the lengths she'll go as the counterpoint to her husband. I thought that Suljic and Cassidy are solid as well. They do and offer their opinion on things that make it more uncomfortable. On top of that, we see Cassidy in her underwear and that made it even worse for me. Silverstone as Martin's mother is fine in the cameo along with Camp and the rest of the cast. We also get to see Kidman nude. She still looks great for her age by the way.The last thing to go over would be the effects of the movie. There's not a lot until the effects that Martin says will happen. We actually get to the point where Bob's eyes are bleeding and it looked quite real to be honest. Both him and Kim performance when their legs aren't working was good. I also thought that using actual footage from surgeries was a nice touch to the sense of realism. On top of that, the look of the film helps to add to the eerie feel along with some really good cinematography as well.Now with that said, this is an intriguing film that I can't recommend to everyone. I really like the allegorical tale that we're getting here of a difficult decision one man has to make in punishment of something that he did. When I say difficult, I mean pretty much impossible. The acting is good across the board in bringing this to life. The effects and how the movie was shot are both solid as well. The soundtrack is one of my favorite parts with how it made me feel. I do feel the movie could have been trimmed a bit, as it does run a bit long. The bleak ending though was on point and I still really enjoyed this movie overall. I find it to be good, but again, it is artsy and if you don't like these, avoid this as I don't think this is for you. It is from A24, so if you like their films, you know the type of vibe for this depressing movie.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

57,davidmvining,"Oddness, on purpose",7,21 November 2019,"Yes, this movie is weird, and it's entirely intentional.Yorgos Lanthimos is an interesting Greek director who's been making English language films for a few years. The Lobster is so dry and oddball that I ended up kind of loving it. The Favourite I ended up loving because it was able to most effectively balance its weirdness with its characters (perhaps because he didn't actually write this script as opposed to everything else he's directed).The Killing of A Sacred Deer is the movie he made in between the two listed above, and I think it might be the weakest of the three. Good instead of very good, that is.So, let me talk about the weirdness. Everything about this movie feels stilted and mannered. It's off putting, especially at the beginning when you're trying to figure out what on earth the movie actually is. As the story progresses, though, it's easy to see the nefarious undercurrents running through every scene. We spend the first half of the movie trying to figure out where this unease originates from, and the fact that everyone is delivering unnatural dialogue unnaturally heightens the feeling.I've seen so many complaints of unnatural dialogue over the years. The one example strongest in my mind is around the movie Juno. The complaints of the mannered way in which characters spoke seemed to be a mask for complaints about the rest of the movie that people couldn't figure out how to express, so they picked on the dialogue. I'm not saying that criticism of such writing is invalid or always misdirected, but that did seem to be the trend I noticed and continue to notice in such criticisms. Just because dialogue isn't reflective of how people actually speak (I like to think of Mamet), that doesn't mean that the dialogue is a failure. Oftentimes, it's that way for a reason.Anyway, back to the movie. The sense of unease that permeates the film is great, and I kind of loved the film for about the first three-quarters. However, once the plot began to unravel and resolve, I felt like the movie lost some of its edge. When the main character is presented with his great moral choice (and his blackly comedic method for resolving it), I felt more removed from the choice than I should have. The build up is what works best in this movie, while the resolution just simply doesn't gel as well.Still, the movie's an odd but entertaining little thriller.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
58,jadepietro,It's All Greek to Me,4,11 November 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆ out of 5 stars) GRADE: C- THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A contrived updating of a family in crisis that fails due to bad writing and absurd situations.SYNOPSIS: Using Greek mythology as its source, a father must make an ultimate sacrifice.JIM'S REVIEW: Oh, those Greeks and their tragedies! They love to wallow in guilt and despair. That avant-garde wonder boy, Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, is upon us with his latest sojourn into absurd irony, The Sacred Killing of a Sacred Deer. His independent film tries to connect the legend of Iphigenia with a modern day family (a lofty goal), and fails miserably, despite the mostly positive reviews that this movie is garnering. (For those unaware with that mythological story-line, let me digress: King Agamemnon is punished by the vengeful goddess, Artemis, for accidentally killing a deer. To appease the gods, he must choose to sacrifice his eldest daughter, Iphigenia, to end his curse.)￼This allegorical film unfolds, ever so slowly, in its tale of crime and punishment. Dr. Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) befriends a confused teenage boy named Martin (Barry Keoghan). His motive and also Martin's behavior are bizarre from the start and we learn more of their true connection about a half hour into the film when the plot finally kicks in. No spoilers here, although it is quite tempting to reveal some details if that will persuade you to avoid this Trojan Horse. (But I resist, nevertheless.)Up to this point, moviegoers suffer more than the film's poorly drawn characters. Enduring the flattest of line readings and listening to the endless banalities spoken in the most unbelievable dialog one could ever experience in any motion picture, the film piles on more surreal circumstances with the good doctor as his family's health conditions worsen, with no possible explanation given. Now let me share a few prime examples of the film's bons mots:""If you don't stop playing games, I will shave your head and make you eat your hair. I mean it. I will make you eat your hair.""""I won't let you leave until you try my tarts.""""Our children are dying, and yes, I can make you some mashed potatoes.""Definitely a food fetish somewhere, but let's move on...￼It should be noted that the cast performs their roles with some semblance of credibility. Mr. Farrell, a talented actor who is unafraid to take risks, is misdirected to act cold and emotionless for most of the film. It creates an unreal tone that undercuts the dramatic potential of his character and the story itself. The actor finally is allowed to react in the third act and he is most effective. Mr. Keoghan is impressive and supplies the perfect foil as a nerdy yet menacing avenger. Nicole Kidman adds depth to a standard grieving mother part. As their children, Raffey Cassidy and Sunny Suljic give respectable performance from the inanity they are handed by the director and his co-writer, Efthymis Filippou. But it is really Mr. Lanthimos who disappoints with his words and actions. (However, he does wisely lets cinematographer, Thimios Bakatakis aim his camera and create some strong visual images that almost hide the film's flaws...almost.)￼Metaphors and heavy-handed symbolism runs rampant amid conversation about menstruation, expensive watches, and donuts. Gratuitous nudity is also thrown in as a wake-up call for any dozing members of the audience. (Lest we question this already wonky plot and the direct inspiration of Iphigenia, the director includes a scene mentioning the A+ grade Kim earned from her report on that very topic...subtle, it's not.) All of this leads to a unsatisfying climax and a very dramatic but polarizing denouncement.￼That said, let me now succinctly go into the C- grade this film earned from this reviewer. (Alas, if only Kim wrote the screenplay as well!) The film has adequate production values, serviceable direction, very bad dialog, a far-fetched plot, and a fine cast that is trapped in a laughable script. ￼Yes, sacrifices will be made, but mostly by the movie-going audience as they waste their precious time and hard-earned money on this dud. The Sacred Killing of a Deer is intellectually and emotionally inert. As revenge thrillers go, this artsy-fartsy misfire proves that the gods (and the filmmakers) must be crazy.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

61,bkrauser-81-311064,"Ambiguous Yet Clear in Thought, Beautiful Yet Ugly, Bizarre Yet Superb",8,15 November 2017,"A Surgeon's guilt leads him to mentor the teen son of a deceased patient. After weeks of diner lunches and awkward afternoon walks along the riverside, Steven (Farrell), our duplicitous leading man finds that Martin (Keoghan) has some seriously sinister plans in-store for him and his young family; a plan that ultimately puts Steven in an impossible excruciating moral dilemma.This is essentially the plot The Killing of a Sacred Deer, the latest mad experiment concocted by the same warped mind that gave you the similarly themed Dogtooth (2009) and the deadpan black comedy The Lobster (2015). But lest you've seen either of those films, nothing can really prepare you for what this twisted little romp is really about and how this film goes about achieving its own ambitions. Director Yorgos Lanthimos isn't just an idiosyncratic art-house director with a wild hair for film-school suspense. No this guy is a cinematic mad scientist who takes all things familiar and makes them wholly unfamiliar by breaking everything down to the bare essentials.What do I mean by this? Well for one the story doesn't ever feel the need to explain itself. In an interview famed director Alfred Hitchcock was once asked why the characters in his films never call the police. His answer was, ""Because it's boring."" Lanthimos seems to be taking that same approach not only for the crime elements of the story but the very mechanisms that make the story possible. It is never explained (nor does it need to be) how Martin goes about doing what he does. The only logic that counts exists within Martin's fractured state of mind; and we just have to live with whatever twisted logic happens to be exposed by the frame at the time.While the story is very much in the vein of Hitchcock, the cinematography just screams Kubrickian other-worldliness. Everything is shot with a streamline economy so that every scene, every character, every plot point is tailor made for maximum ambiguity while never straining the limits of a traditional narrative. Yet despite its perfection in relaying information and theme, every frame and gently sweeping pan serves to overwhelm the viewer with a near constant feeling of unease. How much unease? Well the film literally starts with an un-obscured view of open-heart surgery. Whatever feeling you're liable to have while watching something like that (shock, disgust, anxiety, etc.) is going to be your default for two hours so buckle up.In comparison to other outstanding horror films released this year, Sacred Deer certainly holds its own - even if the spirit of its horror is less Get Out (2017), or Jigsaw (2017) and more Werner Herzog oppressively reading Grimm Fairy tales. Yet in comparison to Lanthimo's other works, Sacred Deer feels like it doesn't have that same immutable fearlessness. That may have less to do with the film itself and more to do with the genre. The Lobster may have dabbled in some horror tropes but it was first and foremost a black satire on romantic love. Our expectations were naturally pretty limited in regards to ""how far"" they're willing to go with the premise. Thus when it really did ""go that far"" the wickedness of the satire felt all that more dangerous. Any satire of familial love on the part of Sacred Deer is played less with a sense of wickedness and more with a sense of dread. It still feels dangerous, but only to the extent the extent of bodily harm.Thankfully the cast are perfectly suited for finding the flawed, ugly and human parts to their off-putting characters. Farrell is at his subdued, disquieted best as a complacent everyman suddenly put into a lose-lose scenario. Nicole Kidman, Sunny Suljic and especially the brooding Raffey Cassidy have between them all the cunning instincts needed to make their characters sympathetic while harboring the animosities needed to make the situation believable.The real standout however is Barry Keoghan who takes what would have otherwise been a one-note Machiavelli and elevates him to the level of an uncaring God. His malevolence is scary not only because of his forceful actions and their inherent power imbalance but because there's nonchalance in everything he does. There's a void where his empathy and moral compass should be. So to compensate, he adapts a sense of justice where extreme measures are regular and they're seemingly the most human thing about him.Keoghan's abrasive performance alone is definitely worth the admission price for horror fans, film fans and those already familiar with Lanthimos's unique approach to storytelling. Combined with the film's fable-like clarity of thought and this thing suddenly becomes a worthy piece of art crying to be studied and argued about for years. But for casual audiences, Sacred Deer may prove too outwardly bizarre and too much of a dialectic gut-punch to walk away satisfied. Which is a shame because I think Lanthimos is actually aiming for the unwitting who settled for whatever just started at the cinemas because Ragnarok sold out.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
62,Abdulxoxo,Unconventional,7,19 July 2021,"The way this movie is structured was brilliant. Slowly we'd be fed nuggets of information which revealed things about the characters and why certain things were happening. There was a build up of tension throughout the movie that would make one squirm as they watch the plot develop. The way the film was shot added a lot to the feel of the movie. The use of corridors and various angles had such a great effect. The way the camera stalked the characters went from unsettling to outright creepy. Great cinematography. Without a doubt however, the thing that had the biggest impact was the score. The use of strings and drums in particular was outstanding. From beginning to end, the eeriness of the score and the way it complimented events in the movie, adding immensely to the intensity. The main cast were all really good. Farrell plays a very serious and emotionally awkward character. His wife, Anna, is more emotional, but in a very controlled way. Her character has to deal with some horrible situations and does so with so much strength. The boy Martin was a difficult character to work out. He would talk very politely and with a childish innocence; but there was something about him that was utterly terrifying. Farrell, Kidman and Keoghan were all terrific in these unusual roles. On to the downsides with the movie, Firstly the style of speech that Lanthimos makes his characters use is really frustrating. It's difficult to describe but it's extremely dead pan, almost robotic at times. It's almost as if an alien has come down and is trying to imitate human speech, but it just sounds wrong. I can't imagine any real person that would talk with a speech pattern like any of those characters. Lanthimos should really let his actors just talk normally. Another problem with this film is that there were too many unanswered questions. The conclusion to this movie was shocking; and as a result there would have been extreme consequences. However, life seemed to carry on in a way that it just couldn't have which was really annoying. All things considered, despite the few disappointments, on the whole the film has more positives than negatives.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

66,maurice_yacowar,The Killing of a Sacred Deer Review,10,8 November 2017,"It takes a Greek director — Yorgos Lanthimos — to revive the elemental power of Greek tragedy in a modern setting. Because this is such a primal story it could be the most powerful and disturbing film of the year. The characters speak in a kind of dead tone, usually on banal matters (like how waterproof a watch is). The music alternates eerie silences with harsh nerve-wracking strings and drums. Shots of surgery and blood churn the stomach. The widescreen settings have an amphitheatrical stretch. Alone among recent films, it sends you out in catharsis — ""calm of mind, all passion spent."" This film releases you, drained. A man's misdeed brings down a curse upon his entire house that only his own immense sacrifice can expiate. That's the Greek tragedy, beside which our mundane stories of simple guilt, rationalization, mercy, forgiveness, and even human justice — the business of cops and courts — dwindle into insignificance. This primitive drama involves a heart surgeon Steven Murphy and his ophthalmologist wife Anna. That is, the elemental force erupts in the seat of modern science, rationalism, humanity. The professional curers are profoundly afflicted. Their reason is helpless, irrelevant, once the old pagan gods have been stirred to ire. Dr Murphy was at least tipsy when his bungled surgery cost a man's life. Murphy has not openly accepted responsibility or expressed his guilt. But he did attend the man's funeral and stop drinking altogether. He also befriended the man's orphaned son Martin, whom he buys gifts and offers friendship as a sop to confronting his own guilt on any deeper level. Now Martin swells from orphaned son into preternatural agent of vengeance. For his father's death has proved a curse on his house too. He and his mother — in different ways — crave Dr Murphy to replace the dead man in their lives: ""My mom's attracted to you. She's got a great body."" This thuggish kid has an other-worldly understanding. He has become the seer, the oracle who alone fathoms the root cause of the Murphy curse and its resolution. If Murphy doesn't kill one of his children, his entire family will die. First they are paralyzed, deprived of appetite and will, then their eyes erupt in Oedipusian bleed, then they die. Of course these modern sophisticates deny this savage myth. Murphy in particular blames Martin for the curse he has only reported. Daughter Kim understands, because she wrote a paper on Iphygenia, Agamemnon's daughter whom he has to sacrifice to atone for having killed a sacred deer. Kim is attracted to Martin and offers herself to him. In him she senses a worldliness apart from the others. Having initially assumed kid brother Bob would go (""Can I have your MP3 when you die?) she then volunteers to be Dr Murphy's sacrifice. She knows the story.The Murphys' life is characterized by a kind of torpor. No-one has any zest for anything. The conversations are banal and wary. Dr Murphy and then Kim report her first period as if it were a head cold. All sense of the primeval has been lost. Anna feigns total anesthesia for her sex with her husband. His friend and anesthesiologist charges Anna a hand job for info. Facing the curse Steven tries coaxing, coercion, threats, even physical violence and the threat of murder, to shake the seer off his vision. Steven turns to a school counsellor for advice on which child to pick. Anna twigs to their predicament: ""Our children are dying, but yes. I can make you mashed potatoes."" She marshals the will to free Martin from her husband's futile abuse. Indeed both the doctor and the anesthesiologist each blame the other for failures in the operating room. This is the modern world with advanced science and culture but with stupefied emotions and a shallow sense of responsibility. Dr Murphy forbids smoking in the house, but his wife and daughter smoke outside. Martin accepts his recent addiction with the same resignation he seems to have accepted as his role of messenger from the gods, to bring Murphy to their harsh justice. This elemental tragedy is the prophet director's harsh judgment on a world that evades its guilt and responsibility by suspending all conscience, all sense of a higher purpose than the mundane and worldly.

The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror masterpiece. It came and went, without a peep from filmgoers. I admit, this cerebral, disturbing piece is not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but in terms of it's visual design and pacing, it's Lathimos's finest hour. This is a medical psychological thriller that leaves a strong taste in your mouth. The first shot is a slow zoom out of a failed open heart surgery. Lathimos, right from the beginning, assaults your comfort zone. The cinematography throughout is a direct nod to Stanley Kubrick, most notably, his work in The Shining. Every scene here is designed to look distorted and frightening, despite depicting minimal locations. Matched are chilling performances by Collin Farrell and Nicole Kidman. It's message seems to be the unintended consequences of Karma and how the human mind can bring about unforeseen illnesses psychosomatically. In that sense, this film is more resonant today than ever before. Maybe this isn't the kind of film you'd want to watch right now, but watch it soon you must.

From Colin Farrell's dead delivery, to the creative and completely absurd nature of storytelling. So when I heard about  Yorgos Lanthimos making another film with Farrell involved, I was game. I went in completely blind; not knowing a single thing about the film. While not as strong as the Lobster, the film is unique in its own right and is one that still leaves an imprint.The film is about Steven Murphy (Farrell) a surgeon who seems to be involved with a boy named Martin. Their relationship is weird and we don't really know what to think until we find out the vengeful reason for their acquaintance. Martin's father died on the operating table due to Murphy's negligence and in return he must kill one member of his family or face the consequence of the death of his wife and two kids all together. His family go through three stages; paralysis in the legs, extreme loss of appetite, and then bleeding from the eyes which results in death.As you can tell, the plot is fairly absurd, rivaling itself with that of The Lobster. The dialogue delivery has that similar monotone, deadpan nature as that of The Lobster. The score is overbearing and jarring at times. The film is dark and yet gorgeously filmed. The dialogue and a few of the characters are idiosyncratic and thus you can find bits of humor in some of the situations. Lanthimos brings forth another wild, weird, and creative entity. I don't think its as strong as The Lobster was but its still nice to see how things unfold in The Killing of a Sacred Deer.

75,kjproulx,"Strange, Unique, and Incredibly Divisive",8,4 February 2018,"When it comes to taste in film, everything is subjective, everyone knows that. Whether a twisted film impresses you on an emotional level due to the uniqueness of it, or a drama doesn't work for you based on the acting, everyone is entitled to their opinion. I felt the need to state that after my viewing of The Killing of a Sacred Deer, because this is a film that will truly make people not see another movie for weeks or just simply turn it off after the very first frame (I'm not exaggerating). On the other hand, this is a very different film from most of the content out there today, so huge fans of cinema will be able to invest themselves in this insane ride of a movie. While I caution to take any of my negatives or positives with a very large grain of salt, here's why I believe The Killing of a Sacred Deer is an impressive movie, even though I found myself infuriated throughout the majority of its duration.Steve (a surgeon at a hospital) has taken young Martin under his wing due to the fact that he has a desire to pursue health care. Very quickly devolving into an evil plot, Steve discovers that his entire family is taken ill. For unknown reasons, he is faced with some very tough decisions that may result in some horrific imagery. Without ruining the movie, that's about all I can say, and while the premise itself seems bizarre and twisted, I can assure you the movie itself is even more so, so do with that information what you will. This film isn't for the faint of heart as I mentioned before, so let's dive into why that may be.From literally watching open heart surgery, to seeing children with bleeding eyes, to see cheating wives and husbands, to even relating to today's sexual abuse scandals in many more ways than one, this is a film that will probably scar some viewers in many more ways than one. With the addition that it's a fairly slow moving film, I can see many viewers complaining about this picture and stirring up controversy. The only reason that no real controversy has been brought up yet is probably that it went under the radar. Not really garnering the attention that it may or may not have deserved, I can sadly say this film probably needs to be found by the hardcore film fans instead of brought into the public eye.In terms of originality, there's no denying that writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos has what it takes to tell some incredible stories. While I haven't gone back to watch his earliest works, his work on The Lobster made it one of my favorite films of 2015. Sadly, I can't say the same praise about The Killing of a Sacred Deer, but I can once again commend him for being original. Nobody makes movies quite like he does so that deserves some recognition. The strange and unique ways that he approaches storytelling fascinates me and that's more than I can say about most filmmakers these days.In the end, I found this film to be incredibly original in terms of storytelling, but the way the film was presented felt a little egotistical to me. That may not be the case for some viewers, but I'm just being honest. With very minimal dialogue and odd camera angles, there's a lot to admire when watching this movie. To hardcore film lovers, I can't recommend checking out this unique piece of cinema enough, but if you're just looking for an average movie to pop on, I can't warn you of the opposite enough. If you placed a few hundred random people into a movie theatre and asked them to invest their time in this film, I can guarantee that at least 50 percent would either walk out or despise their experience, but that's okay because not everyone likes every single piece of art.

76,RJBurke1942,"In which we're reminded we always pay for our sins, one way or another.",5,28 April 2018,"The average viewer - in which I count myself - would probably be unaware, initially, that this story has its genesis in Greek mythology: to wit, the killing of Iphigenia, daughter of Agamemnon, shortly before the Greeks set sail for the long siege at Troy. Agamemnon accidentally killed a sacred deer belonging to the goddess, Artemis. Hence, her revenge upon poor Iphigenia, and Agamemnon.Transported to a modern setting, we meet the perfect family: dad Steven (Farrell), mom Anna (Kidman), daughter Kim (Cassidy), son Bob (Suljic), all firmly ensconced in The American Dream, in Any City in The Land of the Free. Dad is special, though: he's a leader in heart surgery, much respected, much applauded - indeed, part of the very elite of the city, and much in demand for his skills. From that perspective, a modern analog for Agamemnon of old.Except dad has a secret: despite positive proof, we soon learn he probably killed a patient while operating - because he'd been drinking. But, dad and mom have tucked that away into deep recesses of their minds; although, at least one other - a friend - has suspicions. Well, sometimes, one can make a bad call, right? ... Won't happen again, okay....But when the son, Martin (Keoghan), of the dead patient inveigles himself into dad's good family life, things gradually start to go pear-shaped. Unhappily for dad, he soon discovers he's not as free as he'd like to be: Martin, believing dad Steven killed his father on the operating table, wants a reckoning. In the worst possible way: Steven must kill one his own family as retribution. And Martin makes dad an offer he just can't refuse, even though he'd like to, desperately. Agamemnon, I can tell you, got a better deal.The remainder of the story I'll leave you to watch, if you wish, as the family loses control emotionally, physically and criminally. It's worth your time. But only to savor, if you can, dad's performance when, and how, he makes and carries out his decision about which of his beautiful dears he'll kill: Bob, Kim or Anna. Calling it simply bizarre just does not cut it: because unexpected, high camp comedy rarely comes calling in a serious movie billed as drama, mystery, thriller. And its presence, overwhelming the death scene, couldn't possibly have been unintentional. Hence, for me, the drama of the Greek myth was also brutally gutted and murdered. Oh, well, too bad. But, y'know, it could have been an excellent story....The acting, setting, directing and so on, are all uniformly up to scratch, as you would expect, given the experience of Farrell, Kidman and others. Although, Farrell's mostly phlegmatic persona as Steve is almost, at times, a rerun of that as David in The Lobster (2015).
 
Finally, I particularly disliked the often discordant soundtrack - just noise, actually - used annoyingly in a failed attempt to exemplify ... confusion? uncertainty? fear? dread? doom? ... within dad's affected family. Hitchcockian, this movie is not. Complete silence, I think, would have been much more effective for dramatic tension.So, I'll let you decide whether we really needed to see a mangled Greek myth as a lesson about justice denied; and yet served. As for myself, I give this one five, barely, out of ten.April 28th, 2018",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

The robotic talking between them. The ending made no sense at all. It left you going ...HUH?! the girl singing is obnoxious. Why the boy was killed off at the end I'll never know, surely it'd made a better plot if the girl had died and Martin actually showed a sign of guilt or something? What a waste of two hours This movie was a huge let down... total lose. I feel bad for the cast, they put so much effort into it. whole movies is used too long time to depict a very sample idea and story",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
78,msbreviews,Rating: B+,8,10 February 2018,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog! :)Yorgos Lanthimos brings us a metaphorical story about Dr. Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell), a well-known surgeon, and the link between his actions through life, his family and Martin (Barry Keoghan), a fatherless teenager who Steven is secretly taking care of.As Martin becomes to being closer to the family, his true purpose unfolds and threatens the family's well-being as well as it sets Steven's past menacingly in check.Yorgos Lanthimos is able to deliver a remarkably unconventional movie, packed with mystery, suspense and mind-blowing metaphors. I don't think I ever watched a film where the characters act like they do in The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Every character has an incredibly well-written script, they are all fully-developed through captivating dialogues and really amazing exposition scenes.The casting is fantastic, everyone has high-level performances and the way the characters look and talk like is awkwardly similar compared to each other. Colin Farrell is the one that stands out due to the emotional explosion of the third act, but Nicole Kidman (Anna Murphy) and Bill Camp (Matthew Williams) are also exceptional.However, the kids are absolutely phenomenal. Raffey Cassidy (Kim Murphy) and Sunny Suljic (Bob Murphy) portray Steve and Anna's children flawlessly, there are numerous moments where both of them truly shine. Barry Keoghan has probably his best performance to date. I find myself out of words to describe his display, but he goes way beyond himself and he completely embodies his character. He has a lot of shocking scenes, whether by something he does or simply by a suspenseful dialogue with Steven (his interactions with Farrell are very gripping and mysterious).Yorgos uses the realistic cinematography to handle the camera in many unusual forms, filming dialogues with quite rare angles, and he has an excellent control of the suspense and tension boiling out of several scenes. The editing is seamless and the score is one of those that becomes memorable since it raises the movie so much that it becomes part of it. Without this soundtrack, I would certainly not appreciate this film as much as I do.The screenplay is exposed to various interpretations. Mine allows me to enjoy most of the movie, but I am sure a lot of people might even hate this story. Every character's action is a symbol or a metaphor for something and their personalities are particularly interesting. It is very hard to explain since the whole film becomes a ""life lesson"" or a huge metaphor to something that happens a lot in real life (not in an exact way as in the movie, obviously). I will briefly explain my SPOILER interpretation of the story after my rating.Now, this film is not perfect, far from it. Its tone might be well-controlled, but the story loses its interest midway through. The first act is super captivating, mysterious and even creepy, in a good way. However, the second act falls on its rhythm and it turns out a bit boring, mainly because most of the plot twists are rather predictable, so I have to spend almost a whole act waiting for the rest of the characters to find out something I already know for more than 30 minutes.It might be a shocking and perplexing story, but its entertainment value is profoundly affected by the less good second act. It starts off great, it falls apart and then it picks itself up with a compelling yet expected ending. Steve's relationship with Martin is obviously linked to something else that I won't spoil and Steve's past is also something very anticipated.All in all, The Killing of a Sacred Deer is the type of movie I usually love. It has mystery, suspense, plot twists and the story itself is open to various interpretations. Yorgos does a great job directing and co-writing this film, the characters are incredibly developed in a very unconventional way and the story is really captivating. The addictive score is one of the key elements of the success of this movie, every scene is elevated due to it. However, the second act falls on its pacing, the twists are predictable and the entertainment is not that high. Thankfully, it is not enough to take me out of the fantastic environment the film provides.
!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!
So, my interpretation of the story is that Martin is sort of a ""God"" figure, literally and figuratively. Dr. Steven killed his father during surgery negligently (he was drunk) and he denies doing it, lying to himself, his family and his co-workers. In order to compensate for his mistake, he tries to be a father-like figure to Martin but that makes things even worse (like in the movie, it is like rubbing an open wound, it is only going to hurt you more).Martin has some kind of supernatural powers (literal ""God"") and he seeks justice, so everything is balanced out. There are a lot of metaphors in the film that points to this (Anna kissing his feet, for example). Steven has then to go through the dilemma of killing one family member to save the others or they all die. It is s a creepy way of proving the existence of ""karma"".",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
79,SameirAli,The Beauty of an Incredibly Strange Film.,9,28 December 2017,"Yorgos Lanthimos is best of his strange kind of films. If you are a fan of such films, you gonna love this one. The strange music will tingle your mind for a long time.Steven is a cardiac surgeon, living with his lovely wife and two kids. A patient dies on his operation table. The doctor makes a bond with the patients son. At the beginning, the doctor gives him expensive gifts and treat him like his son. Even invites him to the family. But, his entry into their life turns things upside down.A really beautiful film. You may tremble every 20-30 minutes. Watch it carefully, and with the whole heart for the best viewing experience. This is one of the films that will remain with you for a long time after watching.Amazing performance of the cast. Expressionless expressions give the film a very uncomfortable feeling, that suits the best for the movie. Nicole Kidman,Colin Farrell, Barry Keoghan, the boy and the girl, and everyone else in the film did amazing job. Kudos to the entire crew.True film lovers, never ever miss this film.

80,Andres-Camara,Es como ver robots. It's like watching robots,5,25 November 2018,"Es una película tan fría, lejana, plana, que no llego a meterme nunca en ella. No consigue atraparme en ningún momento. No es que este mal hecho, si no que la lleva a un tono que al director le gustara pero a mí me saca.
El hecho de no saber el porqué de las cosas me molesta mucho y en esta película no sé por qué pasan ciertas cosas, o más bien como hace uno de los personajes para afectar así a los demás.Los actores, si lo que quería el director, es que fueran fríos como robots, lo han conseguido de pleno, pero a mí una interpretación así no me transmite nadaLa iluminación es a veces mejor a veces peor. Eso de meter mucha luz por las ventanas para hacer iluminación naturalista a mí no me gusta, pero está de moda. Aporta poco a la historia, pero no esa malEl director creo que no hace una buena película. Es una película para muy poca gente. Me recuerda mucho a Kubrick en la manera de rodar, pero en lo malo. Mucho plano general y ver la película desde fuera, sin meterte nunca dentro de ella. Es aburrida y tiene un tempo pausado, lo cual a este género no le va.Había que verla y la he visto, pero no es recomendable.It's a film so cold, far, flat, that I never get into it. He can not catch me at any time. It's not that it's badly done, but that it leads to a tone that the director would like, but it takes me out.
The fact of not knowing why things bother me a lot and in this film I do not know why certain things happen, or rather how one of the characters does to affect others.The actors, if what the director wanted, is that they were cold like robots, they have achieved it in full, but to me such an interpretation does not transmit anything to meThe lighting is sometimes better sometimes worse. That of putting a lot of light through the windows to make naturalistic lighting I do not like, but it is fashionable. It contributes little to history, but not that badThe director does not think he makes a good movie. It is a movie for very few people. It reminds me a lot of Kubrick in the way of shooting, but in the bad. A lot of general plan and see the movie from the outside, without ever getting inside it. It is boring and has a slow tempo, which does not apply to this genre.You had to see it and I've seen it, but it's not recommended",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
81,Alexander_Blanchett,Not easy on the eye,8,25 December 2017,"Quite disturbing morals but exciting executed and extremely well written. An incredibly bleak film with some really good performances and twisted characters. Yorgos Lanthimos is surely one of the most creative directors out there what he already proved with ""The Lobster"".
Colin Farrell is once again his star in this much darker follow up project. I felt his acting was a bit robotic at times but he still delivered a very solid performance. Barry Keoghan had a very similar acting style but it totally fitted his character and he gave the best performance in this film. He embodied everything the film was about and delivered a very scary and unpredictable character. Great job and a good young actor to look out for. Nicole Kidman also was fantastic. A lot of her performance worked through her silent moments, her expressions, her staring. Great job. The kids were okay. Wished there had been more of Alicia Silverstone. The soundtrack was haunting and fitting the very unsettling atmosphere. Its one of the best screenplays of the year, thats for sure. The way it developed into that nightmare at the end was capturing me for the whole time. Also it is rich on metaphors (something like the Martin character also loves to use) and tough moralic questions. Its not a film for everyone but everyone who doesnt see it misses something.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
82,CANpatbuck3664,"The Emperor Has No Clothes, This Movie is Extremely Ugly and Boring",3,5 February 2018,"This is one of those movies I have nothing nice to say about. The only thing I'll hand this movie is that I don't want to blame the actors/actresses. They've all shown that they have talent and I believe they were all instructed to act in such a robotic and monotone style. This obviously backfired as I couldn't attach myself to their characters because of it but I get the intention. My hope is that they all bounce back soon with other more worthwhile projects.The Killing of a Sacred Deer is filmed in a deliberately cold and sterile way. There are plenty of distant shots when characters are walking down hallways, all the dialogue is delivered without any kind of inflection and the final moments lack any kind of feeling. Again, this wasn't done by accident and I understand that it might just being going over my head. But the trade-off with this style is that it sucks any kind of emotional investment out of the movie. This bleeds over into the characters who are all jerks and terrible people. I wasn't rooting for anyone by the end of the movie. Steven is too arrogant to like; his children and his wife are content to stab each other in the back as long as it suits their best interest. Martin's plan is so ruthless that you can't root for him as the villain (this is also compounded by his complete lack of personality). This is an ugly movie about ugly people in an ugly situation. I get that's the point but if that's the case, why should I enjoy this movie?The next thing is that this movie has very little plot to speak of. There is the mystery of how Martin is doing this (there is no resolution about that) but otherwise, the only other question posed is answered at the halfway point. There isn't anything else! If you're going to strip any emotional resonance from the movie or refuse to give me anyone to root for, I need an intriguing plot to hold my interest. Sadly, this was just one more thing the movie lacks.What this movie relies on is the dialogue and that aspect doesn't pick up the slack. Sure, there are some minor exchanges that are interesting but there isn't any deeper meaning revealed through these characters interacting with one another. It often gets repetitive (there are at least a couple of scenes where Steven and Anna lecture the kids about not doing their chores) or downright bizarre (Steven's story of childhood masturbation was icky). It just failed to hold my attention (again the fact its delivered so coldly didn't' help) and it was just something else that was disappointing.This movie joins A Ghost Story and Mother! In a category of 2017 films that critics adored and I ended up hating. I will say that like those movies, there was a clear vision of what they wanted, and they achieved it. Yorgos Lanthimos had something specific in mind and was more concerned about bringing his vision to life than whether the audience would get it. As much as defenders of this movie would say ""well you're not the target audience"", I'm open to trying new and different types of movies and I don't need to make concessions to an awful movie because they didn't make it with me in mind. I was repulsed by this movie for much of the running time. My hopes that it would get better when we got further into the plot were deflated like a balloon running out of air. Unless you're a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos' previous work (I haven't seen The Lobster, maybe its good?) or you're dying to see something off-kilter and deliberately hard to understand, do not see this movie.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

85,asda-man,A peculiar beast,7,11 April 2018,"Yorgos Lanthimos rears his ugly Greek head again, fresh from the international success of 2015's peculiar The Lobster. He's gone on record to say that he doesn't know how to make a straight-forward film and his fifth feature seems to confirm that statement. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is as odd as the title might suggest and certainly won't be for everyone, but those who like their movies on the different side are likely to find a lot to lap up.It boasts an all-star cast with Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman appearing as a wealthy husband and wife who's lives get turned upside down when the young Barry Keoghan enters their lives with sinister intentions. You could say that all this talent is somewhat wasted due to how they're all made to deliver their lines with an air of monotone autism to them. Farrell and Keoghan's characters dryly reel off information at one hundred miles per hour and no one acts remotely normal. It's an acting style which will immediately put a lot of people off straight off, but it does add to the creepy atmosphere which sustains throughout.Lanthimos directs the film with a suitably strange style, reminiscent of David Lynch and Michael Haneke at times. It isn't a film to be taken literally, I think the whole thing could be interpreted as a dream or a kind of metaphor. It has its roots in Greek mythology which can certainly be seen through the bizarre events which unfold.It's difficult to talk about the film without unravelling too much of the plot, which shouldn't be done. The film isn't as shocking as some reviewers like to claim. It certainly isn't as disturbing as Dogtooth but it does break some cinematic taboos by addressing some dark themes involving children, but these aren't anything we haven't seen before in the films of Haneke. There's no gratuitous violence or sex, although some of the imagery involving these might linger.In short, if you like art films and have an open mind then you'll absolutely love The Killing of a Sacred Deer. It's beautifully made and memorable, however audiences are likely to find the stilted characters difficult to engage with. It's also slowly paced, which I didn't have a problem with although I do think it would've benefited from some tighter cutting. It isn't a masterpiece like some claim, but it isn't unbearable rubbish either. It lies somewhere between them both.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

87,ronakkotian,One of the most unnerving experiences I've had to go through!,9,10 April 2020,"This is my first Yorgos Lanthimos film and it's also a film I would probably never want to rewatch.The Killing of a Sacred Deer is about Steven, a surgeon, whose family and life takes a turn for the worst after he befriends a teenager named Martin.This film gave me a very disturbed feeling during it and after it had ended. It's rare to see a film like this being made in such a unique and uncomfortable manner. It shows to me what a different director Lanthimos is and how he stand out from the crowd. From the chilling music to the character interactions, everything provided an uneasy feeling. The way each person spoke kept on freaking me out due to the absurdity of the dialogue and how wooden and emotionless each actor's performance was. It just seemed very unnatural and robotic which sparked this antsy feeling within me.Another huge part of the film was the music. The music had a very disturbing tone to it which added to the strange atmosphere and increased the anxiety levels. The camerawork was very strange and unlike anything I've seen in a film. Sometimes the camera would be extremely far away from the characters, making them seem very small in comparison to the size of the room. Techniques like these gave a very subtle reminder as to how powerless the family were and it conveyed to me how talented of a filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos is.You can argue that the performances are really bad since everyone had the same monotone, expressionless and wooden dialogue delivery but it's very obvious how intentional this was. Colin Farrell was really good. It's been a while since I saw Nicole Kidman and it felt great to see her perform this well. The star, however, was Barry Keoghan who seemed the most human out of everybody. His character was very interesting and he absolutely killed it in his role.I'll be checking out Yorgos Lanthimos's other work for sure. This film really got under my skin and didn't leave until it ended. It's not everyone's cup of tea but if you like offbeat movies, The Killing of a Sacred Deer is for you.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
88,johannes2000-1,"A weird, but absolutely fascinating movie.",9,9 November 2021,"This is a very unusual, almost enigmatic movie, with a story that resembles a dark fairytale by Grimm, or a Garcia Marquez novel, filled with sinister forebodings and intangible forces, like the force of extreme will power that can rule over life and death. As in a classic Greek tragedy this tale spirals down to an unavoidable fatal conclusion, steered by the irrefutable primordial right to demand an eye for an eye.At first sight this movie seems to be about a normal well to do family, both parents medical doctors, but already in the first scenes of the father with this strange young man Martin you feel that there is something weird and uneasy in this connection, and only very gradually we start to reconstruct its background, and begin to understand the toxic and in the end fatal hold this boy has on the father.Everything in this movie is different and striking. All characters behave rigid, almost robotic, even the children, there is hardly any warmth or even kindness between the family-members. The dialogues are extremely scripted and spotlessly recited by the actors. The music score consists of wavering soundscapes that intensify whit the severeness of the actions and the goings-on. The photography creates alienating views of the long hospital corridors and vast conference rooms (with to me a visual highlight when we see from above how Nicole Kidman leaves the hospital by the moving staircase with her little son and he suddenly falls flat on the floor). Although the direction and script must at times have felt for the actors like a rigid harnas, they actually all give exceptional performances, not only Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman, but also and especially young Barry Keoghan.This movie will definitely not be everyone's cup of tea, and at its climax it's extremely hard to bear and witness, but it is also absolutely fascinating. A movie that crawls under your skin.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

I'm not going to get into the plot other than after watching it, you feel raped. And this is AFTER you saw Nicole Kidman's tits and snatch. Seriously. I WAS raped for having seen that.
Okay, so director Yorgos is an artist. I think. He fashions this odd-ball clipped dialogue that sounds like something no one would ever say, crazy framing, and LONG...and I mean LONG held shots that make your brain go to mush. It's like if ""Eraserhead"" got a lot of dialogue.
But somehow I was sucked into the atmosphere. How do I explain this other than to say a film made by a teenage Kubrick. In other words, he doesn't know what he wants but knows when he sees it.

91,rubenm,Iphigenia in the 21st century,7,15 October 2017,"Not one single deer gets killed in this film, let alone a sacred one. But by choosing this title Yorgos Lanthimos lets us know where he got the inspiration for this film: in Iphigenia, a character from the Greek mythology. After having seen the film, I took one of my old books from high school (1978!) to find out what this myth is about exactly.Iphigenia's father, King Agamemnon, is ordered by the goddess Artemis to kill his daughter, in order to atone for his killing of a sacred deer. When she hears what is going to happen, Iphigenia agrees to being killed, because this would be beneficial to the Greeks.In Lanthimos' version, Artemis takes the shape of a creepy teenager, who terrorizes a successful heart surgeon he considers responsible for his fathers's death in the operating theatre. The surgeon and his wife (Colin Farell and Nicole Kidman) have to witness both their children getting paralyzed. This, announces the teenager, is the first stage of a slow and painful death that can only be stopped when the surgeon kills a family member.'The killing of a sacred deer' is a horror thriller, not so much different from other movies in this genre. The otherwordliness that made his earlier movies 'The Lobster' and 'Dogtooth' so special, is less prominent is this film. There are still some familiar features, such as the strange, deadpan way of talking by many characters. But the surgeon clearly has emotions and is increasingly desperate when he realizes that medical knowledge is useless in this case.'The killing of a sacred deer' is a decent thriller, with a nice weird edge. But the typical Yorgos Lanthimos-style is less prominent, which was a disappointment to me.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
92,davidgee,Too weird. And loud.,5,10 November 2017,"This got a rave review in my daily paper. It's not getting one from me. Weirdness hits a new high.Surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) recently lost a patient on the operating table. He's taken young Martin (Barry Keoghan), the patient's seriously weird son, under his wing. Martin is dating Steven's cute daughter Kim (Raphey Cassidy). Her young brother suddenly loses the use of his legs. Then Kim does too. Steven and his wife (Nicole Kidman) are at their wits end. WTF is going on?You may well ask. To underscore the strangeness of the story, the movie is mostly scored to a cacophonous barrage of pure noise, painful to the ears. Colin Farrell, bearded and beefed up from the super-hunk we are accustomed to, plays with deadly seriousness this man whose world is coming apart – reminiscent of Regan's mother in THE EXORCIST. Kidman, whose role is more akin to Mia Farrow's in ROSEMARY'S BABY, often looks as if she is as flummoxed by this script as we are. The theme is Revenge (that dish best eaten cold).Greek writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos gave us THE LOBSTER two years ago. Here, as there, there's a glossy sheen over the production which – with the weirdness – reminded me of an Almodovar movie. Perhaps it was just the soundtrack, but I left the cinema feeling slightly sick.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
93,andrewroy-04316,"A film that feels like pure Lanthimos - weird, absurd, darkly comic, tense, and surprising",7,11 July 2019,"While I haven't found the same depth of layers and ideas as The Lobster or The Favourite, The Killing of a Sacred Deer creates a gripping atmosphere from the start and never lets go. It's a movie focused more on telling an absurd story of sacrifice and justice than answering specific questions. Martin, the enigmatic and off-putting antagonist, holds Steven responsible for killing his father, so he inserts himself into his family's life and presents his scenario to Steven: kill a family member, or they will all be killed. His kids eventually become paralyzed, and his son's eyes start bleeding as Martin prophesized, before Steven decides to kill one of them. Even to that climactic scene I still expected Steven to kill himself to save his family, as that would be the generic movie ending. Instead, he asks the advice of a school principle, still can't decide, and chooses by random chance with him spinning around shooting one of them. It does fit his character more as a professional and reasonable but ultimately selfish man to act this way. I love the ending, where we see Martin staring at them, and I think he is satisfied and feels as though justice has been served. The randomness and complete isolation of the problem (the hospitals end up saying they can't do anything, almost feeling like they're sanctioning Martin's cruel game) tie into the absurdist themes Lanthimos makes clear throughout. It wasn't a surprising movie in that it had surprising plot elements or twists, but instead succeeds first and foremost by creating a thrilling and tense atmosphere where each character is on their own in some respect and the ways they will interact and approach the scenario is constantly uncertain. Very well done, even if it's not the kind of movie that leaves you with an idea or revelation at the end.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
94,latinfineart,Absolutely horrendous filmmaking.,1,14 February 2018,"I barely know where to start, when it comes to reviewing this absolute piece of garbage. I should have known, after suffering through The Lobster. This director is so lacking in talent, it defies the imagination. Barely any narrative, monotonous dialogue, without passion, life, or joy. Who are these people? There was zero in the way of character development.Right from the start, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" wants to let you know that you are in the hands of a master filmmaker, except nothing about this film is masterful. Nothing. For maybe the first third or so of its running time, I was mostly enraptured by the striking look of the film and the extremely low-key strain of weirdo black humor running through it. I was also intrigued by the basic setup of the film and found myself wondering who this twerpy kid was and why he had such a hold on Steven. The problem here is that once Lanthimos has fully set up his story, he has pretty much laid all of his cards on the table and for the first time in his career, you can pretty much see where he and his story are heading over the next hour. There is still plenty of eyebrow-raising material to be had but the outrages seem more formulaic this time around and help to demonstrate that few things are deadlier to movie audiences than a film that is nowhere near as audacious or transgressive as it likes to think it is-instead of reeling in horror and shock as the climactic events unfold, most moviegoers are likely to instead find themselves thinking ""About damn time.""As the seemingly perfect Steven, Colin Farrell does a sort of decent job of projecting his character's unerring sense of his infallibility in the early scenes and then poking holes in that aura of perfection until he is reduced to being utterly bent and broken-ironically, it is when he is face with committing an unabashedly inhumane act that he finally comes across as completely human. By comparison, Nicole Kidman has less to do but her performance is no less compelling and I once again stand in admiration for continuing to use her star power on decidedly offbeat material like this. As the two children of Steven and Anna, Suljic and Cassidy smartly avoid trying to make their characters too sweet and sympathetic and indeed, some of the funniest moments come from the moments when their survival instincts kick in and they each try to get the upper hand on the other by any means necessary. The most memorable performance, however, is the one given by Barry Keoghan as Martin, who finds a way of taking a character who is obnoxious at his best and monstrous at his worst. as you find yourself secretly fantasizing about dropping him into an industrial-sized meat grinder.This film has little to offer.

97,CineMuseFilms,an engaging absurdist tale of atonment,7,12 November 2017,"Absurdism is an art-house genre that messes with our brains by turning logic on its head. The filmmaker scatters a few clues throughout the film and leaves the audience to make whatever sense of it they can. A superb example is The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), a film full of conflicting clues that will make many viewers wonder if they are watching a supernatural horror, a psychological thriller, or a black comedy.The bare bones of the story are easy to describe but their meaning less so. Successful heart surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) saves many lives but one day he operates after a couple of drinks and the patient dies. With life and death in his hands, an occasional failure is normal. Some years later Steven spends time with his daughter's friend, the loner Martin (Barry Keoghan) who says he wants to be a cardiologist. Martin ingratiates himself into Steven's family and begins a relationship with the surgeon's daughter. When Steven tries to stop all contact, Martin reveals that Steven killed his father so he must kill one of his own family or all of them will die. Inexplicable symptoms appear in his son and daughter which force Steven to make a horrific decision.The narrative is weird enough but its presentation gives the film an extraordinary atmosphere of horror. The word Sacred in the film's title is the first clue that this story occupies a space beyond logical realism, somewhere in the eye-for-an-eye cosmos where a wrong must be held to account. Absurdism frees the filmmaker from conventional logic to make the audience question their taken- for-granted world: like, why should a surgeon be allowed to not atone for a tragic mistake? The filming style accentuates the outer-worldliness of what we see: subjects are framed to look small against massive walls; panoptic shots render humans as trivial objects from a universal gaze, while some tracking shots feel like the camera is running along the ceiling looking down on human panic.While the camera creates the visuals, the performances portray humans being under the control of an unknowable force. Outwardly refined and successful, the Murphys are strange people. Steven and wife Anna (Nicole Kidman) deliver deadpan dialogue and wooden body language, and their sex life relies on one of them imitating a comatose patient. As bizarre symptoms appear in their children and medical tests fail to find a cause, Steven turns on Martin like an animal caught in a trap. When science cannot help, he knows that a higher force is in control. There is no logic in what is happening and no causal link can be found. Brilliant photography and powerful acting combine to continually raise the psychological tension to a bizarre finale.Absurdism often depicts a form of moral dystopia; it is also the code for understanding Sacred Deer. Some will see Martin as an evil force; others will see this as a psychotic episode or maybe it's just natural justice being served. But the film remains in the moment: never questioning why things are happening, always mired in its own experiential strangeness. More than anything else, it is this lingering quality that makes it an engaging and memorable film.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
98,rdoyle29,Lanthimos continues to deliver,8,7 November 2017,"Colin Farrell is a cardiologist who has taken teenager Barry Keoghan under his wing. He meets him in secret, dispenses advice, gives him gifts and ultimately introduces him to his family ... Nicole Kidman, Raffey Cassidy and Sunny Suljic. It gradually becomes clear that Keoghan has some hold on Farrell, which is brought into stark relief when Farrell's family starts coming down with a mysterious illness. Farrell has to make an enormous sacrifice to avoid tragedy. The performances are universally amazing here, especially given the odd, extremely restrained style that Lanthimos is going for. This is a slow film that takes place in very bright, very still spaces. It's very reminiscent of Kubrick. Definitely not for all tastes, but if you've seen Lanthimos's earlier films, this is clearly the work of the same man.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

The mythical underpinnings here give the film a sure sense of direction and overall structure, but Lanthimos' style is all his own -- the restrained, almost deadpan, performances he elicits from his actors; the pared-down dialogue, teetering a lot of the time on the edge of very dark humour indeed; the almost antiseptic visual canvas which takes so little to sully. This is Planet Yorgos.It's two hours of almost non-stop psychological disturbance, so prepare to emerge a little punch-drunk, but it is totally worth undergoing the experience.It's worth mentioning in passing that the performances are terrific, and that Colin Farrell goes from strength to strength now his juvenile lead days are behind him.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

105,Mike_Devine,Heavy and full of metaphors,6,30 May 2020,"Psychological thrillers can sometimes get wrapped up in themselves, and Yorgos Lanthimos's indie effort 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' sort of falls into this trap. The Cincinnati-based film follows a well-to-do family who become entangled with a mysterious young boy, which leads to a series of unfortunate events.'Deer' benefits from two strong leads with Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell, as well as an impressive performance from newcomer Barry Keoghan. It also boasts a chilling soundtrack, which really brings out the drama in a few key scenes, in addition to ensuring a chilling effect throughout. It also is chock full of metaphors and is an allegory from Greek mythology for those who are steeped in that sort of folklore.But 'Deer' is not an easy story to follow. Not that it bills itself as having one, but you really need to be in the mood to give your mind a workout when you watch it. It's a heavy film, to say the least. There are also plenty of questions that are left unanswered, but that's probably intentional. And despite the presence of Kidman and Farrell, there's little to write home about their performances.Don't go into 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' thinking you will feel good about the world coming out - you won't.

It managed to keep my attention: since the beginning I've understood that there was something weird going on, and the director keeps the audience in the dark for half of the runtime. Then, there is the plot twist, which I have to admit, I didn't see coming, at least not in the way is portrayed. I was genuinely surprised, this is something that is not happening frequently in recent productions. ""The killing of a sacred deer"" is not for everyone: it takes his own time to build tension, but without being tedious or repetitive. What really bugged me is the ending, as there are so many questions that are not answered. I understand that Yorgos Lanthimos explicitly withheld some important information to keep the mistery-vibe and that the whole film is open to a free interpretation by the viewer, but I personally did not like how he handled it. Don't get me wrong: final scenes are in fact shocking and well realized, I just wished that was explained how Martin managed to do what he did to Murphy family.I am truly happy that big names such as Collin Farrell and Nicole Kidman are taking part of these smaller projects, and of course I have enjoyed their performances. The general level of the production is pretty high and I am happy that A24 keeps releasing these well thought and written movies, made for an audience that is searching for something different than the average blockbuster. I wouldn't say that this is their best movie ever, but it is very solid. If you are searching for a nice thriller with an unexpected twist, you might enjoy this one.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
110,jayjaycee,Hearts Wide Shut,9,16 December 2019,"""The Killing Of A Sacred Deer"" is a 2017 psychological thriller directed by Yorgos Lanthimos starring Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman. Back in school, we dealt with several classic tragedies such as ""Medea"" and ""Oedipus"" and they always fascinated me on a deep and somewhat strange level. There's so much brachial violence in them, full of insane twists and questionable decisions, in modern standards they would probably be best categorised as controversial, as something that's not a part of normalcy and after hearing that Greek director Lanthimos made a film in the style of his home country's heritage I had to check it out as fast as I could. First of all, the film grabbed me within the first few seconds, with the gross first shot I wondered what I was about to witness. The story starts without any further introduction and leaves you in the dark most of the time. The scenery appears so innocent and yet it feels so unsettling. Most of this is created by the brilliant play of sounds: In one scene you have extremely loud background noises and only a few seconds later you have absolute silence. It's just a small device, but it's effect is immense. The overall atmosphere seems kind of hypocritical, it's almost too perfect. It caricatures the image of a perfect family life, it subtly ridicules the whole situation. Every single second it's oppressively idyllic. There's a mystery that slowly begins to unfold and the further it goes the more horrifying it becomes. The atmosphere in the beginning seemed familiar too me, because it's similar to Kubrick's ""Eyes White Shut"", not only because they share the same leading actress. It's the same kind of uncertainty that packed me. Furthermore, the cast acted brilliantly in this one, aside from a superb leading couple of Kidman and Farrell, the child actors and Keoghan showed some extreme talent. Mostly the latter impressed me with his performance, he made Martin so unsuspicious and simultaneously extremely creepy and threatening. Next to the deliberate inconsistency of the musical score the camera work enables the viewer to feel the intimacy of the story tremendously, it's so close that it's unsettling from start to finish. It all amounts to the effect that the viewer constantly feels this roar in the background, within their whole body. You feel this film so much that it makes your heart race, my pulse was extremely high just by the vehemence of the way it's crafted, it even made me feel my own heartbeat. Also the fast changing contrast of sterile and warm colours subliminally supported this effect. The ending is as disturbing as its heartbreaking, no surprise leading actor Colin Farrell felt nauseous after reading the screenplay. In the end, this criminally underrated flick is an absolutely devastating masterpiece, an emotional hell ride that forces us to feel all of our human emotions at once and asks us the haunting question of how we would act in such a both ethically and morally questionable and horrifying situation. A terrorising thriller that creates a packing horror that will follow you for a few days after the credits rolled.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
111,x_manicure_x,Disturbing but kind of meaningless,6,14 August 2021,"""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is regarded as either a masterpiece or a disaster, but I thought it was just alright. I have nothing against symbolic, artistic films, I am not looking for a payoff at all costs, but it felt a bit too insipid at times. I know it's emotionally empty and awkward on purpose, but the atmosphere was more plainly unpleasant that it is unsettling. Still, it's quite a unique cinematic experience and an interesting experiment.Technically, Lanthimos' visual direction is meticulously on point, often Kubrickian with those tracking shots along hallways and a cold, detached view above the characters as they share emotionless conversations in a monotonous, robotic acting. Lanthimos works like a cynical, sadistic God who looks down on his characters, tortures them, makes them say and do the most embarrassing things. The audience is also invited to make fun of Steven's family as their survival instinct peels off the thick layer of middle-class decency to show their egoism and ruthless individualism.Surely no one was expecting a happy ending, but the final sacrifice felt underwhelming as the matter was eventually left to chance. Steven was actually able to do whatever he wanted in that situation, and, as he was the only one able to see, there would have been no consequences with his family members. If I were Martin, I wouldn't have counted that as a sacrifice.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Not to mention, it is horrible acting, and you could care less about any of the characters. I wished they all died.

113,mgd_m,Deeply flawed travesty,1,30 January 2019,"The problem with this movie is not the boredom or the robotic acting. The problem is it has no climax. When the ending comes, you don't feel anything. It's so dull, you just say ""ok"", while you should cry watching what's happening.
Another big flaw is that the moral (""everyone of us is ready to do the most nefarious things to save his own life"") is told in a very obvious, didactic way, such as ""here it is, here's your moral"". There's no enlightment in it, just a boring lesson.
Third mortal sin, is that there's no real choice to be made in the movie. Everything feels driven, the antagonist is unbeatable, so... I don't know, there's no purpose in this story at all.I like artsy movies, and slow movies, but you have to get your art straight. This is the typical movie where the director makes somethings very artsy, gets good reviews and accolades, but is not a good artist - at all. Good reviews of such movies are written by people who have a poor understanding of art.
And frankly I'm very tired of movies and reviews perpetuating such imposture.In its surreal, creepy atmosphere, it reminded me a lot of a short series by Von Trier, that I watched a long time ago. That was art. That was compelling, though being surreal, cold and uneasy. I watched the whole series all at once, 8 hours I guess.

Trust me, it sounds much better on paper.I understand the author's good reputation better now, having watched ""Sacred Deer"", a bizarre thriller about waking up in suburbian nightmare where the carefully built and maintained life just collapses for no good reason.You should probably call this an arthouse horror or something.

Not knowing and just taking it all in is a big part of what makes the whole result worth experiencing.It's a movie of two parts, really. The first 45 minutes are the most interesting because the main story has not started yet but the authors find all sorts of interesting ways to keep you intrigued without actually telling much.This section plays out like a comedy where everybody is actually dead serious and even kind of morbid.Everybody seems strangely devoid of feelings and sounds like they force themselves to talk - but at the same time they are somehow super motivated to chat, especially about trivial stuff but also perplexing bits of personal information.So far, so Kafka-esque middle class nightmare, or maybe a Jim Jarmuch-ian if he used a lot more dialogue than usual, and aimed at creeping you out. The sense of dread is thick and hangs over everything, and this effect is strengthened by using a long shots and some kind of distorted view.Then the main story starts, and the movie turns into something else, which is still good... but never quite the same, letting one off the edge of the seat more easily.It all remains stylish and atmospheric but it doesn't have much of the initial intrigue (or promise of depth) anymore, and frankly goes on for too long. There are different lines but none of them takes us somewhere as deliciously dark and outlandish as the first section.So, I liked it but not as much as I thought I would based on first 45 minutes.

122,austin0731,Uneasy exploration of human nature and how we deal with our faults,6,6 January 2018,"Without saying too much about the film, The killing of a sacred deer is one of those films where while watching it would be tough, uncomfortable and uneasy. However, coming out of it, allowing the film to settle and marinate there really is a lot to pick apart and analyze. Much like Yorgos Lanthimos' other film: ""The Lobster"" although compared to that, this film is all the intense and dark.The killing of a sacred deer stars Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman and Barry Keoghan (from Dunkirk) and really is about this mythology about redemption, facing yourself and revenge. There is a very interesting dynamic in the film that plays out giving off a strong sense of unnerving and chilling event unfolding. While the killing of a sacred deer isn't a pure horror it really achieves an effect that can be so much scarier than that of classic horror films and tropes. Like the Lobster, the killing of a sacred deer follows a society very much devoid of emotions in which people speak in a very matter of factly manner with very little variation in tone. This has come to be a sort of trademark for Lanthimos' films and is especially effective here under the brilliant acting of the entire cast, the highlights being the aforementioned three leads. This all goes to achieve the greater effect and deliver the overarching message about confronting one's faults that ties up wonderfully by the end of the film.The killing of the sacred deer's score was also beautifully written with this piercing edges adding to the suspense and uneasy feeling. Another thing is the camera work, this was done deliberately and so interestingly, by taking shots either from top to bottom or from bottom to top there is a sense of audiences peering into the conversations and almost stalking the characters adding an extra layer of storytelling. Overall, the film was well crafted and presents interesting themes but can feel dragged at certain times and does suffer from the pacing. Also, it was an uncomfortable viewing that takes time to really settle in and understand the true intentions of the film which is sure to draw a negative reaction immediately following the film.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
123,itsbobr,"Very Strange, but Compelling",7,26 October 2018,"Three years after Martin's (Barry Keoghan) father dies on Dr Steven Murphy's operating table, Martin turns to Steven to replace his father and lets Steven know his mother (Alicia Silverstone) has eyes for Steven. Steven rejects this. Later Martin tells Steven that he believes Steven killed his father during surgery; and that Steven must kill one member of his family to atone for the killing of his father. If Steven does not do this his kids will suffer, not be able to walk, not eat at all and blood will come from their eyes and eventually will die. And most of this comes true. What will Steven do to save his family?This is probably the strangest movie I have ever seen. (Did you forget about Colin Farrell in his movie The Lobster?) oh, right, well this one is up there too. Both are very strange.We do not know how Martin is able to do the things he says will happen to Steven's family, but they do happen. And Martin makes it clear that those things will stop when Steven kills one of his family: the son Bob (Sunny Suljic) or the daughter Kim (Raffey Cassidy) or Anna (Nicole Kidman), Steven's wife. Who will it be? We do see the kids suffer but not Anna. Curious.This is from a Greek tragedy in Aeshylus when Agamemnon has to sacrifice his daughter to atone for killing a sacred deer. Hey, I looked it up. Kim understands all this and is willing to be sacrificed as she knows she is dying along with brother Bob. What will Steven do?One of the most striking things about this movie is the clipped monotone dialogues employed by most of the lead characters, especially Steven. The same kind of clipped cadence was also employed by most of the characters in The Lobster. And guess what? The same director directed both: this movie and The Lobster. So the cadence was his doing. Hmmm........ The cadences were not annoying, but very different from what we usually hear. Not bad in many ways. Kind of gets to the point pretty quick.Notable: Nicole Kidman as Anna, Steven's wife who is also a doctor, an Ophthalmologist, and she blames Steven for the predicament they are in.Anna had to perform a sex act on the Anesthesiologist to get the medical report of the operation Steven performed on Martin's father. Now she is convinced that Steven caused the predicament they are in with the children. The Anesthesiologist blames Steven for the botched surgery, and Steven blames the Anesthesiologist.This is somewhat uncomfortable to watch. One thinks this will go to a horror story, but it doesn't. Of course, if it did, you wouldn't see this review. This is very strange, but is compelling and we just had to see how it ends and to see what Steven does.

125,FelipeCarrillo,Do you play God or Devil?,10,6 May 2018,"Beyond the story about lost, vengeance and repulsion that he sets up, what makes Lanthimos so unique and aggressive is his power to relate poetically atrocious fables, a type of narration that is far, far from the prototype used by cinema currently. He already did so with his previous film and now backs it up with ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"", dangerous ideas and perspectives without anesthesia embellished with peculiar breakdowns on lies, justice, forgiveness and hard feelings; rubbing salt in the wound of many conservative moviegoers who describe this type of cinematographic approach as ostentatious, ambitious and shamefully voyeuristic. Only with the first frame selected by the filmmaker to open the film expresses the general sense of the story, projecting an uncensored, full-color open-heart surgery, with squeaky resonances as cynical background, a perfect start. Simultaneously, it begins the difficult journey that gradually sinks us, along with the characters, into an infernal spiral of mystical degenerations that befall in the flawless lives of two successful but frivolous American doctors, she's an ophthalmologist, he's a heart surgeon, and here is where the conflict comes into play as an important component. Very few filmmakers have explored the medical world from a perspective so sinister, attractive to the sight of the most curious, setting his story over the dilemma of what could happen if a human being, like you and me, makes a mistake saving another's life voluntarily or involuntarily, we're all mortal and therefore we are prone to destroy our world because the slightest error. In a more realistic context, there are a few options that this kind of case goes directly from the hand of governmental justice to the affected person's own justice, however, this is why his films are so appealing, because it tries to imitate realities, turn them into fictions and present them as our reflections, some perceptible, others intrinsically hidden. The story veers completely over a psychological, captivating and supernatural air and many movie lovers appreciate that, we really do. Suggesting subtly that everything shown on screen isn't explicitly all they want to say is a tool for the audience, who must start, on its own, a quick but much deeper study of the connections between the pictures, questioning each line getting out of the mouth of any character, every decision, every distraction, a game in which the spectator must be more clever. Along with ""mother!"" by Darren Aronofsky, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" has one of the craziest, most symbolic and visceral scripts, in the bad and good sense of all the words, of the last decade, guaranteed stupefaction. The screenplay, written by the director alongside his habitual co-writer Efthymis Filippou, is overwhelming; from the opening scene, there are signs warning of an abrasive, variegated in-crescendo trip that gradually, as if it was an uncontrollable beast, increases in strength and belligerence to devour what could have been a tasteless drama. This kind of thing makes more interesting the stories in which no one knows what the hell just happened, not necessarily about R-rated scenes or courageous plot turns, but about that fictional game in which the writers immerse us whether we like or not. Don't forget the superb, staggered build of tension and discomfort, because in fact, the story is not made up of efficient twists and clever moves placed in the right moments, but the story itself is a big, insane twist. Certain elements are required for something like this goes well, fortunately, they're used on this occasion: top-notch performances, an antiseptic cinematography, a lancinating soundtrack and an infinity of technical, artistic and narrative support that become this work, only for a few ones, in one of the best of the year.Here is one of the few films in which the majority, if not all, of the performances are magnificent and strangely credible. Becoming what Samuel L. Jackson is for Tarantino, James Stewart was for Hitchcock or Daniel Day-Lewis is for Thomas Anderson, Colin Farrell returns to the ranks of the director, exposing, again, an explosive labor and personal relationship, both men know how to get the most out it on screen. Putting his bleak sentimental muddle with Rachel Weisz's character in the past, he comes back in the skin of a know-it-all, renowned professional who must forget his perfect Californian life following a cryptic situation which asks him an inhuman sacrifice, revenge calls for blood. Farrell does an outstanding job in this movie, his movie, we feel true anger, his bewilderment and dread are real through his steely gaze, and unlike many other similar-storyline characters, he's a defenseless father contemplating how his family crumbles, one by one, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. He's a very honest manages to withstand an ever-growing madness that won't stop until it gets what it wants, a stroke of genius. Of course, the next big revelation is one of the most terrifying and ominously disturbing antagonists of this year: Barry Keoghan. Christopher Nolan gave him a supporting role to catapult him to stardom in his most recent technical ode ""Dunkirk"", however, it's this crazy film which gives him free rein to shine like the big ones. The 25-year-old actor has found a very complex character, full of nuances represented by means of monologues that he verbalizes in a way as natural as disturbing, the coldness of his boiling hate is what turns his interpretation into a fabulous triumph, there are sincerity and depth in his words, is such the power of his dramatic range that with just a couple of lines and one ""loathsome"" plate of spaghetti petrifies an entire theater, a visceral performance. It seems that we'll never find a bad interpretation from this matron because with her work in Lanthimos' fierce film she ratifies, again and again, her immeasurable talent, welcome Nicole Kidman. Anna, her character, is one more mother at first glance, suffocated by deceits, a worried woman who will fight even against her husband to find the answer about what's happening to her children, however, the ""The Beguiled"" actress endows it with so real concern, watching her on screen is as disquieting as watching Keoghan, just in a clearly different context. With scenes as the discussion in the kitchen or the long shots with her as a centerpiece, the camera delights to give her an open field in order to exhibit all her skills and also all her doubts, because, at the level of strangeness and disturbance, none of the characters left behind, why does she lay down naked on the bed, almost static, like a Greek sculpture waiting to turn her husband on? Raffey Cassidy, Kim in the film, proposes a rather unusual look at her teenage role, because although all the characters revolve around the father's decisions, the scenes she leads and her character's absorbing twist allows her to handle innocence, defenselessness and unexpected malice, there is something in the singing scenes of this young interpreter; a wealthy freak show influenced by a Greek legend. Thimios Bakatakis' barbaric visual section must live up to the brutality and strangeness of the enigmatic writing, frankly, it goes significantly beyond. The cinematographer spreads the messages out through a thin and aggressive line of symbolic pictures, from the most deeply dramatic to those blatantly violent; the camera slithers harshly along hospitals, onerous houses, coffee shops and disturbing basements, using long shots to feed the unstoppable tension through tilt and travelling moves that accompany the characters all the time, even making the viewer to hide behind a shield in every moment, it's restless and frightened of what may come as soon as a change of scene happens. As a whole, the artistic composition is first-rate, metaphorical and brimming with messages that spring up from the colors, increasingly dark and indifferent; light plays a fundamental role in the film, subtly emphasizing an impact as simple as vivacious that it will get under your skin. In the seemingly less significant moments, hence more peaceful, the images are delicate but softly bathed by a bad vibe, however, when the sequences freak out, the images get a much more revealing value thanks to the flawless work of the art and production crew led by Daniel Baker, the most gritty and expressive scenes are painted with high-quality and delicate moderation to never fall into the coarse and lousy, the cinematography fosters the bad omen that transmits the colors and the Hitchcocknian melodies of the wonderfully precise soundtrack, the different songs captive and strengthen each one of the prior elements; a film that leaves you breathless from any side you want to see it, a superbly crafted nightmare. Upsetting, exultantly cruel and incredibly hard to watch and forget, Yorgos Lanthimos's ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is his film less chimeric in terms of visual setting, however, the stark and eccentric display of his ideas and the deep-rooted metaphorical meaning of them are pillars in this rabid tale of karma, morality, vengeance, and humility, smothering the spectator' tolerance limits, causing dissimilar results in each experience, in my case, a da*n obsession to know more about this unclassifiable Greek filmmaker. Quickly, the filmmaker shapes his filmography on metaphorical bases, with esoteric and complex ideas that define a caustically indelible work. No doubt, the second film, narrative and visually, more controversial, perverse and atrocious of 2017.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
126,lorcan-61881,Cool film but very hard to stay into,8,20 March 2018,"The Killing Of A Sacred Deer is Yorgos Lanthimos' new film and first horror film if you want to call it a horror film. The film follows a surgeon who's family slowly begins to grow very ill after a teenage boy he befriends starts to come close to him and his family. When I first watched Dogtooth, Yorgos' second film, I kind of felt like the film was good, just not really my type of film and considering this film was a horror film and not many horror films were coming out in theaters at the time, I decided I would see it, but I never got to. And just now in the UK and Ireland, it has came out and I'm glad to say it was actually really good. The film was very good and offered some amazing performances from Colin Ferrel and Nicole Kidman, in their second film since Sofia Coppola's The Beguiled. The kid who played Martin was absoloutley amazing and highly one of the best teenage performances of the 2010's in my opinion. The only problem I had with the film was that although the first maybe 50 minutes are very entertaining, it then went kind of boring and dragged on like a lot and I just skipped to the end, which also was not the best ending, no offence but was still a awesome climax, like the very last scene I mean. The Killing Of A Sacred Deer, like say, Mother, is probably gonna piss off some fans by it's open range of questions but will please some, so if you don't like artsy kind of films and mysterious ones (Under The Skin, Mother, The Shining, etc.), well then please don't watch this!!",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Don't be fooled.
This movie is perhaps one of my all time worsts.
It's not a thriller by any means, there's a lot of creepy weird scenes that make no sense.
The plot was never fully explained.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
128,PetarNeo,You need to see this one,9,21 November 2017,"The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a new psychological movie by Yorgos Lanthimos the man who created Lobster and Dogtooth which were also pretty amazing but this one takes step farther and if you appreciate a good storytelling you will be amazed how good this movie is. Movie follows a surgeon Steven as he befriends Martin, a kid whose father died on his table, and how his life will turn into a living hell. Looking from dramatic perspective of movie it was pretty good seeing movie put all characters together and how they start to connect creating a prefect environment for something chaotic. As movie progressed it just kept on building momentum for that moment that will everything start to blow apart inside pretty good lives of our characters. About half of the movie things start to get down and it just keeps to pull you inside and make you lose your mind over things that are happening just leaving you speechless and in search for answers. You slowly as time passes start to get terrified and sincerely mind blown how things are going and you are coming to the third part of the movie that will completely make you scream and make you not believe what is happening and all that filled with terror and horror. Final scene comes and you just can't believe what you watched and how it all played out. You need to give Yorgos a praise for screenplay and writing that he is done because it is something special that manages to create and it will make you wonder what is there else to put to blow our minds. Colin Farrell (Steven) was absolutely amazing, once again he showed how good dramatic actor he is and that he is capable of some serious tasks. Nicole Kidman (Steven's wife, Anna) was also pretty great in her passion and loving that her character puts throughout movie. Barry Keoghan (Martin) was incredible, in all his coolness and emotional manipulation that he provides in whole movie. There are no words that can describe how unique this movie is and how it will play with your mind if you fully focus your attention to details. You will want to see this movie without any doubt. 3.5/4",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
129,skip-98756,What did I just Watch? A Descent into Unimagineable Insanity.,8,9 May 2020,"I checked this one out because I heard it was a trip into madness...
Well, i was not dissapointed! Spoilers ahead beacuse I want to discuss the craziness and speak a few theories on what just happend..1st off, this movie absolutely Wreaks of strangeness and makes you almost immediately feel like you are going down the rabbithole! From the insane use of creepy well placed, bloodcurdling sound that sometimes comes up out of nowhere and shocks the bejezzus out of you! Especially if you are listening on a good surround sound system! The Absurd dialogue that you would have to hear to believe and the deadpan,lifeless, emotionless ,almost android like expression of speaking that ALL of the characters exhibit lends to a ""WTF am I looking at here?"" feeling during the entire movie.. Its beyond bizzare, it must have been what the director wanted becuz the actors are first rate, its Not becuz they cant act, its becuz they were told to deliver their lines in this manner and its disconcerting to say the least...many times , i swore the punch line was gonna be that these were NOT even human beings, it was That weird! This is one F***ked up family and the other kid and his mom are even worse..The cinematography was great for adding to the weird, the way the camera panned around, just uber creepy..So my theory on What just happenned..I believe the Boy was possesed of terrible powers of mind and will.. Whether he was practicing black magic to right the percieved wrong he felt was done to him or whether he simply had the power of mind alone to inflict pain and suffering and even death on others, it sure came across like that.. At 1st i thought he may have poisened the family, but the scene where he ""allowed"" the girl to suddenly stand up and come to the window in the hospital showed he could manipulate circumstances to his will...This is Not like any movie you have ever seen, its unique, ultra disturbing and for the atmosphere and story it tried to create, I gotta say it was well done..It held my intrest all the way through,often because i was in shock at the absurdity of it and wanted to see how the madness would play out... Recommended if you are the kind of person who likes the utterly bizzare and is Not afraid of being deeply disturbed.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
130,Lewis_Heather787,"Strange, Uncomfortable, Haunting, Powerful and Unforgettable!",8,14 November 2017,"Wow! This film is madness but strangely beautiful madness at the same time, there is so much to talk about this film. That, I believe, is the point of this film and that is to start a conversation because this film brings up some many questions and answers very few of them. Yorgos Lanthimos, his directing in the film is truly fantastic from start to finish. The film has a great flow to it and the camera is set up in such away that we as the audience are actually there experience this from a far. The film gets your attention as soon as its starts and what a brilliant idea it was to start with an operation, considering that the film follows a doctor and his family. I can't remember a film that has been crafted so well to be so unsettling and uncomfortable, the film brings up topics and themes that would make anyone feel awkward but the acting in the film portrays them as the norm, which is fascinating. The closest thing that I can personally think of is this film is a combination of Prisoners and The Shining, these combined creates an extremely suspenseful and bizarre emotion ride. Fantastic directing overall.We all know by now that Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman are fantastic actors but this film for me shows them playing extremely different characters to what we have come accustom to from both of them. Both are absolutely brilliant from start to finish but are both just very strange, one minute they can be ""normal"" and caring for their kids and doing day to day things, then the next minute there character will act or say something that just doesn't fit right. This is how the film lures the audience in by carefully placing odd things here and there to grow the suspicion and mystery of the entire story. Yes the story is just a mystery and I still think this even after viewing the film, who knows what was really going on, the film brings up more questions than answers. This is great because not everything needs to be explained to its fullest or at all, why certain characters do certain things or why certain plot points happen none of these are ever found out or explained. For me personally that is a positive of the film not a negative.Even though Farrell and Kidman are great in the film there is one stand out that deserves some award nominations and that is Barry Keoghan who plays Martin. His performance is truly bizarre, weird, creepy, strange and uncomfortable. We as the audience are introduce to him without any real backstory, some small details are added throughout the film but not much which leaves to speculation. However it is the fine line that he plays between innocent guy and psycho that is really interesting, that's not to say that his ""normal innocent guy"" act is not weird it still is but you get use to it just assume that its part of him, not everyone is the same. However once he starts to predict the future and future events that will happen in the film that's where this film hits a new level and gets extremely weird and will probably turn some people away, personally I think it added to the film and made strange even more strange, if that is possible. The Last character in the film that deserves a mention is the score of the film, and yes I did put character. The score in this film is a character of the film it is not there all the time however when it does appear it can be truly haunting and build suspense very well. It definitely has that Kubrick style to it that resembles The Shining, is perfectly crafted for this film and is very well done.80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10, this film is very good from the directing, acting and the story that is complete bonkers. However its is a difficult film to watch and its quite slow it does feel longer than two hours and its certainly not for everyone, this film is very dark and is not exactly very happy lets put it that way. Saying that if you do see this film than you will not forget it in a long time especially the remarkably bizarre ending, just wow!",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
131,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Artsy Fartsy strange slow mess,5,30 May 2021,I just found it so weird and hard to get through. I mean the second half is definitely better than the first and it does pick up. But I just found myself not connecting with the characters or story. Everyone acts so strange. The dialogue feels forced and unnatural at times. Are these real people or are they robots? Theres one point in the film where Nicole Kidman's character is talking about how one of the children will have to die but at least they can have another. And theres always IVF but they probably dont need it and its said so matter of factly. Like I just sat there thinking dafaq? The premise was good and the atmosphere was good but it felt like it was trying too hard to be artsy.I think Barry Keoghan did a good job of playing a creepy unsettling guy. Although his accent work slipped a couple times.Overall.....ehhhhhh.,The Killing of a Sacred Deer

133,Otkon,Not a single realistic emotion or response throughout.,5,23 January 2018,"As if aliens had scooped out the brains of these people, and were awkwardly operating them from hamster balls rattling around in their skulls.The things that are said and done only make sense in the context that the characters are just learning what it means to think, interact, walk, eat. etc. They seem to have no understanding of basic motor skills or societal norms. I think also the aliens that were picked to partake in this theatrical simulation were culled from the malfunctioning fringe.

It doesn't. In fact it goes on and on, getting worse and worse - and it's fascinating and brilliantly acted by Keoghan, Kidman and Farrell.Yorgos is quite a sick man and I'm not sure what he wants to do. However, 5 days after watching it, it's still growing on me and several scenes will haunt me for a long time. I'm not sure it's all good, but it does something with me. It leaves marks. Also, it holds the most authentic portrayal of medical care and hospital environments I've ever seen in a film.Letterboxd: Mårten Larsson (Morten_5).",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
135,gilleliath,a very painstaking exercise in the pointless,7,27 September 2019,"This is an interesting film but maybe not as deep as it thinks it is. The direction, although not a slavish imitation, is very Kubrick-esque, and the music (also like Kubrick) and the decision rarely to use shots at the actors' eye-level create an uneasy sinister feel. I think the director is right not to offer any explanation of the story (Colin Farrell's take is that it's just 'the gods' messing with people), and the deliberately cold, detached style of acting works in this particular case. Though unusual, it's more conventional than The Lobster and better for that.So much on the plus side; however the very randomness means that, although you're intrigued, you don't really care; the story pulls you along, but at the end you're thinking 'so what?'. The only way to combat that would been a really good shock ending - but no, the film goes right on to the end of the line and ends just the way it looked like it would.What parent, though, would knowingly allow their kid to be killed in preference to themselves? I don't care if it's Greek myth, it's ridiculous.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
136,js-66130,CREEP,9,11 April 2020,"A maddeningly slow crawl of robotic, stilted dialogue and sterile sets, sets up a wild second half in an accelerating dynamic of tense desperation. Yes this is the work of Yorgos Lanthimos, and yes it stars Colin Farrell, and yes it has the same creepy distance, frenetic frustration, deranged twist, and unsettling absurdism as their previous collaboration ""The Lobster"". And yes, it too is very, very good.A quick refresher of the Greek tragedy ""Iphigenia in Aulis"" (referenced in the title, and briefly in the story line) is imperative. This is a play about Gods, or doctors in this case. Sin, blame, vengeance, sacrifice, and catharsis, a familiar score, but delivered in a finely crafted nuanced and oblique manner that ever so slowly tightens its grip, leading to a white knuckled conclusion.It's almost a relief when the bizarrely mundane and oh so proper existence of the perfectly symmetric (two doctors, two kids, two sexes) well to do family, is interrupted by an outer teenage force. Hah! A terrifically creepy and clinically cold turn by Barry Keoghan (the Eddie Haskell to the Cleavers here) is the heart of ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"". His insidious, stalking manoeuvres are unnervingly lifeless. In fact, most every character here is god damn lifeless. Disturbingly so. So when they start fighting for their lives, it almost begs the question: what the hell for?The banal and cold character interaction is balanced by a menacing music score, and hovering, ground crawling, and wide angle cinematography. It is an exquisitely disturbing balance. Highly recommended, especially if irritation, discomfort, and insomnia are not a big deal.hipCRANK",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
137,hunter-friesen,Lanthimos creates one of the most perplexing and surreal horror films of the modern era.,8,17 January 2018,"Just like the Greek myth its title comes from, The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a well-made horror film that plays by its own rules and never lets you know what comes next. Colin Farrell reteams with director Yorgos Lanthimos after making one of the best films of 2015, The Lobster. Here he plays Steven Murphy, a gifted surgeon married to an ophthalmologist, Anna (Nicole Kidman). They have two kids, teenager Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and younger Bob (Sunny Suljic). When he is not working or with his family, Steven is spending time with Martin (Barry Keoghan), a teenaged boy whose father died while Steven was operating on him. Martin and Steven's friendship doesn't feel normal and fills you with discomfort every time they meet. Soon, terrible things start to happen that begin to unravel secrets that have fueled a personal vendetta. Just like he did with The Lobster, Lanthimos makes a seemingly unrealistic situation feel like it really could happen. Most of this comes down to his writing that benefits from allowing great interactions between characters. Every scene with Martin and Steven is brilliant to watch as it reveals so much about each character through dialogue that is unrelatable to the main story. Lanthimos fills his screenplay with some of the weirdest and out-of-left-field dialogue that has been filmed. Because of this, the film takes two steps forward when it comes to building suspense and characters, but also one step back because some of the conversations become overly weird and distracting. The film also drags a bit in the middle part as the suspense slowly builds up to a brilliant ending that perfectly wraps everything up in an unforgettable and horrific sequence.In addition to his writing, Lanthimos proves his mastery of the camera as he positions it perfectly to create a fantasy world for the characters, but also a real world for the audience. We get a mix of wide, closeup, and long shots that, while taking place in normal locations like a house or a hospital, give off a sense of otherworldliness and claustrophobia. It makes us think that the characters are all alone in the world and that there will be no help for them by the end.The actors create one of the best ensembles of the year as each of them makes their characters memorable and mysterious. Colin Farrell perfectly captures the essence of a man who is too full of pride to see the harm in his mistakes. He's collected but also unhinged when it comes to people doubting his actions, usually bursting out into a tirade of passive-aggressive remarks in order to reassert his dominance and pride. Nicole Kidman is also brilliant as her character tries to deal with the unfortunate circumstances that have been unfairly set upon her. She perfectly conveys a caring mother that is slowly beginning to lose hope that her situation will resolve itself. The performance of the film goes to Barry Keoghan as Martin. He creates one of the most unnerving and weirdest characters ever. He uses his full arsenal of both verbal and nonverbal acting to make his character feel so uncomfortable to watch as you never know what he'll say or do next. I hope he doesn't get overlooked during awards season as he deserves to be in the conversation for supporting actor. Both Cassidy and Suljic do brilliant work with the material they are given. It's a testament to their amazing work as actors that they can pull off Lanthimos' absurd ideas at such a young age. They feel just as important as the adult characters and don't fall into the usual trap in horror films where the kids are merely objects with no desirable traits. The only performance that underwhelms is Alicia Silverstone's minuscule role as Martin's mother. She feels out of place and can't be taken seriously.While still a slight step down from his previous film, Lanthimos still delivers the goods when it comes to suspense and freshness in this bizarre creep fest. A perfect trifecta of writing, directing, and acting makes this one of the most memorable films of the year.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
138,keelhaul-80856,This Movie Makes No Sense....Absolutely None,3,26 November 2020,"I was interested to see this movie, after seeing decent reviews and a trailer. I couldn't be more disappointed though, upon viewing. They did surprise me, when it turns out the boy is not involved in some sexual relationship with the doctor, neither is the boy his long lost son or anything. It turns out that the boy just wants a dad figure or revenge on the doctor for letting the boy's father die.
However, there is a whole crap load of stuff that makes no sense, and infuriates the audience in this film.
1) Why does everyone in this movie talk like bad actors in a child's play or a local car commercial? The acting is ok, with huge stars like Colin Farrel and Nicole Kidman, but the delivery of lines is utterly absurd. Every single character talks like a quiet, emotionless robot. There are very few times this changes. No one talks in this monotone, depressed manner 24/7. Their dialogue and expressions are the same at a happy bday party or fancy event as they are at the hospital or dealing with death. It just sucks, and is laughably dumb.
2) What is with the wife and daughter lying around on the bed, with their feet towards the headboard, acting like a corpse? Does this turn the doctor on or something? Are they supposed to look like dead deer on the road? Who knows?
3) What the hell is up with the doctor telling his son about jerking off his grandpa???? Super weird and unbelievable. It was like they just wanted to throw in some homo erotic gay vibes throughout, even though this had nothing to do with much of the plot. Who jerks off their dad, unless you were being abused by him, against your will? Never heard such filth. What is up with everyone telling people in public about the daughter having her period? This never happens in real life.
4)The whole plot with the teenager making the doc's kids sick and dying-- WTF???? So, I am supposed to believe that some weird random teen can infect people with all these afflictions, and prestigious doctors and therapists can't figure any of it out? This would have been great, in the right context, but there is never any exposition or suggestion that this kid knows ANYTHING about poisons, medicine, or that he is involved in witchcraft or esoteric events, etc. This leaves you feeling like there are no rules or explanations for anything that happens. Somehow, this dork is just a magical wizard that everyone is terrified of.
5) I told my wife, the doctor has 2 main options at this point-- Tell the police this boy is threatening you and stalking you, and give them the information he warned about, so they can deal with him-- or torture the kid into telling you what he did to them. When he kidnaps the boy, they never show the parents asking what or how the teen is able to do any of this, and eventually, they just let him go.
6) Why does the dad spin around with a bag on his head, in trying to randomly decide which family member to kill? Why not just draw straws or roll dice or something? You would probably just wound the person or keep missing, especially with a bolt action rifle. That was the dumbest way to randomly shoot someone I have ever witnessed. Makes no sense whatsoever.
7) At the end, we see that the family sees the teen, and after they have killed their son, all is ""normal"" again. Umm...so a prominent doctor kills his son, and no one wonders what happened to him? Especially after he was see by a million people and other doctors at a hospital with all sorts of afflictions, and couldn't even walk??? No one would wonder where the kid is, or think it suspicious that he vanished forever? Also, there would be rifle bullets and holes in the walls of the house, and evidence suggesting foul play. I guess this can be written off by them making up a kidnapping story, but still far out.
This whole movie could have been great, if it had more explanation of the teen using occult powers or being a demon, or a genius of medicine or hypnosis, but there are no scenes of any of this, and many other points are disjointed. This movie is entertaining for an hour, and then it just goes downhill, pretending to be groundbreaking, but really just a fart in the wind, with no realism.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Barry Keoghan delivers an amazing performance as a polite yet disturbed teen. Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Raffey Cassidy, and Denise Dal Vera all perform very well.The pacing in the beginning is very slow, but once the darkness of the story kicks in it gets faster.

Visually it's great,but it is just pointless and boring with weird acting that does not make you like any of the actors in any way. The director failed miserably on this regards. The movie is just pointless and just too weird,but not in a good way. Reminds me of an episode of Mr Bean and the movie festival where a director was making a nonsense movie - this is no better. There's nothing to understand in this movie. It's just a pointless sad story. It's not horror in any way( music really tries to make it one) It's just a drama about failed people with very bad(like, VERY BAD) acting. All actors are good,but they were acting badly for some reason and it made no sense. I give it a 3,but this is more of a 1.

141,PotassiumMan,Arresting film that brings the cruelty,9,6 November 2017,"Creeping, frightening and altogether clinical and cold, Yorgos Lanthimos' revenge thriller about a surgeon whose family is suddenly confronted by a peculiar but utterly vindictive teenager will slither into your consciousness in a serpentine and occasionally unsavory way. There are times when this film might feel like an endurance test, but it's worthwhile in the end, because it's such a beautifully acted and vividly directed work of cinema.Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman are excellent as the husband and wife physicians whose lush suburban lifestyle initially looks insular and beyond disturbance. But the real standout in this film is Barry Keoghan, who gives a malevolent performance as the nonchalant teenager whose father was a patient of Farrell's character. Initially, his presence seems merely peculiar and offbeat. But as the boy encroaches more on the family's life, the story takes on a more unsettling tone. Lanthimos' use of deadpan, nondescript dialogue masks something sinister and roiling underneath and the whole cast plays it exquisitely. And while this is not quite the black comedy that some have categorized it as, there are discreet moments of depraved humor.The film has a soundtrack that is classical and mournful but gradually becomes more violent and disquieting as it dots the storyline with dread and despair. As the sense of hopelessness starts to build up, the film ever so briefly becomes a touch static. This brief lapse is forgotten as the climax draws near. What I thought would end with shock and perhaps ambiguity, ends instead with a sense of relief and almost moral victory. It's as if after putting us through this labyrinth of horror and torment, Lanthimos gift-wraps it with a bow. It's a devilish touch. I first got acquainted with his filmmaking style with ""The Lobster"", a film that I reluctantly acknowledged as a good work. Here, he surpasses that achievement with something much closer to the bone and deathly scary. Recommended to the highest degree.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
142,bastille-852-731547,"Lanthimos' Latest is a Solid, Sordid Cinematic Venture",7,21 October 2017,"While I wasn't a huge fan of ""The Lobster"" after viewing it for the first time, it has been a film I gradually came to appreciate and admire for its unique audacity. I was looking forward to Yorgos Lanthimos' new film ever since strong (albeit polarizing) reviews started coming out of Sundance. While not perfect, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is a well-made, twisted film that is audacious and often hard to categorize.It's not easy to give away the plot of this film without bordering on revealing spoilers. As a result, all I will say is that it revolves around the life of a surgeon in Cincinnati who befriends a teenage boy that ends up placing a curse on his family--leading to horrific results. The acting in the film is excellent, and Lanthimos' signature blunt and emotionless style of writing is on full display here. While the film's pacing could definitely have been improved (the main plot device is not introduced until halfway through,) Lanthimos still proves that he knows his stuff as a skilled auteur. Dramatic irony forms the backbone of the film's narrative technique, and it is effectiveness within the film's storytelling is utterly brilliant. Many will be surprised at the shocking ending, which is unlike anything else you have seen in a movie lately (even if you've seen ""mother!"") It will further make the film a very polarizing one for audiences. At the showing I attended this morning, I overheard two people say it was the worst movie they have ever seen while walking out. Make no mistake: this movie is definitely NOT for everyone. But for discerning audiences who can appreciate the unique chills that Yorgos Lanthimos can send down your spine through a pitch-black psychological horror/drama, this movie will do the trick--and to them, I recommend this film. It's intriguing and unique to see a film so polarizing and provocative every once in a while, after all. 7/10",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

144,perica-43151,A harsh condemnation of American hypocrisy,9,24 March 2019,"This movie, inspired by a Greek myth, delivers a harsh verdict on modern USA life. It is very unsettling to some viewers who hate the truth this movie is exposing as they too cannot face their failings, which are deep and disturbing. A rich surgeon, representing power without accountability, whitewashes his responsibility for ""collateral damage"" type of killing of a patient, a father of a whitetr ash sociopath with possible supernatural or terrorist powers, whom he chooses to appease with cheap gifts to lull his sense of justice for his kin, while feeding the fake narrative of benevolence, like ""spreading democracy"" serves as a shameless cover for brutal neo colonial expansion. However, the real price must be payed in order to make peace with the Gods. The selfishness, hypocrisy and lack of morality is present in all of the rich but glaringly banal and shallow members of the surgeon's family. In the end, he runs from responsibility, but manages to stay on top, for yet a little while more. A fitting analogy for dwindling USA power as they continue to kill people all over the world, and try to postpone their comeuppance for a while and continue their cheesy ways, filled with lack of true refinement and overabundance of ketchup.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
145,thedarkhorizon,"Disturbing, messy, raw and - brilliant.",8,27 May 2021,"Every shot and every angle has a message, in this film more than ever. We feel crazily detached from all the characters, not only by their distant, quite held-back acting (intentional), but the slight bird views or off-center compositions give us a rather surveillance and voyeuristic experience. We are with them and we are not.Often we are left with situations and no explanation but a high pitched sound - this is simple but effective and disturbing... awaiting even more doom. The sound tells a story deeper than what we see. We are left until minute 46 with the mystery of all character's connections with each other. This is masterfully done to keep us engaged so long.The story winds down in a whirlwind of sickness, death and an epidemy of heartbreakingly sick emotions... I cant believe I kept watching, because the sickness of it drove mencrazy - but this is what brilliant cinema is about: telling a powerful story with powerful tools. The atmosphere, the imagery, the characters and the pace was, for me, on point.There is what I found in Dogtooth and The favorite: the depth of human emotions wrapped in closeups, classical music, a touch of beautiful surrealism and eerie magic, sickeningly honest and raw characters and understanding that we are all made of sick things that happened to us and made us the sometimes awful people we are today: violent, selfish, messy, disturbing.Lathimos brings the darker side of what it means to be human to cinema and I am forever grateful that I sat through these two painful hours. Would do it again.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
146,magnuslhad,Unsettling,9,9 July 2019,"Yorgos Lanthimos masterfully creates a suspenseful atmosphere in this tale of a surgeon made to atone for a past sin by a sinister teenage boy he befriends. The monotone delivery, empty streets, clean frames, and drip-feeding of information all mesh into a cumulative effect that gets right under your skin. The relentlessness of the antagonist is chilling. The stubbornness of the protagonist infuriating. But there is also dark humour, especially when the children compete to be the one who is saved. Great performances, a judicious use of Steadicam tracking shots, and a demonic, haunting score, are all points that jumped out on first viewing. Highly recommended.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
147,danielharden,The Killing of a Sacred Career,7,30 October 2017,"Yorgos Lanthimos is one of my favourite directors, perhaps even my favourite. His surrealist style is bold and undeniably him, as it is both humorously absurd whilst also containing a deep-rooted and complex message. The Lobster would be Lanthimos' first English language film and is arguably his best to date, the debate being whether Dogtooth is better. Now Lanthimos has moved from England to America with his second English language film, The Killing of a Sacred Deer. The film tells the story of Steven, a surgeon who befriends a disturbed teenage boy only to find himself with an impossible ultimatum on his hands. The Killing of the Sacred Deer is very much a Lanthimos film, however, it doesn't reach the heights of Lanthimos' best work, and feels a little too much like an attempt of commercialisation.Don't get me wrong, Lanthimos' niche surreal style is ever-present in The Killing of the Sacred Deer. The script is filled equally with Lanthimos' hilariously direct dialogue and pointless high level of detail in that dialogue. As well as this, Lanthimos' signature surreal visuals glisten through the films stunning cinematography. Cinematographer, Thimios Bakatakis, changes up his style, favouring the fish eye lens, resulting in a fantastic sense of atmosphere and an almost CCTV feel to the film. Additionally, the film's score works beautifully with the visuals in the film, especially with one specific gruesome metaphor. It is by far Lanthimos' best use of sound to date. All of this comes together to create Lanthimos' auteur style to which I've come to expect in his films.This all being said, the Lanthimos stamp isn't as prominent in the Killing of a Sacred Deer. Although there are surreal moments, they are few in comparison to Lanthimos' entire filmography. This is definitely Lanthimos' most accessible film, as the story is very simple and easy to follow, however, this is where the film falters for me, as a fan of Lanthimos' bold approach. The surreal images in the Killing of a Scared Deer are few and far between, and unfortunately, aren't replaced with anything of paralleling interest. This is a real shame as it's the off-kilter visuals that I've come to want, love and expect of Lanthimos' work. I can see many being bored of this film as the entertainment comes from the experimentation. As I've already said, the story is straightforward and the surreal images are few, therefore the film is rather linear and ""normal"" for the most part. I can't help but feel that Lanthimos is attempting to crack America with this film, almost abandoning his style along the way. He is attempting to make his niche style mainstream which is a paradox in itself. I can almost feel Lanthimos' loss of self-confidence, the pressure to make something more conventional and realistic must get to him immensely, but his attempt to become a modern-day David Lynch falls short. Instead, he's shooting himself in the foot Overall, the Killing of a Sacred Deer is disappointing by Lanthimos' standards. As a film it's great, but as a fan of the Greek director, I was let down by the lack of abstract and experimentation. The story is just too simple for Lanthimos and the film just feels to me like a crisis of self. However, if Lanthimos' filmography wasn't already so rich with abstract ideas and experimental images, then I would probably find myself enjoying The Killing of a Sacred Deer a lot more than I did. This is a multiple watch film and I look forward to giving The Killing of a Sacred Deer a better chance.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

The director is trying so hard to be an 'auteur' it's really painful to watch. This movie actually chokes on it's own pretentiousness. There are also images that suggest a preoccupation with necrophilia and the movie isn't even centered around that. There's an anesthesiologist who is willing to violate his oath for the most pitiful and unerotic hand job in the history of hand jobs. I don't care if it's being done by a grim Nicole Kidman or not, I don't see the up side. The premise is absolutely absurd, that some kid could poison two children, have the mother and father know about it, have the crack medical team at a major hospital not be able to do anything bout it and not have the police yank the cure out of the kid's asshole, metaphorically speaking. The movie is incredibly cruel toward children, it's basic core is built around that, if that gives an idea what you are signing up for with this turd fest. The performances are stilted and so stylized it's obvious this director is straining his gonads to be the next Stanley Kubrick but the performances simply come across as terribly self-conscious, unconvincing and emotionally false at their core. He even has a Kubrickian soundtrack with Ligeti snippets in it for cripes sake. The camera work is so self conscious you can almost hear the director yelling at the operator about the setups. I was going to give this movie 3 stars out of respect for the cast having to endure this but for the life of me I have no idea why they signed up for it, so I had to deduct 2 stars. The ending is totally idiotic and it presents itself as if it's one the greatest moments in cinematic history. This is easily the most pretentious and full of steaming hot bullshit movie of the new millennium. The same people who think 'LaLa Land' was great must be responsible for the 7 star rating. And I really wish those people would stop rating movies. They have no idea of difference between good thought driven cinema and pretentious cow flop. I had to divide this movie into two viewings because the whole experience was bringing me down and I had to shut it off midway. I was literally counting the minutes for this movie to end.

156,themovieparadise,"Nice Attempt, But Ultimately Fails",4,17 November 2017,"Yorgos Lanthimos goes for a distinct style that ultimately fails. One might perceive it as dark comedy, though the humor in it is more that what is being said is being said at all. We're not laughing with the movie; we're laughing at it. Characters will have asides either with their dialogue or with their actions where they do or say something so outrageous that you can't help but to laugh. Colin Farrell's talk to his son about an incident involving his father certainly comes to mind. These moments serve no purpose; they do not further the story. They don't really add to our understanding of the characters. All it is is fluff. It's extra baggage that, for whatever reason, Lanthimos thought would be necessary or funny, and it's not at all. The film is littered with these asides, and all it did was dilute a rather interesting story. Buried under all of this extra sh*t is a story that could have made for a fascinating and riveting thriller. But instead, all we have is an interesting concept wasted by a writer who doesn't know how to stick to the basics of screen writing. It's amazing that I'm saying this about an Oscar-nominated screenwriter, but I don't know how else to put it.

If you've seen the trailer you know already most of the themes that are explored in this movie (with the sole exception of the ending). Which is pretty disappointing. That's not how you're supposed to make a trailer.When I said that the movie is weird I meant it. The ambiance is very strange and can only be described as ""autistic"" (and no, this is not a joke). At the beginning of the movie all of the characters act as if they're on the autism spectrum. All the protagonists talk as if they're robots, completely devoid of anything that could be described as an emotion. As the movie progresses and as things start to escalate the protagonists finally start to act like normal human beings. It's highly likely that this was done intentionally but I found it to be a little ""gimmicky"".The one thing that the movie has going for it are the totally ridiculous dialogues. I know, this is supposed to be a horror movie but some of the dialogues in the movie were so bizarre that they're more akin to comedy. 
Many of the funniest dialogues were even exaggerated due to the contrasting presentation of the actors. Here are some of my personal favorites:
""I won't let you go until you taste my tart""... (obvious double-entendre)
""My girl started menstruating last week""... (WTF?!)
""Can you take off your shirt and show me?""... (said the kid to the doctor)
""I will make you eat your hair!""... (spoke the father to his son)
And that's not even all of it. There is this weird scene where the protagonist tells his son a ""secret"". Believe me when I tell you this; it's quite messed up (the story that he tells him).There was a lot of suspense but I can't help but feel confused. I don't quite get the movie to be perfectly honest. I think it was too artsy fartsy but maybe I'm just missing something. Who knows?Final verdict: I personally couldn't wholeheartedly recommend the movie but I do respect the execution of the director.

169,texshelters,The Killing of a Sacred Hour,4,17 December 2017,"Scared Deer Goes Wrong when the Main Character, Like the Director, Can't Decide How to End it. ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is from the director of ""The Lobster."" Like ""The Lobster"", the film had a promising premise that failed in the end. Perhaps director and writer Yorgos Lanthimos needs to bring in some other writers and directors to give him a reality check on his next film ending. And he isn't the first auteur who needed help. Lynch and Trier come to mind with some of their incomprehensible films. I don't mind the incomprehensible, it's stupidity I can't abide. The film is too drawn out and too predictable for all its length. Once the main premise was revealed, there were few surprises left in the film. What was a surprise was just how predictable the ending was. There were several ways the film could have gone that would have been more interesting, compelling and surprising. However, the film chose the easy ending by not deciding and leaving the ending to chance. Literally. The motivations of the father in the film, surgeon Steven Murphy, played dully by Colin Farrell, were unclear. Moreover, his ability to make simple decisions had been long damaged by an apparent, unproven mistake, made in his past. And it is that mistake, one that is pivotal to the plot, that moves the story. If you are going to use an event as a driver of action, it better make sense within the narrative. And it better be clearly true. We needed more detail on that event, but why make it easy for your audience to understand your film?Steven is haunted by Martin, the teenage son of a former patient. It makes no sense that Steven would keep him around and allow Martin to harass him. The script lacks the clues to Steven's motivations, perhaps empathy, perhaps guilt, and even if it did, I don't think Farrell could have pulled it off. The film plays like an episode of Black Mirror, minus a focus on technology that is a hallmark of the television series. The problem was that it wasn't as good as a Black Mirror episode and it was much more predicable. That's too bad, because the first act of 'Sacred Deer' was compelling. Things happen in 'Sacred Deer' without a reason. There is no underlying motive for too many of the key actions in the story. We are supposed to take it on faith the way the characters act. Only Martin's motivations are clear within the film. 
 
As long as critics tout films that have incomplete scripts full of cracks, characters with unclear motivations and endings that certainly fit with the narrative but offer no surprises, films such as ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" will be touted as great cinema. And we can expect more mediocrity. Certainly, with a slew of mindless block busters on screens, superhero films, robots, Star Wars and horrors film, critics clamor for more art films. But that doesn't mean we have to cheer mediocre ones.Rating: Rent it. 
We shouldn't reward lazy story telling. See 'Lady Bird' again instead or for a laugh you want to avert your eyes from, see 'The Disaster Artist.' If you want a good creep fest, I recommend ""Borgman"", the Japanese film ""Creepy"" or last years ""Split.""Peace,

170,Bofsensai,More Emperor's (Euripides) clothes tedium: yet with powerful modern day allegory punch,5,1 July 2018,"Having already reviewed earlier Lobster, just have to also add in another on yet another (latest) tedium effort from the viewer challenging Mr. Lanthimos.Possibly, like caviar, or quadruple IPA's, there's an undoubted 'acquired taste' aspect to his offerings: both undoubtedly, absolutely certainly, essential to exciting life's pleasures, so interesting and not in the least worthless: but not necessarily palatable!
And indeed, palette-wise, despite seemingly washed out colour, if you feel film should give you the time to ponder over and 'drink in' the mise-en-scene (after scene!) in wide angled slow pan-in shots, (á la a sorta Kubrick - similarly super soundtrack music use, too and even Kidman almost reprising her Eyes Wide Shut persona role here, too), this will no doubt, ah, draw you into its shenanigans.. But still not my cup of tea (glass of IPA!)Ah, yes, those Lanthimos longueur shenanigans; for as to what the heck is unfolding, it is no longer plot-spoiling to know - as most now have found out - its perplexing plotting is inspired by an ancient Greek tale of the omnipotent power of a Goddess almighty over mere mortals, but who needed / bargained with her capricious goodwill to escape isolation instead of impending likely death ... 
coz that's given in the film - as otherwise why throw into the scene where the headmaster of Farrell's daughter's school, he remarks she has turned in a top graded piece on this otherwise formerly obscure ancient Greece Euripdes' myths story?
And of Farrell's character delivery, despite another emotionless performance - although presumably precisely as required of the character - by Farrell, conversely his nemesis in Barry Keoghan imbues his with a stupendous slow burning, smouldering, suppressed menace. Knocks spots off any modern psychopath portrayal!Ok, so most cineaste's smugly know what Lanthimos (and co-writer Efthymis Filippou) is referencing in what would otherwise be a quite tediously paced film.
But, one may surely reasonably wonder, to what purpose to be moved to resurrect such an otherwise obscure bit of Greek mythology and place it before us in such a way?
Well, he's (they're) Greek too, isn't he?
And what has recently happened to Greece, in referencing an apparently capricious, almighty powerful, if not deity, then entity, over its populace's (financial) life or death ...?
Oh, and Euripdes' tale was a tragedy, right? 
Ah, ha .. so, a neat modern times allegory of victimisation in the hands of forces you cannot, as reality is run, think you can bargain with ... I see. Tragic - Disturbing.And along with further disturbing, as surely Lanthimos and Filippou intended, challenge to the sensibilities is that in its mythic referencing denouement, is the relative fates of the family member that most sucked up to the almighty (he's a surgeon, no less) patriarch, compared with the one that most thwarted his supposed authority. 
Now, in that, what does Lanthimos want us to take way from this? How best to deal with powerful forces beyond your control: Obsequiousness and flattery usually will get you nowhere, but in this one, it gets you - (just coincidentally of course, because its supposedly random, as like at the whim of a God -dess) - survival!
Ah, I see.
So, yep, not worthless to sit through / tolerate: but cinematically impressive?
Well, there goes that Emperor again.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
171,filmtravel101,"Terrible script - boring, pointless and Yorgos needs to see a shrink for his problems not Make movies.",1,15 December 2017,I wish there was a ZERO for this film. Yorgos might have great talent as a director but he sucks at writing. This was by far the most boring film and pointless story ever created. Okay we can buy into the notion that the doctor killed his father.. but this dark film is like a zombie trying to imitate a film by Stanley Kubrick. Sorry for the critics that think this is fantastic writing but it simply does not work. The lobster was decent yet this is almost unwatchable especially with such talented actors. Kudos to the crew for agreeing to this nonsense but at some point the Producers will pull the plug on this Greek piece of crap .... it was like watching paint dry on a wall.. only to see the obvious. Yorgos should return to Greece and consider seeking help from a shrink for his mental issues of thinking this is a worthwhile story to present. Maybe he can do a remake of the Tenant...but throw himself off of the building as a finale. What has happened to Hollywood that they allow this type of garbage. 1 star for the actors who surely had to endure this torture.,The Killing of a Sacred Deer

However after seen this movie, the fingerprints of the director are unmistakable. The cinematography of the film is impeccable worth the long and wide shots drawing the viewer into each scene. There's no doubt that this movie leaves you feeling uneasy and thinking about what you watched. The dialogue and script delivered by the actors gives an otherworldly feel to the whole movie. With lots of interactions that leave you wondering in which world that would br normal.

175,DVR_Brale,Runs slowly and feels esoteric,7,31 December 2017,"After seeing Afonofsky's Mother I thought I may not stumble upon more disturbing and strange movie in quite some time. And I was wrong. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is as weird as it gets. Firstly, this film has some of David Lynch's feeling to it. It runs slowly and feels aberrant and nefarious. Secondly, all horror elements are entirely psychological in nature. There you have a combination which only few are going to be able to withstand, let alone enjoy.If you fall into this group of people, equip yourself with forbearance. Don't expect to understand it at first. This is one of the movies I like to describe as being enjoyable post festum, where you have to put together different parts of the movie and make some sense out of it. Contrary to that, it may even be the case that searching for and adequate interpretation only ruins the experience, as Lynch once described his Mullholand Dr. No matter which impression you get, Killing of a Sacred Deer is certainly a film difficult to put in words or understand correctly since there is no ""correct way"" to it. That may be the explanation of most of the low rating reviews here on IMDb: you can't appreciate it if you approach it with too conservative mindset.A thing that troubles me with this types of movies is that I always get the impression that directors putter a little too much with New age elements which most of us are not aware of. There are a lot of them in this movies and the central motif of a scapegoat is of course one of them. That may be another explanation of many low rating reviews: people are sick and tired of primitive concepts being rendered as esoteric.Taken everything together, I'd still recommend you to at least give it a try if you find yourself falling into the upper mentioned group of people.

I believe it is a simple, strange revenge story and it touches the themes that usually come along with it such as guilt, fear, denial, sacrifice, etc. The film is quite slow and the pace is not exactly even so you will need a bit of patience to get through it. Direction and acting are great. Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman both deliver strong performances but the real star would be Barry Keoghan who portrayed Martin brilliantly.

The affectation of having the actors recite their emotionless lines like Stepford wives is pointless and adds nothing to the story.

The audience's hope to see that the wicked get punished is a vent. Although revenge is carried out in the movie, the people who actually died, the boy's father and the doctor's younger son, are all innocent.

Farrell plays a cardiologist who befriends the 16yr old son of a man he killed in surgery. After introducing the boy to his wife and children, the kids become unexplainably ill.

189,axapvov,Misunderstood Tragedy,7,22 January 2018,"Wow, I just wanted to write a short review but after seeing the tide of unrestrained bad reactions I kinda feel the urge to ""defend"" it.I had no idea the film was made by Yorgos Lanthimos until the end, in fact, I watched it completely blind, no info whatsoever, just how I like it. It´s gotta be said, the film sets the tone from the first second. It gets right into a disquieting atmosphere and maintains it for quite a while, until it gets plain distressing. At first I wanted to hate it. Affected yet robotic acting, intrusive music, annoying camera angles and a whole sense of pretention were my first thoughts, and I guess the last ones from a lot of people. Yet, the film creepiness slowly but steadily convinced me and dragged me in. As some critic very well said, the film crawls like a reptile. Chosing the less obvious camera angle is a legit trick to make us uncomfortable and so is the taste for symmetry, which places the characters in theatrical tableaus. They move like puppets in a set because this isn´t a character study. They´re kind of figurines with a tragic purpose. The detachment is required to get to the inevitable dilemma in one piece. Greek tragedies aren´t famous for deep character studies, they rather keep them deceitfully simple, symbolic. In this I might be dead wrong, though, ti na su po;Is it absurd? Yes, so what? It introduces an absolutely nonsensical element and then develops it in a plausible way. The same goes for countless horror, fantasy or sci-fi films. Is it boring? No, it´s not, and anyway that´s not a valid criticism half of the time. I once fell asleep at a heavy metal show, so there you go. Is it pretentious? Yes, but not as much as it seems and again, that isn´t either good or bad. That can apply to Kubrick and Tarkovsky, to Haneke, Reygadas, Angelopoulos, Zvyagintsev... that´s like saying the film is blue. The tragedy is heavy enough for its tone to match it. Is it disgusting? Yes, but the violence is contextualized, which is extremely important. It avoids sadism to the point we don´t even see half of the violence.Now, I admit it loses a bit near the end, although the premise is so insane it kept me very curious to know the outcome and the climax does climax indeed. I find the bits of psycho humor to be no less than genius. Overall, Lanthimos takes risks, incredibly big ones, and that takes huge amounts of confidence and bravura. We sould all be at least thankful for that, specially in a time with so many complaints of wasted potential taking the safe road. It takes bits of The Shining, The Omen and who knows what else, and makes something new, unique and controversial. By the way, Colin Farrell does a great job, but Nicole Kidman... oh my god, she is on a whole other level, absolutely committed to it. She is always as good as she chooses to be and in this one she´s all in. I am too.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

The Lobster feels like something beyond your dreams (nightmares?), while this felt like could, for the most part, happen.I certainly embraced the off-putting atmosphere a lot better here, and I feel he made these characters much more realistic. They could definitely be the weird family that every class at school seemed to have. This family is played exceptionally well, as it is so different to anything an actor would do if not working with Lanthimos. Martin is played with a lurking feeling of unpredictability expertly by Barry Keoghan.I love the cinematography and direction here as well, it shouldn't work, but it just does.

We then see Martin's big Victorian home in Hyde Park. They have ample food, nice furniture and clean clothes. I don't think the director/writer understands what low income Ohio looks like.

Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is the heart surgeon in question, who befriends the darkly enticing Martin, a local youth. We're not sure who Martin is, but it becomes clear he has a stake in Steven's family, including his ophthalmologist wife Anna and especially their children Bob and Kim.Martin and Steven meet frequently, and as Martin is entering adolescence he has all sorts of questions on adulthood. Kim, herself, is blooming and falls for the quirky Martin, before her brother Bob is struck by lower-body paralysis. Kim meets the same fate. What's going on? It seems to be psychological, but we get a dark hint as Kim is said to have delivered a great lecture on the myth of Iphigenia, and this myth is made life.Steven, being incurably logical and earth-based, cannot fathom that the fates are involved in a spiral of revenge that will force him to make an unearthly choice. How he arrives to that choice and the ensuing back and forth between he, Martin and his family are fine moments to watch and absorb. Especially funny is a conversation between Kim and Bob about Bob's possessions, which will leave some in stitches.Highly recommended for those looking for that dark, cold movie that can work your cockles.

198,lumieretrain,The Killing of a Sacred Deer by Yorgos Lanthimos,5,21 March 2020,"The stories about the main characters who face the horror, from a curse which has been thrown at them or even at the people they love, after they have committed a tragic mistake, are one of the scariest and brutal stories to explore in the books, poetries, comic books, movies and television series. Especially to see how the horror would get worse to the main characters, as their emotions become so desperate to take a dramatic choice to get blood on their hands. Once the main characters have been set free from the curse, they become then so sad for their dearest loss. The auteur filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos seems really interested to explore this theme, but set in the modern times, by maintaining the dark atmospheres of the theme. In 2017 came out The Killing of a Sacred Deer by Yorgos Lanthimos with Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman and Barry Keoghan. The movie's plot: The surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is a charismatic happy married man, who takes care his wife Anna Murphy (Nicole Kidman) and his two children, whenever they need. Steven has also an empathetic bond with the teenager Martin (Barry Keoghan), where everything goes well as an ordinary life. Until Steven realizes his family has been cursed by Martin, who seeks vengeance for a mistake committed by the surgeon. The premises of the movie seems pretty clear, about the direction of the story, which is told through the dark atmospheres and unexpected moments. Especially to see how initially the main characters are living in a happy life, as they keep moving forward with their choices. Until the horror starts, by making the story scarier, without giving an immediate answer, about the next decisions taken by the main characters. The editing has been elaborated by creating the specific rhythm, without letting the audience be distracted by anything. As the audience is captured, by the most unexpected scenarios of the story. The monologues and dialogues have been elaborated, by getting clear about how the main characters are presented, especially how later on Martin would be shown sinister. The camera tells the story to make the scenes look like, a powerful painting in every single angle shots and in every single camera movements. The lightings help as well by creating the atmosphere, in the sinister way to be unforgettable for the audience eyes. Collin Farrell did an excellent performance as Steven Murphy, a surgeon who is satisfied and always focused to do the right thing. But since the curse has hit his family, Steven becomes slowly desperate to search a solution to safe his family. Until Steven realizes he has to take a dramatic choice, if he wants to stop the curse. Even there should have been more explorations, about if Steven feels more or less guilt about the mistake he has committed. To see if Steven would try to be a better person, by trying to take the right choices. Nicole Kidman has done a well done performance as Anna Murphy, the wife of Steven who has been always supportive on Steven and her family. Once Anna realizes what kind of horror is happening, she would try to be as helpful as possible. Barry Keoghan did an interesting performance as Martin, a teenager who looks initially normal until it would be slowly seen how sinister he is. Especially in every Martin's face expression, as well as how he takes decision to make Murphy's family live in a hell. Even there should have been more details, about who is actually Martin to throw a powerful curse to Murphy's family. Even the movie tries to give some metaphorical explanations about the reason of the curse, it is still not enough to give an explanation about Martin's evil abilities. There is not enough explanation either about the relationship between Martin and his mother, to see if she does know or does not know about his evil actions and how she would react. As the movie has some potential to be intriguing, but it has some unanswered questions, to be not completely surprising. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a scary and intriguing movie, with some unanswered questions to be not completely convincing.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

202,thirtyfivestories,The Devil Needs An Invite,9,10 November 2017,"Tragedies are best played out in secret. The participants must be self-conscious to a fault, and the curse facilitator needs to have an insatiable score to settle. A Cincinnati suburb is fashioned into a Greek amphitheater, and the gods of wine and harvest are the only ones watching.This deadly production has a singular moral, but it is not being taught to the audience. Steven, the star surgeon is the unfortunate recipient of this mythical lesson. With a wife retrofitted to his peculiar kinks, a son quick to adjust career paths, and a daughter who is an A+ expert on the horrors he faces, Steven has yet to make a sacrifice worthy of his current comfort.Martin sticks like gum on Steven's sole. The boy's leverage is secret and potent, easily masked by tidy alibis and half truths. Steven passes professional blame onto anesthesiologists for malpractice fatalities. Step one is to properly administer sleep. The knife wielders rarely are the killers. Martin wishes to change that.Steven has outstretched his wings, cradling Martin in nondescript diners and parking garages. When he gives the young man a watch that dwarfs his own, Martin's attachment reaches the final phase. One last peace offering remains before a game of addition spirals into subtraction. Survival will be reduced to haircuts and epic recitals. The suburban theater bloats with situational irony, the plot engulfs sexuality and innocence in the same gulp. The modern mansion shrinks to a living room, and the villain disappears into coffee mugs at an incomplete booth. The city with medical advances ten or more years beyond their sun- burst automobiles would suggest, has no answer for the scientific Steven. His careful domestic construction falls apart with about as much explanation as Bill Murray's temporal tornado.

Farrel needs the money and worth it, since he is the only one who brings some acting and emotion into this exposé.
The children are pretending to be a boy and girl.With the present media trials of child abusers, this film attempts to get into the mind of someone who would kill a sacred deer for the greater good.
These murderers justify the young and innocent's willing sacrifice of life force, to reinvigorate the life force of themselves, the killers.If there are any hidden secrets in this film they live in the head of the actors, the writer and director.
Kid Man's behaviour is astonishing but fits as someone who is totally heartless but consoles itself with the fact that another kid can be produced to replace the sacrificed.So if you are a a Farrel fan , go straight to New World or In Bruges. the other freaks in this show are there for the ag.enda",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

I only got 67 minutes in until I felt the need to skim through the rest to see what happened because I didn't care to wait. The characters and their portrayal are extremely flat and dumb. Had they had any common sense and gone to the police directly after a high schooler threatened to kill an entire family, this would've been a much shorter movie, and the characters would've seemed much more relatable. The people in this seem to have absolutely no emotion either. When a father shoved a doughnut down a kids throat, the mom standing directly next to him didn't seem to care at all, when any other person would be losing their minds.

209,rblenheim,Lanthimos gives us a Kubrick-like thriller that you won't ever forget,9,17 March 2018,"Iconoclastic Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos has followed up last year's dark comic gem, ""The Lobster"", with another audacious film that bears his twisted mark on every frame: ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"", its title drawn from a line in the Greek play, Iphigenia at Aulis by Euripides. Its story begins rather conventionally before veering off into the bizarre: A skilled cardiac surgeon seemingly befriends a strange teenage boy and introduces him to his family. The boy named Martin seems to have some form of a neurological disorder, and gradually we discover his connection to the surgeon and the threat he brings to the entire family. Colin Farrell plays the surgeon, Nicole Kidman his wife, but it is Barry Keoghan who takes center stage to the drama, playing the intruding boy with a perceptible mental unbalance that grows more sinister as the film goes on. Relying more on the tenants of psychological horror than the societal satire and the Kafkaesque fable of ""The Lobster"", ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is a masterpiece of the absurd, its every frame showing the influence of Stanley Kubrick at his most pristine with its pure cold visuals and precise razor-sharp cutting. It won best screenplay at Cannes, but it is Lanthimos' perfect compositions and subdued anger that reaches out of the screen and shakes the viewers' sensibilities that defines it. Disturbing on different levels and perhaps inevitably unpleasant to some, it is a film that will rivet you to your seat until its provocative conclusion, one that could have you thinking about it for days after.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

I get that some people thought this was another exercise in prententiousness... but honestly... I don't think Lanthimos took things seriously enough to merit that judgement.

214,adam-may-bower,Compelling,8,2 June 2018,"'The Killing Of A Sacred Deer' is a compelling and bizarre thriller that tells a brilliant story in a peculiar, unnatural world. Right away, it is noticeable that this is not a normal film, through the way the characters interact with one another. Film critic Mark Kermode articulates this perfectly by describing the dialogue as ""theatrically mundane"" with discussions ""delivered in the monochromatic rhythms of a trance state"". Initially, this comes off as bizarre and plausibly even uncomfortable, but by the end of the film, it's passable and actually contributes to the overall effect. Director Yorgos Lanthimos certainly has an acquired taste when it comes to his filmmaking, but it is done all in the right ways in this film. The story itself, based on the Greek myth of Iphigenia, is a captivating tale of revenge, with interesting characters and an ongoing tension that keeps you hooked until the disturbing end. Combining genres of psychological thriller and revenge horror, Lanthimos creates a film that is unforgettable. The acting is also phenomenal, with outstanding performances by Colin Farrell and Barry Keoghan, as well as Nicole Kidman. Another notable highlight of this film is the visual aspect, which is essentially amazing. The cinematography is striking, with a great use of colours and tones that add style to this film. Overall, this film is a bizarre and disturbing thriller with brilliant direction, acting and cinematography and is definitely worth a watch.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
215,smithpaulusmc,"Dark, Slow, and Chilling",7,19 December 2020,"The Killing of a Scared Deer stars Collin Farrell as a fated cardiologist in a moving reframing of the Greek myth Iphigenia in Taurus. Directed by Greek artist Yorgos Lanthimos who has grown in popularity for his last two films The Lobster and The Favorite, The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a meaningful, slow-burn epic that has you questioning the powers of the fates in your own life.The Killing of a Sacred Deer follows Doctor Steven Murphey (Farrell) and his family (Nicole Kidman, Raffey Cassidy, and Sunny Suljic) as Murphey's children mysteriously lose their ability to walk and their appetite to eat. The curse on Murphey's children stems from Martin (Barry Keghan), a young boy whose father dies under Doctor Murphey's care while he operated under the influence of alcohol. Martin seeks revenge and ultimately announces that the curse will be lifted should Doctor Murphey kill one of his own children in an ""eye for an eye"" scenario.In a departure from most modern films that value highwire action and comedy to draw a crowd, Lanthimos and his crew of wildly talented actors deliver deadpan performances that raise the hair on the back of your neck. Notably, Barry Keoghan's portrayal of the sinister yet unassuming Martin is frightening to the extreme with his ability to contrast innocence with near demonic intentions.If I had to highlight the single variable that drives The Killing of a Sacred Deer, the one thread that pulls the audience along throughout the two-hour A24 saga, it would be its wonderfully frightening use of soundtrack and leitmotif. The Killing of a Sacred Deer. The pairing of emotionally draining and epic choruses at the hand of Franz Schubert with Latin and German operatic movements engenders a frightening sense of dread, one that brilliantly capitalizes on the juxtaposition of murder and revenge against the backdrop of a seemingly perfect American family.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
216,Deathstryke,"Cold, stilted and irritatingly obtuse",2,3 December 2017,"I went into ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" knowing that it was based on an ancient Greek tragedy which I had not read and that the trailer was ...pretty weird. So I was braced for something more auteur and symbolic that I would have to retrospectively interpret and extract meaning from, not something immediately tangible or obvious.However, try as I might, there was not one meaningful thing I could extract from this ponderous, drawn out mess of a film. I am not familiar with Yorgos Lanthimos's previous work -I have not seen the Lobster- but I'm told TKOASD is very much in keeping with his stylistic quirks; Emotionally vacant, surrealist art installations masquerading as film.A brief, spoiler-free summary of the plot: A heart surgeon, his wife and two children are befriended/stalked by a mysterious teenager who's strange mannerisms belie a dark, twisted plan and a destructive supernatural power. The plot and its fantastical leanings didn't bother me. What did bother me was the awkward execution.The cast of one dimensional archetypes all ramble their lines in a robotic manner, their eyes fixed in a detached, glacial stare. It is impossible to connect with any of them on an emotional level, even when the stakes rise and certain characters are met with horrific choices, the focus seems to be less about conveying the emotional depth that a real person might plunge to in those circumstances, and more about favoring the artifice of the shot. Barry Keoghan's Martin -the malevolent teenager stalking the family- is perhaps the only character served well by this robotic approach. His monotone aloofness, combined with his shifty vacant eyes make him feel all the more disturbing and unpredictable.Colin Farrell on the other hand, gives one of the most stultifying performances of his career. His character, Stephen, a heart surgeon and father of two, is so utterly devoid of pathos, employing his frowny face and flat middle-class Dublin cadence to every line, he fails to make Stephen believable or likable, even when he's blubbering snot all over himself in one incongruously candid scene, it feels artificial and contrived, as in the next scene he goes right back to being a cold, miserable android again.Nicole Kidman does a better job with her material as Stephen's wife, at least her delivery is the least morose of the lot, but her performance is still frustratingly restricted in places where it should be amplified, making her mostly unsympathetic.Stephen's children, the innocent victims of Martin's vengeful plot, should surely have some element of likability if we are to feel any fear for their predicament, but alas they too are passive, unfeeling robots who fail to engage.The film instead relies on gimmicky mechanics to convey tension and dread where the stolid acting falls short. There are dozens of shots where the camera slowly zooms down long corridors or empty rooms, accompanied by screechy, dissonant sound effects as if trying to convince you that the dreary banality of what's unfolding on screen is actually threatening and you should be very afraid.The film is also full of pointlessly weird scenarios and obtuse dialogue that seem to be there solely for the purpose of making the viewer squirm uncomfortably. There are many bizarre references to menstruation and armpit hair, a pointless sex scene involving a nude Nicole Kidman pretending to be anesthetized so her pervert husband can get it up, and one particularly risible scene where Colin Farrell confesses to his young son that when he was a small boy, he happened upon his sleeping father and masturbated him until ""The bed sheets were covered in sperm"".The nonsense continues at a creeping pace until the under-whelming, implausible climax, which feels a poor reward for enduring what was essentially a 30 minute short film stretched into two hours. I don't think any amount of retrospective research on ""Iphigenia in Aulis"" will change my rating. One of the worst films of 2017.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
217,fletcherc21,"Dark, Haunting, and Uncomfortable",7,13 November 2017,"The Killing of a Sacred Deer starts off very slowly, very little happens in the first 40 minutes or so besides awkward interactions between the characters. Even those interactions are lifeless and the characters are deadpan and unemotional, in the same style Yorgos Lanthimos used in ""The Lobster."" The only response the beginning of the film can draw from the audience is the discomfort that the characters should be feeling, but don't seem to be aware of.Then, there is a sudden stylistic change and the film suddenly becomes dark and twisted very unexpectedly. The film becomes true horror without any of the classic buildup. There is not a single jumpscare or traditional horror cliché, but it still managed to terrify me more than anything I have seen in a long time without ever raising my pulse.Nicole Kidman delivers a powerful performance while Barry Keoghan shines as a deeply disturbed and strangely powerful teenager. The film would have an even greater effect if the characters were actually relatable, but instead they all exist in some sort of other dimension where many people are deadpan and oddly direct. It also would have benefited from a greater urgency to actually begin the story near the beginning of the film, rather than 40 minutes in.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Boy, was I wrong! There's more here than meets the eye and this film delivers on the unexpected, not to mention the mysterious elements, on what a good suspenseful story is about.An absolutely perfect family life is depicted here, but as you watch, you know there's 'skeletons in the closet' and that nothing is perfect as it seems. You can tell the characters are 'hiding something' until you eventually grow to realize, ""Are these people playing with a full deck?"" and ""How long will it be before they're all dragged off to a sanitarium?""None of that happens here, but from what transpired, it should have. Nicole Kidman is in a ""Stepford Wives"" type of position with her two kids in perfect health, but for some reason, they can't walk anymore and have disability problems although doctor's tests prove nothing is wrong. Colin Farell is the doctor/husband/father who seems to have it ""all together"" regarding his career and family life, but slowly starts 'unraveling' as the situation with his kids gets even more bizarre. The problem seems to lay with the mysterious teenage boy that the doctor is buddies with for some reason. There's also the boy's mother who has some kind of weird ""hand fetish"" for the doctor and made her obsession well know about that.Mental instability, I admit, tends to happen and this film perfectly shows that no matter how great your life is, the golden crown can always be tarnished in one way or another. I admit I had trouble understanding this flick on my first viewing. I first looked at everything from a realistic psycho angle, later from a mentally deranged angle and then further still, from a supernatural angle.

222,someokiedude,Basically a bad Kubrick knock off.,6,25 June 2020,"The Killing of a Sacred Deer is meandering and dull, at once aping Kubrick and then some Hitchcock for good measure. Many of my friends and critics that I admire have praised Lanthimos as a brave new talent and a new subversive voice. Sadly, I was hoping that he would be remarkable and interesting.The most disappointing aspect of this film was the acting, a lot of it falls flat and is stilted. It was unfortunate seeing talented people like Kidman (who, by the way, is aging like a fine wine) and Farrell acting like emotionally stunted robots, when some of their previous efforts showcase that they have range. No one acts right in the situation that they're thrown into, the only one who I would say is acting appropriately is the vengeful kid, who does give a rather creepy performance. I was also disappointed with the lack of character depth, or even likability for that matter. The Act Man made a good point, if we don't care about the characters, or the conflict, then there is no point in discussing the story.There is also the odd touches of humor throughout this film, with much of it either shattering the immersion of the atmosphere that this film is attempting to create, or just coming off as awkward and forced. There were several scenes in this movie where I either laughed awkwardly, or I was completely uncomfortable from it. There's one scene that I remember specifically where Farrell is telling his son about a particularly uncomfortable memory from his childhood, it was the scene where I stopped trying to like this film. Another pet peeve that I have with any form of storytelling is where it spells everything out for you, with no regard or trust for the audience. The Matrix is a film that I often pick on when it comes to this problem, but The Killing of a Sacred Deer also exemplifies this issue. There are plenty of long winded, pseudo-philosophical monologues coming from the characters that I assume are supposed to come off as intense, but just come off as stilted and lifeless.For all of its faults, the film does have its bright spots. The film's cinematography is consistently good and creates an uneasy atmosphere. It's clearly aped from Kubrick, but I appreciate that the film has a consistent visual tone throughout, even if the acting and writing seems to be lost in what tone they're attempting to convey. I also was fond of the musical score, given my fondness for classical music. It was probably the two things that inspired me to give this film the star review that I did, and not go any lower.I have heard that Lanthimos' other films are much better thought out and consistent than this one, but after seeing this I am unsure if I'll give them a shot any time soon, or even at all.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

He here uses to fine effect a number of subtle filmmaker tricks to evoke a genuine, primitive sense of dread. 7 stars and not 8 or 9, however, because like a Peter Greenaway film, this one resonates and resonates with itself, turning in on itself like salt water taffy, without ever reaching authentic resolution or explication. Certain scenes have such bloodless coldness and unnecessariness as to make life seem garish and bleak. Celebration of life warts and all, self-discrepant though it generally is, would seem to be an ironic ubermotif in Lanthimos' oeuvre, but that thread runs thin here and then vanishes, no greenroom with champagne in it for anyone.

The first 15 minutes of the movie starts off well, you're introduced to a high profile surgeon, a great family and an unexplained relationship with an annoying boy with various forms of autism and long list of deficiencies. From that point on-wards, the movie dips like a car without brakes. The director proceeds to introduce us to awkward and unnecessary sexual encounters from 'laying-dead' fetishes to rapid hand-jobs, The entire movie revolves around this irritating kid bent on revenge to wipe out an entire family through magic curses due to the accidental manslaughter of his father at the hands of the surgeon. I wonder what sort of revenge he would have exacted had his dad been killed intentionally, he may have wiped out humanity.
Nonetheless, you continue watching this slug-fest hoping for a dramatic change, hoping for the surgeon to kill this boy and remove this curse, or perhaps seeing a flashback of the surgeon accidentally cut the father's heart in a fit of alcoholic rage.

228,romneymeredith,I'm angry as h@ll and you will be too - skip this atrocity,1,26 July 2020,"Wow - Nicole Kidman in 2017 looking hot as a firecracker and I still can't like this movie???The oddity of the plot and some weird scenes drew me into the movie, I simply wanted to understand what the heck was going on. I am a literal person - when I watch movies, I don't sign up to interpret metaphors. I want to be ENTERTAINED with a good plot, good acting, good directing and good cinematography.But this movie really angered me - the first part was like watching ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Detailed, precise, even surgical dissection of a perfect very upper middle class family, a common theme among Hollywood auteurs that detest suburbanites. A clinical examination, so to speak. But the movie's allusions break down as we see the antagonist threaten precisely the kind of illnesses the 2 children get, as well as the stages. And of course the medical professionals can't figure out what the problem is and worse than that the movie ends without you ever knowing how this evil teenager was able to cause these illnesses. Not only that, he said he'd spare everyone else if only the doctor (Ferrell) would choose one of his family to die - and the idiot does, by of course blindfolding himself and his children and his wife at the movie's end (he also duct-taped them to chairs) and whirled around shooting randomly with a rifle until he killed his boy. Then the movie ends with he and his remaining family meeting with the boy at a diner he's met with him in the past. All of this over the boy blaming (correctly) the doctor for having killed his father when he was a wee bit drunk during a heart operation. Oh yeah, this punk aimed his widowed mother at the doctor and her attempted seduction scene with Farrell was ridiculous.The direction was pathetic, the plot insane though the acting was okay even if it seemed at times they were all drugged up. No explanation was ever given as to how the boy affected the children that way (paralysis in the legs and not being able to eat, finally bleeding from the eyes for the boy) nor how he alleviated the sole remaining female teen's medical problems.Do not waste your time.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

The first half was great but the second half was repetitive and devoid of rich ideas of the first. But we are here for the deer and not the lobster so let's jump into the relevant film. This film was really good, YL was able to sustain the momentum from a good first half and delivered a stronger second half. The shots are long, the cuts are few, the angles are great, it's a very smooth and polished film. The real standout of the film was the music, really made me uneasy, combined with a very mechanical performance by the leads (Farell and Kidman) the mood building for a psychological horror film was cultivated well. This is the kind of horror you're better off not asking the hows, it's more about the journey. There are some mystical elements in here and their clash with science, a theme which was present in The Lobster as well. It's also quite big on biblical and mythological references (I haven't seen Mother yet so interesting to have another film in the same year like that). Colin Farell and Nicole Kidman evolve from these mechanical sophisticated people to desperate parents naturally but not without some tense moments and gorgeous scenes. These are the kind of films which should have gotten noms, TKSD over Get Out or Shape of Water any day.

The score comes out of nowhere and honestly I believe it adds a sense of atmospheric power to the film but thats about it for me. Since the term ""art"" is subjective I wont say this movie is garbage but I believe it lacks direction and a clear, cohesive plot while trying to be unique and abstract. The characters are drones of what humans should be showing little to no emotion until the midway point. This confused me because in a psychological thriller or any movie for that matter isn't the purpose immersion? How can one be immersed with such a chasm between audience and character? The dialogue was monotone and the setting was monochromatic, this mixed with bland emotionless characters makes this film difficult to sit through for the wrong reasons. I personally think this movie loses people on its path to obscurity and ""art"". May I suggest the Lobster (same director) for a unique movie, with truly rich characters and far more digestible storyline. Cheers ✌🏾",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

242,littlemankazoo,Beauty in agony,9,14 February 2018,"My word...Are there really WORDS for a film such as this?...'Killing of a Sacred Deer' is a story that seems centered-upon the concepts of lifelessness, in more ways than one. Lifelessness as humans as we function through life, lifelessness as our own hearts beat and our blood pumps...but most of all, lifelessness as we do horrible, awful things to one another.Life and lifelessness are balanced here in a film that features performances that are seemingly executed in purposeful woodenness and stilted manner. Everyone speaks their lines in over-explanation, all delivered in monotone manner and in robotic fashion. Much as I fancy myself a man of above-average understanding in film theory...I, for the life of me, cannot understand why this choice was made. Even now, this decision confuses me and taunts me toward its meaning. Would real performances have made this film better? Perhaps. In my opinion, they would have.My issues, however, end there. This film is, bar-none, the most disturbing and unsettling film you will see from 2017. The cinematography, done in such a faux-Kubrickian style you would almost be fooled into thinking it's a modern-day 'The Shining' or 'A Clockwork Orange', is masterful in how it builds suspense and distorts this warped reality we follow these characters through. It feels pristine, perfect...and in all that, we never feel cozy or comfortable. This look keeps us constantly on-edge, and director Yorgos Lanthimos never lets that feeling go. It is Kubrick-style suspense and dread that I have never seen done so well since Stanley Kubrick himself.The score, subtle as it is, adds to this teeth-grinding sensation of constant dread and waiting for something simply awful to occur. We are stung with its eerie presence constantly, punctuating each moment of psychological horror we see with music that made even my skin crawl and made me shiver in my seat. The composer and editor should be proud of what they've accomplished here, as its intent to make us uncomfortable succeeds in every facet.The performances are indeed purposely muted, but Barry Keoghan turns-in a performance that unsettles me even thinking about it now. Calculated, eerie, but never hamming the role in the slightest, it is by far one of the best performances by a young actor this year. It almost makes me think he was snubbed for Best Supporting Actor, his work is that eerie here.But in the end, it's Yorgos Lanthimos, who I am only familiar with for 'The Lobster', who really steals the show in this piece. His direction feels muted...but at the same time, you feel this ever-present feeling of dread and horror even as we are panning down a long, narrow hallway with no signs of danger. The entire film feels like one is traveling down a perfectly straight tunnel, devoid of any flaws or danger ahead. We think of ourselves as safe...we relax in that safety...and perhaps become lifeless in that very same safety...but in that, there's an imminent danger that we can only feel that looms ahead. That long tunnel that you can feel approaching something horrible...something that can make your skin crawl...THAT is the feeling this film evokes. This film is agony.But my goodness, is it beautiful agony.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
243,glaneljhonathan,There's a lot more to it than you saw...,8,14 February 2021,"If you watch the movie, it's a good/Ok psychological horror. But if you read the Ipheginea play by Euripides (on which the movie is more or less based on, sans the inclusion of all characters) or even the plotline of it, then this film becomes even more impressive for you, nevermind if you read it after watching the movie. Just like reading a comic book before or after watching a movie adaptation of it, makes it better & less confusing.Colin Farrell's character is Agamemnon, Nicole Kidman's character is Clytemnestra, The boy Martin with his supernatural feat is the Goddess Artemis who is offended (here because his father was killed), The daughter Kim is Ipheginea who is to be sacrificed, & the son Bob is the Sacred Deer for Kim who actually gets killed.In the original play, it's Ipheginea itself who is sacrificed to Artemis. But a deviation to this end exists, through the manuscripts of an unknown interpolator who suggested that Artemis must've visited the distraught Clytemnestra to reveal that she accepted the sacrifice of a deer (an actual deer) instead of her daughter Ipheginea, after she was moved by her grief. This is like that The Princess Bride censor version, & the actual play is believed not to have followed this. Nevertheless this deviation is what the movie is based on, but in a really really twisted way. You can see all the characters covertly trying to save their own selves through desperate yet subtle manipulation towards the end, except for the innocent Bob.On a reality context, creepy as though this movie may be, this is more or less, if not exact, is how most modern humans would choose to react than be self-sacrificial. Because today we have more reasons to live than people in historic times. So this movie is not so strange & confusing after all. It fulfills the story of ancient Greeks & modern humans with the use of the same characters, but with subtly different nature, affected by the times they lived/live in. So killing two birds with one stone, perhaps?Even if now people dismiss this movie as not being a good art film, this is exactly what an art film is. The esoteric nature of it (yet obvious to realise if you ponder below the surface) couldn't be more artistic! Once you GET IT, you get it! It's like Black Swan, but without any exposé dialogue, or relying on a more famous story. But the same merging or blurring of ""supernatural"" with ""psychological"" exists in both movies, but without blurring the lines between reality & dream/delusion here. It is just what it is with this movie.Watch & find out what this suggestively creepy movie with its uniquely 2 dimensional characters has more to offer. Pay attention to the dialogues, they're deeper than you think, & reveals a lot about the characters' true natures. The acting of everybody was spot on too, the subtle expressions speak in volumes & are at times straight creepy, for the lack of a better word.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

The surgeon has taken an interest in a boy who is the son of a patient he had years prior that died on his operating table. At first, you wonder what the motive is with the man and the boy, because every scene screams, something isn't right here with the father (surgeon). That is only the beginning of this creepy story line.Every scene is shockingly more revealing than the last, and you soon find out that something isn't right with every single person in the movie. The family dynamic is very awkward. Just when you think things are normal, someone says something that makes you question if you just heard what you heard. I have honestly never seen anything like it.In the story, the boy seems to take an extreme liking to the surgeon. They become good friends, but soon the boy starts showing up at the hospital which starts to be a bit troubling for the surgeon. Soon you will realize the point of the movie and things just get more disturbing from there.The acting seems awkward at times, but I think this is done purposely for anti-effect, if that makes any sense.

267,sstetsko,"I really like it, but I kind of don't :)",7,29 August 2020,"I came across The Killing of a Sacred Deer again, recently, and decided to give it another viewing and a review. The first time I saw it I was really put off by the stilted performances and the odd, often times illogical plot (one of the key plot premises in particular). At that time I was fully aware that these aspects of it were really its strength and not a fault. A completely logical plot premise has NOTHING to do with making this movie effective, while the stilted acting was deliberately done to highlight the story's true premises... the hollowness of many people's lives... the lies they built their existence and reputations on... the facade of honor and respectability adopted by certain people (etc).Even at that time I liked the concept, and I appreciated the strange delivery as a directorial choice, but it still left me cold. On the second viewing I even noticed subtle camera use and setting choices that indicated story teling mastery and artistic vision, and I became somewhat more engrossed in the dilemmas of the family members quivering beneath their flat and dead fish exteriors, but it still left me cold.But that is still the point. The characters are generally cold--cold and dead, and it is hard to get drawn into what should be their emotionally charged conflicts. Their true human reactions are strangled and stillborn in most cases... more going though the motions than genuine most of the time. If they can manage any emotion at all it is generally impotent rage. Their crisis in the story is horrific in a way and should solicit empathy and sympathy, but they themselves, are even more horrific albeit in a pathetic and innocuous way. So when I find the story leaves me hollow and unfulfilled... that the drama which unfolds on the screen at best makes me feel angry and frustrated, well, then, kudos. The movie has done its job. Some stories just are not heroic, pleasant, or even really human., even if they are about a family in the most difficult situation they could ever have to confront. Some stories show sides of humanity most directors don't want to look at... and so it is with The Killing of a Sacred Deer.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
268,miromoman,Interesting but tiring,6,2 November 2017,"This is an interesting film, no doubt. It succeeds at building a psychologically oppressing atmosphere. Comparisons with Lanthimos' previous work, The Lobster, are unavoidable. The sense of absurdity, the tempo, the photography, the neurasthenic characters... In fact, a disappointing Farrell seems to be playing exactly the same guy. Personally, I had the same issue with both films. A promising beginning, but, after an hour or so, I just subtracted myself out of the action and started analysing the movie, way too much, more as a critic than as an spectator. And, for me, this is one of the worst things that can happen at the cinema...If you are into this kind of psychological horror, I would rather recommend Miike's Audition (1999). That, for one, if you can stomach it, would capture your attention from the beginning to the end (and even beyond).",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Yes there are some decent actors here, except for the wooden Colin Farrell. In this movie he plays a surgeon who has a wooden character and Colin actually overacts the woodiness to an almost unbearable monotony, like he is just reading the lines off the page of a script and told to do it badly. He excels at it . This is not a compliment. 
The filmwork and soundtrack is adequate but the plot is preposterous. 
It is disturbing in the kind of way that you might witness someone having a bad accident or open heart surgery, yes you would look for a second, but this film is over two hours long , so if you want to torture yourself mentally or just feel bad in general, then knock yourself out and watch it...

272,joecoby45,Incredibly pretentious and pointless film.,4,19 January 2018,"The Killing of a Sacred Deer is essentially a 30 minute short tediously dragged out for 2 hours. Due to its bloated length the movie is filled with pointless and unpleasant sequences that add absolutely nothing to the plot. Such an example is a terrible scene in which Collin Farrell tells his son a long story about how he jerked his own father off. Its a pointless scene shoved in there to make the audience feel uncomfortable. Uncomfortable scenes in movies are perfectly fine so long as they serve some kind of purpose, this did not. The writer/director of this film probably thinks he is some kind of visionary but he is anything but. He just thinks that making a full length movie with a paper thin/nonsensical story and flat monotone characters delivering their lines in the most robotic way possible constitutes a work of are. It is not, its shit. And what's interesting to note is that is exactly what made his last film, The Lobster so unbearable. He didn't learn anything from that piece of shit he just did the exact same thing again. The movie is redeemed slightly by good composition (even though many scenes in this movie look like they were stolen directly from a Kubrick film) and a great performance from Barry Keoghan as the main antagonist. Like all other characters he is also robotic and monotone but it works splendidly with him as it makes his character totally creepy and unpredictable. Kudos to Barry he really delivered some award worthy work here. All the other actors/characters are just dull. This writer/director is clearly the most pretentious film maker working today. He thinks he is the next Kubrick when in fact he is just a non talent hack who writes stupid stories with robotic characters. Lame.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
273,gatheringsnow,The Very Definition of a Slow Burn,7,18 July 2018,"Yorgos Lanthimos's most recent and polarizing film, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" seems to me like one of those films which one half of it's viewers absolutely will despise, and the other half will hail as an underrated masterpiece of psychological horror, somewhat akin to classics like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, which by the way, shares many aesthetic elements with this film, and will undoubtedly inspire a slew of comparisons from people who feel it's ripping The Shining off, or working as something as an homage to it. Anyway, me personally I felt that it didn't work as a horror film in the same way that The Shining did, as it wasn't particularly frightening, lacking any jump-scares or the traditional elements of what many people consider trademarks of the horror genre nowadays, however for anyone familiar with Yorgos's previous films such as The Lobster and especially Dogtooth, not to mention the fact that this film was distributed by A24 Pictures, also responsible for such ""art-house"" type horror films like 2017s ""It Comes at Night"" or 2016's ""The Witch"" than you will quickly figure out that this film has far less in common with the likes of ""Paranormal Activity"" or ""Unfriended"" and much more in common with the films of Ingmar Bergman or Michael Haneke, both European ""auteur"" filmmakers who have a long history of making uncompromisingly dark and grim films which are a large hit among the Sundance crowd. What this film lacks in flashy visuals and gory death scenes in makes up for with an overwhelming sense of unease and despair which slowly, very slowly, ratchets up the tension and atmosphere as the film progresses and you learn more and more about the relationship and tragic history between the surgeon Dr. Murphy (Colin Farrell) and a strange, almost alien boy named Martin (Barry Keoghan). At first Martin just seems a bit awkward and geeky, the sort of quiet introverted type who always keeps a low profile in public and doesn't really speak much, but as the film progresses and he gets to know Murphy's wife and kids better, especially his teenaged daughter Kim (Raffey Cassidy) it quickly becomes clear that his odd, robotic mannerisms and way of speaking are more than just harmless quirks but the hallmarks of a truly sinister and dangerous youth who is hellbent on serving his own brand of retribution for an unforgivable act done to him by the father, but it's his family that must pay the ultimate price, and Dr. Murphy is eventually forced to make a horrific decision that inevitably will tear his family apart one way or the another. In ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" revenge truly is a dish served, cold and bleak. Many people will not like this film because many things are left unexplained at the end and it also features elements which many have seen as attempts at dark humor although I personally rarely found this film to be funny, just odd. The dialogue also is incredibly stilted and robotic, but this only works in favor of Martin, with everyone else it serves as a real crutch in allowing the audience to sympathize with their plight and comes off as very unnecessary and forced most of the time, and thus many who watch it will see it as being pretentious and laughable even though the lines themselves are delivered in a deadpan serious manner, and others will criticize it for being ""weird for the sake of being weird"" which I definitely feel is a legitimate criticism as the film is filled with ""weird"" scenes which seem to make little or no sense on the first viewing, so overall whether or not you enjoy the film will be based on whether or not your able to look past the surface level and dive deep into the hidden metaphors and allegories lurking around every corner, waiting to be analyzed by those of a more analytical mindset, anyway, I know this review may come off as incredibly meandering or even pretentious itself, but I do genuinely feel that it's the sort of film you need to watch more than once to truly understand, but that's just my take on it.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

It could have worked if it was all intended as a cheap thriller with some cheap sex and gore thrown in to keep the crowds happy. But no, this is intended as high art and because the director comes from Greece he has to throw in some ancient Greek drama to turn his work of art into an even more significant form of allegory.

280,vinylvanilla,When an allegorical movie becomes absurdly pretentious.,7,13 December 2017,"If you like ""The Lobster"" by Lanthimos, here, expect something different. Although we still have in ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" a very strange screenplay, here its attempt to be super symbolic and metaphorical reminds me more of ""Mother!"", by Darren Aronofsky.I am not sure if there's a current trend to adapt to the big screen Biblical stories or greek-roman myths, but I suspect this is the case. In this movie, we see an allegory of the myth of ""Iphigenia"". A heart surgeon (Colin Farrell) one day has performed a surgery on a man, but this doctor was drunk. The patient died during the procedure. His son wants revenge, and makes a deal with the surgeon - he either has to kill a member of his family, or all his family members will die from a magical, unexplainable-by-medicine series of events: limb paralysis, eye bleeding, and sudden death. After that, the movie is all about this moral dilema - what should the doctor do? Kill one of his children or watch all his family members die? And that's it. This is the plot. The first and second acts are absurdly slow, the soundtrack is just there to disguise how cold this movie is, and it's only in the third act that the movie actually SETS OFF. Cast's performances, especially Barry Keoghan's, is quite impressive. But a cast cannot save a movie. Its desperation to seem to be ""artsy"" and ""allegoric"" makes this a very pedantic work of art, just like ""Mother!"", by Aronofsky.It is, for sure, a nice movie to distract yourself. It's good entertainment. But it's not valuable. Lanthimos probably thinks this movie is better than it really is.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

282,diaju_vampprincess,An eye for an eye,7,28 April 2018,"Yap, it's a metaphore. The movie is full of metaphore, which is obviously describe from the title.It may seem like it is flat, but i think that what's gonna happen when your life is stagnan for years. The story is about a life of a successul surgeon named Steven Murphy, who is finally facing his zero point in his life. He has a happy family, a beautiful wife and daughter and a talented son. Simply a perfect life. But it gradually turns upside down when one time he appears to be wrong in an operation table when performing surgery and costs a life of a father, ten years ago. He realizes it is his mistake, yet he doesn't admit to anyone because it can ruin his perfect life, thus he secretly take care of the son of the patient. Being his friend and also his guardian.What he doesn't know is that the son, named Martin, secretly holds grudge and seeks revenge. He is somehow manage to perform a curse that will cost Steven's entire family if he doesn't sacrifice the life of one member of his family. That is the price Steven has to pay for being he reason behind his father death. An eye for an eye, a life for a life.I think it is a good metaphore of responsibility. Admit your mistake, face the punishment. Do not hide it, because the judgement will surely come.
The message is well-delivered by all of the actors, great acting. Here we can see that mother will do anything for the sake of her children.
And here we can also see, a happy family is not always what they appear to be.But i don't really understand who Martin guy is. I mean is he somekind of God who wants to punish the wrong people, or just simply a guy who commits a satanic ritual for revenge? He is able to curse and making an entire family sick like magic.

The writer(s) probably didn't have something set-in-stone for this so they just said ""yeah let's throw it out there and we're sure that some people will pick it up, get something that wasn't planned, and they will start projecting random things to feed their ego that they're high intellectuals.

284,kevinaguirre-47730,It could have been better,7,12 May 2020,"I see many people hate this movie, but the reason is that this movie is not for everyone. It was made on purpose that way, because here the author wants to make an allegory of the idea of sacrifice and redemption, in the style of Ancient Greek tragedies, and also I see some metaphor with what is happening in western societies, this guilt feeling that many got but try to suppress for their own good. In this case, the bearded guy tried to but he can't, so the wife ends up having that feeling as well and they know that they are guilt for one of their group's sin, in this case, the bearded man. Many topics are touched here, like sacrifice, guilt and redemption. That's how it is, no matter they try to avoid them. Poor family. They have to pay for what one of the members of it did.Even though the idea was great, there was something this movie lacked, a touch of more realism, and one or two scenes that didn't make much sense, like the one between the protagonist and the supposed victim's son's mother. Some disturbing sexual scenes and conversations, which didn't make sense and ended up becoming weird and uncomfortable. The idea was great, but a few details made the movie to not be perfect.

A heart surgeon has secret meetings with a teenage boy after unsuccessfully operating on his father. The boy somehow makes the Dr's whole family sick as an act of revenge for drinking on the job, Dr must choose which family member to sacrifice...which he does, randomly. During the film, these's lots of hidden messages in the imagery that you must decipher, and most likely will be attributed to the teenager being an incarnation of the devil, or a hundred other ways that it could be interpreted, of which the director will no doubt take credit for, more ambiguity the better for an artsy film, which is really means being too lazy to figure out a more plausible reason that these events could even be put on screen. The dots do not connect, the acting is definitely questionable, and the plot is just hot air, camera work is interesting, a lot of the placement is following the action, as if hovering from behind, similar to 'Birdman'. The film did have me interested in the outcome, I did want to know the reasoning behind all the sickness, and how he was able to predict it, but for a film to be worth watching, it must address it's central question, at least try and answer it, but it doesn't. So yeh it's an 'Art' film, because you have to decide yourself what it all meant, or be able to recount decades of cinematic references that the director was targeting to unravel all the hidden meaning, which may or may not lead to a logical ending. But me expecting a logical satisfying ending to a film (to which there will be no part 2) is no doubt looked upon as ignorant and docile to all the film noir aficionads's.

On the one hand certain aspects just couldn't be better, such as the aforementioned, contrarily I'm not sure if its my own personal disenfranchisement from the Horror genre, or if there is a hole, a great gaping hole missing from this film. This film is cold, stark, interesting, but lack character. It lacks a unique voice, which writes strange as this is a highly unique feature, it feels almost soulless. As if it knows not its own fate, and becomes more style over substance.While I am a great admirer of Lanthimos' style, I felt that it began to overcast this feature. The narrative is a compelling tragedy, about a doctor who's past mistakes destroy his present, based on the 2400 year old Ancient Hellenic (Greek) Tragedy named 'Iphigenia At Aulis' by Euripides. His distinctive directorial style is allover this film, from its angulation, to dialogue delivery. It is clearly his work, with as aspect of Kubrick-esque flair thrown in that is present in many of his films, though only a little. The direction of this film is truly masterful, almost without fault, the narrative is a little slow (although this is common to Lanthomos' features, it feels longer in this instance, something feel unbalanced). The film is sound, but yet feels a little wonky, dare I say undercooked. Like a Jenga tower, it could collapse if but a single brick is taken out. It only just fulfils the criteria, it is difficult to describe.The performances are among this films great strengths, Colin Farrell is wonderful, although I believe for his performance here to be a little weaker than his previous outing with Lanthimos in 'The Lobster', it is still sound, and as layered. A complex character, extremely well crafted and realised, almost like as if I couldn't imagine any other actor fitting the part quite so well. He sports a great beard in this motion picture, it covers much of his facial expression, which makes him seem more of a spectre, more difficult to read and to understand his viewpoint, which adds to the moral complexity of the feature rather well. In effect the beard was a clever addition, quite out of the norm of Lanthimos' performances, but a clever piece.Barry Keoghan as Martin is a character that is hard to forget, but for all the more lurid and deceitful reasons of his ways. For this character seems innocent at first, but is truly the paramount expression of evil behind a flower. His character is one of the most well portrayed, well characterised villains I have ever seen put to a film. For his actions are complex, manipulative and extremely well constructed by the screenplay. He is portrayed to every beat so well by Keoghan, truly it will be a performance to be remembered.The rest of the cast is rather good too. Nicole Kidman as Anna Murphy, Raffey Cassidy as Kim, Sunny Suljic as Bob and Alicia Silverstone as Martin's mother are all well portrayed. Neither of the younger performers are bad, in fact they are quite compelling and add to the films tone. Nicole Kidman is great, although I felt that her character while present for much of the film, was somewhat lacking in development.The cinematography of this feature was, as many of Lanthimos' films are, absolutely stunning. Id say this was his best looking film, visually, that he has made thus far (Excluding The Favourite). The way the camera is cold, it feels like viewing capsule, it is cold, antiseptic, like a hospital, and as I have already mentioned, a Kubrick Like style to the way it behaves. The colours used are all a thousand shades of blue and grey, it is a very limited palette, that gives an incredible depth, each shot is a spectacle. This adaptability which Lanthimos displays, across this different genre, shows just how incredible of a director he is, that it feels like he a master of everything he touches, simply by his command over visual information.The set design was also very well crafted, with very open yet cold feeling locations. I read that this was filmed in a real hospital, and clearly they picked the right one. All the right beats are hit. The costume design is fair, but this is expected of a film in the Horror genre.But as I have already stated: the film feels as if it is missing something. It feels like a brilliant showcase of cinematography, performances and screenplay, but it feels almost too cold, and too distant. It didn't have the same engrossing power which Lanthimos' earlier work possesses. The style began to take over, not in entire sections but from scene to scene. Some felt more tonally distant than others, some blended style and plot extrmely well, such as the spaghetti scene, or the corrior scene between Farrell and Suljic's characters. While others such as the final scene, the walking scene, the medical examinations, began to meander a great deal.In the end, I was somewhat disappointed with this feature, but it is by no means a bad film. It has some truly outstanding aspects, however its over-reliance on style and form, and perhaps too much distantness from the audience do detract it, and make it feel longer than its actual run time, or at least that;s how I felt. I would recommend this film to any Lanthimos fan or Horror fan, as it is a brilliant showcase of what can be done in those respective corners. I give it a 7/10",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

I expected something similar but this is not the case, except for the fact that they are both highly unconventional movies.""This killing of a sacred deer"" kills every sacred film-making technique. It is really disturbing, I would say even horrifying. Music and direction made me uncomfortable, in stop and starts annoying. But this was the purpose, so very good job, Lanthimos!However, I've watched these outside-the-box films very often in the last years; as a consequence, I could feel a bit bored during the movie. In this particular case, dialogues are sometimes very minimal, or nonexistent.Don't misunderstand me: I don't think that this movie is pretentiously disturbing or boring (like ""Kynodontas""). Everyone who likes Lanthimos, or in general unconventional movies because of both the plot and the film-making techniques, should watch this movie.

I didn't know it was based on Greek mythology and I don't think you need to know that, you just have to appreciate a good movie. It's absolutely out of the realm of normal and will definitely make you uncomfortable. The strange cadence of the dialogue is odd at first but once you embrace it as art it becomes really engrossing.

308,tedd0093,A type of Psychological thriller that we need more of,8,3 February 2018,"It came as a surprise to me when I found myself really enjoying this movie. Not because it was a bad trailer, but because I didn't expect it to be so tense right from the beginning - considering how the pacing of ""the lobster"" was. It starts off really slow and seems rather artistic in style. All the slow building up to a final climax, is made so intense in a way we rarely see on the big screen. It really stuck to me because of the surreal style. Most movies these days tend to explain every detail of the plot through simple dialogue or voiceover, where this movie makes you a bit confused (to say the least), and leaves the viewer with a lot of content to digest and make up their mind. The story itself comes off weird and fascinating, mostly because of the disjointed acting and surreal-like atmosphere (and that's not a bad thing). The characters in the movie really does something that makes the audience linger to understand their actions, which I think is on purpose so that nothing in this movie is predictable. The cinematography is great, actors are splendid, and the setting is nothing short of amazing. The only thing holding this movie down as to becoming a masterpiece, is the really slow pacing and the lack of any catharsis. All in all - a really great movie that will stick to your thoughts long after the credits roll.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
309,barry-180,A film for masochists,5,5 November 2017,I love a good thriller. However I wouldn't go to see The Snowman one of my favourite detective psychological thrillers because of the way it had been truncated. The Vue cinema in which I saw The Killing of a Sacred Deer last night puts you in the mood to see such a film. It's like being at the dentist for half an hour before the film starts. There is a crescendo of drill sounding vibrations advertising how lucky you are to be in their cinema. Then after a final explosion of noise the film starts. There is blackness around thirty seconds of silence and we are taken into a heart operation. Having a by-pass operation myself I found this interesting. Let me say that the acting was mostly very good especially that of Barry Keoghan. If you have masochist trends I am sure you will like this film. If you don't give the film around 30 minutes before deciding if you are going to walk out. Let me say that if you watch it to the end and afterwards you say you enjoyed it. May I suggest that you go and see a psychiatrist.,The Killing of a Sacred Deer
310,thejoudblitz,What a shame this could have been excellent,3,18 December 2017,"This film depicts the life of upper class people as we like to imagine it, and brilliantly so. The medical doctors couple have it all figured out, speak in complete sentences and are firm and polite. The house is gorgeous, the children are smart and well behaved. The setting of the story as a whole is very well done, believable and with great actors to boot.The score is not so great. At times we have experimental ""music"" that just annoys and does nothing for the mood, but the visuals are exciting to watch, we have interesting camera angles, no shaking and clever zooms and motion.The pace is slow, yet ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is never boring. There is always a plot twist which is explored after, things take their time but rightfully so.Why the relatively detailed review for a 3 star rating? The problem is that the climax is just a huge letdown. The audience can't help themselves but wonder what is going on, guessing on the crime the apparently genius 16 year old villain commits. It is never explained. The makers thought it would be enough to have the bad guy win. It is not enough. In the end everything good about the movie was negated by breaking the suspension of disbelief in a petty way, just ending the movie.Even ""The Leftovers"" explained its phenomenon, and that show did not need to. There the mystery was the premise for character development, here the mystery is a tool to keep the viewer's attention.I'd like to give less than 3 stars, because of how cheated I feel and because of the waste of talent and production value.

Later I thought maybe he damaged their brain nerves with the MP3's that he gave to them (this would have been the only logical thing to happen in this entire movie) !

317,Philipe14,"Stupid Premise, Silly ""Style""",1,3 February 2018,"The premise is that a teenager somehow induces a slow death on the children of the doctor he blames for his father's death on the operating table. It's some kind of poison or affliction, we never quite find out which one it is or how the kid managed to do it. The kid promises to end the ordeal, if the doctor kills a member of his own family in order to pay for killing the kid's father. In the real world, the doctor would go to the police at this point. But his is Hollyweird, where the Real World doesn't exist. So instead we watch as the doctor's colleagues are baffled by whatever's ailing his children, and the family begins to unravel as they wonder what Dad is going to do. Finally, there's a scene in which one of the children dies from, apparently, a gunshot wound, but the movie ends as the teenager and the doctor's family are in a diner. 'Scuse me, if son or daughter was shot, wouldn't Dad be in jail? Then there's the ""production style"" involving stilted and shallow dialogue, apparently to illustrate what a stilted and shallow existence these people live. OK, that may be the only link to Reality we see in this flick, but we're still stuck with A) the police are not involved at all, and B) nobody gets arrested for a murder. And the people who make crap like this think we're supposed to take them seriously at Awards Ceremonies when they start lecturing us about who should or should not be President. I watched this flick on a DVD that include ""Features,"" the one and only ""feature"" being the typical promotional clip where the actors and writer/producer types are just fawning all over each other about what a great job they all did......like they do at their Awards Ceremonies when they aren't lecturing the rest of us about how to run a country.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
318,lars-viebrock,How do people enjoy this god awful movie?,2,29 April 2020,"This is one of those movies, where you are not sure, if they are kidding or not. After 2hrs of agony, I learnt they are not.
From scene one, I wasn't sure, if they everyone was speaking like a 1980s sci-fi movie robot on purpose. Apparently, that's the tone of the movie. Everyone just needs to behave as weird and unnatural as humanly possible. Dialogue, behavior, and tone of all characters is 100% not that of actual human beings.
I think Nicole Kidman is a great choice, since here face looks as natural, as her character is supposed to be. Colin Farrell on the other hand is usually a great actor. Well, not here.
Since no one behaves like a human, and the tone and scenery is extremely unfitting in basically every scene, there is no reason to feel empathy with anyone. Anyone of these humanoid robots that are very poor at behaving like real humans.
Coherence is not a thing in this movie. Sentiment and direction change in basically every scene. The dialogue feels like it is written by a person who has never been to earth, but once read a few novels from the 17th century from planet earth. Great stuff.
I don't want to spoil the fun for anyone, but just to give a highlight from this movie away: he inquires his children's teacher about who he should rather kill. That's right!
The final scene, where he dances around like a child in the living room playing some Russian roulette with his family is the movie goodness!

Yorgos Lanthimos has done it again writing one of the most compelling scripts of the year. The story is incredibly intriguing, and builds tension incredibly well throughout the film. The film is disturbing, not in terms of violence, but in the way it messes with your head. The acting is great from Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell. As is the case with all his movies, Yorgos Lanthimos brings his unique direction style in a way that it almost seems the characters are living in their own world. The cinematogrophy is also fantastic, adding to the tension and uneasiness of the film.

322,ozyhmandias792,"""Don't forget to water the plants""",7,18 January 2018,"If one assumes that the goal of Surrealism is to access a hidden, particular dimension beneath the ordinary, then it can be said that this movie goes the exact opposite way : it overshadows and hints to something superior and transcendent beyond the commonly known reality. 
An evident climax in the plot can justify this opinion : as the movie develops, the Murphy family witnesses increasingly disturbing accidents to its members which bring to a pathological degeneration of the (already unnaturally cold) domestic atmosphere.
These accidents are effects produced by an inscrutable Cause, which represents the mysterious and untraceable narrative core of the whole movie. 
This transcendent element can be identified in the concept of Retribution, that is a bitter idea of justice. 
This metaphysical entity tragically appears on Earth through the enigmatic medium of Martin, a troubled young man whose obsession for the Murphy family grows exponentially dangerous. 
To be honest, the plot provides convincing clues and more than enough evidence in order to give a psychological explanation to Martin's behaviour : his father's death during a surgical procedure performed by Dr. Murphy leads to a logical replacement of the two fatherly figures; this fact will later be confirmed by the unorthodox offer of his own mother's favours to Dr. Murphy. 
But analysing the movie through this lens doesn't seem appropriate. 
It would be better to follow a supernatural interpretation which enables to observe some truly fascinating traits.
First of all, the title itself suggests something otherworldly and mythic : this clear indication should not go unnoticed. 
The theme of Disease is central : both the Murphys are doctors, the incomprehensible punishments their children suffer because of Martin are all of pathological nature and, because of the way they are announced (almost prophetically) by the boy, they somehow remind of divine plagues. 
And this same divine presence, clearly perceivable in the slow motion ending scene with sacred chants in the background, can lead to a critical reflection on the role of doctors in this modern society. 
It can be said without a doubt that these people actually happen to find themselves in the daily position to determine or choose between Life and Death. Their technical knowledge is so vast and different from the common practical culture of us mortals that all there is left to do is listen to them as helpless disciples to the revelations of biblical wisemen. 
But here comes Retribution : by inflicting such catastrophic tortures to the innocent children, Martin (I might call him the Hand of Retribution) operates one more substitution, that is turning the doctors (gods) into patients (victims), letting them have a bitter taste of devouring impotence, for a change.
I am sure that much more could be written about this surprising movie (I am thinking, for instance, of the illusory equation : mechanical routine = domestic peace that seems to be the rule at the beginning (""Don't forget to water the plants"")) but all I have left to say, in conclusion, is that I have immensely appreciated this mesmerising work and surely will not waste any opportunity in the future to watch it again.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

329,ThatSlackerOnSci-Fi,A film that tries so hard to be weird and unique that it forgets to be a good movie in the process,6,11 January 2019,"I'm usually a fan of independent or concept films much like this one. I love Greek mythology and what could be considered as surrealist films, they are some of my favourite in fact but whilst this film is shot beautifully and has some great music, by the end of the film, I just couldn't see more in it than as a pretentious mess which has an interesting concept but entirely wastes it in the effort to be considered as strange.I won't go into the story because its simple and like Eraserhead, its the least interesting part of the movie. Unlike Eraserhead, however, it actually has no subtext to back up the reason for creating the movie rather than adapting Greek myths into the modern day. It's a simple revenge story with supernatural themes that is never explained but is only shown to the smallest of degrees. This tell don't show is also a big reason for why I couldn't get into the movie. It tells you about this briefly but it never goes into that story to any significant degree, not even in a way to keep it subtle.The worst part really is that there's some very good scenes that get their very disturbing feeling but the pacing and how dramatized to the extreme some of the other scenes are, I just couldn't take the movie seriously for a big portion of the run time. It's even worse because I wanted to love this movie, maybe I should give it another try and think it over a bit more but I just keep questioning why it just didn't interest me in the characters or the story which just makes the surreal and disturbing elements feeling just feel like filler.In short, I didn't hate it but couldn't like it or love it even as a huge lover of art-film and surrealist film in general. Maybe it just wasn't just right for me. There's scenes I like, the beginning is great but as it went along, I just got less interested with each passing minute of the film's progression. All this ending with a diner scene so pretentious that it nearly ruined the whole movie for me, it was just film-student like quality in a film that started off incredibly unique and interesting. But even though a film is unique and can be disturbing doesn't mean that its good and here it sadly wasn't the case, at least in my opinion.This is probably going to be a controversial review but I expected so much more from this director from his other work but this just disappointed me more and more as it went along.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

335,Mikee_Maher,Very unique and disturbing in a way!,7,18 February 2021,This is one of those films where you finish watching and begin to scratch your head for an explanation to what you just watched.

336,jrmeretis,The problem isn't that it's slow; it's that it's ultimately illogical and meaningless,2,14 November 2018,"Firstly, I don't mind slow-building horror, (so don't assume ""this person just doesn't like that there weren't more jumpscares and cheap thrills!"") For example, I loved ""Hereditary"" and the way all the foreshadowing and symbolism made sense in the end. Random events turned out to not be random. It was one of those films that became more impressive on the second viewing""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" was the opposite of this. There was no explanation for a lot of the weirdness or for why the characters acted the way they did. It was like someone decided ""I want to make a weird, uncomfortable movie about the Greek tragedy"" without actually giving an account for why things were so weirdOnly Martin was supposed to be psychologically disturbed. And yet all the characters acted in strange ways on at least a few occasions in which no mentally sound human would act. Like why would Kim still want to be with the boy who was trying to murder her and her family? ""Well, if you do some mental gymnastics, the dad kind of killed them by killing Martin's dad"". But for real, even if Steve 'started it', Martin was still clearly disturbed. Why would Kim want to be with him after seeing his nature?There were three main things that should have had explanations:--SPOILER START--
1. How did they get away with killing Bob? Their house was in a nice, quiet neighborhood with other houses right next to theirs. Neighbors would have heard the four / five gunshots and called the police. Bob went to school. Teachers and the principal would have noticed his absence. The police would have started an investigation into how and why this boy went missing, and the gunshots would have immediately made the family a prime suspectThe ending made it look like it was all over: Martin got the sacrifice he wanted, and the family could move on. In reality, at least Steve would have been imprisoned for murder. There was no explanation as to why this didn't happen. The consequence of murdering Bob was just a huge loose end2. The family's reaction to the death: basically there was none. Kim seemed perfectly happy about everything and smiled at Martin in the end. It would have made sense if she was a sociopath or if she hated her brother. But since she claimed to and acted like she cared about him earlier, why she was so nonchalant about his death made no senseSame with Anna especially, since Bob was shown as being her favorite throughout the film. There was no explanation for all of their sudden blunted affect. Why did none of the characters act like regular humans? It was either weirdness just for the sake of being weird, or the creators did a poor job of depicting how real people in their right mind would have responded to the whole situation. They all acted like sociopaths or autistic people. It would have been fine if there were some reason for it. But there wasn't, and Martin was supposed to be the only person with mental issues
--SPOILER END--3. Martin randomly had the power to make people sick and heal them with his mind. It's amazing the amount of reviews saying ""it's creepy because it's something that could happen in real life!"" Um, no, probably not. Did they miss the very important fact that Martin is apparently some kind of psychic?That element was just random, since there were no other supernatural elements and no foreshadowing. It just seemed like the creators right at the end were like, ""okay, how is this kid going to be able to make these people sick, and then just heal them when he wants to? How would he have access to or know about a poison that does something like this? What poison would have the potential to bring someone to the point of death, and yet be able to be reversed immediately at any point before the person dies?""""Meh, that's too hard.

Everyone is super awkward, they act like robots or aliens. They are emotionless and zero realistic. We don't identify with the characters, everyone is super weird, everyone is super apathetic.

I was not interested in a hunting film. In the press they mentioned the Lobster movie. 
 So I decided watched it. I have hearing impairment and use captioning. I first thing that struck me was the dialogue was scripted. The actors were reading their lines not acting. I wonder if this will be going through the movie and it did. It was the stepford wives. I believe this was intentional. Sort of a dream state.
 A poor mans attempt at 'eyes wide shut' or bad writing disguised as european film making.
 The pace was really sluggish, could not identify with any of the characters. Seem like the actors had all the talent sucked out of them. That maybe intentional to.
The children behaved like 40 year olds.
 There is no spoiler, because there is no plot. There is no logic. 
Who, what , when, where and why is there. But no how. Hence it a supernatural movie because that how the producer found funding for this movie.
You can read into this movie anything you want, which makes it supernatural also.
 Too much medical stuff to make this a psychological thriller.

347,bottomsgaming,An outstanding film that I'll never want to see again,10,29 November 2017,"Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, is well-shot, adeptly acted, intensely written, and beautifully unsettling. An outstanding achievement by any metric. And I never want to see it again.From the opening shot, the film wears its tone not only on its sleeve, but also on its chest, face, and everywhere else: Its gonna make you uncomfortable. From the haunting score that seems to creep its way into every scene, to the awkward and robotic characters, to the downright scary Martin (played excellently by Barry Keoghan), the movie feels 'off.' We've seen this ""seemingly perfect upper- class family has a darkness that tears them apart"" type story before, but never so viscerally displayed as it is here. If the characters' inhuman mannerisms, conversations, and actions aren't unsettling enough, the film also delivers enough on-screen gross outs to hammer home a truly affecting experience. The film is objectively well-shot, and delivers a capable, if slightly subdued plot, while building to a frightening conclusion. It's not a horror movie sort of frightening either, but more of a, ""I can't believe I'm about to watch this"" feeling.I know that's a tough sell. The Killing of a sacred Deer is not going to make you feel good. The film is filled with an overarching, all-consuming darkness that lingers even after it's over.

Why?1. The ideas it promotes about family or about 'justice' based on Greek mythology are weakened by the boredom of the film.2. It is based on the VERY SAME concept as the lobster: Lanthimos builds a universe where things doesn't works as in our own, and no questions should be asked, no explanations should be given about this. On Lobster, the whole animal-transformations was a defacto fact, that the move doesn't want to explain. You have to accept it, even if it makes no sense. Ok.
On this movie, a boy has a supernatural ability of divine justice on a usual world but nobody seems to asking the real questions or being impressed. They very easily accept it!3.

It concerned a surgeon (Colin Farrell) who befriends a teenage boy (Barry Keoghan) whose father died during an operation performed by the surgeon. They establish a tense relationship which results in the the teen trespassing more and more into the life and family of the surgeon.I found all of the actors performances were very good except for Barry Keoghan who, was in fact, excellent.It carried the same atmosphere and style of his other movies. It was made in a very clinical stifled style with complimented by a suitable score. In his movies it focuses, I feel, how our immediate environment influences the human condition.This is probably his most accessible film yet. As in all Yorgos Lanthimos' movies the human interaction is deliberately delivered in a kind of clipped stilted tone, very rarely over expressing emotion and which often the viewer would find inappropriate but is effective. It is very dark in subject matter and conclusion, more like The Lobster in that respect. There is also a hint of the supernatural as the story develops and the children Sicken, helped by the inhuman haunting soulless atmosphere they exist in.The music has been criticised but I do believe it gelled. The going through the motions by actors critique is a common snipe at the film but that is meant to happen, it is as though somehow these days we all exist rather than live from the the jobseeker to the elite. We also drink too much. In fact that drama is initiated due to fact that he was an alcoholic/drunk, and this also dealt with in a very subtle if suggested at all.If you want a taste of earlier films I would suggest just starting with Dogtooth.

The real problem is that all this trash that his sick mind is producing is being advertised as another masterpiece and displayed in front of our eyes. Someone should inform him about the fact that the unlimited and unnecessary perversion is not considered as a work of art. Also he should know that one can simply not adapt an ancient myth into a modern real story and combine both fiction and non-fiction in the same film. Of course inside a sick head anything can happen. After all who am I to criticize Lanthimos' work? My average mind is too humble to understand the quality of his creations...

And this breaking-point was reached in 'The killing of a Sacred Deer', at about the two-third mark of its 2-hour-plus running time -- where the sinking feeling that the film was going nowhere, envelopes and summarily drowns the viewer.The acting in this film, is another aggravation -- compounding in frustration the further it traipses towards its unfulfilling, somewhat predictable finalé. Very stilted exchanges, sometimes bordering on rote reading of lines, and po-faced countenances perambulating through nearly every scene, like apparitions - often in spite of the emotional dynamics being presented - conspire only to irritate, nay entertain the viewer. It is nearly impossible to engage with the characters of a film like this with any other emotional faculty than annoyance and disdain.The cinematography is neither here nor there in 'Sacred Deer': bland settings (mostly cold hospital settings and arguably even more sanitised, upper-middle to middle class suburban domiciles) do not resonate nor set much of a mood beyond the torpor already imbued via the aforementioned, conspiring facets.The 'bizarro world' nature of the canvass presented (very little human activity beyond characters directly related to the immediate ""story""; an almost post-apocalyptic eeriness in the desolate feel of the few environments depicted), where multiple guns shots do not elicit any response whatsoever - constabulary or otherwise--in an upper-middle class suburb--located in the United States of Armipotence(!)--is rather immersion-breaking; if for nothing else, then the lack of an established universe (is this real-world or Twin Peaks?).If one is looking for an abstract piece, I recommend Winding Refn, Von Trier or even Malick (*the latter's earlier works, ideally), than this journey into the WTF of unlikable weirdness.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster) has an uncanny ability for exposing human insanity and takes aim at justice through his omniscient surrogate Martin, one of the most sinister and riveting movie antagonists of recent memory.The story is clearly inspired by the Greek myth Iphigenia in Aulis, but could also be viewed as an absurdist retelling of God's testing of Abraham with Isaac. Lanthimos once again incorporates his trademark dialogue (flat, affected, overly expository, humorous), but here he seems to also be channeling his adoration for Stanley Kubrick: horror elements, extensive use of classical music, long tracking shots, one point perspective, deeply unsettling imagery, and studying of the dark depths of human nature.

The Lobster was a comedy, sort of, and when the characters spoke with a very monotone voice and said and did things that normal people wouldn't do, that added to the comedy and it was a pleasure to watch that movie.Now, this movie is ""The Lobster 2"" in the sense that people still speak with a very monotone voice and say things they normally wouldn't. For example, during small talk at some party, the mother just casually mentions that her daughter had her first period. The daughter herself mentions that to a boy she just met later on in the movie. That resulted in the audience laughing at the movie.This is not a comedy. It is also not a horror movie. This is a drama or thriller with strong religious undertones. It is a mixture between the Binding of Isaac and the story of Job. Whatever supernatural being is responsible for punishing the two kids has a moral best described as ""an eye for an eye"". Something that I thought humanity would have overcome within the last 2000 years. This picture is completed by the ""happy end"", where the father simply kills one member of his family. This actually works in the sense that the punishment stops.This doesn't mix well with the bits that are (unintentionally?) funny.

This movie gets 1* because there are zero redeeming qualities in it. It's not just bad, it's dreadful to watch...Not because the movie is so dark and emotionally messed up, it's absolutely none of those things. It's boring, it's horribly acted, you'll not care for a single person in this movie, and you'll literally have no idea what is even going on until somewhere between 45-50 minutes into the movie.Allow me to set the scene of every actor/actress in the movie: Director: Please read EVERY SINGLE WORD with ZERO emotion, the cadence of a voice automated answering machine telling you ""the number you called has a voicemail that has not been set up"", and absolutely do not ever think of going outside of monotone."" EVERY SINGLE WORD is executed perfectly under those directions, with the exception of 1 short kitchen scene.There is nothing dark or menacing, no looming creatures or mystic forces shown at work, no fights between the husband and wife about the fates of their suddenly ill children, nothing to build tension. Nothing at all. Even the ending is stupid and boring.Save your time, please, and watch anything other than this boring and monotonous piece of trash.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
374,ccm604,Master class,10,9 June 2020,Very interesting story line with no real conclusion at the end but what a master class of acting from Barry Keoghan.

375,beybeykestrel,"Compensation, revenge and sacrifice",10,18 August 2018,"While the film began, I was fascinated by the camera moving, the angle of camera, still pictures and freeze frame of its own. Just like enjoy the magical moment that every ordinary scene came into the ridiculous irony. It was a film about compensation, revenge and sacrifice. At first, Martin wanted the compensation from Steven, and what he wanted mostly was a substitute of a father. But it was in vain. Next, Martin cursed the Murphy family. It was his revenge. Lastly, the curse developed into the sacrifice. Steven had to kill one person to save the others' life. He had to do that. I wondered that the most sacred sacrifice was killing, because depriving one's life has always been the utmost punishment to human beings and the pleasant behavior for worshiping God. All the metaphors and the arrangements in this film made me think twice and felt interesting.That's why I subjectively liked it.So I gave it 10/10.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
376,bashfulbadger,THE WASTING OF TWO HOURS OF YOUR LIFE,1,25 September 2018,"Officially the worst movie I've ever seen and over the years there have been some doozies, let me tell you. Not only was it bad, it was not even so bad it was good. There was nothing entertaining about it at all.This is not a clever or original piece. It is not deep. Before you say I don't understand it, I have studied literature to degree level- English, Greek and Russian. Nothing in the classics is this tedious.I could accept the rather daft premise if it weren't made even more ludicrous by the peculiar style of direction.IMDB says, 'Steven, a charismatic surgeon, is forced to make an unthinkable sacrifice after his life starts to fall apart, when the behaviour of a teenage boy he has taken under his wing turns sinister.'Frankly, I've seen compost with more charisma than Steven and I'm a Colin Farrell fan. The character is possibly the least engaging I've ever come across. I'd rather have a chin wag with Chucky.The writers, director Yorgos Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou, perhaps shouldn't attempt to write in English. They profess that their intention is to make viewers uncomfortable.I don't mind movies that make you feel uncomfortable but in this instance it was because I felt embarrassed for the actors forced to speak the truly atrocious dialogue. And I'm sure there are less boring ways to be made uncomfortable.If I want to witness actors speaking lines as if they don't understand them or as if they're kids being forced to read them out in class I can go to my local am dram production.At first I assumed Colin Farrell had grown a comedy beard and was speaking his lines in a weird affectless singsong because he hoped not to be recognised.But most of the actors seemed to be doing the same. Sometimes they would just suddenly speed up and say a few lines super-quick for no apparent reason, I suspect because they dearly wanted to get the whole ordeal over with.I noticed no 'deep and empathetic bond' reputed by the synopsis to develop between Steven and weirdo teen Martin. All it seemed to be was some kind of creepy co-dependence. Indeed, the fact that the actors appeared uninvested in their lines succeeded in destroying any sympathy you might have for the family's plight. I couldn't wait for something awful to happen to them.Meanwhile poor Nicole Kidman was trying to play it straight, bless her. Perhaps she couldn't grasp that she was required to act badly (and I don't blame her). As a result she was the sole individual you cared about - but just barely.As a viewer, I tried to rationalise their behaviour - were they aliens making a woeful attempt to blend into human society, hence a conversation starting 'My daughter started menstruating yesterday', not to mention the obsession with men's armpit and chest hair?Or were they androids - all of them - again mimicking humans exceedingly poorly to fulfil some inscrutable agenda?Incidentally, it also highlighted another strange phenomenon common to both films and TV series. That is, the mysteriously shrinking interiors of giant American mansions - it's like a reverse Tardis effect.Although they may have twenty-five windows at the front alone and look the same size as your average UK stately home i.e. like places you normally need to purchase a ticket to enter, they never have any spare or guest bedrooms. And unexpected guests always have to 'make do'.For instance, Trish and Roger Murtaugh's house in Lethal Weapon looks absolutely immense but Riggs always has to sleep on the couch. And in Killing the couple's place of abode is even more ginormous but they gamely volunteer to put a mattress on the floor for a guest! Have they only set-dressed a couple of rooms or what? Still, that is only a minor quibble in a movie where they are legion. If you want people to behave like automata and consistently fail to react, even when their lives are at stake, this is for you.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

388,Dispatcher3033,*A Few Weeks Later*,9,11 January 2021,"I don't think it's controversial to say that Yorgos Lanthimos' work is polarizing. Absurd concepts the character take at face value; stilted, wooden delivery of dialogue by the actors; long takes or slow zoom-ins, these are all highlights of his body of work. If you are unable to get past these traits of his you're not going to have a good time. ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is no different.The story is a pure Greek tragedy, which makes sense since it's based on Iphigenia in Aulis by Euripides. Dr. Steven Murphy befriends a former patient's son, Martin. However, things turn sour between the two, and Martin forces Steven to make an unthinkable choice that will affect his family forever. Reading reviews where people are confused by Martin and whether he has ""power"" or if there is some kind of curse misses the point of the story. It is to have an incredible decision put before you and being utterly powerless to stop it.This ties in nicely with the performances which make all the characters seem like they couldn't care less about this decision, only to care for themselves. It could be viewed as a reflection of the audience that would stand by while the unthinkable happens or make excuses to keep the status quo. We don't want to rock the boat, but we don't hold that true for films or novels where our protagonist is supposed to challenge the world they're in and not be complacent. The actors portray this by delivering their lines like they're reading the newspaper.If you can't get behind the character, the production side is amazing. While some reviewers have compared Lanthimos's style to that of Stanley Kubrick, I see some Michael Haneke in certain shots. The camera feels ethereal in some places and adds to this growing unease the story contains.I watched this about 3 weeks or so ago and kept thinking about it and how I honestly felt. I didn't want a knee jerk reaction or just write a review where all I can compare it to is David Lynch. Something that can stick with me for that long after viewing doesn't happen often. Hell, it didn't happen with Lanthimos' other works ""The Lobster"" or ""Dogtooth"" so this was a surprise. I would recommend this film to just about anyone that's looking for a psychological thriller.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
389,l-r-patrick,"But for the stars, who would watch this?",2,16 December 2017,"I know this is based on a play, I'm not sure how much they have stuck to the original script, but the whole film to me felt so unreal 
and so unbelievable. I mean, it seemed odd the attention Colin Farrels (a professional person) character was giving the boy, even if he felt 
guilty for his past mistake. Then, when the boy threatens him, and his children are dying, why would he not kill him as opposed to killing 
his own son, even if he thought they would die. Why would he not call the police, why would he even entertain the boy as much as he did, 
I thought his character was so unbelievable, although his acting as always was good, although bizarre. What was it that the boy did to the
children, the only thing I could think was he had somehow brainwashed them or hypnotised them as there was no explanation. How could
you sit at a acfe where the boy who is responsible for your sons death is as well? Not real at all. If but for the main stars who were in this, 
I don't believe it would get the attention it has so far. But for Colin and Nicole, I would have definitely not watched this to the end. 
I think as a film maker, you have to make films that are appealing to an audience, not films that are just self gratifying, unless you are
using your own money to make them. If you are using other peoples money to make your film, then please make something that has a
large audience as there's plenty of good scripts out there that could be made as opposed to stories like this that have multiple plot holes

The dialogue was bad. The conversations didn't seem to even be like actual conversations. Just characters rambling long, repetitive sentences back and forth.There were several instances, but a good example of bad dialogue was when Martin, Kim, and Bob were having a conversation. The most random things brought up was Martin saying, ""I don't have much body hair."" Then Kim randomly saying, ""I got my period.""
I couldn't help to think, ""Who cares and what does all of that have to do with the conversation?""An example of these bags of meat being hardly emotional was when Steven shot Martin in the leg. Martin still talked as if barely anything happened. A functioning human being would be in pain and struggling, regardless of their pain tolerance.To top it all off, it was never revealed of how Martin caused the children to become sick. It was never revealed if Steven was actually the cause of Martin's father dying during surgery (though evidently him drinking before operation was their ""confirmation"").I understand that the story was supposed to be based off of an old myth, but it was a crapfest.

395,Debukochi,"Not a Horror Movie, But a Horrifying Classic Tragedy.",9,26 January 2020,"This is a contemporary arthouse rework of the classic Greek tragedy, Iphigenia [ee-pah-gay'-nee-yah] (contrary to YouTube mispronunciations), written by Euripides (484-406 BCE), and interpreted by Michael Cacoyannis in one of the great films of the '70s of the same name. (One can perform a simple Internet search for insight into the mythical origin of this story.)
This stylized interpretation is absent any of the archaic, poetic prose of its antecedents--choosing to tell this tale in a contemporary style and setting. Despite this, it can be confusing and even seem illogical, irrational and obtuse to viewers not familiar with the genre of the classic Greek tragedy. Several reviewers seem to be looking for the film to provide an explanation, palatable to a modern mindset, which clarifies 'how' these events could be unfolding. That's not how Greek tragedies work. The film will, however, provide a 'why' for these horrific events (i.e. think 'vengeful gods,' unmoved by even the most passionate pleas for mercy). Not even brilliant physicians, the 'high priests' of our current culture, can provide an understanding or affect a course change in the punishment exacted by these gods through their human vessel (the character, Martin). Viewed in this light, a haircutting scene, foreshadowed early in the film, becomes a gut-wrenching sight--a frantic, futile offering of appeasement by a child, desperately trying to elicit sympathy. This scene is a variation of one from Cacoyannis' Iphigenia, and, when understood in this context, is just as emotionally overwhelming. (I sobbed.)
You'd expect A-list actors like Kidman and Farrell to deliver great performances--which they do--but Barry Keoghan's acting as 'Martin' was remarkably haunting; eliciting sympathy, fondness and revulsion, simultaneously. As with most Greek tragedies, the survivors, despite their initial presumed entitlement, acquiesce to accepting the unacceptable (but unavoidable) outcome and find a means to move on, humbled by their inability to escape their fate.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
396,kapapula-93254,Hard to sit through till the end,1,8 February 2018,"I like psychological thrillers but this was just a big headache from the start till the end. I am sorry but I think that the director is not alright mentally. Filming things like when wife pretends to be in general anaesthetic so that her husband can get his tool to stand up and have intercourse is just sick, not mentioning a secret story about jerking off his father when he was a little boy like really this is the artsy cinematography of these days? It makes me want to vomit. I think this is one of the worst performances from Colin, he is talking like a robot the whole movie not creating even slightest bond with viewers. The only relatable character is Nicole, who portrays a carrying mother just trying to cope with the life she has including a useless, weirdo of a husband, slutty and bitchy daughter and cute but very secluded son. She was the only reason why I managed to sit through till the end. Other than that the music was terrible, not creating any tension just full on annoying. The actor who played Martin did a very good job because I haven´t seen such repulsive movie character in a long time and I guess that it was his goal in the movie. I found the plot quite intriguing but the amount of disturbing scenes, the android like performances and horrible music diminished it to a pain-in-the-ass movie that I would not recommend to anyone. And the ending just made me upset. I would definitely choose someone else to get shot.

Slow story pacing and unexplained mythology are my main problems with this film. Also the robotic acting which is mixed with a lazy script (characters explaining everything they do, and family members talking to each other as if they were complete strangers).
Soulless dialogue does not necessarily mean ""eerie"". It should make you feel uncomfortable but in a creepy way, not in a cringy way. You have to make it believable enough so that it doesn't look like Google Translate bots reading lines.

After watching it, though, I'm honestly baffled as to how it has a 7.1 IMDB rating. This movie was downright bad. First, the plot was just completely ludicrous. Martin's motive was too farfetched and unclear, and the movie also failed to address/explain his supernatural powers altogether. I also found the screenplay to be terribly written. A lot of the dialogue sounded unnatural and recited, which made it difficult for me to immerse myself into the movie. Furthermore, there were so many unnecessary and pointless scenes that did not add anything to the storyline. Examples include, but are not limited to, the creepy sex scene where Anna pretends to be anesthetized and the repeated mention of Kim's menstruation. In terms of the characters, they were all poorly developed. I could not empathize with any of them. Even when bad things were happening to certain characters, I just didn't care. To make matters worse, the cast did not impress me at all with their performances. Every cast member delivered lines with such rigidity to the point where they seemed like emotionless robots. The performances of Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell, in particular, were so lifeless and cold that I honestly thought their respective characters (and not Martin) were the killers.

You will find copious amounts of tidbits and Easter eggs to feed your curiosity about this story.That said, I did need to read and watch analyses of this film in order to truly appreciate it. Unfortunately I feel when the story is so full of symbolism and metaphor that it requires analysis, something is lacking. It feels sort of...try hard and less a natural story.I am impressed enough at the level of depth in character storylines, symbols, and metaphor crossing many areas to give this film a 7, but I'm thinking a 6.5 would be more accurate, just because the story itself is pretty lacking.

The only indication that there was anything going on worth noticing was the music, which often times just swelled up to a cacophony that did nothing but irritate. After the 40 minute mark it began to get slightly interesting. However, the premise of the plot, which you'd have to be willing to actually allow suspicion of disbelief in order to endure, is so ludicrous that it's more of a distraction than anything else. The only ""horrific"" events in this travesty of a film are: 1) when each of the family members try to subtly make a case for why they should be allowed to live, and 2) when a child is ultimately killed. Other than that there was no ""horror"" in this movie, unless you count the fact that the length of the film, which is a little more than 2 hours, is time you will never get back.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

429,methodman-70252,much more than a psychological thriller,8,4 November 2017,"Saying that the ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is just a great psychological thriller is at least undermining... This film is full of brilliant metaphors, but you have to know Greek mythology and history to understand some of them. When Agamemnonas wanted to go to Troy to fight with his ships, there was no wind and he could't get there. So he asked the Gods to throw some strong winds, but the Gods replied that he had to sacrifice something in order to get the winds he desired, so they told him he had to kill his daughter. Agamemnonas thought about it and he decided to kill his daughter, but when he was just about to kill her, the gods transformed her into a deer, so he killed a sacred deer.That's where the title of the movie comes from and you can easily guess the reason..So this film is about choices, sacrifices and revenge.But revenge from the Gods. When Martin can bring sickness and death to Steven's whole family, in fact martin is in the place of a God from Greek mythology. And his duty is to bring the justice and punish those who overestimated their powers and tried to play gods( Steven went to do a surgery drunk)In addition to that, this great film of lanthimos, gives a harsh critic to the modern way of living in the western societies. Alienation, fake goals, fake relations and money that that bring comfort but not happiness.In conclusion it's a great film that gives you much homework to think about when you get home after you watched it and surely much more than just a great psychological thriller that many people believe it to be..",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Any movie that's ""based"" on something else should at least stand alone as its own entity - at least to the point where it makes SOME sort of sense.I'm not as bothered by the monotone voices as other reviewers seem to be. The characters seemed to become more emotional and lively as the film progressed which I found interesting. What I'm mostly bothered by is the unignorable neglect of plot. I'm all for a metaphorical movie that challenges me to think, even after viewing it. But come on... there is just nothing to go off of in this film.The biggest plot point that drives the entire film is this teenager who curses the main characters loved ones as a revenge ploy. How do I even begin to think about how this teenager has the power to curse people in oddly obscure and specific ways? IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU REFLECT ON THE FILM. They give no indication to how that could even be remotely possible.

434,skyeporcupine,You'll either love it or you'll hate it,8,20 January 2018,"The horror genre has seen a resurgence in the US in the last few years that is trying to reconnect to a mainstream audience. This film doesn't achieve that, because it is a piece of art and all art is subjective. This is a deeply unsettling, highly stylized film, and when the plot takes its twists and turns, if you aren't into ""weird"" films with nuanced approaches, you're going to hate this one, so much. First there is the film's distinct rhythm and cadence. The actors speak in a flat, rapid manner that almost sounds like they're running lines for time. Next, the music is unsettling and often doesn't match what's happening on screen. This makes the viewer feel unsettled, possibly without being aware of why that is. The camera angles are Hitchcockian, the color palette like Kubrick. If you don't like Hitchcock or Kubrick, those things will annoy you. The plot takes a while to unfold and lurches and stalls without giving the audience any explanations. The interpretations are left ambiguous on purpose. If you are the type of person who likes predictability and paint-by-numbers storytelling, you should definitely not watch this movie. Go see Avengers instead. If you're more comfortable with being uncomfortable in a movie, and/or a horror buff who is familiar with the works of Miike and Kurasawa, you might still hate this but you'll get something out of it regardless.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

441,Wordsmith,Killing...,5,19 December 2017,"Stylistically this movie may appeal to some, however, I was greatly underwhelmed. These are my main reasons:
-Acting felt really forced and unnatural to me, which stood in the way of connecting with any of the characters.
-The frigid atmosphere added to the sense of distance put between the viewer and, well, anything actually.
-The script was also weird and story got out of hand quickly, without feeling anywhere believable.
-The sound effects and 'music' inappropriately created a false sense of tension. The makers especially went wild with the SFX, which to me were at times excruciating.
If there were any hint of absurdity or a supernatural phenomenon I'd have a reason to accept a lot more of the characters' actions which now just didn't make much sense!
I like weird movies, but this one just seemed to want to be different for all the wrong reasons and in all the wrong ways. I didn't run out of the (nearly empty) cinema, just because I thought some kind of reasonable explanation would come.

Once you bring in superpowers or magic of some sort, you break the internal realism and consistency of the movie, and the suspense disappears. This was the problem with the script, I feel.If it was possible that Martin had done what he did with the aid of some ancient, unrecorded poisonous substance (or some other even remotely believable device, it would have been a great mystery.

The scenario is full of holes. It is worse than a Swiss cheese. The execution of musics does not make you get in the mood. It just makes you cringe... Yet it has 7 points (at least for now) on IMDB compared, ranking much higher than many other good thrillers. Why? I really have no idea.Secondly the story is not prepared well. It is not presenting an opinion, it is imposing its opinions on you. In the end my conclusion is the director and scenarist hate doctors and want to impose a stricter liability on them in law. However, they did not even provide any substance. It is like there is a sickness and no body understands it... Except that little boy of course. None of the doctors are able to understand what is wrong. Probably because they are not using their brain. But that's unusual.

458,JDreviews101,Utterly bland and monotonous overrated whim.,3,2 January 2018,"I was really looking forward to seeing this as the critics and reviewers were very positive about it. Although I'm no fan of Lanthimos I decided to go ahead and watch the film anyways - bad mistake. I knew beforehand it wasn't going to be the average psychological thriller flick, and that's exactly what sparked my interest for it. Now that I've seen the movie and thought about it for a while I have to say that I truly regret watching it, It's just not worth the time. The film relies heavily on metaphors and symbolisms that simply do not work for me. The direction and writing is highly questionable since the very first few scenes. The characters and dialogues are so monotonous, bland and emotionless that it becomes a huge distraction since the first few lines of spoken dialogue. It's obviously none of the actors fault as I'm pretty sure the outcome is exactly what Lanthimos wanted, but it is really painful to see such wasted acting talent in this poorly executed whim of a film. Sometimes actors have little to absolutely no creative freedom over their roles, and it certainly seems that this was the case here. The characters had basically no chemistry whatsoever as everything involving their interactions felt forced and dishonest. There are some scenes that are totally unnecessary and feel very out of place as they contribute absolutely nothing in the plot's development. At the end of the second act is when I really stopped caring about the characters and the movie itself. I wish I could say the opposite but even the musical score felt irritating since the very beginning. I guess the only positive things I could say are on the technical aspect - at least the camerawork, editing and cinematographic style are pretty slick. All in all not recommended, very disappointing.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
459,batigoal9-1,My interpretation,8,14 April 2018,"Just watched the film, haven't read any analyses or comments and although I'm Greek, I couldn't say more than one sentence about the Iphigenia play. I think there are plenty of deeper meanings, here's my take.The film is like a mirror of opposites. Before the film, father screws up, kills part of the teenager's family and ruins that family. During the film, the boy forces the father to ruin his own family this time.The obvious question is how would that happen, well it can't under any normal circumstances, hence the supernatural element, the curse just is, there is no explanation and it was clear from early on there could be no explanation since the symptoms made no sense for a single person, let alone two.There are many aspects of the film where this mirror of opposites applies but it doesn't get any clearer than the scene where he bites the father's arm and then instantly bites his own arm. And immediately after that, it's like one step before breaking the 4th wall, the boy asks do you understand and repeats three times, it's a metaphor, it's metaphorical, it's symbolic.There are aspects of justice and revenge but I think the theme that suits better is the hubris-nemesis combination.I think he's trying to be nice to the boy cause of guilt, he understands he has made something terrible but he's not willing to go all the way. He keeps it hidden plus the whole society system works in his favor. And he refuses to ""replace"" the boy's father despite the effort the boy and his mother have made for him. He isn't afraid of negative consequences since under normal circumstances the boy not only can't do anything to him but he wouldn't even be able to know of the doctor's mistake in the first place.The cold world is Lanthimos' bread and butter but besides that, for a reasoning coherent with the film itself, I think it serves the purpose of separating it from real life. If you had normal stuff, the supernatural curse would feel super weird and out of place. Instead, you start normal and slowly but steadily get acclimatized to weirdness. And by the time the bomb drops with the boy revealing him the crazy curse, you already have your suspicions and you are more open to it.The fries scene, in the opening one as soon as the boy says he saves them for last, the father says he does that too so there's the mirror aspect again. Additionally, starting and finishing a film with the same or similar scene is a common theme in films and life in general (ouroboros in the west, wheel of time in the east etc). My view on the connection between the two scenes is in the starting one, the father has killed someone and ruined the boy's family but the boy is eating as if nothing wrong or significant has happened. In the last one, the boy has forced the father to ruin his own family and it's now the daughter that's eating as if everything's normal.Regarding the relationship between the boy and the daughter, I'll go back to the mirroring. On one side you've got the father trying out of guilt to be good towards the boy and the mother but as soon as it's about to go the final step, he backs off (visit to their house). On the opposite side, you've got the boy trying out of guilt to be good towards the father's family but as soon as it's about to go the final step with the daughter he backs off (scene in daughter's room). The similarities are uncanny. The mother irrationally loves the doctor despite the damage he's done to her family. The daughter irrationally loves the boy despite the damage he's doing to her family.I think the boy's mother importance is limited to those two things (proving the father is unwilling to hurt his life to help the boy's life and as an opposite to the daughter), hence why the small part.Regarding Martin lying to Anna about Steven flirting with his mom, it's about ruining the family and there's still the mirroring aspect as far as lying in general. There's a ton of lying, the father lies all the time and the boy does the same.The hand idolization in my opinion is a metaphor to society's view on doctors. It's the best job, they are flawless, never making mistakes etc. And that's also prevalent early in the film elsewhere, in the speech scene, he changes the classic saying ""the operation was successful, but the patient died"" and there's tragic irony in that as it's a common secret a lot operations fail due to human errors, yet doctors are never held accountable for that.And there's opposite mirroring here too. On one side the hopelessness of going against doctors and on the other side what happens in the film, where it's obvious the two children are very sick, yet all the doctors insist they are fine or ignore them.Finally, regarding the the body hair, yet again mirroring. Initially, it looks like they are going to be different but they stand opposite to each other and find out there is little difference.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

First, the character building: bad, stilted dialogue, deliveries so flat that they undercut all emotion, and unbelievable character arcs. Furthermore, the cinematography was perhaps meant to be edgy or cool but it was just annoying- lots of shots from weird, unnecessary angles. The music was wretched- they were going for a eerie feeel, but the constant whinny of the high pitched theramin just Made it so I HAD to mute the TV instead, so mission not accomplished. On top of all this bad, the plot made very little sense.

It could never be targeted at the masses, but if it were it would be treated as an insult to conservative family values and attacked with disdain, confusion, and ""1"" star ratings.What I loved most about this film was its ability to strip me bare of my moral conscience and force me to analyze how karma and justice are interpreted in the eyes of others. ""Is that fair?"" ""Who does fairness apply to?"" ""Should I give something because I took something?"" ""Is there a real force on Planet Earth that implements justice outside of courtrooms and public opinion?""These are the questions that I asked myself during this film. Beyond that, the acting is superb, the atmospheric tone is calculated to be cold and cruel, and the stage setup and background music are flawless in every scene.I came in with VERY modest expectations and was treated to a marvelous psycho thriller that nearly blew me away. The true acting ""Ace"" of this film is Martin (the antagonist, played by actor Barry Keoghan), whose teen character constructs the unwavering foundation of the entire film.You will either love this film, or you will hate it.

476,kalgo-725-870078,"Don't know where we are going, but like the ride!",9,5 January 2018,"I really like this film. The casting was perfect. I felt a lot like I did after watching The Lobster. Definite tension throughout, but the film had me with the style of delivering dialogue right from the beginning(the conversation about the watches). I read the IMDB description which introduces Colin's character as charismatic? What? I assumed as we were watching that he was a personality-less 'aspie'. Lol I have to admit that I went into the film cold, knew nothing about its connection to mythology/greek tragedies, and found the meaning afterward by reading reviews from others. Even without having an idea of what was going on, I still enjoyed it. I will enjoy it again some time now that I am informed. And, spoiler alert, my interpretation(thanks to the help from smarter reviewers) is that this is a battle of gods. Martin, a god, is punishing Dr. Murphy, a lesser god, for his indiscretion, or for his guiltless reaction to it. Dr. Murphy has messed with the wrong god. Martin demonstrates his godly ability through his inflicting of a plague on the family, and even his ability to cure them, as desired, by him alone. Dr Murphy demonstrates his power by routinely healing the sick, miraculous surgical expertise, and providing extreme comfort/wealth for family, providing an idyllic existence. Dr. Murphy also demonstrates a sense that he has limits, that he is impotent, no match for Martin. His wife confirms that she is aware of this. Nicole was a perfect cast, playing a character not unlike hers in 'eyes wide shut', where she seems to have one face she shares all of the time, but when forced, reveals that she is someone different inside. You sense that she tolerates a less than passionate life in exchange for the predictability and comfort/wealth, and when this is threatened, she is not shy to reveal her inner thoughts, and her teeth. Nicole is a statuesque beauty who plays a peaceful goddess who has no ability to counter the powers of Martin. One thing I haven't figured out is if they are gods living among mortals or if they are in a community and all around them, their friends and neighbors, are also gods? One option that is off the table for Murphy's wife, but open to him, is the idea of killing Martin. You sense that she, both the goddess, and the wife, is more powerful than her husband, and I believe it is safe to say this mirrors our mortal, real world, relationships.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Out For Justice this is not.Things get strange quickly, and you don't get the full scope of what he's doing until the middle of the movie.

479,lspijker,Pretentious nonsense,1,29 December 2017,"This movie seems to aim to be some kind of ""higher"" for art, symbolizing stories from Greek mythology. Applying stylized dialogs and cinematic effects to give it an arthouse feel.
Well, in my mind it utterly fails to do so, and unfortunately when not seeing it like a highly stylized form of cinema, you are left with a confusing, irritating, stiff dialoged, inconsistent kind of psychological thriller-horror that complete fails.
If you put aside the ridiculous references to Greek mythology, you are left with a weird mix of The Gift, maybe a bit of Cronenberg's Spider all embedded in a David Lynch like absurd universe. However, in that case it so completely lacks the stylistic quality of those movies, that you are left with nothing but pretentious nonsense.
Only good thing is the acting, in sofar possible with the absolute terribly directed dialogs. Nice to enjoy Collin Farrell in a more serious role, and I almost always like Nicole Kidman.

And this was of course to let Martin slowely creep in. but the plot was made in a way it was totally normal to happen. as if we could sense it's weirdness. Yorgos is inmensly good in goofy dialog which is not funny at all. but makes it even absurd. as a watcher you'll be confronted with the choice you make in your head. the question: what would I do in this situation is a horrible thing on it's on. and makes the goal of the movie oh so clear. the only thing I missed was the unsolved mistery of how this could happen? how was martin capable of doing this to the family. but maybe i'm thinking too rational then. so it's a fine masterpiece, again.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

I'm not biased against the kinds of films the director makes; I find The Lobster and The Favourite much better films.The Greek myth is basically about how a powerful person is brought so low by things beyond his control that he has to sacrifice something valuable. But this sort of thing doesn't really happen among doctors, as far as I know. It seems doctors are usually exploited by patients, insurance companies, etc. The use of the metaphor isn't really correct. Just seems like the director is forcing a metaphor to make a story seem more intellectual but ends up feeling like fluff.Even though the doctor, being someone who has control over a person's life, seems to have God's power, that is not real power. He isn't a modern day version of the Greek ruler.

This would have been better served up as a Twilight Zone episode as alot of the scenes were not necessary IMO. Despite some big name actors appearing in this, the acting was not so great either... adequate at best, the weirdo kid being the most effective but that said his role was so far out there that it is hard to judge.

It's one of those types of movies that require a certain level of intellect to understand and appreciate it.Here are some things I enjoyed about this film the most:
I loved how unexpected the dialogue was. It's masterfully written, and one of a kind, in my opinion. The writer, certainly pulled this off very well. The unexpected dialogue between characters was a thrill itself. I enjoyed being shocked by what the characters were saying throughout the film. I enjoyed the thrill and surprise of it all.
I also enjoyed the score in this film. The creators used it in a way to provide such a theatrical effect. When you hear the music, the audience is immediately aware that something is to come, and it's a very thrilling, over the top experience, that just makes you marvel at such creativity.
I also loved all the creative camera angles and effects. Being able to craft a movie in such a way is truly remarkable and admirable. The way the creators were able to project a image of this family and other characters by using these effects, to set a scene and create such an effect on the audience, is beautiful. It was very elegantly crafted.
Overall, this movie was a masterpiece, in my opinion. Not just anyone can craft such a movie. It requires a true artist to craft a movie like this and make it work. It surely worked well for me. I appreciated the art and talent behind it all, and would absolutely love to see more movies from these set of film creators.
So, is it worth watching? 100 percent. It's achingly chilling, thrilling, and unique, but what the audience is able to receive from such an experience and craft, goes way beyond than that of a ""creepy"" undertaking...it may be grueling, disturbing, and uncomfortable...but isn't life grueling, disturbing, and uncomfortable too? However, despite the dirtiness of life, isn't it just the most beautiful? There must be a bit of darkness to even know and appreciate such beauty, right? Because you cannot appreciate such beauty if you have not experienced a bit of dark.

497,blundellisgod,About as jet black as humour can possibly get...,8,13 January 2018,"For a filmmaker as avant garde and layered as Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster), the plot of The Killing of a Sacred Deer is deceptively simple. Alas, I can't give much of it away here other than to say that a surgeon (Colin Farrell) is forced to face up to his past by a teenage boy (Barry Keoghan). Lanthimos has got the best out of Farrell before in the aforementioned film The Lobster and he is excellent again here. Farrell is a much better actor when not asked to do an accent and he simmers and pops here in a difficult role. Indeed, in a Lanthimos film all the roles are difficult. Each character only has two settings, a robotic lack of emotion or over the top melodrama. This style takes a while to warm to but eventually the sheer poignancy of the plot helps one to forget about the quirks and idiosyncrasies.It's about time I devoted a paragraph to Nicole Kidman because she really is an astonishing actress. Despite loving her in everything from Big Little Lies to Dogville, I don't think I have ever truly given her the props she deserves. As good as Farrell and Keoghan are here, Kidman is at least their match. Portraying a multi faceted character with little more than a pointed glance and a word or two is difficult but the Australian actress breezes through a tumultuous and fearless performance. She really is a movie star in every sense of the word.Anyway, back to Lanthimos. Anyone who has seen The Lobster or indeed Dogtooth will know that the Greek director likes to infuse his films with jet black comedy and Sacred Deer is no different. There are genuinely laugh out loud moments within this dark fable which make the viewer uncomfortable but never detract from the story itself. Actually fable isn't quite the right word. Sacred Deer is closer to a fairy tale. A modern day fairy tale of course, but the idea that all actions have a clear consequence is straight from the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Anderson.A lot of people will not like this film, and it isn't because they don't understand it, it is because some people don't go to the cinema to be challenged. There is nothing wrong with that, it is supposed to be entertainment after all, but those that approach The Killing of a Sacred Deer with an open mind will surely be rewarded with one of the most unique viewing experiences of 2017.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

We figured out everything pretty quickly but it just kept slowly , almost painfully, dragging on. Most of the sex scenes (and some sex talk) were unnecessary and uncomfortable, and really did nothing to add to the story. The music that was suspenseful at first became almost goofy later on. Music alone does not a thriller make. Colin Farrell spinning around in his living room was an especially lame scene that made no sense, and oh yeah, I thought the title was pretty dumb too.Like I said, I think 4 stars is being generous, and I gave it that much only because I thought almost all of the actors played their rolls well.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
501,Fandango137,Confronting Irrationality,7,28 July 2020,"The film confronts the viewer, existing in a rational world, with the what happens when one meets an irrational force. A force that disenfranchises an individual, as they confront the stronger opponent. The irrational and unexplainable, as it invades a comfortable and familiar environment, revealing a helplessness in the individual. This can be referred to as fate.The title draws parallels to the Ancient Greek Myth about King Agamemnon in Sophocles' Electra, whose army incurred the wrath of Artemis for killing her sacred deer. Martin, then, is our Artemis. This is further alluded to when Martin asks, ""how do you know I'm not God?"". This references, of course, not The God, but one of the lesser Gods known in Greek Mythology. In Greek Mytholoy, Gods were seen as the perfect distillation of a set of ideas or principles. If in Christianity Christ is the embodiment of morality and virtue, then in Greek Mythology, Artemis was the God of hunting. Hunting is seen as a confrontation with nature, a form of sustenance, as well as man's subsequent triumph over it. When viewing Martin as a God-like figure, we are able to explain the preternatural events that are shown. As the world of the film exists under the umbrella of Martin's rules (God-like figure), then all of the events shown are consequences of disobeying his rules. Martin, in the context of the film, is the God of surgery.Steven, existing under the umbrella of this paradigm, and going against this law, has condemned himself to God's wrath (Martin). Steven's sin isn't that of killing Martin's father, which is something that may occur during surgery and is always understood as a possibility, but of going against the codex of surgery. As he was under the influence of alcohol during surgery, Steven broke Martin's law (God of Surgery). He has gone against the objective law of God, and throughout the film justifies his own rules as the accepted norm, ""it's acceptable to drink a little before an operation to calm the nerves.""We see that Martin is not seeking vengeance, as evidenced by him stating that he holds no anger towards Steven. Martin is God, and he is enforcing the law of God by punishing Steven for his impropriety. When Steven meets with Martin at the cafe, this is the deciding moment of his fate. This is indicated by Martin stating, ""this is the critical moment that needed to come to fruition, and here it is."" When Martin explains what Steven must do, Steven realizes what justice means within the confines of his own rules. It is important to note that Martin does not tell Steven that he should repent. This is because Martin is only the law, the prevailing force dictating that for every action must accompany an equal action. His mechanical and emotionless demeanor is further indicative of the notion that Martin is merely the law. He is objective and cerebral.Fate is typically seen as deterministic. It is accepted as the product of the external, as something unable to be changed. Fate is not seen as the manifestation of a given internal state, which is able to be influenced. We are able to shape how we act or how we think, but we do not see these as arbiters of outcome. During antiquity, philosophers, seeing themselves as under the influence of something greater than them, understood that changing their inner state could inevitably change their fate.Around the 4th century, as antiquity came to an end, the rise of Christianity replaced Greek Mythology, with the former's understanding of God as Love. This paradigm shift now placed fate as the product of God's will, which the believer saw as a part of His Love. Now love is seen as greater than law, and the belief that God awaits mercy as opposed to sacrifice. Blind fate is seen as the will of God, leading one to His grace.Despite the West being a product of Christianity, Steven does not adhere to its principles. He does not acknowledge his fault, instead battling his fate internally. Steven, existing within the confines of the temporal, is unwilling and unable to acknowledge that change must come from within. He battles the external by trying to explain Bob's symptoms as physical, dismissing the possibility of psychosomatic disorder, which is an attempt at confronting the external by searching from within (the mind).In the end, there is no conventional catharsis, which is expected from Greek Mythology, where what occurs is the result of governed laws. The idea of outcome being the product of an internal state is similar to the teachings of C.N. Lazarev, where he writes that change happens on the energetic level before eventually manifesting in the temporal. The frequency and type of thought or action determines the density of this energy and its subsequent composition.And so Steven conforms to the law of Martin, existing externally, but does not change himself internally. The family leaves the diner spiritually unchanged, still existing within the confines of the corporeal as absolute.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

I have never seen Colin Farrell look so on edge and in pain. It was also very good with Nicole's acting, how she has conviction in her strategy.It was so funny when there was terrible news at the hospital, and she just says 'make sure you water the plants'. These people are shockers. It is hard to feel too sorry for them. It's a bit like that movie with Cameron Diaz and the big button she has to press to make decisions.Look, today is all about psychopaths and duplicity. This kid is really good at that, and you can just feel his anger and weirdness the whole time. You feel like he could take out the whole town he is so weird. I must mention he and the others grated on me the way the dialogue got delivered, but it was part of a masterplan.I liked the hospital scenes, they were oringinal. Also, so glad it didn't turn out to be about the couple. In fact, they stay together and are quite bonded in that way. I really don't know how they could choose between the two, and it shouldn't be watched by people with young children really.Original, wicked and funny, makes you think and laugh too.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

505,BruceAndTheBeast,I've seen still images with more coherent stories.,1,7 January 2018,"I was thrilled when I saw the trailer for ""The Killing of a Sacred Dear."" I'd thought that it would follow in the foot steps of child-gone psycho films such as ""Orphan"", ""The Bad Seed"" or ""The Good Son.""These kind of films have always intrigued me! It had an extremely high rating here on IMDB (Last time I trust it), so I'd figured it'd have been worth a watch. I can safely say that I will be sure to read the reviews prior to viewing next time. Where does one even begin? ""The Killing of a Sacred Dear"" managed to underwhelm on almost every front. I've never seen acting this wooden or line delivery this stilted in any professionally made film before. The cast attempts to portray a group of unrealistic, inhuman, underdeveloped and ultimately unlikable cast of characters that go through no significant changes, revelations or development over the course of the 2 hours I spent (wasted) watching this. There were oddities in the music choice and even issues in the sound mixing. There were scenes where ""ominous"" music was played over two characters having a casual conversation and scenes were the music was so loud it was drowning out the dialogue. The film is riddled with pointless and needlessly sexual deleted-scene esque material that could have been removed and would have improved the films pacing. Then there comes the leading issue. The story, or rather lack thereof. It's apparently based off of some archaic greek story without being changed or contextualized to make sense in a modern setting. We all know how it went. The father (just watched the movie and already forgot his name) killed Martin's father in surgery and now his son Martin wants to avenge the innocent...by targeting the innocent. (Again, not properly contextualized.) He makes the children of this family deathly ill. How he managed to do this is not even remotely hinted at or explained. Is he god? Is he psychic? Is he a WIZARD!? As far as the character of Martin goes, he's kind of just a creep. His history and character have no exploration other than his ""You took one of mine, now I take one of yours"" mentality. Anyway, I guess I can talk about the conclusion now. Or rather how much of a waste of a conclusion it is. It isn't deserved. It isn't satisfying. It isn't worthy of the 2 hour build up it receives. It doesn't even appear to have any impact or consequence as the film abruptly ends before the weight of the situation can be felt, that's assuming the events of the conclusion carried any weight at all. Overall, this is probably the worst movie I'll see in 2018.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

After the director's marvellous masterpiece ""The Lobster"", I expected a bigger movie - bigger in direction, screenplay, actor ensemble, and budget - since The Lobster received many accolades and an Oscar nom for best screenplay! However, his new movie seemed as if it was actually filmed before ""The Lobster"" - a dull, white and unappealing setting (mostly the hospital), not an ensemble cast or switching scenes + an unattractive and annoying young boy as the young protagonist.I actually watched it till the end with enthusiasm because of Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman - I really like their work and acting and they never disappoint. Also, hail to Nicole for having such a great year ahead! They had some great scenes together which make the movie worth to watch. The most annoying part must be the recurring unsettling & loud orchestral music to force the effect of: ""Hey, you are not watching a slow-paced drama with no elements of thriller or action, it is going to be so exciting and spooky right now"". ...and the ""bloody violence"" or scary, spooky scenes never came, actually. Wished Nicole Kidman had more scenes, though. She was too passive.

However, the reason we don't feel that Martin is realizing justice is because of the family relationship between humans. Humans are related in family relationships and that is a blessing, but can be a tragedy at the same. Why does a man gets underated if his father is a criminal? Why do people blame parents when their children did something wrong. This movie gives an answer to these questions. These problems can be tragic but it is inevitable due to the human curse.

I can't think that Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman would star in this garbage of a movie if it wasn't for the money. And only for the money. The movie does start out well, but then completely loses coherency. The script must have been written by someone who does not have children - or who lacks any true connection to his or her own children. This isn't a modern version of Sophie's Choice.

525,glpetroni,"what the word ""Sacrifice"" really means?",5,27 January 2019,"Sorry mister Lanthimos , in general I like your cinema but you don't know what ""sacrifice"" is.
We could say it's the opposite of what u think it is. In your movie your are talking about the law of ""An eye for an eye"" (or ""A tooth for a tooth""). This is the law of retaliation, the principle that a person who has injured another person is to be penalized to a similar degree, and the person inflicting such punishment should be the injured party.
This is a very human way of thinking , and something very commun in our mediocre ""low"" world.Sacrifice is exactly the opposite , it is the way we can escape the laws of the dark world to reach higher degreee of consciousness and reality (from Latin sacrificium , sacer+ facere , to perform the sacred/holy). I have been punished but I don't reply ""an eye from an eye"" : I SACRIFICE my pain and I obtain something much more noble, the liberty from the laws of this world. It's is the only way to be free and to escape the prison of the life in this world. And can e applied to all kind of sufferance.So ok everything but we should take much more attention using such important word and concept.

526,glpetroni,About Sacrifice,5,27 January 2019,"I would like to add something to my last review. I was saying that sacrifice is exactly the opposite of the law of retaliation (the law that we see in the movie, also known as ""An eye for an eye"") the principle that a person who has injured another person is to be penalized to a similar degree. I was also saying that the deep understanding of sacrifice refer to the sacrifice of human sufferance to reach higher degree of consciousness and existence. When we sacrifice something (and sufferance in particular) we are not losing anything but we are obtaining something much more noble and valuable: liberty from the laws of the world and the human sufferance. In the sacrifice of Isaac when Isaac is bound to an altar, a messenger from God stops Abraham at the last minute, saying ""now I know you fear God."" Abraham looks up and sees a ram and sacrifices it instead of Isaac. Similarly the sacrifice of Iphigenia ends with a messenger reporting that Iphigenia has been replaced on the altar by a deer (the deer of the title of the movie). Also in the story of Hariscandra (and ancient myth of the Hinduism tradition) Rohita does not die when he is scarified and sent to death by his father the king Harischandra. Sacrifice brings to Life not to death! The movie should finish with everybody safe and alive after the sacrifice of one of the member family (in the understanding of the myth of Iphigenia and sacrifice in general).

You know when you realize that you are watching a well done piece, but it just isn't your thing? The dialogue was stilted. Intentionally, of course. My best guess is that it was supposed to give the character's voices a cadence that one would use were they telling the story aloud. I don't know that to be true, though.I do know that it kept taking me out of the moment. It reminded me of dialogue from The Room by Tommy Wisseau, but delivered by top caliber actors. Once that mental image entered my brain, it wouldn't leave. Every line went through that filter thereafter.The story itself is ironically unique, as I believe it is an adaptation of a mythological story. It has that nonsensical cause and effect one expects from ancient fables.There were some moments I found enjoyable in their successful attempt to make the audience uncomfortable.Fantastic performances all around with a standout job by Barry Keoghan.

529,jessica-gonzatto,"Interesting and dark, but obviously not perfect",8,22 January 2018,"The newest feat by one-of-a-kind director Yorgos Lanthimos is actually as disturbing as apparently intended to be: inspired by a greek tragedy, it shows the characters inevitably marching towards a family related near impossible decision. This paired with Lanthimos' stone-cold detachment in directing and writing creates a barren environment for a discussion that gets morally interesting, but ultimately too caught up in its own world for its own good.Its fantastic realism approach - either on narrative self-indulgences or in its directing style - certainly opens up the possibilities for new storytelling routes, making it a film that's almost free of clichés, but somehow towards the ending, the general progress of the narrative feels underwhelming, and frankly, plain. There are merits, though, such as the natural progression on Martin's obsession and need for closeness; the wholesome and technically difficult performances the cast delivers; the interesting and raw dialogues between Martin and Steven, among others. But the main difficulty I encountered while watching this movie was finding reasons for the bluntly stripped down cast directing Lanthimos insists on (not only in Sacred Deer, but in his career as a whole): was it necessary for creating a piece that speaks differently than, say, a blockbuster? Was it necessary for the chilling narrative choice to come across as chilling indeed? Was it an underlying intention or more deeply rooted in personal matters for Lanthimos? Or was it out of a need for building a style and a manner of communication that is unusual just for the sake of it? It feels to me as a self-imposed choice, and maybe not what this story needed.The cinematography, on another instance, fills the gap that may have been left blank by the edgeless acting. It screams elegance mixed with real life dullness, and even though the insane amount of zoom ins will definitely get tiring after a while, its visual approach through non familiar framing choices and general emphasis are a true feast for the eyes. It might've been done before, but still feels fresh and secure of itself. Technically a very well done movie, and stylistically speaking, one of Lanthimos' finest - specially regarding his first movies. Even though the story might've fell short and unappealingly set up for a forgettable ending after building a great momentum, its elegant narrative progression and tragic take on family, revenge and closeness between people makes The Killing of a Sacred Deer worth the watch.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

And it is game, that everyone believed and not argue with own fantasies about this 'situation'. He manipulates hard. And for me this movie and the events on the screen are very psychological games and in real life between us it has own big place too, manipulations, manipulations, loneliness and crazy loneliness (loneliness is not crazy thing, in fact, its ok to be, but there it overdramatic, for family where man dies on surgery), about how we should understand ourselves and our motives, emotions and subjugate what we are saying, thinking or overthinking in real, and create own reality, fantasies, illness, and worries!

It literally ended how it was telling you it would for most of the film. Extremely underwhelming. I love horror films and psychological horror/thrillers even more when executed well. This however wasn't even close. I feel like I've just wasted a couple hours of my life.

I was wrong. ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"", from ""The Lobster"" director Yorgos Lanthimos, is not only one of the most mind-boggling films of 2017, it's one of my favourites. It revolves around a cardiothoracic surgeon by the name of Steven Murphy (played by Colin Farrell), who forms a friendship with a young man by the name of Martin (played by ""Dunkirk"" actor Barry Keoghan), and the strange events that follow once Martin gradually becomes more and more strange. That's all I want to say about the plot as I didn't see a single trailer for the film and went in completely blind and I'm really glad I did, because this is definitely a film that should be experienced that way. From the fantastic performances from the whole cast (especially those of Colin Farrell and ""Dunkirk"" actor Barry Keoghan) to the amazing cinematography and unconventional camera work, the at times extremely unsettling music as well as the near-perfect pacing and run time and unpredictability of the plot among other things made ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" a truly special and memorable experience at the cinema. This is definitely not your typical hollywood film, it is, while frequently funny, also extremely dark and it doesn't surprise me at all that it's labelled as a psychological horror film on Wikipedia. Not only does it have several scenes that will either make you chuckle or gasp, there are a couple parts in the film that are just plain uncomfortable to watch as well, especially when I was reminded of such other films as ""Funny Games"", ""Psycho"" or even Lanthimos's previous directorial effort, ""The Lobster"", another film that doesn't feel like it's really set in reality. It's probably the darkest comedy of the year, but Lanthimos doesn't just focus on one single genre, he instead uses elements of multiple genres like he did in ""The Lobster"", which is extremely refreshing and makes him a filmmaker to look out for. I was strangely fascinated by the overall odd nature of ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" and was hooked right from the start. This is also definitely a film that will most likely puzzle most viewers, it pretty much explains almost nothing and leaves you connect the dots after you've seen it and the film has such a lasting impact that you will probably want to read about it in depth and I love the fact that some films nowadays still have that ability to stay with you like that and those are the ones I love watching. It's not even about the basic premise of the film, it's just the way that it goes about telling its story with all it's themes, dark humor, camera work, the weird dialogue and the way the actors deliver their lines to name a few things that really make ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" stand out from the rest of the films that tackle similar subjects. Overall, I was truly impressed by this film, for everyone that's interested in seeing it, I can only recommend it, it's an extremely unconventional film and one that will stay with you even after the credits are over.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
536,ruthbroxton,Wooden acting and terrible storyline.,3,7 January 2018,"I decided to give this a try after seeing how high it had been rated.The storyline seemed intriguing and as it was classed as a horror/thriller would be right up my street. 10 minutes into the film I almost left. The acting is terribly wooden with lines delivered in a monotonous drone. Nicole Kidman is the only actor that kept me watching this movie. 
As the movie progressed I thought that it was picking up a little and the horror element was finally surfacing. How wrong I was.
As the film finished I stared at the screen expecting some other explanation as to who Martin was, why the family had just accepted was he had done to them and what was the reason for meeting in the diner. This didn't happen.
I think I will start looking elsewhere for movie ratings as the ones on Imbd seem to be falsified by the people that are proffiting from the unsuspecting filmgoers. Give this movie a wide berth. Even the few and far between scenes of gore couldn't pull it back.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

538,kkeane-68234,Terrible,1,24 March 2018,"I'm so tired of basing my movie watching on the ratings on IMDB and being so bitterly disappointed like this.
I appreciate the Arthouse genre but feel this was one of those moment when a painter draws a pink line through a mottled grey background and sells it for 20K because he said it was the next big thing... this movie struggled to get its point across, if it weren't for the acting this would have zero appeal. 
There is nothing more frustrating than walking away from a film having more questions unanswered than you did before it started. 
If still you decide to watch, take my advice and give up at the first moment you think, wow where is this going, I'm kinda bored. I stopped my husband from turning it off 3 times as I believed it had to get better somehow, surely? Look how much money they've spent on actors?

539,gtkennedy,I liked it but it could have been so much better,7,8 May 2019,There is so much to love about this movie the great acting purposeful cinematography and good music. What really holds it back is how Yorgos has decided to direct the actors. He has chosen to have the actors deliver dialogue is a very matter of fact and emotionless way similar to how Wes Anderson does and it really takes a lot of the tension out of what is happening to these characters. It would have made much more sense for just Barry Keoghan's character to talk like this in the beginning. And maybe have the mother sister and protagonist to go into this way of talking towards the end of the film to show their descent into madness I feel like this would have made the film much more interesting to watch for me. But instead they just act like robots for the entire movie. I mean come on like there is that one scene where Bob loses his ability to stand up and he acts like he could care less. But even with this major problem this movie is super well made and I still definitely enjoyed it over all and would totally recommend it. I feel like some people would love this movie and some people would hate it but its totally worth a shot.,The Killing of a Sacred Deer

541,bloodyhigh,he Killing of a Sacred Deer is a MUST WATCH for fans of psychologically disturbing horror,9,2 October 2018,"TL;DR:
The Killing of a Sacred Deer is deeply dark and disturbing psychological thriller about sacrifice and revenge that will crawl under your skin and stay in your head days after you've watched it.The LONG version:
Before I dive in, I feel like I need to disclose one small detail. I enjoy watching movies (especially horror) while high on cannabis. Apologies in advance to anyone out there who that may offend. That being said, the impetus for writing high horror movie reviews ignited immediately after watching I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House on Blackwater. I'd obviously watched countless horror movies high prior to that evening, but that specific movie/strain pairing blew my mind. So much so that I felt compelled to document the experience. Since then, I've been chasing that feeling - trying to find another movie/strain pairing that would produce the same results. Horror movie after horror movie, I felt like my objective was becoming more elusive. That is until I watched The Killing of a Sacred Deer extremely high on some LA Confidential - we're talking between an 8 and 9 on the high scale.I had no idea what to expect from this movie going in. I hadn't read any reviews or watched any trailers. I went in completely blind. I've since gone and watched a couple trailers and they all ruin a major plot point. Trust me, the less you know the better. In fact, if you haven't seen it yet you should probably stop reading this review. But damn, if this movie didn't impress the hell out of me! From the opening frame (which I'll get into a bit later) to the closing credits, I was victim to its strangle hold. I couldn't turn away from the deeply disturbing and unsettling story unfolding before my eyes. But just as the way I felt while watching I Am the Pretty Thing..., I kept asking myself during the course of the movie, ""Wait? Would I be enjoying this movie as much if I were sober?""Let me just come straight out and say it. The acting is bad. Really bad. But is it? If I were sober I think it may have been something that bothered me. But high, I kept thinking the bad acting was intentional. After all, we have two very capable actors in Nicole Kidman and Colin Ferrell - Academy Award and Golden Globe winners respectively. But in this movie their performances were wooden and lacked emotion. The whole thing felt artificial, like I was watching a stage play. But again, I felt like it may have been an intentional artistic choice by director Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster). Contributing to the ""stage play"" aesthetic was its effective use of cinematography. Yorgos leaned heavily on long static shots that lingered to the point it felt voyeuristic. Super wide angle lenses were also used pretty liberally throughout creating almost impossible looking results where everything and everyone is captured in a single frame - like looking into a dollhouse. It's difficult to describe, but you'll know it when you see it. There's no denying that this movie is visually stunning. All of this, combined with a powerful story and my elevated state of mind produced a psychologically sinister movie experience like no other.Before I dive into the premise, let's chat about the strain I selected that night. LA Confidential is well known indica known for its calming, yet psychedelic effects. Buds are light green in color with orange hairs. Hints of purple are also buried deep in the nugs. The flavor is piney with a strong skunky smell. Hits were smooth both on the inhale and exhale allowing patients such as myself to really appreciate the taste. Pro-tip: Make sure you have your environment complete set before consumption because LA Confidential hits quick and it hits hard. Once the effects take hold, it'll leave you locked in place with zero desire to do anything, let alone move at all. In the five minutes it took for me to down a large glass of water, brush my teeth and hop into bed I was already completely baked.The first minute of the movie begins in complete darkness with only a haunting orchestral track playing in the background. It was at this moment that the psychedelic properties started to reveal themselves. My entire bedroom became cloaked in complete darkness. My body was floating and I felt like I was in space. Scratch that. I was in space. Then from darkness, the movie abruptly cuts to an extreme close up of an exposed beating heart being operated on. It's extremely graphic and disturbing. Most of all, it's effective. I felt queasy and uncomfortable watching this scene - a sensation I would feel over and over again during the course of the film.As mentioned earlier the film stars Nicole Kidman (Anna Murphy) and Colin Ferrell (Steven Murphy) who play parents to Raffey Cassidy (Kim Murphy) and Sunny Suljic (Bob Murphy). Steven is a heart surgeon who has an unlikely friend in an awkward teenager named Martin, played by Barry Keoghan (Dunkirk). It's not immediately apparent the nature of the friendship, but it's obviously suspicious. Martin appears to be troubled with possible mental issues. But Steven acts as a sort of father figure by giving him gifts, treating him out to lunch, making time to talk on the phone, and even inviting him to his home for dinner with his family. The pieces come together later when we learn that Steven performed heart surgery (opening scene) on Martin's father while intoxicated leaving his father dead. So, these apparent ""acts of kindness"" are in fact a selfish attempt clean his hands of guilt and take accountability for his negligence.Things begin to unravel in the second act when Steven's son suddenly falls ill. He's taken to the hospital and run through a battery of tests - all of which come up inconclusive. When Martin confronts Steve and says that he's ""really sorry about Bob."" Steven responds with, ""It's nothing serious"". Then Martin chillingly replies back, ""No, it is,"" as if he's the one responsible for what's happening. It seems unthinkable, yet somehow he is. Is he a demon? Is he a God? Martin then explains that there's a blood cost that Steven must pay for killing his father. One life for another. He has to kill either his wife or one of his two children. If not, one by one, each family member will become paralyzed from the waist down, eventually refuse to eat, bleed from the eyes, then die. The scene is a punch to the gut.To say this movie is dark is an understatement. The subject matter is every parent's nightmare - to kill their own flesh and blood. Needless to say, things don't end well. This is a movie full of damaged individuals. There are no heroes in this movie, only villains. The Killing of a Sacred Deer will surely leave a bad taste in your mouth. Worst still, it'll linger in your mind days after watching it. But that acting! Ugh! I'll stick with my theory that it was an intentional artistic choice.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

545,spicymjp,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,7,20 April 2020,"The Killing of a Sacred DeerThe Killing of a Sacred Deer is a profound , intentionally disturbing , borderline satirical, insightful film of an upper-class family and a god-like figure psychopathic kid.Steven, (Colin Farrell) a heart surgeon, plays a convincing cynical role, and his mannerisms display a manipulative, sadistic, repressed personality. His family consists of a wife and two kids that seem to be manipulated and mentally-disciplined to abide / conform to his personal standards. I got the sense that Steven will stop at nothing to control his families decisions / literal personalities. From the beginning, Bob subconsciously irks Steven by alluring to his free-will like personality, long hair and genuine conversation. He claims he wants to be an ophthalmologist (just like his mom), whereas Steven is a cardiologist. Anna (Nicole Kidman) plays the wife and is equally convincing as a scarred mother with an unnerving personality. And ofc, the daughter, much like Anna, is trained to abide, but is equally disturbing / obnoxious as the father. In a sense, the Murphy family is a daunting, questionable pack because of its puppeteer, Martin.Martin is the victim of a immoral act caused by the allegorical hands of Steven. The backstory of the film suggests that Steven operated intoxicated on Martin's father, leading to his death. He can't come to terms with his guilt / blame, so he attempts to be a farther-like figure to Martin. Instead, Martin poisons Steven's family and says he needs to kill one of them to save the others. Steven is obviously a cowardice, manipulative mess so being faced with this eerie proposition weighs in on him and he starts to subtilely lose it. All of Martin's actions weren't moral, (much like the act of Steven's operation) but followed the whole ""eye-for-an-eye"" principle.I loved the performances and the technical aspects. I thought the camerawork was authentic and eerie, as well as panning in on the unsettling characters. Lanthimos' style was ingenious and thought-provoking. The comedic elements complimented the gory, disturbing elements well.My few discrepancies were regarding the script. It was a little too over-the-top for me personally, and the message felt clear from the first hour. In addition, the scene with Martin's mom felt unnecessary, even when her words / actions felt similar to the manipulative, crazed behavior of Steven, Kim and Martin. Kidman's performance was excellent, but her sudden twist to a broken mom then suddenly back to an immoral, frightened mom was a bit rushed. I can infer that she's just terrified of Steven / Martin and the consequences, but it all combined to feel too huddled.To me, The Killing of a Sacred Deer was a well created, thought-provoking film about vengeance, morality, and manipulation. Steven's cunning personality mixed with his self-centered approach and materialistic viewpoints were complimented with Martin's raw disgust and hatred against him. I got an unsettling feeling by the ending, which is what the film might've been going for.7/10",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

551,Miss-Meggo,Ok.,6,19 March 2018,"An ok film with dialogue that is someone stilted and overly structured--similar to that of the Lobster but less compelling this time. Most of the actors did an adequate job and the story line was interesting though somehow never felt as dark as it really could or wanted to. Barry Keoghan however shines in a way that no one else comes close to. He is the only person who seems to really embody the character that he's playing, committing down to the micro-espressions which gives him an authenticity, intrigue, and completeness that none of the other characters come close to. For a film about a husband believing he may be watching his family die around him, the film rarely goes into the dark depths that that would involve--something that surprised me from Lanthimos. The film ultimately felt like it wasn't fully fleshed out into the emotional depths that I was hoping from it. Keep an eye out for Keoghan in the future though.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

It unfolded to a intriguing story where the unnatural came through more and more. Towards the end, to me personally, it became very laughable and I indeed laughed out loud at some of the scenes that unfortunately dragged the hole movie in retrospective down.I did not understand why you have actors like Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell when they don't even act. They just said the lines that often seemed to be written by some artificial intelligence where you just set up two computers and let them say sentences to each other and write down whatever comes up. No human beings talk like that.The violence was brief but heavy and intense with one being just plain funny without the intention of being so.I appreciated the idea and although you were left pretty much alone with how the things that happened in this world made sense, the movie stayed in the same subtle yet dark undertone which made it at least consistent.I wish I could say more positive things but I was left puzzled at the end.

Sacrifice for a sacrifice, eye for an eye, all the other details are never given and there's this undercurrent of weird sexual abuse and fantasy throughout the whole movie. BIG let down. If you like movies with no resolution, plot holes and zero explanations, you might find a sliver of enjoyment from this movie, otherwise pass.

Few films have stuck with me the way this one has- I definitely consider it a horror and will recommend it to anyone who wants an out-of-the-box thriller that makes you question your values/beliefs",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
565,JIMm_wordplay,Wickedly Awesome,9,5 May 2019,"To everyone who has seen a Yorgos Lanthimos film, it's not such a surprise that the characters and situations he creates can only exist at an alternate universe for they exhibit something unusual. Nevertheless, it isn't any less human. What makes Lanthimos' films interesting and distinct was its awkward frankness when saying something about human nature. It's straight in the face no matter how silly and comedic it could get. Besides, that's part of the charm. It registers on the audience's mind, leaving them thinking.His latest film, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is no different. It is a surrealist film that dwell on mystery, heightening the impact of the impending doom set for its characters. Offering suspenseful anticipation, black comedy and a trip to the dark side of human nature, it is yet another triumph for Lanthimos who exhibit a distinct flair in filmmaking.Mirroring a Greek mythology, the film centers on a family undergoing a crisis when one family member was held accountable for another person's demise. This leaves them to do something unthinkable, or else a bigger price should be paid. As the movie progresses, things only get worse, creepier. Only reminding its characters how helpless their situation is. The tension keeps on piling up.With a tightened scope, Lanthimos wisely executes the film by not fully revealing everything about its characters. Instead, its viewers were only given clues through their decisions, actions and reactions. The same goes for its plot, which did not go into detail as to what, why and how. What makes things scary are the portions that we do not know about. For this film, such principle really worked.Colin Farrell, who previously worked with Lanthimos' previous film ""The Lobster,"" was cast as the film's lead cardiac surgeon Steven Murphy. In here, he once again delivered a noteworthy performance. Farrell seems to have an idea of what kind of character Lanthimos envisions for the film, and his performance astonishes.Other commendable players on the film were Nicole Kidman and Barry Keoghan. Kidman, as usual, makes the most of her character despite its limitations. As for Keoghan, he is quite the scene-stealer. His role is showy enough to capture attention. Portraying a weird character, he just really goes for it.Aside from the thrills that the film showcase, it is also important to mention that it runs with dark humor. The script, written by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou (who won the Best Screenplay award at this year's Cannes Film Festival) are responsible for such moments. Even so, it does not affect the tone of the film. In fact, it only adds up to the strangeness the film is aiming for. The dialogues are repetitive, awkward and clever enough to trigger one's funny bone. It has a potential to be hilarious, but it did not go all the way by employing some deadpan moments. It is a way to balance its blend of nihilism and humor, which did not go beyond the point of offense.For sure, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is no ordinary entertainment. But it is not without a trajectory. It has themes of revenge and playing-God teaching us how our past can haunt us and that we should be responsible for our own actions. Its unconventional way of presenting its world and characters aim to pinpoint a truth about human nature. It may pose a challenge to some but by taking such bold risks, it encourages the viewers to expand their cinematic horizons. That there are others methods of telling a story or imparting a message aside from literal spoon-feeding. We have our others senses we can rely on as well. That what makes it special and worth-seeing. It pictures the out of ordinary to emphasize the mundane we sometimes fail to acknowledge.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
566,Koala_99,Absolutely artistic and brilliant,9,17 November 2017,"The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a psychological horror film directed, produced and written by Greek director and filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos, the same filmmaker who directed The Lobster. This film is absolutely brilliant and it deserves to be add in the list of the best films of 2017, alongside with Dunkirk, Blade Runner 2049, It Comes at Night, Okja, etc. During the cinema screening, I realised that lot of people walked out of the movie theater and I asked myself: ''Why? The movie isn't bad. Give this film a time and chance to explain itself.''. Other people were commenting that it was great, but it was confusing and also disturbing, because of many brutal and violent scenes containing blood, wounds, organs and general fear of hospitals. I understand that this film isn't for everybody and that is really complicated at first, but if you watch the second time, you'll start to understand the whole point of the film. Here are some of the reasons why this film is amazing.It has interesting plot and story. It has everything what the psychological horror genre needs to have: a constant growing tension, interesting story that actually makes sense, a great terrifying, horrific, brutal and violent scenes that are related to the storytelling (that scene at the end in a living room, with ribbon covering eyes and a hunting rifle), the philosophy and moral behind the film, etc. The film has symbolism, metaphor and reference with the Greek mythology and some of the Greek tragedies.Acting, character development and dialogue between the characters were incredible. Nicole Kidman, Colin Farrell and rest of the cast did a fantastic job, but the actor who stole the most of the scenes and who was outstanding, was Barry Keoghan's role and character. Like in The Lobster, characters are related to absurdism. All of them are unemotional, artificial, cold-blooded, monotone and strange, but with a dose of realism. Normally, in those situations, characters would panic, constantly cry and scream, but they don't, which is why, at the end of the film, you'll get this terrifying and shocking feeling.Editing, pacing and lightning are perfect. The whole film has insane cinematography, beautiful, static, slow-moving and dynamic one-point perspective camera shots and angles, similar to Kubrick's directing film style and effect. Speaking of Kubrick, it also contains beautiful, tense and magnificent musical background and score, with classical music, famous symphonies and violin sounds and music.But the film has some mistakes. Sometimes it goes really slow and sometimes the music and violin sounds can be so loud, which can be annoying.Despite of those few mistakes, this film is one of the reasons and proofs why we love and enjoy the art of cinema and filmmaking. Yorgos Lanthimos needs to be add to the list alongside with other legendary directors and filmmakers. Absolutely artistic, well done, brilliant, original and creative.9/10",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

I give it 4 stars only because I was hoping to find out the secret of how so that kept me in it but the secret never came. I read many explanations of the film's ending and meaning and it goes from greek mythology stories to lets just anger the audience with a meaningless meaning and bad acting. So nobody really knows what this film is, but we do know what it should of been, never made. Some pretend to know what this film is, but they are lying. Was he Damien? Was he a hypnotist? Was the family all severely mental ill? The weirdness and blackness of each character made me feel like I was Rosemary in Rosemary's Baby. Nothing normal was happening, characters didn't react as they should. It felt alien. Total power was given to a character that had nothing powerful to give. This is just bad filmmaking.

Mash Potatoes anyone?,7,26 November 2017,"From the opening shot of open heart surgery being performed with Schubert's Stabat Mater in the background we are pulled into a surreal and dark world inhabited by strange characters. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is the latest film by Yorgos Lanthimos whose previous work was the excellent and well received The Lobster. There are similarities between the two films, such as the deadpan delivery of dialogue and elements of dark comedy, a common thread in Lanthimos work, but The Killing of a Sacred Deer is not The Lobster.The film takes us into the life of renowned heart surgeon Steven Murphy played by Colin Farrell and his relationship with his wife Anna (Nicole Kidman), son Bob (Sunny Suljic), daughter Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and teenager Martin played by Barry Keoghan. It is the relationship between Steven and Martin that leads Steven (a man of science) into a world of chaos and dilemmas. The story is loosely based on the Greek tragedy of Iphigenia, which involves a death of a sacred deer, though the deer is more metaphorical here. The film excels in its casting with Farrell's restrained anger and agony complimenting Kidman's piercing, collective matriarch, but it is worth the ticket price alone to see Keoghan's performance of Martin. He is unsettling, ruthless, vulnerable and mesmerising to watch, the scenes in the basement showcasing his talent.The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a strange film, it cannot be classed as a black comedy, or a art house film nor a horror, there are scenes reminiscent of Kubrick with its long shots and chilling music, but it also contains Lanthimos deadpan delivery, The film leaves you with a dilemma, do you care enough of the characters to want to watch the film? yes and no, but do you want to see what happens in the end? Yes, yes you do.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Not a single character shows any facial expression during the entire run time of the film. The delivery of lines that are supposed to be serious is stilted and awkward, like the characters are toddlers, struggling to speak English for the first time in their lives.The only thing worse than said acting was the writing, I won't 'spoil' the end for you but let's just say, it takes whatever hope you had of the movie ending with any kind of dignity and waffle stomps that sh*t down the shower drain. The characters make dumb, nonsensical decisions at all parts of the movie and are seemingly impervious to common sense.

It is intentionally slow, acting is intentionally wooden (void of any emotion) and intentionally weird.Now, I don't mind weird movies, but this is the completely traditional artsy weird-for-the-sake of weird. It doesn't aid the plot, and most of the weirdness could've been removed and the plot would not be changed in any meaningful way.Speaking of which, the plot is completely transparent from the start, and full of glaring holes, which aren't even attempted to be explained or excused. It is trivial to see where it is going, removing any hint of mystery from the movie itself.Every character acts irrationally and without emotion, leaving me not caring about or connecting with any character in the movie.The only mystery here is how it can achieve its high rating and how the director keeps getting funded.The only positive I have to say is that it is slightly less artsy and dull than The Lobster.I suppose if you either consider yourself smarter than the peons who don't understand movies like this or you're a flagellant, this is the movie for you.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

594,folon2008-100-319305,Lanthimos walking on the slippery paths of ancient tragedy and Hollywood,4,27 February 2018,"Having watched the Dogtooth and Lobster, I realize to my disappointment that Lanthimos's choices on plots and their transfers on screen follow a downward spiral. It is a great waste of cinematographic and acting talent to spread misery and pain without an attempt to awaken people's minds towards noble thinking and way out of the purpose of the notorious but didactic nature of good old ancient greek tragedies. And in this case, borrowing and twisting the ancient myth regarding the original plot and purpose, once more proves to be a very dangerous undertaking that leads knowledgeable audience to inevitable comparisons almost surely to the loss of the borrower and people ignorant of the context in front of an uninterpreted mess (as I often hilariously found out by reading previous reviews of the film).Stretching situations to the utmost ends may be a strong demonstrative tool for expressing views on bad reality but somehow, this has to drill down to the causes according to the creators' view. I was able to follow the line on Dogtooth and Lobster, easier in the first case, harder in the second but here, I really can not figure out an original and innovative view on causes. If that was not the purpose of the film, then it is just a plain useless, flat and twisted representation of the old myth. I recommend you to choose instead, films of Lars von Trier, even the Antichrist. In those films you can also delve into despair but at least with far more poetic ways.Being myself an existentialist and often cynical on my views on humanity and people's behavior on situations beyond their abilities, I personally prefer Tarkovsky's God-seeking world or even Tsafoulias's recent work Eteros Ego (The other me) with its struggling characters and their attitudes as opposed to the ever film-by-film evolving deadlocked and suffocating Lanthimos's micro-cosmoses that teach us (with often needlessly graphic enstantanees) less and less.A piece's of art impression is about provoking minds to think forward.

603,Zachary_White,A hilarious and disturbing film that is definitely not for everyone.,8,19 February 2018,"Whew boy. This one is a bit of a doozy. Let me start by saying that I completely understand why so many people have been turned off by this film. In fact, 2017 has been a good year to analyze how much improper marketing can affect the public's perception of a particular movie (e.g. ""It Comes at Night"" and ""mother!"" misleadingly being sold as horrors). This film's trailer is very misleading with how it portrays this movie so don't go into it thinking that it's going to be a psychological horror.With all that out of the way, I think this movie is fantastic. It's not as funny as this director's previous work, ""The Lobster,"" but what it lacks in some humor it makes up for with how disturbing and creepy it is. This is one of the only movies that has me laughing like a lunatic one minute and then feeling sick to my stomach the next (seriously, there is some really, really dark stuff in this movie so it's not for those with a weaker constitution).Depending on who you are, you will either love or hate it. While that statement obviously holds true for a lot of movies, I think it's relevant to this one in particular. It's not scary enough to be a horror film and it's not quite funny enough to stand as a comedy, so it rides a fine line between tragedy and comedy depending on who you are. To me, it leans more towards comedy but that may just be because the director and I share a similarly dark sense of humor. Anyways, if you're open-minded and you don't mind weird experiences that you're unlikely to ever forget, then I highly recommend this film.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Most of the negative reviews are complaining about obtuseness and the lack of explanation given in the film. Just because those people don't understand a movie. it makes them feel stupid which in turn leads to their negative opinions. 
To be honest, I too am not quite sure what this film is trying to say but that is exactly the beauty of it. It respects me as a serious audience member by acknowledging my intelligence and challenging my mind to its utmost extremes. 
It's a film that you should definitely check out even if you anticipate to be in some way disappointed. The reason for that is that The Killing of a Sacred Deer is going to mess with your head, it is going to stay with you and it is going to ducate you by eliciting a response.

If he dies, then it will be at the hospital... at least they won't all go to prison for killing a child ( the movie doesn't reach that point).. thinking of the mother was strange for me, because as a mother, i would have offered myself to be killed to save my child...and last thing; why this drama at the end, i mean if they decided to kill one, parents pull paper with name and kill the child or wife silently while they are asleep...instead of causing PTSD or more for the ones who stayed alive.

638,jose_apou,Unsettling and interesting despite flaws.,7,24 October 2017,"""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) is a tense psychological thriller directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. Dr. Stephen Murphy (Colin Farrell) finds himself in an unsettling situation when an old patient of his, Martin (Barry Keoghan), intrudes into his life and tinges his seemingly idyllic family: his wife Anna (Nicole Kidman) and children Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and Bob (Sunny Suljic). The story, written by Yorgos Lanthimos and Efthimis Filippou, builds up tension with a slow pace at first. The dialog felt edgy, sometimes preposterous and sometimes comical (Especially one scene with Steven ranting in the kitchen) but it served to fill the air with anxiety and unease. It's directness and pace felt somewhat surreal. As information is cautiously revealed I felt captivated and uncomfortable (A long scene that occurred inside a car comes to mind). The characters take an active role in the story, with consequential decisions (Dr. Murphy's in particular) However the ultimate choice, which came with the last act, seems to lack consequence and it's aftermath felt weak. Moreover certain aspects of the plot seem to be left without explanation, undermining the story (Specially regarding Martin). Some characters also felt underdeveloped, regardless of their impact on the plot. Long intimate close-ups place you inside the characters minds and facilitate the ability to empathize. One shot, involving Anna and bob walking down the stairs was remarkable, as was the film's cinematography. Bleak, gray tones and an isolated atmosphere provoke a feeling of claustrophobia and lead you to think that there is no escape for our protagonist. The score and sound effects, involving long slowly built screeches, kept me uncomfortable and accentuated certain scenes involving two characters in particular: Steven and Martin. Barry Keoghan as Martin really made me feel like there was something not quite right with him at first, to fully suspecting a clinical mental disorder. Colin Farrell as Steven felt in command of his character as a confident successful man who is humiliated and brought low. Nicole Kidman as Anna felt like how any desperate parent would do believably reacts to the information that is unveiled to her. The tense dialog, brilliant cinematography, unsettling score and interesting acting carry this movie and kept me captivated despite it's seemingly slow pace and sometimes weak plot. This movie stands superior to most thrillers and is definitely worth a watch.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
639,kdziolak-33574,Failed myth adaptation,4,20 October 2017,"Myths were created to help human build and understand the model of surrounding world. 'The Killing of Sacred Deer' is too artistic to bother. It builds a dent in reality in which a lower deity (surgeon) accidentally kills father of a greater one. While making people believe that the characters are somewhat real, it combines the mythical sacrifice of Iphigenia with cliché of train dilemma (kill 3 people by inaction or pull a lever and decide who dies). Unfortunately the setting is so artificial that the movie completely fails to deliver a point and decides to abort any attempts of explanation leaving viewers in a limbo. It's gripping, but completely dry upon closer examination. 'The Saw' was more believable than TKoSD. Viewers can admire a glimpse of naked Nicole Kidman for this suffering though!Acting: 7 Plot: 2 Production: 7",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

It's the kind of movie you would see by yourself on a silent night, concentrating on the superb photography and atmosphere created by the distressing music.
Nonetheless, do not expect an horror which would make you jump from the chair.
It is sad to notice that The Killing... has become a target for haters who have not appreciated it. I personally find sad seeing so many ""reviews"" of just a couple of lines, full of swearing and undeserved, exaggerated low scores.

643,gamedogluke,A Mediocre Greek Tragedy,6,11 November 2017,"Yorgos Lanthimos is one of those directors' people either love or hate, with most of his films being ever so subjective. They're always very out there and sometimes very hard to follow or take seriously because of how bizarre they are. However, if there is one thing Lanthimos knows how to do, it's how to make the audience feel tense and uncomfortable during the entire duration of his films. The Killing Of a Sacred Deer is no exception. Lanthimos did a great job of making me feel uneasy from the very first opening shot, and making that feeling last for the full 121 minutes.However, another trait he's known for is his strange characters, and I mean really messed up. It's as if his goal was to make all the characters in the film as unrelatable as possible. This removed any kind of emotional connection I could have had with the characters, which of course ruined a couple of scenes in the film for me. The dialogue though, irritated me during the whole film. It's as if the writers don't understand how people communicate and interact with one another, almost as if the writing team have all got autistic tendencies. Like adults having conversations at dinner parties bringing up their daughters menstrual cycles and fully grown men showing teenagers their armpit hair are just two of many weird exchanges the characters make during the film. All of this however does add to the odd vibe that the director is clearly going for which is a success on his part.However in films (especially in thrillers), I want to be able to connect with the characters, to create a greater impact when something tragic happens to them. I don't want to be shaking my head at the dialogue and choices the characters make. But with the scrip that's all I seemed to be doing. I feel that if this film had the same plot and cinematography but changed its script, I would consider it an 8/10 but the script (for me anyway) holds it back from achieving that by a couple of marks.IN SUMMARY: If you're a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos's other works such as Dogtooth and The Lobster, you'll definitely find loads of enjoyment from this and perhaps even consider it one of the films of the year. For people who have never watched a film of his before and feel curious enough to see it, approach it with caution as it is not your average film and features a lot of artistic choices which will seem strange to people who have no idea who Lanthimos is. Lastly if you don't like any of Lanthimos's other works, I'm afraid this one is not going to win you over.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

I wish I could rate this film as less than 0. -10000000 would be a good start.
It is so, so bad, there are no words for how terrible it is. 
I love Collin and Nicole, they are two of my favourite actors, but there should be some penalty for hateful acts like participating in this assault on our entertainment platforms. 
There will always be people who call complete garbage ""art"", claiming that it is interpretative, that it has something to do with religion, or myth, or that it's deep and meaningful in such a way that only a true intellect can unwravel the message hidden beneath all that symbolism, when in fact, it is just garbage, written by a talentless narcissist who has built a career off the back of the hype sent into the world by the type of morons outlined above. And that is all this film is. Pure garbage.
Say all you like that it relays Greek myth, it doesn't. It's purposely non-sensical, rediculous and meaningless, drawing no parellels to real life, no true-to-life dialogue, never coming close at any point to a storyline any normal person would enjoy watching.
Interesting that the largest portion of the movie focuses on deciding who will die, as for the first 40 minutes of this film in particular, in which all characters have monotone, senseless dialogue, ranging from ""my daughter's fine, she started menstruating"" to ""do you have arm pit hair, can I see it?"" and nothing in terms of a storyline happens at all, you really wish you were the one who could just die and be put out your misery.
Please let me spare you 2 hours of your life and the reverberating question that will remain unanswered; ""what the hell am I watching?"" Collin Farrell is a surgeon. The film begins with Collin doing his thing in hospital, showing odd dialogues with hospital colleagues, all in monotone, with more than an edge of weirdness, such as ""my daughter started menstruating"".
Collin Farrel is shown meeting the young lad, and their relationship seems odd, him giving the boy gifts, the boy also speaking in monotone with completely odd dialogue. 
Collin Farrell's wife is Nicole kidman. She and their two children also speak in monotone, with purposely flat, emotionless responses and odd dialogue. Nicole occasionally lays on the bed naked in the position of a corpse. 
Collin goes to the house of the lad he has befriended for dinner. His mother is Alicia Silverstone. She starts licking and kissing his hands. It becomes clear the lad wants him to ditch Nicole and get with his mother.
After some hand licking, Collin leaves and tries to cut contact with the lad.
Collin's youngest child, his son, claims he can no longer feel is legs and is hospitalised. Tests are done, but seemingly there is no cause.
The lad Collin was friends with admits he is responsible (it isn't explained how, he must just have magical powers, huh?) and that this is justice because some years ago his father died on Collin's operating table as he'd been drinking. Now, unless he kills one of his own family to make up for it, one by one they will become paralysed, stop eating, their eyes will bleed, then they will die.
They all become aware that the boy is the one responsible, yet the daughter still talks about moving in with him, and noone demands to know how he is doing it to them. It is just accepted as is. 
Collin beats him up at one point, but Nicole lets him go. Noone thinks of threatening him using his own mother as ambition, or telling the authorities, or anything else.
Instead, they decide the most logical solution to the problem, is to do as the boy says and that Collin does, indeed, need to kill one of them.
The daughter and son start competing for their dads affection (whilst dragging their paralysed legs behind them) in the hopes that he decides to kill the other sibling and spares them.
There is one particularly bad scene when the boy says he is going to water the flowers outside, whilst crawling on the floor, dragging his legs.
In the end Collin blindfolds them all, including himself, and shoots at random. He (eventually) kills his son.
The daughter gets better. They all go out for a nice family meal at the diner. (There is no mention to prison time for killing the son, presumably they just disposed of him and noone ever asked where he was again.)
The lad responsible for it all walks into the diner while they are eating.
They get up and leave and he watches them go.
The End.
Yes, it really is as s**t as it sounds.
The only film I have ever seen as bad as this is Mother! When I watched that I never thought I'd see a film as terrible again.

This is the kind of film that seems so different from other films of its genre and time that it feels like the audience (a dignified cinephile one, of course) can benefit from an entire different experience.
The way the film deals with death is in fact a comical, unrealistic way which fortunately does not strike a blow on the narrative of suspense around the protagonists' fates.
Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell were sublime in their performances, which cannot be said for the actor who played the antagonist in the story, who appeared shaky and too docile to be considered a real threat. The weak spots in the film - few as they are - are the jumping of conclusions that the audience needs to engage in in order to follow the events unfolding. The suspense, therefore, didn't hit all the areas it needed to in my mind to keep me drawn to the film throughout my experience.

663,jjzee,Quite Psych Thriller And Very Thought Provoking,9,27 January 2021,"This will have you saying ""What is this?"" either becuase the dialog is sometimes ridiculusly uncomfortable ot becuase of the pure lack of traditional (over-done and basic) emotion from the charcters. Particualry the mom (Nicole Kidman), we would be shown sort of long silent scenes of their facial expression as they pieced together what was really going on. It seemed to be a common theme of ""Hmm...this is happening but I dont really know what to do next."" It was a breath of fresh air mainly becuase we didnt have to dit through the torture of the MCs realizing theres something serious -> complaining. That was certainly part of the theme that justice is not always fair, becuase there was nothing they could do to stop it, it wasnt worth wasting time. It really urks me when people try to look at it from a literal piont of view (ex. how he technically piosoned them)- this is perhaps the most metophorical movie ive ever seen. With random seemingly meaningless tid-bits like the chest hair and multiple meantions of the daughters menstral cycle, it revealed the mundanes of upper-middle class everyday life as well as hinting to the eventual end to to the childrens sprouting lives. Even the boring demeanor of them in the hosptial beds emphisized how they didnt REALLY care about anything (also the moms corpse position in bed), often disagreeing about inconvioeances such as the mp3 player. Towards the end. each character slowly became more desperate while still maintianing their facads. Which, is in contrast to Martins blatant honesty and willingness to confront his enemies. (as well as his mom, who was not afraid to show affection). There is one scene where the mom says, ""If its his mistake why should his family have to pay for it?"". While it is a good question, it alludes to the idea that he didnt get to choose if a member of his family died, nor did his dad do anything. While this punishment is clearly extreme, it comments on how people do things all the time that deserve repercushins and dont get them (+ vice versa). Everythings fine until it isnt. No amount of material goods (i.e. the watch) will make up for another wrong.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

679,CineFreakk,Plot holes aplenty,1,1 February 2018,"Wanting to base a movie on a Greek tragedy is commendable but the main story must contain some credible plot elements. The whole premise of this movie revolves around the far-fetched idea that a teen-aged psychopath can somehow find this incredibly mysterious way to sicken a whole family with an undetectable ailment that will thwart even the most advanced medical team's attempt to find the cause. How the family is rendered sick and how, at the end, it is cured is not even remotely hinted at. Finally, when the father decides to do as instructed by the psychopath, our supposedly intelligent medical doctor opts to go about it in the most stupid way one could imagine. Our idiot doctor decides to blindfold himself while spinning his body and spraying bullets around a room where he has tied his family members, hoping to eventually fire an impossibly lucky lethal shot. In reality, such an approach would most likely to lead to hundreds of bullets sprayed around the room whilst maiming all the family members before eventually running out of bullets without killing anyone.
I could go on about how this murder is not uncovered by the authorities or many other gaping plot holes but I think that you get the gist... this is one of the most idiotic film I have ever seen. The concept is interesting as is the cinematography. Unfortunately, because of the laziness of the film writer who could not be bothered to come up with a credible plot, this whole exercise only leads to head-shaking and wondering how two great actors could not see how ludicrous the script was.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

People behaving in artificial ways, having ridiculous unreal conversations and with no understandable motivation to their actions....except presumably to get the story to where the director wanted it to go.I would not focus my criticism on the actors but primarily on the director (or maybe also writer). Presumably the actors were told to deliver the lines in the silly manner, which soon seems like a tiresome parody, but just what the director thought the film would be to anyone but himself is a mystery to me.Basically, it seemed to me to be a self-indulgence...so I suppose I would hope that the director enjoyed it...cos very few others will.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

698,alviahmed05,Classic Psychological Horror,8,20 December 2017,"I only watched this movie because it was labeled as a horror movie, a genre I'm very much fond of and also because it cast the A-listers like Kidman and Farrell. Good cast and very proficient, quality acting from them. Barry Keoghan (the boy who portrayed Martin) was the most impressive in my opinion. He was perfectly suited for the character. His nonchalant, unflappable expressions played a vital role to depict his character as a diabolical one. Kidman played her part albeit her character was peripheral at times, but Farrell put in a classy performance himself.I noticed a tension from the very opening scene. Tension between the characters. There was always a suspense. And it always felt like something sinister is gonna happen. That's where the background music comes in. It was so eerie and creepy at times that, just by the sound of it, it felt very gruesome and distressing. And I have to say that Farrell's beard played a big part in the build up.If you're a fan of psychological thrillers or horrors, you'll find it very compelling. Your eyes will be glued to the screen until you've seen the end game. And I got to tell you, I didn't expect the way it culminated to the finale.
 
In my opinion ""The Killing of Sacred Deer"" is the third best movie of its kind this year right after ""Get Out"" and ""Split"". And it's not very easy to pull of a movie of this kind with a story-line so macabre and nightmarish. Most definitely going to recommend this to psychological-movie lovers.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

It's a straightforward revenge tale that questions your personal ethics and ideas of what is justice. The cinematography is beautiful with wide frames and claustrophobic corridors, the dialogue is very typical Lanthimos style of cold and awkward (to emphasize the clinical nature of the characters) coupled humor and sarcasm. 
The acting is effortless and stays true to the nature of all the Lanthimos films - so I am unsure why anyone would watch this without doing their research first. No point in slating or calling the film pretentious unless you understand the style of all these films, and go in knowing it will most probably be quite strange and make you think - a lot.

But the risky choice to have the cast remove practically all emotion from their performance sucks the life out of the work. It is so disgustingly vulgar I would have walked out had I seen it in theaters. The choice of style also demands that the characters behave irrationally. Which some will likely have a problem with. But at the heart of the films issue is a total lack of empathy. A person can't be expected to feel for a character who has no emotion. The story takes place in a land of soulless robots and is void of substance. However, I would like to see more from this director.

704,lacicivan,Everyone who gave 1/10 must be banned for life,7,13 December 2017,"A man who plays God for a living meets a boy who chooses to play Devil in Yorgos Lanthimos' chilling and breathtaking ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer."" Once again, as he did with ""The Lobster,"" Lanthimos is working in a deeply metaphorical register, using an impossible situation to illuminate relatable human fears. The result is a mesmerizing thriller, a movie that asks questions with no good answers and traps us within its terrifying and bizarre situation with little hope for a happy ending. With uniformly great performances throughout the cast and Lanthimos' stunning eye for detail and composition, this is one of the most unforgettable films of the year.Colin Farrell, reuniting with Lanthimos and a bit bushier and grayer than before, plays Dr. Steven Murphy, a noted and respected surgeon. Externally, he would seem to have it all. He's powerful and successful with a gorgeous wife named Anna (Nicole Kidman), who happens to be an ophthalmologist. They have two children-15-year-old Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and younger Bob (Sunny Suljic). Steven has befriended a 16-year-old named Martin (Barry Keoghan of ""Dunkirk""), the son of a man who died on his operating table a few years ago. Exactly what happened in that room, and how and why Steven has tried to stay close with Martin is unclear at the beginning of the film. Lanthimos often keeps histories and motivations vague, allowing us to fill in the blanks as the film progresses.From the beginning, something seems vaguely off with the relationship between Steven and Martin. The doctor introduces him as a friend of his daughter's, but he's not. And he buys the kid presents, even inviting him over for dinner. Martin becomes friends with Steven's kids, and a romantic interest for Kim, but there's a dark undercurrent here from frame one. Something's just not quite right in the Murphy household, and it's not only that the good doctor likes his wife to pretend to be under general anesthesia when he has sex with her. The Murphys seem to be just a little off, and Martin more than a little.Then Bob can't get out of bed. His legs don't work. Not long after, he stops eating. Martin tells Steven what's going on. It's justice. Steven took his father, and now a member of his family must die. The scales must be balanced. Steven can choose to kill one of his family members and end the nightmare, but they will continue to lose the use of their limbs, refuse to eat, and eventually bleed from the eyes if he does not make a decision. Steven, being a man of science, turns to medicine to explain what's happening to his family, refusing to believe that it's some sort of cosmic karma coming to get him. Thematically, Lanthimos is playing with the differences between science and the supernatural. Steven plays God. He saves lives and he makes mistakes that take lives. And he sees the world in that kind of black and white. Martin breaks down his perfectly controlled worldview, and demands something rarely asked of the gods, personal sacrifice.Working with his regular cinematographer Thimios Bakatakis again, and a multi-talented team of designers, Lanthimos delivers one of the most visually striking films of the year, a movie that recalls prime Polanski in its claustrophobic tension but more distinctly feels like an entirely new voice in horror. ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" takes place in a world of clean lines and kitchens as antiseptic as operating rooms. It's this world of suburban perfection that Martin, and Lanthimos, deconstructs with a waking nightmare. There's something about the cool, detached world of ""Sacred Deer"" that makes it all the more terrifying. Of course, fallible man must be punished in a world this perfectly refined and lacking in common humanity. It almost feels like Martin gives Steven an out early in the film, inviting him to his more ""everyday"" world in which they watch ""Groundhog Day"" (tellingly, another movie about a man who must learn a lesson to stop a physically impossible situation) and his mother (Alicia Silverstone) demands he try her tart. But the God won't deign to play with the mortals, and so he must be hurled from his throne.And here's where we get to the title. Late in the film, we learn that one of the characters wrote an A+ essay on Iphigenia, a Greek myth that centers on the killing of a sacred deer by Greek leader Agamemnon. Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, punished Agamemnon, and the only way to remove the punishment is for the leader to sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia. Is the modern surgeon the equivalent of Agamemnon? Is the child who lost his father before he could talk about puberty with him Artemis? Lanthimos never draws straight lines, but the parallel is illuminating. He makes films designed to start conversations, to leave viewers startled and shaken. And he's smart enough to use Greek myths, pitch black humor, and chilling horror in equal amounts.It helps that he's clearly at a point in his career where the right actors want to work with him. It feels like we're finally at a time when we can recognize that Colin Farrell has been pretty great for a long time, choosing to work with challenging directors who bring out different edges of his ability even this late into his career. He's phenomenal here, finding the shades of a man whose greatest sin may be his refusal to admit he's only human. In the end, that may be the message of ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer""-when you play God, you must deal with the consequences. The Lanthimos-Farrell dynamic is one of those relationships in which the creator and actor are so clearly on the same page that it's invigorating.That's a good word for ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer."" It's a film that challenges viewers in such fascinating ways and feels so refined in its filmmaking that it's invigorating to watch. It's a rare movie indeed that can be this alternately terrifying, hysterical, strange, and heartbreaking, often in the same scene. Like the Greek myth that inspired the film, it feels powerful enough to be timeless.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

708,elizabethpolishan,I had to watch Moana afterwards,7,11 June 2018,"This movie doesn't always make rational sense, and parts of it disgusted me. But I wouldn't discredit the film as ""disgusting"" or ""senseless"". It's worth the watch.At the very least, it triggers a powerful emotional experience. (I literally had to watch Moana afterwards, no joke, to get the final few scenes out of my head; is that a strength or weakness, you tell me). Say what you will - it's a powerful film. I've never seen a movie quite like it. Something about it is deeply universal, weirdly generic (it's just this suburban family who has to walk the dog and water the plants, just like you) but something about it is so particular, so specific, so strange (see: everything else). This is a hard combination to hit on, and one that I think gives the movie its special power.The dialogue itself is also beautiful - poetic, specific, sometimes funny. It's quotable.It's worth the watch, but prepare yourself. I can't get it out of my head.**SPOILERS AND A HALF-BAKED QUASI-LITERARY RANT TO FOLLOW**MORAL AMBIGUITY: The dad has to pay for what he did. What version of the truth are we getting? We have the dad's story and the anestologist's story. No one wants to take responsibility for the death of the father - they each shrug it off onto the other. We might be obligated to think that the anestologist's version is true, but there's no hard and fast evidence. He might be lying too. (Just because we have the wife's perspective, and bc the anestologist's story comes second so it feels more like a revelation.) But on a first watch, I don't think we have any access to the truth of the story.Which brings me to a central point, which is that this movie is playing with postmodernism, no doubt about it. Postmodern theatre characteristics abound. The moral ambiguity. The multi-perspectivialism that challenges the notion of objective truth. The inflectionless way that the actors deliver their lines (this harkens back to the notion of the ""text bearer"" in postmodern theater, which places actors as bearers of the text, rather than interpreters, and calls them to say the lines with minimal inflection). Even the (almost cliched at this point and seemingly requisite mention of ""a dog."") There's always ""a dog"" in movies like this and it seems to always play this larger-than-life role. So in that sense, I think it's a little paint-by-numbers. I think it's a little tired. These 'artistic elements' aren't necessarily artistic, in the sense that they're not doing anything so radically new, or challenging the conventions of movies. People are using these same exact conventions, just on a fringe group. So I don't think it's particularly radical. But.There is SOMETHING substantive here. The movie IS playing with ancient myths (there are some HARD CORE OEDIPAL VIBES going on, between the characters, and even in the final symptom of the disease). And the notion of prophecy - did the prophecy 'come true' because it was destined to be that way, or because he knew about the prophecy? Even the idea of sacrifice, a sort of one-for-one, life-for-life thing is something that comes up in Ancient myths (and the Bible) all the time. The movie's also playing with the Joycean themes of paralysis (literally, another symptom that the family finds); and gnomen--that is, what gets left out, what's unsaid. (Two prime examples of this: the name of the diner gets blocked out in one scene; in the scene where the husband threatens to shoot the neighbor boy but then stops, we don't know what Nicole Kidman says to her husband to get him to put the gun down). And all the stuff with hands--the doctor/husband/father has clean hands, which get sucked on; Nicole Kidman gives a handjob--there's something going on there too. Finally, it is the kind of movie that sticks with you. Even if the postmodern elements are a bit tired, the integration of source texts gives the movie a bit of depth. There's a universality to the film, but also a particularity that is so strong, so beautiful, that genuinely pulls you in. I've never seen anything quite like it. I can't get it out of my head.MY TWO FAVORITE LINES:

This already called for some absurdities. But some, not a ton as the director chose to pile on our backs (he is also one of the screenwriters). As an example, the scene where the main character tells his son how he masturbated his father when he was a boy is gratuitous. If you want to be disturbed there are far better movies.

720,adbeer-47919,The killing of a sacred deer review,9,6 July 2018,"""The killing of a sacred deer"" is a film that hardly anyone talks about in its fullest form, in fact many people would watch this film for the first time and think it's too weird, unconventional and disturbing but really there's much more to this film than meets the eye. Filled with great performances a unique concept and a tone in a film that you would never see in any other, this film is quite the film to have a big discussion about.
The film's about Steven (a surgeon) who takes Martin (a teenager) under his wing after Martin's dad dies in one of Steven's surgical procedures. But Martin takes his revenge by making a sinister, supernatural curse that causes all of Steven's family members to die unless he sacrifices one of them so it could be even to Martin's family. The stages of the curse is first they lose their ability to walk, then refusal to eat, then bleed from their eyes and shortly after they die.
One of the film's main strengths is the very disturbing and also darkly hilarious tone. The cinematography and music in the film is very unique. The film often has very Kubrickian shots that seems similar to ""The Shining"" which is definitely a good thing. But the cinematography style is unique in its own waybecause it often has shots where the camera lingers over characters heads in the frame, so there's a lot of space at the top. A good interpretation of this is that it's to give a sense of helplessness for the characters in the situation. There's a lot of aspects that go towards the tone in the film like the distinctive music that never lets you breathe mixed with camerawork that makes the film really disturbing and on the edge of your seat. But what makes the tone so special in the movie is how they mixed dark comedy with disturbing concepts. There's often laugh out loud moments that come out of nowhere and somehow it doesn't mess up the flow or tone of the film. ""The killing of a sacred deer"" has characters in it that speak in a very monotone way and this gives an extra off-putting vibe to it that although the film is very much set in reality, there's something that 's just not quite right about it.
The film can be interpreted as: the world is modern looking but it has Greek mythological rules, because Martin seems to have similar to a Greek myth that this story is based on. The title ""The killing of a sacred deer"" comes from a myth where Agmemnon (a King) sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia as the blood price for killing Artemis' sacred deer. 
There's a scene in the movie that's not that hard to dissect and is fairly obvious but there's a scene where Steven locks up Martin in a basement and when Steven went up close to Martin, Martin suddenly bites off a bit of flesh off of Steven's arm and then his own arm and explains that it's ""to symbolise the situation"". Later Steven points a gun at Martin and Martin says ""killing four birds with one stone isn't good,"" meaning if Steven shoots Martin; Steven's whole family will die alongside Martin. This just gives a more gradual sense of hopelessness which then the film turns into a question of morality.
This film also plays out as a cycle of grief. First is ""denial"" in which Steven denies about what Martin told him and starts to forcefully make Bob (the youngest child) eat his food as one the stages was ""refusal to eat"". Next is ""anger"" in which Steven starts banging on the door of Martin's house whilst shouting his name. Third is ""bargaining"" in which Steven ties up Martin in the basement to interrogate him. Next is ""depression"" in which Steven starts feeling depressed about what might happen to his children. And lastly is ""acceptance"" where he accepts the situation he's in and eventually deals with it.
STEVEN
Steven seems to be a sort of dishonest character in the film with lots of subtle hints hidden throughout. There's an instance in the beginning where he gets a leather strapped watch and says he'd prefer a metal strapped watch for his own particular reasons. In a scene afterwards he gives a metal strapped watch to Martin when later Martin says he swapped it for a leather strapped watch instead which didn't bother Steven at all. His dishonesty continues through the film when he lies to his wife about Martin's father dying in a car crash and then when she finds out and questions him about whether he was responsible for Martin's father's death he goes so far as to blame his anaesthesiologist saying: ""a surgeon can never kill a patient, an anaesthesiologist can but a surgeon can't"". The character of Steven as a whole is that on the outside he's a great person who has a great job and a great family and a wealthy home but deep down inside he has dark secrets as we discover that Steven drank on the day he did the heart transplant for Martin's father which caused him to fail.
MARTIN
Martin isn't a character who is harsh with what he says or with his mannerisms but instead he seems like a socially inept, disturbed kid who only lives with his mother and that makes his character very off-putting. The whole movie is basically Martin's sense of moral justice and acting upon whom he thinks shall not get away with lying and an injustice. In fact there's one scene where Nicole Kidman's character (Anna) kisses Martin's feet which is symbolic to Jesus Christ.
KIM
Kim is the teenage daughter of this family. In a section of the film Steven introduces Martin to his family to then Kim and Martin meet and start to bond in a romantic way. After Martin puts the curse on the youngest child, Bob (giving everyone the curse one at a time) and Kim comes home after seeing him, she asks her mum outside on the lawn if Bob is OK and then she asks if she was OK. This implies that Martin told Kim about his sinister plan. But Kim is too confident that this curse won't be put on her and that when he does she thinks it's only temporary because she thinks that the bond between her and Martin will set her free. As the movie progresses she learn that this is not the case and Martin will never set her free until Steven has paid the price. She then starts to panic and escape the house but soon after Steven and Anna find her to then which she begs not to be the one to be killed.
ANNA
Anna (the mother) is full of contradictions. She often says things like a normal and caring mother who hopes for the best for her child's future would say like: sit on your chair properly or do these chores etc. However when she is faced with choosing which child should be sacrificed in order to save the whole family, she says ""we could always just have another child"" as a way to look lightly on the situation. There's not really an explanation for this except it's probably out of panic and to make herself feel better.
""The killing of a sacred deer"" is one of the most unique, original and totally great films from 2017. It's full of very interesting symbolism and subtlety but it's not like you have to dissect the film in order to enjoy it, you can enjoy it despite not understanding some of it anyways. Films like these where you can have a discussion about it for a long time with so much to say definitely should be admired in some way. It may not be for everyone but it deserves to be seen sometime.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
721,damascenee,"A waste of time to watch, only more",1,25 February 2018,"It's not fit for an adaptation of Greek mythology, it's not fit for a decent film to watch. It could serve as a torturing item however. You show it to people you want to punish, and it is guaranteed they will feel worse than if they've seen a nightmare. The film in technical terms is good. Good acting, good directing, good music, etc., but it's about what no one should want to see, no one sane and normal, at least. It totally misses its target. It doesn't capture mythology atmosphere but a nightmarish one. Not everything can be taken out of context and modernized quickly.The same plot (you killed one of mine, I will kill one of yours) could have made a decent film, but the handling has to be totally different.

723,bobbsswiggy,I think people missed to purpose...,7,2 March 2018,"If you enjoyed this film, you're going to be labelled as a pretentious ""art"" loving wanna' be who seems to find all the right things in the wrong films. The truth is, if that's the case, then that's the case. Films like this are open to interpretation, and aren't for everyone. People love it, people hate it, but it's a film you'll need to watch to decipher for yourself what it is to you.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but not as much as Villeneuve's Enemy, which people would criticise just as much by saying it made no sense, but again, that is to them.There isn't as much homework as a David Lynch film, but it definitely stays with you after you watch it. The film is based on the Greek play Iphigenia in Aulis, which prior to this I had no experience with, but as the film took loose inspiration from it, it's not compulsory for you to know. People have tried to apply this film to a real world experience and as such, can't fathom that, just like any film, there are particular clauses. It's like watching a monster film, but then criticising it for having no scares because, monsters don't exist.The film is the literal incarnation, to me, of the famous saying ""an eye for an eye"". Someone invites you for dinner, you invite them to dinner. Someone gets you a gift, for example a watch, you get them a gift, for example a hunting knife. You bite someone's arm, you have your arm bitten into. The film is full of dread thanks to the absolutely terrifying score the film offers, and the intentional, lifeless, hollow acting was so troubling at times, but funny at others, it offered a very odd experience.Watch it, make your own mind up, and decide for yourself. I love films that I continue to watch when the film ends, and continue to watch the next day, or next week.

724,theekopper,Don't Waste Your Time,3,24 June 2020,"How Martin was able to cause the two kids to lose control of their limbs and stop eating is never explained. I suppose we're just left to assume that he put a curse on them of some kind, but that word, nor any word like it, is ever used to tell us what (or HOW) Martin is able to do this, other than the fact that his father died at the hands of the doctor some time before. Did he just wish it upon them? It's stupid to not convey what supernatural power Martin has in order to do this... and it is, in my opinion, the greatest flaw of this movie. Another thing that bothered me was the way Steven is somehow able to get away with murdering his son. The family goes to the diner afterward as if nothing happens, and again, with no clue as to what he did with his son's body or how he covered up for his murder, we're left to assume that he was able to somehow get away with it.

As the script takes an unexpected turn we quickly discover that the boy has other plans.... he is back in seek of justice.The character's emotionless expressions, coupled with the monotone script and unexpected sex scenes and explicit content thrown in for good measure is almost humorous at times and adds a satirical element.Whilst the plot is gripping the film's ending could have been stronger.

There is something really special about this film. The music is torturous, the camera angles, even the monotonous acting of the main characters. It all has a point which many here fail to see. That and there are a lot of religious undertones which have biased many audience members to automatically (and narrow-mindlessly) bring their score to a 1-3. There is a lot of Kubrick influence in this film and it is very evident. I for one hated ""The Lobster"" as it came off very pretentious but this movie was different.

Martin was introduced to the Surgeons children 2 or so occasions where he supposedly had access to there food, drink, to later cause paralysis of the children's limbs, this is all very confusing and based on the fact the child is using some sort of mind control to cause the children's illness. There is music throughout which entices a menacing theme to keep the audience on their seat, but most of the movie this did not go with the scene played out, the first hour I thought was getting to a fairly good story, but there were so many inconsistencies throughout that just did not add up, it was difficult and challenging to watch and an ending that was disappointing and did not make sense.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

743,palle-47036,Worth watching but too ''artsy'',6,16 August 2020,"Entertaining and worth watching. The bizarre plot, the performances and the cinematography makes this worth a watch. Probably extremely clever and contains lots of details with deeper meanings, but as a movie it doesn't quite work.SPOILERS BELOW - ONLY READ IF YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN ITIf you accept the fact that you have to kill a family member, which Steven does eventually, you wouldn't drag it out like he did. Instead you'd choose one and kill them in their sleep or something along those lines. Literally nobody would choose to torture them all by tying them up only to take random shots at them with a rifle.It seems as if the movie's entire latter part comprised of Steven and his wife talking about what to do and Steven carrying out the act solely served the purpose of making this parable into an actual movie. It left me waiting for a clever and unexpected ending which never came.Also, Martin said that once phase 3 (bleeding from the eyes) had begun, it was too late. I took it to mean that either it was too late to make a choice once phase 3 had begun and thus they were all doomed to die at that point, or that the family member bleeding from the eyes was inevitably going to die. Either way, the logical and obvious choice would be to kill the person already bleeding from the eyes instead of choosing at random.I would've preferred the ending to be all of them dying as a result of Steven's indecision/hesitancy in accepting his punishment.The ending was disappointingly stupid in my opinion.

End of movie.This is the type of film that some people will love because of the atmosphere and because they can be all pretentious about knowing the allusion from Greek mythology - and it's not really an allusion cause the title directly references it - while not going into any detail about why that makes it good other than ""oh, well if you aren't the type that likes to think, you won't like it....dummy.""Would like to hear somebody explain what they liked about it instead of redirecting me to study Greek mythology.

754,Nickdk2,Greek mythology drama,7,28 August 2019,"Some reviewers here clearly find this movie meaningless, but the key to getting this drama is to understand, that the premise of this movie is ancient Greek religion and Greek drama.In this movie a surgeon, Murphy, has killed a patient while operating under the influence of alcohol. In Greek religion the world order (Cosmos) is disturbed if a murder goes unpunished, this disorder is then ""balanced out"" by divine intervention. The Greek gods will appear cruel to modern viewers, since they seem not to care about ""collateral damage"" / innocent victims when they punish or drive home a point. (Examples in the Greek dramas of ""Oedipus Rex"" and ""Antigone"": When the murder of King Laos of Thebes goes unpunished the gods punish the city with plague, when King Creon years later commits hubris his punishment (nemesis) is the death of his son, because this will hurt Creon the most)Dr. Murphy has killed the father of young Martin during surgery. The punishment will be that he must ""sacrifice"" one of his own family members, as Martin explains to him, or they will all die. Murphy gets to choose which one to sacrifice, which obviously seems particularly cruel. It is unclear if Martin has brought about the divine intervention by cursing Dr. Murphy, but he certainly makes clear he finds the punishment just. Martin is clearly not a god himself, although he knows what will happen (like a seer), therefore it does obviously not help Murphy to threaten and torture him.
This movie is clearly a modern adaption of the ancient Greek world view and mythology, not knowing this will get you nowhere.
Based on this premise the movie is fine - albeit a bit slow, and without sympathetic personalities. 7 all in all in my view.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

The whole movie feels like it's building up to the ending, the events that lead a father into making a tough decision but at the end of it he basically lets fate decide, and even if he did choose that option himself, it doesn't make much sense.

766,april-17335,The same exact issues every A24 movie has,3,2 May 2020,"I have seen 3 movies produced by A24 now. The other two were Hereditary and Midsommar. And by now, I honestly feel like I don't need to watch any other movies by them because they all have played out the same way.All 3 movies are a cryptic reference to some type of mythology, aside from Midsommar being definitely pretty obvious. Hereditary is based off some type of satanic worship, and The Killing of a Sacred Deer is based off greek mythology. Issue is, if you did not go into this movie preemptively knowing the reference based off the title, then there are no second chances to get it explained to you.This movie tells you to be psychologically uncomfortable rather than showing. It uses loud, screechy music in the same manner as a laugh track in a sitcom, and the music is so loud in some parts that you almost can't even hear the actors. Not that they had much to say, anyways. It tries really hard to have metaphors, but they just aren't there. One character admits to starting smoking recently, and then all of a sudden, every character has a smoking scene injected at some point.The acting was abysmal. You can tell that they were purposely supposed to be emotionally void, but because it was EVERY actor, EVERY scene, EVERY line, it was just waaaaaaay overdone to the point of bad writing and acting. Too much of anything is always going to end up being bad. Some of the actors were trying to cover their accent, which then made the line delivery even worse because it was robotic along with a forced American accent. But, the other two A24 movies have these problems too. Line delivery is extremely unnatural in all of them, to the point of cringey rather than uncanny like they want to be. All of the movies rely too heavily on sound to make sure the audience knows this is supposed to be a scary part.I don't know whether this can be called a psychological thriller. I was uncomfortable during many parts of the movie, but for all the wrong reasons. There were so many completely unnecessary, absolutely out of place and bizarre lines the actors would say that added nothing to the film except for making it longer. There was nothing metaphorical about them. It didn't develop the characters or the plot anymore. If anything, it brought me out of the film because I was too busy going, ""wtf would ever say that?"" There is this supernatural element to the movie, but the movie never finds a way to convince you that the supernatural is an acceptable thing to occur in this universe. The rest of the movie is modern-realistic. The supernatural just like, happens and is never even really addressed by the characters. They never wonder to look into it. They're just in denial the whole time and keep going about their day as if everything is scientifically explained. And while that may have been the point, that was also poorly done to the point that you just feel like all the characters are (not artistically) mindless.I've seen other reviews that are addressing things literally only found in the synopsis of this film. They say the wife is materialistic, but literally the *only* thing that could elude to that in the entire movie is her asking the husband if he wants her to wear a dress of hers he likes. Other than that, it's the synopsis that tells you she's materialistic. There is zero character development throughout the whole film. I honestly don't even remember them ever addressing whether the wife stays at home or works. Towards the very end of the movie, a line by one of the children possibly answers that, but it could have also just been him saying what his mom wants him to be when he grows up.And, in A24 fashion, the movie ends with a final scene of no lines, slo-mo, with orchestral music playing just to make sure you knew the movie was supposed to be edgy and bizarre. There are also, as usual from them, awkwardly forced sex scenes and gore that don't do much for the plot.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Lanthimos once again creates a strange universe of strange people and relations. It does slightly resembles reality, yet in a weird way, i cant explain it in words. It is a movie that will make you question a lot of things, ideas, your attitude against logic etc. It actually brings up a lot of questions in a very twisted and absurd way.
The acting is in the same lines as in the Lobster however it is not just words spoken in very catatonic manner. All actors do it justice in my opinion.
Going back to the film as a whole, it is definetely worth watching. Yes, it is dark. Yes, it is propably way too weird for the majority, and yes it has some way too dark humor at points for most. However i never found it THAT much as it is portraid. You escape reality, you watch a world that resembles it, yet things you would find obvious, logical after some thought, feel like not even an option in this movie.
The camera work is also unbelievable, classic wide lanthimos kind of shots which create a surreal atmosphere accompanied by intriguing music.
Some might say i go too far, but for me is one great film that scores really high on my ""ranking"", a film one should not miss. I believe you can appreciate it at some level afterwards, even if you find it disturbing ehilst watching it.I would advise you to read a bit about the myth of Iphigenia beforehand.

778,lacatrinap,"The structure, the characters and all is all over the place",1,19 February 2021,"Well, as many, don't even know where to start from. Maybe just saying that, this movie, to my opinion, is far from art. I am not a cinema critique, do not want to sound arrogant but I do appreciate good cinema and art cinema and I admire and enjoy the great and talented cinematographers of all times.
I find this director pretentious on its max. I do understand that his other film, ""The Lobster"" was great, I get that, but not every body has the ingenuity of Kubrick or Guy Ritchie, to pull off the same way of dialogs and direction in every movie with out falling into a drowning situation one after the other.
I completely understand what he tried to do with the dialogs and the personality of the characters, and I say ""what he tried to do"" because in my opinion was not achieved.
No one, for the only fact of being Greek, should be so arrogant to try to bring a Euripides tragedy comedy to a nonsense, pretentiously directed, modern and ordinary movie. Does not raises in any way to the theme and darkness of it at all. Putting in randomly, gore and dark scenes does not meet the purpose of the intention, this is good for the ""forevers"" but not for me.
There is an art on making sarcastic, dark and psychological thrillers and this is just not it.
On the other hand, if the purpose was to make people realize, that he is educated on cinematography and admires the good film makers and directors, then that purpose was achieved. This shows a big hot mess of mingling together, wanna be Kubrick, Bunuel, Hitchcock and Nosferatu, so yes we get it he knows the game but just didn't know how to play it.
Starting with a too long close up of an open heart surgery (yes, yes, I know the purpose was to make the audience nervous as a plan, ok.....), to the non justified close ups of the characters while having a regular, or nonsense conversation, to the trolly shots, opening the spaces when nothing was really, suspense wise, happening at al. Same as the music, random Hitchcock kinda suspense drums and ""going psycho"" music, when, again, nothing is or was going to happen in that moment, not even crazy changes or nothing on the characters minds, it all goes flat, even with the gore and unjustified grotesque shots.
Overall, it comes across as disjointed and do not achieves the glorious cinematography of a natural born talented crazy mind.
Talent and ingenuity can't be made, either you have it or you don't. You can learn by the book but, you as well need to learn not to get egocentric and pretentious on the way, maybe another gender would have fitted Yorgos Lanthimos better this time.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

799,patrickjvmurphy,Not for everybody,8,16 February 2018,"Firstly I watched the Lobster and whilst being fascinated by it for a large part ultimately it was not a good ending making the whole movie seem pointless. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is very, very similar in terms of the style employed, the dialogue and the way it is delivered is certainly familiar when you start watching this movie. The fact that Colin Farrell is in the lead role again adds to this familiarity. The movie is initially very interesting as you try to figure out what is happening and it does a good job of holding the sense of mystery and suspense throughout. The ending is good but won't be a big surprise for those that understand the mythology that the movie is based on. It is the type of conclusion that would make you think how you would have handled the situation yourself - in my opinion any movie that puts you in the shoes or mindset of the main character has done a good job. The acting throughout was largely excellent, the characters have been made to be wooden through the style of the movie but the acting really shines through despite these constraints.This movie is not for everybody and I know a lot of people that will be completely put-off when they hear the similarities to The Lobster. But if you are willing to commit the time to getting into this movie will result in a rewarding and fascinating story. Also it is probably best if you know nothing of the greek mythology driving the story because this makes for some very interesting research after the movie.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
800,briian_kruis,Were the actors forced to act terrible?,4,25 December 2017,"I could already sense it after the very first scene in the hospital. There's something very off with the atmosphere in this movie. The actors don't show any emotions and they speak their boring lines like robots. I think even Stephen Hawking's robotic voice has more tonality then these actors do. More surprisingly, actors well known for their oustanding acting performances (especially Nicole Kidman) are completely out of touch with the events happening in this movie. Therefore it was impossible for me to relate to the characters and there was no character development. A lot of pointless and weird scenes don't have anything to do with the plot and are just there for the sake of lengthening the movie. What was the purpose of Martin's sexual relationship with Kim? Why is it normal to share with colleagues that you're daughter had her first period? Why is body hair important to show to others? Why is Anna pretending to be a sex doll for her husband? Does Martin have superpowers? Why is Martin trying to let Steven have sex with his mother? Why doesn't Anna care at all that her husband is flirting with Martin's mom (which was a pointless lie of Martin in the first place and didn't add anything to the movie at all)?

Seriously people what the hell did you expect? If you rate this (or almost any movie for that matter) so low then you are a dumba** that should stick to watching things more suitable to your level of cultural awareness - I hear there's going to be a new fast&furious movie. The acting is not ""bad"", ""cold"" or ""without heart"" - it is intentionally done in such a way as to show you the dis-attachment and alienation of the characters to each other and at the same time the phoniness of what would be perceived as an ideal family/life from first impression. Not witnessing any emotion on screen you unintentionally try to compensate and thus put yourself in place of the heroes and the threats the challenges they face. The plot does not need a ""coherent explanation"" of how the processes work - you don't question the powers or will of the gods, you just know that they exist and like it or not you have to abide. Finally, you shouldn't be expecting some clear message to be regurgitated into you at the end of the film. This is one of those movies that is supposed to take you out of your comfort zone and take of your blinkers so that you could through reflection, thought and immersion try to take something from it and grow your inner self as a result.That said I think that the film is a great attempt to set an ancient Greek tragedy in modern day life. When reading through the scarce remnants of the myths of ancient times, who did not try to put themselves in place of the characters? Did we not see them as cold when they readily sacrificed what they held dear to them to the gods? Did not some of the characters seem to be bland and be in the story just for the exact same reason? And did we not think that our actions would have been more passionate and different? *Spoiler*
And as the actual legend goes, would anything have been different had he chosen his (from my view apparently favourite of the 3) daughter as the martyr? Would his willingness alone be enough to clear his sins?

818,edward-a-bowling,The Best from Yorgos!,10,2 November 2017,"Ohhhhh my goodness. First off, we all know Yorgos Lanthimos likes to tell stories of characters struggling within constraints. In ""Alps"", the constraints are imposed by a demanding leader of the company that impersonates the deceased to help the grieving. Strict regimen, strict rules. ""Dogtooth"" revolves around a North Korean-like isolationist state where children have no contact with the outside world and therefore come of age and meaning battling their own families constraints. ""The Lobster"" mocks traditional marriage/relationships as having them be required by law in near future, thus single people are ostracized to the outskirts or morphed into an animal of their choosing. Clearly we see a bit of Haneke nihilism and abandonment of traditional the loving family ideal/trope. ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"", Lanthimos' best to date in my opinion, revolves around constraints arbitrarily imposed by a creepy mysterious character about midway through the film. Without giving much away, the protagonist has an agonizing internal dialogue set forth due to rules of the game like the ""Saw"" films. Family is pit against each other, and each character uniquely focuses solely on their own survival. The cinematography itself resembles ""The Shining"", and added to the Kubrick similarities are the strong orchestral score that permeates the film from even the ""lighter"" earlier scenes--perhaps foreshadowing----definitely foreshadowing. Bravo Yorgos",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
819,AnnBorei,A thriller whose basic plot is as bad as a B-Horror movie,4,9 July 2017,"I went to see this movie with a couple of friends at a special screening, we are all fans of Lanthimos previous works, but when this movie ended we looked at each other and chuckled nervously in disappointment. A few people in the audience even left immediately after the end and one man a few minutes later gave the movie an ironic clap, people laughed. It was that bad.The movie starts out really strongly, with all the daily awkwardness in human interactions Lanthimos can so easily portray and reshape. There's mystery, intrigue, the characters develop as the movie progresses, it delves into wider themes: the nuclear family, growing up, sexual awakenings and revenge. It is obvious Lanthimos sought to portray a ""what if"" situation in the movie that would make the viewer reflect on this themes, but the plot construction and thriller-like soundtrack and filming leaves the viewer demanding answers (like you normally get in the end of a thriller) or a twist. Instead the movie goes bland, it's extremely anticlimactic to the point of being comparable to bad horror movies where the intrigue goes nowhere. A lack of answers to basic questions as to the function of Lanthimos universes is usual in his movies, but here it doesn't work: this isn't a dystopian family or society, the movie is set in a world that feels like our own, yet we aren't given any explanations for the surreal undertones this world can have.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
820,rabbit-room,Read your Aristotle,9,12 April 2018,"Here's a black comedy film that takes its blackness so far into the black hole of its own logic that it inspires in the viewer nothing so much as spellbound horror.

This movie is, if you can imagine it, a parody of classical Greek tragedy with all the fixings, including Colin Farrell as a transgressing, responsibility-avoiding bearded Agamemnon, with Nicole Kidman as his wife, a Clytemnestra chillingly tempted toward joining Team Artemis. As in Greek tragedy, we witness the struggle of human will against an insuperable otherworldly will, and here it's one that defies categorization, not exactly the will of the gods, or of God, or of Nature (what Aristotle calls ""necessity""). The fatalistic material, delivered here as a daisy-chain of WTF moments, is presented with cold precision by the actors, including children, and the writer-director demonstrates a keen instinct for narrative exclusion, leaving out just the same sort of expository material lesser filmmakers can't get enough of.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Directing is excellent, and so is the cinematography. However, I thought the plot somewhat lacked (in quality and consistency), as did the relationship between Steven and his son (in depth). Kaurismaki-esque poker face performances are a trademark of Lanthimos', and the actors did a good job expressing the appropriate vibes. The music and sound effects were spot-on at times, but mostly over-used and tiring.Overall, the director presents a thrilling, supernatural twist on the classic euripidean tragedy, darkly comical and well-presented, that is a few flaws short of a great movie.

825,Elkhwas,THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEAR*: An evolutionary approach.,9,7 January 2018,"I really don't know, if directors study some techniques to either involve, engage us emotionally in the events or detach us emotionally from the events so they can pose their questions clearly, throw them in our faces. May be, they do not intend to do that deliberately, and it is up to viewers!
However, this movie, can stir your mind up, mess it up, fill it up with embezzlement (it is actually a minefield of moral conundrums), without ever get involved emotionally.
This movie is a reincarnation of an old, perpetual, eternal problem; Justice. 
In evolutionary psychology, justice is discussed in terms of reciprocal altruism(cooperation) and retaliation1 (Eye for an Eye) or (Tit for Tat).
 
Justice through the eyes of gods: 
You might think that there is a resemblance between this movie's theme ""seeking for justice"" and the theme of the Iliad and the Odyssey, but I see that there is a big difference here. At first, there is a big difference between the Iliad and the Odyssey2. In the Iliad, the gods are somehow neutral, but in the Odyssey, they are more prejudiced to Odysseus's cause. Justice was very blind in the Iliad. Blind retaliation to the violation or disobedience to the moral or sacred rules, was guaranteed once you break the rules. No matter who you are, you just win your punishment ticket, once you breach the rules; you incurred your deserved punishment.
 It seems like, the moral codes were Gods-made, but they were autonomic, characterized by ""Apply to all"". In the Odyssey, Zeus and Athene were obviously rooting for Odysseus's cause by all means, through his journey, from the beginning (Released by the intercession of his patroness Athene) till the end (slaughter of the Suitors) 3. In our movie, Gods don't play any apparent role, maybe they were just viewers like us, although I prefer to see them latent behind the stage. They may just responded to Martin's craving for revenge, by putting his plan into action. They granted martin god-like abilities to reinforce his cause: when he called Kim, while she was laying paralyzed at the hospital, she fell down once he hanged up, before she was able to reach the bed. But, even if we are talking about gods reinforcing justice, there was not a single hint to how martin managed to work his plan through, The Murphys didn't stop to ask. It seemed like Martin was himself the god of retribution.

I genuinely don't understand what space this movie is supposed to exist in.I have never been so confused. At first I thought the doctor was either abusing or grooming Martin. Then I thought Martin was grooming him? Then I thought Martin's mother was or had at some point abused him. Collin Farrell says he's going to f Martin and his mom 'just like you wanted'. There's the hospital scenes where Martin is treated like a dirty secret? The shirtless scenes, Collin showing Martin his body hair? Why? Martin talking about his mother and how she has a great figure... If the doctor slept with his mother, it's not like he would have lifted the curse anyway? What was the point of all of these scenes? To make the audience uncomfortable? It wasn't uncomfortable, I wasn't unnerved, I wanted to see where those threads were going. Surely this has something to do with the larger picture! No, nope, there was exactly zero point to all of it, it went nowhere, and it was stupid.There is a story it's trying to tell, but it's not done well. It feels like this is a movie where the director told all the actors to ad lib everything in the most wooden way they could manage, and it would have been much more entertaining if that were the case. But no. I read the script and these are the actual lines of actual dialogue written for these people. I get that it's some alternate universe, but people don't speak like this? If there were just some pauses in between what they say, it would be more believable. The effect they were going for here is ruined by how quickly they rapid-fire off every conversation. It's honestly hilarious, but not in a way that makes this film something you would recommend or re-watch.The best part of the movie is watching Collin Farrell tell his son about inappropriately touching his father, and then threatening to cut off all his hair and make him eat it. And he's serious, he will literally make him eat his hair.

841,kerr-p-andrew,A critical use of the medium,9,18 March 2018,"We are led to expect that a movie, with its time frame, is used in its entirety to explain an idea. Seemingly a complicated idea, it may be, requires its length. But an idea isn't bound to time necessarily, though film forces that dimension upon us. It may be hinted at to slowly draw it out, but this film does it in a way so as to remain hidden to those who will not jump bounds to interrogate it. In this sense, we the viewers are proven to no longer be sacred deers ourselves.The boy is the sacred deer, and it may seem obvious, but only afterwards; which is the point.We are shown the outside lives of the main characters, all but the boy. He is rebellious as shown with his hair. But he is also the youngest, and the least understanding of the ""world"" which all other characters seem to be so sure of.Yargos' use of language has always exemplified this, it is terse and borderline sociopathic: but this is the point.The sacred deer is innocence. Innocent to the social world, the nails that have yet to be hammered. This movie communicates in long winds that which is explained immediately by title and context: Those whom have not yet been hammered in will be so or suffer the opposite; to be ripped out.What jars most is that this theme, through the medium of film, is played out in a breath that seems longer than what is required to be explained, and therefore besets our eyes and ears.I have watched Yorgos' other films but this one seems to be the most obvious and straightforward. The hammering of the nail is done by ourselves, often by the ones who most love us. No one is to blame, especially when the ultimatum is set by those outside of our control.This innocence exists in forms we do not immediately appreciate, which I feel is not as immediately represented in this film. This is fine as I do not believe the goal of the film is to be ""direct"", which is to say I do not believe the film, or any of Yorgos' films aim to use our language to convey meaning. What is shown is that our views become perverse as we are nailed deeper into the social coffin. Or to use less morbid imagery: The youngest and most innocent; the least affected of us are yet to be shaped, and so truly they are the sacred deers among us, and we all participate in it's killing.

That is not necessarily a bad thing as it is better to feel something than nothing at all.The film showed echoes of Kubrik, Lynch and early Scorcese at times, and ebbed and flowed enough to make you feel unsettled and almost seasick. There were too many themes running throughout and as the viewer it was hard to settle on one to try and make sense of the film, at some points I gave up and decided to enjoy it for its cinematography and beautifully shot scenes, only to be drawn into another theme which served to distract as opposed to settle you into the experience.The score should be like lighting in a movie, you know its there but you shouldn't notice it. This was not the case in this film, as it continuously and deliberately is used as a tool to unsettle the viewer, which became an annoyance more so than anything.I can't say that I enjoyed this film, but I really appreciate this film, and what the director was aiming to achieve.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

It may be more artistic than I was willing to entertain at the time of viewing, but the relentlessly cold nature of the characters made disconnection inevitable. It is about this point I realised (and you will too) there will never be any modern-day rationale or logical closure in the sense that a more viewer friendly film would put forward, even one portraying an ancient mythological happening.I didn't ask for a reward when I started watching this film, and certainly none was offered.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

I understand that and I can enjoy that type of movie (dogville one of my favourites) if the movie makes a point. There is no point to the movie. Nothing to make you think about days, weeks later. It was a simple fable from the Bible set in modern day. After you realise the irrelevance of fact and understand the fable you then turn to ask yourself, what is the director trying to tell us here? What point is he trying to make? What insightful piece of information does he want the world to know, and therefore be labelled as relevant or even genius. There was none. He told a mildly boring fable about an eye for an eye, and it finished the way an eye for an eye story would finish if you wanted to make it as dry and mundane of a finish as you could.

881,dreamweaverroxie,If your not into purposefully pretentious & awkward movies give it a miss,3,21 May 2020,"When the movie first begins your met with awkward characters and acting, it's clear this is purposeful so you stick around rather intrigued but also wondering if you made a mistake choosing to watch a movie with such a pretentious name, but you continue hoping it will all make sense in the end and it's all part of some obscure plot that will be worth the slow pace and bizarre dialogue.Unfortunately I don't believe it was and it seems I am not alone after scanning over these reviews, which I felt forced to do within 30 minutes of the movie beginning as I grew bored of trying to understand why it was, well the way it was.
I am left to assume only professional critic's have voted for this purposefully odd movie as I can't believe after seeing so many bad reviews from us little people that its managed to gather a resounding 7 out of 10, which was the main reason I put the it on in the first place ignoring my instinct that with a name like that it was going to be pretentious.I have rated the movie a 3 because I do believe in some ways it had promise, I think it could have gone alot further by dropping some of the stilted acting and developing the characters so they were atleast likeable.. theres hardly any anticipation if your content with or actually wanting the main characters to die.It's clear from the start for example whilst the father chooses to chastise the son, but is willing to cheer on his daughters horrendous lack of talent (singing) that he has a favourite (all parents do, its human) it's also clear theres no passion nor love lost between him and his wife, whilst she only shows tenderness towards her son and by the end complete contempt for her daughter. So to me even though of course there would have to be serious thought and you'd try all ways to avoid having to choose which family member to kill in order to save the others, I don't understand how it got to the point where he was having to play duck duck goose or ask the headmaster who was the best child lol he CLEARLY had a favourite.I think many would agree that the clear choice was the mother, she was horrid. Unfaithful, cruel and not afraid to show favouritism, I think when she made it clear that to her the obvious choice for them was to murder one of there children as they could find a way to conceive another.. from there I was expecting him to make the right choice.The awkward justice seeking main character earns 1 star, even though he is grating particularly when he eats spaghetti I believe there was room to take his character further by giving him some depth and emotion.. I guess this can be said for all of them, just because a film maker goes out of there way to be odd and different doesn't make it good although this is the world with we in at the moment and these purposefully pretentious, quirky, look at me I'm different, I stand out, im unique movies often leave me bored, repulsed or disappointed and left wanting more or usually an explanation.I realised what was going on around 20 minutes in, when the boy finally sat with the doctor and gave him his choices I thought the movie was about to pick up.. its disappointing that it didn't.1 star for keeping me integrated enough to keep watching

886,gissenmann,A psychological thriller like they should be,7,26 May 2017,"This slow paced psychological thriller embodies everything that is key to making the viewer feel a lively and frightening experience: it is beautifully shot, with very talented actors, a soundtrack that will give you chilling goosebumps, and an enigmatic plot. While some parts might feel slow or superfluous, this is easily compensated by the rising tension. Moreover, the fright is ingeniously generated through the actors' astute portrayal of character turmoil, and not cheaply made jump-scares or gratuitous violent scenes. In a way, The Killing of A Sacred Deer reminds me of Cape Fear (1991).

But I am so resentful that this Director wasted so much time and money taking us on such a pointless odyssey with so little to teach us and with zero entertainment value that I wanted to ensure that more people like me wouldn't be entrapped into giving up an afternoon on this awful, horrifyingly bad film.""Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is a poorly-directed movie with wooden performances from the actors, driven by a screenplay designed to make the viewer feel awkward for no other purpose (if there is any purpose to anything in this film) than to hate the characters. I showed this to a room of four people. After 70 minutes or so I noticed everyone was either sleeping, or fully tuned in to their iPads, so we abandoned this pretentious pseudo-art film 2/3 of the way through. I feel that the greater sacrifice than not knowing the ending was having had to endure the storytelling that far through.The actors were CLEARLY deliberately told to ""not act"" or to put forth wooden, emotionless performances, in some sort of attempt to create a tense atmosphere, which they did with varying success. Farrell and Kidman are actually good actors and gave us occasional glimpses of humanity but the vast majority of the dialogue is delivered with all the passion of a United Nations translator. The plot moves incredibly slowly. Unnecessary scenes abound. Long lingering shots and scenes deliver neither a tableau vivant or any sort of message.The deliberate insertion of incredibly awkward sexual scenes and references -- a sophomoric, derivative pseudo-art-film attempt to cause the audience to question our own lives -- merely make us squirm and hate the characters even more. They also feel more like TMI revelations of the screenwriter or director than character or plot development devices.At the abandon point, where our protagonist has confronted his tormentor, there is the possibility that by ending him, he could cause the entire cast to perish as a result. By this point that seemed like a pretty good idea -- a swift ending to a pointless film and a rightful demise of a bunch of characters that, thanks to the director, I had grown to loathe. Having not stuck with it thru to the ending, this is how I prefer to imagine the film concludes, so that there may never be a contemplation of a sequel.This is a terrible movie. An awful movie. I will deliberately avoid this so-called auteur's work (he also gave us ""Lobster"", which I bailed on about 10 minutes in) the future.I feel bad for the DP, the actors, the Producers. I even feel bad for the Best Boy and Craft Services. All clearly worked hard on this film, toiling under the tormented gaze of a deranged director drunk on his own prior (ahem) success.

If you have to know the background story to make sense of this movie then your storytelling does not work. Even with that in mind, it's hard to find any correlation to the original. It's hard to see past the 'absurdities' to connect with what's happening. Also the way the characters are acted out is very off-putting.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

904,PandaJerk007,Great plot with a bit of awful acting/dialogue,6,24 January 2018,"It's very rare for me to lower my review score for a movie based on the quality of its acting. I find that the vast majority of actors do a passable job, so I quickly immerse myself in the film and start judging it by its other merits. Occasionally I've raised my score of a movie because its acting was so fantastic, but I'm still figuring out how to react when I see some unnatural, noticeably awkward acting.The Killing of a Sacred Deer has numerous scenes, mostly in the first half of the movie, that made me ask myself ""Are these actual humans talking to each other?"" The dialogue of some simple conversations come out feeling forced and rushed, with the characters showing no emotion when they react to each other. A few moments almost felt like scenes from The Room, which is an embarrassing comparison that no serious movie should have to face.The movie does end up rationalizing one characters' unnatural behavior, so that performance actually seems very fitting in hindsight. But the rest of the characters still feel awkward and say strange lines for almost no reason. Fortunately the actors do somewhat step up their game as the plot unfolds, but it still leaves you with a very poor first impression.The Killing of a Sacred Deer's premise and cinematography are where it really shines. For a horror movie it's actually pretty tame when it comes to gore. What's really disturbing is how its unsettling mood builds into a truly hopeless situation, until you actually start to feel the fear and paranoia of the characters. I'd like to avoid giving spoilers, and I don't feel like summarizing the plot, but I'll just say that this movie is very effective at delivering psychological pressure if you're able to survive the occasionally awful acting/dialogue.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Is it good or bad weird, in my opinion it's bad. The main issue for me is some of the implausible conversations between the characters, talking about watches, the menstrual cycle of daughter and comparing armpit hair. Another annoyance is how the main characters behave when major incidents happen. For instance, the daughter is shouting in distress downstairs, but the mother continues to make the bed upstairs, I found that implausible. This odd behaviour by the husband (Colin Farrell) and wife (Nicole Kidman) repeats throughout the film. You find yourself constantly asking why would they say or do that? I won't even mention the strange sex scenes, although they are tame compared to Lanthimos's second feature Dogtooth.

I initially decided to get this movie due to the good reviews and good score here on IMDB, but I quickly realized how misleading all of that actually is. First off, let me say that the acting seems very forced. It's literally so bad, I could assume the actors were forced to read off of a teleprompter for the entire film, rather than memorize the lines. If you'd ask me what movie is the most similar to this one, I'd say The Room, and I bet a lot of people would agree with me. This is the most forgettable movie I've seen all year. The plot is something a 4 year old could come up with, while dreaming. This is supposed to be a ""psychological thriller"", but there was nothing psychological, or thrilling about this movie. I'd bet a thousand dollars that some of these reviews are paid for by the producing company, like the one from gissenmann. This is the most dull movie I've ever seen, but he said ""It's beautifully shot, with talented actors, and an enigmatic plot"". ~~ Yeah.

I googled the film before watching and it brought up greek mythology, after reading about that not the film it made perfect sense the first time i saw it. This might be classed as a spoiler or maybe not ??Basically in greek mythology a guy accidentally killed a deer of a god/queen something like that and in return she demanded he killed his own daughter to equal the odds, thats all you need to know watching the film.....Martin is the so called god, hence how he can do what he does, hence Kidman kissing his feet near the end.The music/score is excellent and creepy its a tragedy from the start to finish, I mark it down 1 for one reason only. even though as some things that are sad are creepy and twisted i wanted just that little bit more of a push to say OH MY GOD DID THEY JUST DO THAT, it never quite got me to say wow that shocked me.

915,sektoras-53704,Easy film...NOT!,10,18 December 2017,"I don't want to write any criticism for the movie. Most good reviews have done it better than me. What I would like to write has to do with basic understanding of a particular kind of movies.There are movies which are self-explanatory and there are movies like this one. I find it sad that a lot of critics have the words ""obtuse, weird, no meaning, garbage, etc "". I am Greek so I am familiar with the context and the generic idea behind the movie but even in other complicated movies (directors like Aronofsky, Bunuel, etc have created movies like this one (and because i want to avoid haters, i am NOT making a comparison between Lanthimos and those guys)), I always, ALWAYS think and read before I judge.It's one of those movies that you need to think and even by thinking you may still not be able to understand it. You may need to read before passing any judgment. But for me at least this is the beautiful thing with these kind of movies. They educate you. You evolve as a personality because of them. To rephrase it, you may evolve as a personality because of them if you let yourself open. If you baptize the movie as crap just because you found the acting ""weird"" or ""empty"" without thinking why the director choose this approach(?), then you have barricaded yourself under the safety of your own little world.Of course if you believe that a movie is good only if you are able to understand it without the need of any reading, considerable thinking etc. then of course this is not a movie for you and you have excluded yourself from a vast collection of amazing directors and movies but that's just personal preference.

My wife always reads reviews on this website and Im always saying let's give it a chance! Now this has brought out more emotion in any film I have seen (which might be a good thing thinking about it) There are a few things that excuse my french are terrible! 1.ROBOT ACTING
Having been a lover of Nicole Kidmans past films I thought the robot acting was due to a twist coming for example they were animatronics or some other twist. NO, NO THEY WERE NOT! It was like they were purposely trying to portray they were reading from a script which in itself was annoying.2. I HAVE NEVER WANTED SOOOOO MUCH TO SEE A LEAD CHARACTER DEAD!I can not fault the actor at all. He was great (apart from the robot acting) this scrawny little arse was killing off a family and he was left ALIVE! yeah OK!3. Colin leaves the hospital angry and even says to the head of the unit he wasn't doing his job right, i could understand that all the symptoms were psychosomatic! you know what would have made this film one of the greatest? If Colin rushed his son to the hospital and then he died,due to him thinking he was poisoned by the mums homemade lemonade. that would add some realism to the movie as there is now way it was psychosomatic anymore, but alas he stays at home with him turning around in the living room shooting!4. THE ENDING
My god there in the cafe and the guy walks in, only 3 of them are left and he sees them, walks past and has a water! Again imo I would have loved this film if Colin went crazy or even Nicole or the daughter walked up and killed the guy, and knowing there may be a chance of them all dying BUT NO THEY WALK OUT AND LEAVE THIS SCRAWNY LITTLE MAGICIAN SITTING THERE! All in all this movie could have been utter brilliance but having found out it was based on a GREEK MYTH I know now that it doesn't work in this time.It has been emotional goodnight!",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

Oke is hé taking revange for his father or that hé revused his mom?Oke that was a bit confussed, but one Day the surgeon his son cant walk and does not eat...

How and why the boy did that....movie never tells....Why is the whole family listening to the boy and do what ever hé wants?Why are they not going to the Police and Just kills one of the family? Parantly the boy gives a lot of his mom, so why not blackmail him... Like if you dont change the situation i am goin g to do something to youre mom. Instead of killing youre own son...

And i can honestly say this is the biggest art scam i´ve seen in at least 5 years. DO NOT BOTHER. The mood mediated in this flick is destroyed by it´s painfully (and unnecessary) elongated scenes that would put Tarkovskys movie Stalker to shame. Difference off course is that Stalker is a masterpiece of art as where Killing of A Sacred Deer actively aim to make its list of great actors purposefully act almost as sterile as the rest of the environment. The dialogues are flat to say the least and It is one of those movie where you due to irrational and frankly dumb characters stop caring altogether about their fate to the point that i, towards the end, hoped the protagonist would just kill off his entire his family.
The logical gaps and the unanswered questions is for sure deliberate, masked under the cloak of artful cinema, and yet without any finess or purpose.Inb4 someone claim i do not get the movies artfulness or the emotional experience it tries to mediate, let me make it clear i am fully aware of both. Truth is this movie cements Giorgos Lanthimos position in cinema as what Robert Rauschenberg is to art.

937,ahmelsayed,terrible movie,1,5 February 2018,"This is a terrible movie. It takes a seemingly simple setup, and shrouds it in meaningless mystery that once reviled left me feeling completely underwhelming.The setup is that of a cardiologist who killed a patient of his after operating on his heart while have had a couple of drinks before hand. The doctor is unwilling to admit his fault, while at the same time spending time with the patient's son to make himself feel better about it.The movie takes that simple unoriginal setup and shrouds it in a lot of needless symbolism just for the sake of symbolism that delivers nothing to the movie other than that of movie makers to stroke their egos of how clever they can be. A running symbolism is that of how beautiful and clean the surgeon hands are. Look at how bizarre his sexual fetish is, which may signify some history of actually doing that to patients. Look how he denies even the possibility that he could be responsible for killing someone. Look at that kid who appears to be suffering from some mental disability but is actually a supernatural being.The only well done part of the movie was the soundtrack. The sound track keeps you involved throughout the movie hoping for a thought provoking twist that will make all the odd personalities make sense, but it never does. Once the kid explains the setup the rest of the movie is very predictable and pointless.The dialogue is simply the worst part of this movie. There is little to no dialogue in the movie. Which to me is an easy way for an incompetent script to hide itself as a really deep one, while in fact containing nothing of value.

The acting was just okay from Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell (only sometimes), but the children were just plain awful and painful to watch honestly. The plot and dialogue were actually the worst though!! We couldn't help but laugh through the whole thing. The entire time I kept thinking it would all come together and make some sort of sense, but nope. Literally finished it with my mouth hanging open in shock of how blatantly pretentious and dumb this movie was. DO NOT WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME ON THE FILM EQUIVALENT OF A SOGGY CORN-FILLED TURD. Seriously though, it sucked so bad I had to make an IMDB account just to let everyone know.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
953,petermueller-93021,Don't waste you time... objective Rating minus 10 Stars,1,7 May 2018,This is one of the worsest movie i have ever seen. This movie is completely confusing. No Idea what is the sense of this movie. I can't understand why this movie gets in average 7.1 Stars. I won't waste more time. Forget this Kind of crap.,The Killing of a Sacred Deer
954,peacheyt,Without a doubt the most agonizing waste of film.,1,20 May 2018,"One of the worst films I've ever seen. I'm not sure there is anything I can say that the other reviewers haven't said. There is so much inane dialogue I was tempted to turn it off and leave. Come on, no one really believes 3 children would meet for the first time and begin telling each other about body hair and having just had their first menstrual cycle. Then from there the dialogue just got worse. If you've seen this film, I'm sorry you subjected yourself to that crap. If you haven't seen it please don't waste your time.Does this review contain any spoilers? There isn't anything in this film, that if reveled, could spoil anything about this film. I guess if I had to look logically at that question, this last paragraph is a spoiler because you will walk away knowing ahead of time that it is a total waste of 2 hours 1 minute and 8 seconds. Save yourself the agony.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
955,lenarder,A Master surreal director at work,9,26 May 2018,"It's obvious that your standard cinema goer/film consumer will not understand this work of art, so all the low-rated reviews aren't a surprise at all.
Expect a subconscious, dream-style technique, in-line with other Master surreal directors.
Wonderful sound design which builds the tenseness of the plot beautifully. Hear Johnnie Burn's ""Hecatone"". Even more wonderful music, especially the Lachey Arts Choir 's ""Carol of the Bells"" with its distinctly Pagan overtones and Kim's cover of Ellie Goulding's ""Burn"". Seems to be an on-going theme for the director to attempt to recall the nostalgia of youth.
Brilliant cinematography. Strange high shots of scenes, as if some giant were filming. Unusual panoramic lens used at times, which is immediately interesting and noticeable.
I found this to be Lanthimos' most accessible work in terms of standard film format; being a build up and then conclusion at the end. Probably what I liked least about it! Ie, I don't especially enjoy predictability when it comes to arthouse.
His actors' script execution always seems to be the same: purposefully mechanical, very much trying to convey a fake reality, in my opinion, as so often experienced on psychoactives like LSD.
Interestingly though, is the fact that ""Bob's"" (Robert) script delivery was the most life-like (ie, non-mechanical), him being the one sacrificed.
The metaphysical twist was the clincher for me which was immensely rewarding. 
As another reviewer noted, which I'm interpreting in my own way: the film acts as a reminder that technology can't reveal the mysterious forces that keeps the wheel of life turning, and human relationships and evolution in tow, which can only be a good thing.
The only thing I wish, is that I didn't know anything at all about the film before watching, as I read the 2 line IMDB review knowing that Martin was going to become ""sinister"", as that would've been a nice surprise.
I look extremely forward to his next feature for 2018, already completed.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
956,nickupholdlive,A Film to Digest,10,12 June 2018,"I had been wanting to see this film for quite some time. I would see it on my Amazon Prime and just scan over it, mentally preparing myself. I knew going into it I would be viewing something that would both entrance and disturb me and I needed to be in a particular mood to sit down and watch it. The day finally came last week.The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a deeply disturbing movie both visually and story wise. The cinematography is very unsettling with it's bizarre camera angles, the soundtrack makes you uneasy throughout, and the story itself is unlike anything I have ever seen.The story follows a surgeon and his family as they are quietly terrorized by a young boy named Martin who is seeking vengeance on the surgeon for accidentally killing his father. Every twist and every turn makes you believe one thing, but just when you think you know what's going on the movie sends you down another whirlwind of nightmares.I highly recommend sitting down late at night and viewing this masterpiece. It is not for the faint of heart. The movie is very slowly paced which makes it infinitely more unsettling.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer
957,jchrisstrickland,Strained,4,13 December 2019,I can suspend disbelief as well as anyone for the sake of otherwise good story telling but I found myself distracted by the logic failures here. The rationale for cursing them seemed weak. It lacked justification. Why didn't they just leave Steven instead of cajoling him for his favor? How could the sudden absence of his son be explained later? I realize the primary intent was to disturb and shock... to create squirmy unease but that should not be done at the expense of reasonable plot development.,The Killing of a Sacred Deer

960,jorgealvarezram,Greek tragedy made cinema,9,14 October 2019,"Something that is bothering me about this movie, is the fact that they are putting and forcing a comparison to Stanley Kubrik thanks to their main theme and a scene of Nickole Kidman, where he is removing makeup in front of the mirror, which is identical to the eye ... but it looks more like a tribute. Yorgos Lanthimos comes as with all his films, with a family destruction, he did it in Canino as the metaphor of a prison; He did it in The Lobster as the exaggeration of belonging to a social group and now comes with The Killing of a sacred deer with a Greek tragedy.SynopsisSteven (Collin Farrell) is a successful surgeon, who maintains a relationship with Anna (Nikole Kidman) who is an ophthalmologist and between the two they maintain a beautiful, stable and wealthy family, which will be interrupted by a strange young man who will break into Your peace of mind with a mysterious event.DirectionSince I saw the trailer I noticed a beautiful photograph with excessive use of super-wide-angle (wide-open) lenses, which seemed strange to me since I hadn't seen it at the Yorgos Lanthimos cinema, for a moment I thought the same thing had happened as in the case of Alejandro G. Iñarritu with Birdman, who succumbed to the hollywoodence technique to create this work. But it was not so, the use of these lenses was used to show that the emotional distance between each character is immense, to this is added that very aesthetic photograph of Thimios Bakatatakis that shows you the characters not so close or so far, to not to empathize with them but without losing that interest that characterizes Lanthimos's cinema.
Throughout the film there are those panels that are very notorious, it is strange, but the fact of being notorious could lose the viewer's interest, but it is not, it is more, it helps to maintain a constant tension, which is seasoned with string soundtrack giving those suspense touches in the first part, but for the second it works to give elements of terror.Iphigenia in Áulide and the Talion LawThe film is based on the tragedy of Euripides: Iphigenia in Áulide, which tells that King Agamemnon has to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to win the war against Troy, a request made by the goddess Artemis; she sends an oracle to give this prophecy, since she was angry with the king for killing a sacred deer (hence the name). The king to perform this action, lies to his daughter saying to marry Achilles. These details must be taken into account, as they are shown in the film in different ways but with the same meaning. It is interesting how he uses this resource origin of his country, since although cinema is a very small company there, adapting Greek tragedies to it is magnificent and what better than Yorgos Lanthimos to do it?
Here we will also see the Talion Law, which obliges the person who commits wrong actions to pay with the same acts. You know, it is famous for the Bible passage Exodus 21:24 - eye for eye, tooth for tooth.PerformancesI hear many people complain about the performances, but they are the same who said nothing in The Lobster by the same director, since he handles a similar performance Collin Farrell, only that in that film the interpretation is colder. In The Killing Of a Sacred Deer characters are shown that seem to have no feelings, cold and even ruthless, but as the film progresses they open up and even the planes are more intimate towards them, there is an excellent work by all , they look plausible. This of evolving and entering the characters exponentially throughout the plot, whether for better or for worse, is seen throughout Lanthimos's cinema, so I really recommend all his films, it is a very interesting filmography.
ConclusionLanthimos emphasizes something that persists throughout his filmography: punishment; He is constant in it and is what he likes to play with most. This movie is not for the public, it is not pleasant and like Lanthimos cinema, do not expect the beauty of life in a movie. Look at it with a critical eye, since this director plays with many details, sometimes very subtle and I leave you one: women are represented as deer, just notice that there are two planes of them with trees resembling the antlers of these; it will not be David Fincher, but it shows that it is thorough.",The Killing of a Sacred Deer

We looked at the rating for this pieceoftrash-movie and were good to go. Everything about this movie is bizzare; the sexscenes are unnececary, the filming is boring, the music sounded like the musician was bangig his head against the piano, the dialoges are so unnatural I didnt know whether to laugh or cry.

I LOVE this film and everything about it. I'm still reeling from the unsurpassable spectrum of feelings it emoted from me in a mere 121 minutes. I'm enchanted.P. S.

In the end, I walked away from this movie with the same exploited feeling I have when I go through self check out at the grocery store. The score was very good. Kind of like finding an elevator that plays your favorite jam. Would you ride to a few extra floors to hear the entire song? Or perhaps start dancing a bit in the tight confines?
