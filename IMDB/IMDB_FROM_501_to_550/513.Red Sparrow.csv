0,TheLittleSongbird,Flies high enough but doesn't quite soar,7,8 March 2018,"The book, that 'Red Sparrow' is adapted from, is brilliant. It is very complex, but also very clever, suspenseful, intelligent and fun. As well as loving the book, the main reason for seeing 'Red Sparrow' was the cast which is a talented one and while not being blown away by the advertising it left me intrigued.After seeing it, 'Red Sparrow' turned out to be a decent film in my opinion that flies high enough, but falls short of being great (like it could easily have been) meaning it doesn't quite soar. As an adaptation, it is a laudable one. The book is very difficult to adapt, but the film condenses it while still adhering to the spirit of the source material and what makes it so good and still making sense. It is to me much better than the mixed critical reviews, while sharing a few of the criticisms, and is not a 1/10 film. A rating only reserved by me for films that have no redeeming qualities and don't try. 'Red Sparrow' does try and has a lot going for it, while being problematic, if anything leaning slightly towards the trying too hard side of the spectrum.'Red Sparrow' has a very elaborate and suitably challenging story with plenty of twists and turns, the most shocking being the ending which will confound some but like with me haunt others. Luckily it is executed with a suitably cold and suspenseful touch, while having the intelligence to be involving and not taking itself overly seriously. A lot goes on and it's very complex content, yet the story doesn't feel too convoluted if perhaps over-stuffed in places. Visually, 'Red Sparrow' looks great. In particular the scenery, landscapes and locations, which are wondrous and have such a lot of atmosphere and beauty. Made just as striking by the stylish photography, where the cold look suits the tone and subject very well, and slick editing. The music has its share of tension without intruding too much. Script is smart and thought-provoking, again being challenging and elaborate enough without being too over-complicated. Francis Lawrence directs with cool confidence and personally that the violence and torture weren't that gratuitous, they are not for the faint-hearted certainly but for the subject the brutality was needed, is not overdosed upon and added to the full horrors of the situation.Most of the cast come over very well. Jennifer Lawrence, hated a lot on IMDb but for me one of the better actresses today under 30, is in one of her most demanding roles here and she is not taxed by it at all and gives it everything, commanding the screen with ease. Frosty Charlotte Rampling, authoritative Jeremy Irons and menacing Matthias Schoenarts support her just as strongly.For all those strengths, there are drawbacks. 'Red Sparrow' is a little overlong by about 15-20 minutes and there are times where the pace loses its tautness. Agree that the characters tend to be one-dimensional and although the cast are mostly very good the accents are less than great.Joel Edgerton is out of his depth sadly too, having neither the charm or the intensity for such a role. He and Lawrence have very little chemistry, sexually or otherwise, meaning that the more intimate scenes lack sensuality. Overall though, a decent and better than expected film but something was missing. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Red Sparrow
1,Leofwine_draca,"Interesting, but not without problems",6,14 December 2019,"RED SPARROW is the latest Hollywood spy thriller, this time told from a Russian perspective. It's a flawed piece with lots of interest but also some crucial elements which don't work all that well, leaving it a mixed bag overall. Generally it's well produced, and it's nice to see a film which doesn't shy away from the gritty violence and sexuality that goes together with this profession in the real world. The supporting cast is very good, from minor players like Ciaran Hinds and Jeremy Irons to dependebles like Joel Edgerton, but the one misstep is Jennifer Lawrence herself, who never really convinces in the role and has little depth. The film features numerous set-pieces which are handled effectively, but it's also at least an hour overlong with repetitive scenes (such as between Lawrence and her mother) which drag the pacing down to a glacial crawl.",Red Sparrow
2,SnoopyStyle,straddling the divide,6,29 April 2018,"Russian prima ballerina Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) gets hurt and her dancing career is over. Her uncle Vanya Egorov recruits her into Russian intelligence with a threating offer of help for her sick mother. Her mother warns her but is powerless to help. She is trained by a cold-hearted matron (Charlotte Rampling) at a spy school. CIA agent Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton) is working on an important Russian asset. Vanya sends Dominika to uncover the identity of the Russian traitor.This is trying to be dark realism and also stylish sexy thriller. The blending is not easy and it struggles between the two genres. I would rather it go full dark and realistic. Lawrence is doing her best but she is being pulled around in this. It's hard to see the chemistry with her and Edgerton. They are both a step away from true romance which always left me wondering about their true intent especially her. That's par for the course for spies and in one pivotal scene, she's asked to play both sides. That does keep me for truly embracing for the pairing. There are also questions of logic. It's hard to imagine the Russians trusting her which does go back and forth. That part of the ending is the most problematic. It would have been better to kill Nash after torturing the name out of him. That would be a great dark ending but again, the movie struggles to straddle that divide. It wants the darkness but also the happy ending. This has the makings of a good espionage thriller but it fails to excel.",Red Sparrow
3,Horst_In_Translation,For the easily entertained,4,29 March 2018,"""Red Sparrow"" is a new American movie and the most recent collaboration between Austrian director Francis Lawrence and lead actress Jennifer Lawrence (not related obviously) who previously collaborated on the Hunger Games franchise. Now for this one here, it runs for a massive 2 hours and 20 minutes, but luckily it almost never drags and that is almost the only positive thing I can say about the film to be honest. Now my perception may be a bit clouded by the fact that I always thought Jennifer Lawrence was horribly overrated, but what can I say: I don't think we get more than 3 different face expressions in these almost 150 minutes and she is like a less talented Renée Zellweger and I am already far from a Zellweger fan. As for the film itself, the looks of the poster and title already give away that Cold War and spies are crucial components here. If you take a look at the cast list, you will find many really talented names. Edgerton was solid most of the time and it's baffling how he looks like a younger version of Ricky Gervais at this point. Schoenaerts is without a doubt a talented actor and I always thought that he looks so Russian and not really Belgian at all. So the role was perfect for him and if they ever want to make a Putin biopic, they sure need to cast him. Rampling I feel pretty sorry for. She is a good actress, but here she plays the most embarrassingly cringeworthy stereotypical character and has zero material to shine. Oscar winner Jeremy Irons has nothing to work with either. His impact at the end makes him at least a bit more memorable and his revelation is thanks to his talent maybe the best scene of the movie.But yeah, it is really all about Lawrence (Jennifer). They did everything to make sure that nobody takes away from her spotlight. The character is a joke to be honest. Extraordinarily-talented ballerina, niece of Russian high-profile intelligence member, and all she turns into afterwards feels just like a bad joke. With basically no training, she becomes somebody who plays the biggest secret services of the planet the way she wants and this includes not just the leaders, but also the people she is in direct contact with. Nobody sees through her. Oh yeah, and of course, she is stunningly beautiful. Well no, she is not, but they sure try to make us believe she is. The ""not in her league"" comment about REdgerton is just the best example. There are moments when the movie is shockingly bad indeed. Realism is nothing you will find in here whatsoever and the lack of your and the general public's insight into these secret operations in the real world are certainly no justification. This is not how it is. This is dramatized beyond recognition for entertainment purposes. For the easily entertained and not worthy a script for a BAFTA nominee.Of course, the film is also way too intelligent for its own good and has far too many plot twists that are really ridiculous, like of course Schoenaerts' character at the end at the airport. Wow.. what a surprise. With better writing, this main character could have been a huge contender in the Best Lead Actress category at every award show, but certainly not with what the two Lawrences turned it into. Like I said, it is definitely a shame because the cast offered so much more here. The best example is how inferior, weak and hopeless all other female characters next to Lawrence's were written and depicted like the Senator's head of staff, a woman in her position who'd never act and react the way she does in this movie. She does not stand a chance to the Sparrow. Yeah right. Okay I think I made my point clear. I like spy movies, really love Bond for example, even those that not too many like, but this one here is a mess. I definitely give it a thumbs-down and suggest you really wanna skip it. For your own good.",Red Sparrow
4,Prismark10,This bird does not take off,1,31 August 2018,"Red Sparrow highlights the continuing misogyny in Hollywood today. Even an Oscar winning actress is not immune from it.Dominika (Jennifer Lawrence) is a Russian ballerina who gets seriously injured and her dancing career is over. Unable to support her sick mother. Dominika's uncle Vanya (Matthias Schoenaerts) recruits her to become a Russian spy and in return he would make sure her mother gets the medical treatment she needs.During spy training the sparrows learn the art of seduction. Giving fellatio to strangers so they can extract information. Dominika is assigned to seduce a CIA agent Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton) for information. Instead Dominika looks to use Nash to defect to the Americans.The film is inherently sexist rather than a sexy thriller. It is also tepid and lacklustre.There is little chemistry between Lawrence and Edgerton. This is a truly torrid film. As an updated version of the French espionage film Nikita, it fails miserably.",Red Sparrow

When she has an accident of the stage that ends her career, he uncle Vanya Egorov (Matthias Schoenaerts) from the Russian Intelligence offers Dominika to work for the government. She succeeds in her assignment and Vanya recruits her for the notorious Sparrow School where the women learn how to get information for the Russian intelligence using their bodies. Meanwhile the CIA operative in Moscow Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton) falls in disgrace when he creates a diversion in the Gorky Park to save the mole Marble from the police. However he convinces his superiors to let him go to Budapest to have a final encounter with Marble to indicate a new contact. Dominika is assigned to meet Nash and discover the mole´s identity in a spy cat-and-mouse game.""Red Sparrow"" is a highly entertaining spy movie with a complex story. Jennifer Lawrence shines in the lead role despite the terrible hair bangs and the absolutely lack of chemistry with Joel Edgerton. The last plotting point is absolutely unexpected and will certainly surprise the viewers. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Operação Red Sparrow"" (""Red Sparrow Operation"")",Red Sparrow
6,nogodnomasters,"If you don't matter to the men in power, you don't matter.",8,25 April 2018,"Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) is a ballerina ( Isabella Boylston)... no close-ups please, who through a series of circumstances, some of her own doing, she winds up becoming a spy, i..e ""Red Sparrow"" by going to what she calls, ""whore school."" She cares for her mother and is very astute and good at her job. She needs to ""get close"" to a CIA operative (Joel Edgerton) and discover the name of a mole. As always there is more going on than what is on the surface. Spying is a cut throat back stabbing business. I can say Jennifer Lawrence's accent was better than Sean Connery in ""Crimson Tide."" She makes a good spy, but not on the scale of Angelina. My personal belief this would have been better for a thinner person, like Gal Godot, while Lawrence would have made a better Wonder Woman. For those who like to watch a good old fashion cold war spy drama, this is it. Putin has put Russia back in the theaters. I have grown weary watching pictures with a lot of sand in them. I can only hope J-Law does some more torture porn. The film makes Russia look like one big prison. And it dares to ask the question, ""Why are Russian women so sexy and all the men look like toads?""

7,kosmasp,Not taking prisoners,8,23 April 2018,"Or exchanging them for that matter, if that is another thing you may like to say for a movie that is really brutal. Too brutal for some, I have to admit it is borderline on occasion, especially when you have an issue seeing women being abused (and that is actually something the movie riffs on of course - and again, remember this is fiction).Still the torture (no pun intended) some may feel is necessary at points. Did it have to be as graphic as it is at times? That's a tough one to answer. Just bare in mind, what the movie tries to achieve and that it does not tip toe around the depiction of violence. If you can handle that, the movie has a story to back that up and make it worth your while (unless you also don't like all the Russia bashing - try to blend that one out, someone has to be the bad guy, don't read anything into it)",Red Sparrow
8,jboothmillard,Red Sparrow,5,16 March 2018,"The trailer for this movie, based on a well-received novel, looked pretty good, including obviously the lead actress, so I went to see it in the cinema, directed by Francis Lawrence (Constantine, Water for Elephants, I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire). Basically in Russia, Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) is a famous Russian ballerina supporting her ill mother Nina (Joely Richardson), her career ends after an injury. Dominka is approached by her uncle Ivan Vladimirovich Egorov (Matthias Schoenaerts) who works in Russian intelligence, she is tasked with seducing Russian politician Dimitry Ustinov (Kristof Konrad), to replace his mobile phone with a replacement, in exchange for the continued medical care for her mother. As Ustinov rapes Dominika, Russian operative Simionov (Sergej Onopko) kills him, they escape, and he reveals that he had intended to kill Ustinov all along, Dominika is now under threat and had two choices, work for Russian intelligence, or be executed. CIA operative Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton) is working in Moscow, he is meeting an asset in Gorky Park, a mole in Russian ranks code-named Marble, he creates a diversion to allow them to escape detection. Nash is reassigned back to the US, but he is the only CIA operative Marble trusts, Nash insists he is the only individual Marble will work with, he cannot return to Russia, so he regains contact with Marble in Budapest. Dominika is sent to train to become a Russian operative, known as a 'Sparrow', capable of seducing her targets, the Sparrow School is governed by the Headmistress, known as ""Matron"" (Charlotte Rampling). Dominika excels in her training, despite some issues, and she is assigned to Budapest, meanwhile Russian SVR has been tracking Nash, hoping to find the identity of Marble, Dominika is assigned to gain Nash's trust, and reveal his contact. Arriving in Budapest, Dominika lives with Marta (Thekla Reuten), another Sparrow, she quickly makes contact with Nash, he recognises she is a Russian intelligence operative, Dominika reveals her true identity to him, and her motives for wanting to know Marble's identity. While Marta is out, Dominika inspects her room, and realizes that she is working to gather information from a U.S. Senator's chief of staff Stephanie Boucher (Mary-Louise Parker), Dominika realises she needs more time, she tells the ambassador that she is helping Marta in gathering information from Boucher. Returning home one day, Dominika finds Marta has been tortured and murdered, Simionov reveals that murdered her as a warning not to betray Russian secrets. Dominika offers to work for Nash as a double agent, she carries out Marta's assignment to meet Boucher, and covertly exchanges the floppy disks containing the supplied CIA information. Boucher is spooked when she sees American agents, she unintentionally steps into traffic and is killed, Russian agents observing realise that the mission has been compromised by Dominika. She is returned to Moscow, where she is tortured and interrogated for days, she repeatedly denies compromising Boucher, Ivan is convinced that she is now credible to the Americans, Dominika is then returned to Budapest, and wants to defect to America with her mother. Dominika spends the night with Nash, she wakes to find Simionov torturing him, he is attempting to discover the identity of Marble, she initially helps with the torture, but turns on Simionov and kills him. Dominika wakes in hospital, where General Vladimir Andreievich Korchnoi (Jeremy Irons) reveals he is Marble, he explains that he was initially patriotic, but grew to feel that Russia was corrupt. Korchnoi fears he will be caught soon, he does not want to die in vain, so instructs Dominika to reveal his identity to Ivan, the promotion of doing so would make her a hero, she could then replace him as the mole, furthering their working by passing information to the CIA. But when Dominika contacts her superiors to reveal the identity of the mole, she frames her uncle Ivan rather than betray Korchnoi, Ivan is killed, and Dominika is congratulated for her work. Dominika returns home to Russia with her mother, she receives a phone call from an unknown person, but she recognises it may be Nash, who played Grieg's piano concerto that she had listened to during their affair. Also starring Ciarán Hinds as Zakharov, Nicole O'Neill as Sonya, Sergei Polunin as Konstantin, Bill Camp as Marty Gable and Douglas Hodge as Maxim Volontov. I can see why this is one of Lawrence's most demanding roles, mastering a Russian accent and getting into the shadowy world of espionage, it does get slightly complicated with all the surveillance and countersurveillance stuff, but there are memorable scenes, not least the seduction techniques stuff in the school, and a fairly interesting follow the clues style plot, with one or two twists along the way, all in all it is not a bad spy thriller. Worth watching!",Red Sparrow
9,Tweekums,A gripping and gritty spy thriller,9,27 February 2019,"Following an accident which ends the career of Russian ballerina Dominika Egorova her uncle, the Deputy Director of SVR, offers to help her by finding her a job working for the state. This leads her to 'Sparrow School' where agents are trained in seducing potential targets. The target she is given is CIA agent Nate Nash who is believed to have been in contact with a high level Russian official; it will be her job to get the name of the traitor. As she gets close to him it is uncertain who will ultimately turn who and the danger increases for both of them.If you are looking for an action pack adventure along the lines of 'James Bond' you are likely to be disappointed; this is a much darker type of spy thriller. At times it is hard to watch as characters are tortured and there is a real sense of danger for even the most important of characters. Jennifer Lawrence is on great form as Dominika bringing both a senses of vulnerability and strength to the role. The rest of the cast, which includes many well-known actors, is solid too. The sense of tension builds quickly and remains high for most of the film; right up to the final scenes I had no idea how it would end for the protagonists. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of John le Carré style spy dramas where the craft if more important than the action.",Red Sparrow
10,michaelRokeefe,"Sex, lies and violence",8,6 March 2018,"I more than likely wouldn't have watched this movie if not for Jennifer Lawrence. Miss Lawrence plays a famed Russian ballerina, Dominka, burdened with paying her mother's medical bills.

Her Uncle Vanya (Matthias Schoenaerts) , a top-ranking member of the Russian secret intelligence agency, offers her work; but first she needs training at a center called Sparrow School. There she will be taught to manipulate people by discovering their weaknesses and using her body as a near lethal weapon. She will refer to it as whore school.Dominka's first assignment will be in Budapest, where she is to get close to a CIA agent, Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton), in order to discover the identity of a mole inside Russian intelligence. Nudity, lesbian love scenes and bursting graphing violence with vulgar language will earn director Francis Lawrence's movie a strong R rating. Intrigue and suspense does little to sustain this lengthy film from getting a tad clunky. Of course, personally I didn't want to blink and miss another glimpse of the newest sparrow's skin. Miss Lawrence and Edgerton have very little chemistry; the cast is rounded out with Charlotte Rampling, Sergei Polunin, Mary-Louise Parker, Jeremy Irons, Claran Hinds and Joely Richardson.",Red Sparrow
11,writers_reign,Sparrers CAN Sing,4,4 March 2018,"Clearly a divisive movie. I knew nothing about it when I saw it. Here in the UK the new films open on Friday and in most cases I have a fairly shrewd idea of what to expect - I have seen the trailer, read the book, watched the PR, etc - but this time the movie was just there, out of the blue - sorry about that. It was one of the coldest days of the year, well below freezing, a medical appointment was postponed and I had about three hours to kill. There was a multiplex five minutes away and Red Sparrow was screening in 15 minutes ...
I'd never heard of movie or book, the ticket seller said it was a spy story, I figured what the hell ... it had more twists than a pretzel, absolutely no chemistry between the two leads, a ballerina a good twenty pounds too heavy to BE a ballerina, none of the Russian characters made any attempt to sound Russian, apart from that ...",Red Sparrow

14,view_and_review,"Sexy, Suspenseful, Satisfying",7,12 March 2018,"This movie was very intelligently done but it certainly wasn't giving off an air of brilliance throughout. In fact, at one point I thought they were going for softcore porn or maybe just giving Jennifer Lawrence an opportunity to be an exhibitionist. There is no shortage of sex and nudity--it was actual a main principal of the movie. The movie is set in Russia and Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) finds herself being used as a state tool to gather information. She doesn't know who to trust but she relies on her instincts and her wit to stay alive. Jennifer Lawrence was only Katniss Everdeen to me. I had never seen her do another role. After Red Sparrow, she is Katniss no more. The performance was very good and very gutsy. It's one thing to play the role as a vulnerable Russian beauty looking to help her country but another to do so when it involves being in several sex scenes of both the passionate and violent nature. Red Sparrow relies very little on action. It derives it's suspense and intensity from the myriad of dire situations. It is very suspenseful but the suspense is only as strong as the viewers connection with Dominika. In that regard Lawerence was excellent as was the writing and directing. It's hard not to think of the Black Widow when watching Red Sparrow. Both are beautiful Russian women who are instruments of the Russian state but used in different ways. The Black Widow, while attractive, is more suited to use force to get what she wants. The Red Sparrow, also attractive, has to use every bit of her womanliness to get what she wants. Both are highly effective, it's just a matter of preference. I prefer them both.",Red Sparrow

In particular, she is tasked with obtaining the identity of a mole within the Russian security services from the CIA agent who is his contact.Jennifer Lawrence is the compromised ballet dancer, Joel Egerton is the CIA agent, and Matthias Schoenaerts is her sleazy uncle in a rather dark, glum and violent thriller. I think the sex-seduction boot camp run by Charlotte Rampling is probably a cinematic first. There is a reasonable helping of sadistic violence, a sprinkling of fairly unerotic nudity, and a plot of moderate complication.This is not a bad spy thriller, but it is pretty dour stuff, albeit with a satisfying ending. It is interesting to see Jennifer Lawrence going from feeling violated by having her nude phone selfies all over the internet to feeling empowered by getting 'em out for the boys on set.

16,phd_travel,A Russian ballerina turned spy - what's not to like?,8,1 March 2018,"J Law is good and draws you in but then goes into unnecessary twists and turns. The beginning is quite good with the ballet and then the shocking injury. I got on her side quickly as she is trained like that excellent Bridget Fonda movie ""Assassin or Point of No Return"". Then things become much more modern and sexual with quite a lot of nudity. The body count isn't that high but the torture scenes are harrowing. Although I did figure out what happened and was able to follow enough of it so I wasn't too confused, there were just too many twists and turns in the later part to be convincing. Could have been kept a little more straightforward. Jennifer Lawrence is quite curvy and doesn't have that super skinny ballerina look. Rooney Mara may have been more suited. But J Law overcomes this because she acts quite well evokes sympathy. She has a sufficiently convincing Russian accent while still being comprehensible. The supporting cast is pretty good and Matthias looks like Putin a bit so he is a good Russian. Joel Edgerton was referred to as handsome which he isn't really - this is the main casting fault they should have chosen someone a bit more dashing.Nice locations. This isn't a Luc Besson style action thriller with a high body count and lots of forward moving action. It's more a fanciful spy thriller.

Francis Lawrence of the Hunger Games Trilogy directs this very long and somewhat disjointed film. The cast is blessed with exceptional actors, even in the every small roles they are given.Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) is many things. A devoted daughter determined to protect her mother (Joely Richardson) at all costs. A prima ballerina whose ferocity has pushed her body and mind to the absolute limit. A master of seductive and manipulative combat. When she suffers a career-ending injury, Dominika and her mother are facing a bleak and uncertain future. That is why she finds herself manipulated into becoming the newest recruit for Sparrow School, a secret intelligence service that trains exceptional young people like her to use their bodies and minds as weapons. After enduring the perverse and sadistic training process under the Matron (Charlotte Rampling), she emerges as the most dangerous Sparrow the program has ever produced. Dominika must now reconcile the person she was with the power she now commands, with her own life and everyone she cares about at risk, including an American CIA agent Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton) who tries to convince her he is the only person she can trust. Her uncle (Matthias Schoenaerts) urges her to accept the challenges of being the Red Sparrow and the other players include Ciarán Hinds as the evil Zakharov, Mary-Louise Parker as the vague Stephanie Boucher, Jeremy Irons as General Korchnoi, and other actors who walk that suspicious line as to whether they are Pro Russia or pro US. The ending is dramatic and also tender. Solid actors, all, who attempt to make sense of the meandering at times boring script. For 140 minutes at least half the footage needs editing. The ballet scenes and classical music used in the film are richly rewarding. The film is not perfect but provides but provides an entertaining evening.",Red Sparrow
18,mm-39,A gritty solid movie!,9,5 April 2018,"Red Sparrow is one of the most non P C Hollywood movies made this year. Instead of the typical B S the viewer sees with establishment movie, Red Sparrow is hard to watch at times, non-sanitized, with a real life feel. Red Sparrow starts with an accident, doing a favor, set ups, melded into in an ugly cold environment! The beginning throws an icy cold feeling on the viewer and gets worse with the un-folding of the story. Lawrence's character is forced into a brutal Sparrow training program. A program of harshness, leverage, and deceit. The ugly life of spies and spy games unfolds, as Lawrence's character faces a jaded Edgerton character from the C I A. Red Sparrow add more and more characters which creates more sub stories , which keeps the viewer intrigued and guessing. Will the Red Sparrow lose her soul? Which side is the Sparrow working for?

I thought it was a nice mystery spy thriller, with enough twists and turns to keep you interested. You can't miss a second of the plot otherwise you might not understand everything. I guess that's what most of the negative reviewers did, they just didn't follow attentively. The cast is full of good actors and actresses. Jennifer Lawrence as the main character, one of the sparrows, did a very good job. She's not afraid of a little nudity, and in this movie it was welcome. Matthias Schoenaerts can just play anything you want. I don't think I ever saw a bad movie with him. And I don't say that because I'm also a Belgian.

20,siderite,Misleading marketing campaign for a straight up spy movie,7,28 May 2018,"The movie was good and I think Jennifer Lawrence did a good job as the titular Red Sparrow. However, it was the way the movie was marketed that soured the deal for me. Just after watching the movie, I rewatched the trailer, which arranges random scenes from the film to give the impression of a professional Russian spy doing extraordinary work of seduction, assassination and intrigue. Carefully placed reviews titled ""Is Red Sparrow the Hard R Black Widow?"" and similar get the superhero audience interested and the casting of great, but passee names like Jeremy Irons, Charlotte Rampling, Mary-Louise Parker and Ciarán Hinds, all acting for at most five minutes of the film gets the older generation in the theaters. And for what? A straight up normal person caught in spy games and getting through alive story. So, bottom line: if you like spy movies, it's an acceptable one, but expect two hours and twenty minutes of people blundering through intelligence games that aren't too intelligent in order to push the story to a rather bland ending.

22,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Flashes of a subversive and adult spy thriller are buried beneath a dour, slow and self-serious slog.",6,11 March 2018,"There are flashes of a good, subversive and genuinely adult spy thriller buried beneath a dour layer of incredibly slow, self-serious monotony and it's kind of a shame since the promising ideas, occasional uncomfortable moments and outbursts of painful violence all point to a piece that slots into a gap in the market for a mature, slightly difficult blockbuster of this sort. Unfortunately, 'Red Sparrow (2018)' falls into the trope-laden pitfalls of its genre on multiple occasions and always lets its forced-feeling, yet seemingly obvious, downbeat tone get in the way of its overly long, overly complicated story and that's why it just isn't all that entertaining. That, and the fact that it becomes genuinely boring when it feels like it's been on for far longer than its already stretched 140 minutes. 6/10",Red Sparrow
23,richardchatten,Sexpionage,5,22 February 2021,"Washed up as a ballet dancer, Jennifer Lawrence straight away finds a new vocation as a glamorous chainsmoking spook (her induction conducted by Charlotte Rampling dressed like a concentration camp guard) in this hokum in which hardly anyone ever speaks above a whisper.One suspects a leg pull, but the penchant of Vladimir Putin (who actually appears in the original novel) for flexing his pecs stripped to the waist suggests that maybe it's emphasis on buff torsos rather than espionage isn't too far off the mark after all.",Red Sparrow
24,bowmanblue,La Femme Nikita (in Russia),5,6 March 2018,"I guess there comes a time in everyone's life (or at least the life of an avid film fan!) where you begin to judge films based on whether they're even slightly original or not. 'Red Sparrow' is a prime example of - technically - quite a good film and worth a watch. However, from the point of view where I've seen many various versions of the tale regarding someone who gets forcibly recruited by a secret Government organisation and then made to do X, Y or Z until they can finally break free, there's nothing new here.Jennifer Lawrence does a convincing Russian accent as the lead character, but I felt she was kind of unlikeable and her sick mother was just thrown into the story as a way of trying to show her character's 'softer side.' So, in between killing men who seem to want to attack her on site, she also strikes up a relationship with Joel Edgerton's character. Only they don't really meet on screen until about a third of the way through, so there's little time for them to establish chemistry before they're thrown together as lovers. Then, seemingly by way of counterbalance, some of the other characters we meet early on are basically cast aside and left under-developed.Somewhere in here is a good film, but it feels a bit all over the place in terms of story and pacing. It tries to be dark and gritty during the opening third, then abandons that feel and flits from being 'La Femme Nikita' to something more like 'Fifty Shades of Grey' in other places. I know it goes for the 'dark and gritty' tone, but it ends up taking itself way too seriously. The film is littered with long, lingering shots of J-Law walking slowly towards camera at the beginning of every scene while she stares off into the middle distance beyond the camera. It might have helped the film's overall feel if it was a little lighter here and there with some more 'fun' elements thrown in, making it more of an action movie. Just my take.Maybe if you haven't seen a film like this before you'll like it more than I did. I just got a real sense of de ja vu in terms of cinema where it wasn't bad, just wasn't original enough to be any good and having Jennifer Lawrence as the lead and a few naughty scenes weren't enough to elevate a stale storyline to anything more than an average film.",Red Sparrow
25,ThomasDrufke,Not Black Widow,7,11 March 2018,"A lot of people were making the instant comparison to the Marvel character Black Widow, and by the way the trailers were positioning this movie, I don't really blame them. However, there aren't a whole lot of similarities between the two besides the fact that the names consist of a color and an animal/creature. Red Sparrow is much more in the vein of a pure spy thriller than it is an action/spy/thriller. If I'm not mistaken, Jennifer Lawrence's character, Dominika, never throws a punch, besides one or two in defense. Dominika deploys a far more psychological and seductive approach to her enemies, and it actually ends up working quite well.I know some people questioned Jennifer Lawrence's devotion to the X-Men franchise after she ""mailed in"" her performance in apocalypse. I just don't think there was a whole lot for her to do in that role, but I never questioned her ability to act or her motivation to do so. Well, she undeniably goes for it in Red Sparrow. This isn't a typical role for her, physical and emotionally difficult, all while doing an entirely new accent. However, she makes it look easy and for the most part, leads a thrilling film.I will say, one of the faults of Red Sparrow is a common fault among spy/thriller/mysteries, which is the constant feeling that they need to keep one-upping every scene towards the finale. There are quite a few exciting twists that occur in the last act, but at 2hrs and 20min, it does feel like one too many at a certain point. The film can also get relatively slow at times and while the story is interesting and worth telling, you could make the argument it's more style than substance at times. I was never bored and it isn't exactly what I expected, but it's certainly not something we haven't seen before. That's good enough for me.7.3/10",Red Sparrow
26,MLDinTN,"OK story, but 30 minutes too long",5,15 November 2018,"The biggest problem with this film was it was too long, 30 minutes needed to be cut. There isn't enough action for a 2 hour plus movie. Dominika is a Russian ballerina, whom suffers a career ending injury. She is used by her uncle, a top dog in the Russian spy program, to first eliminate a businessman, and then is sent to Sparrow school. Recruits are taught the art of seduction to extract info from targets. There she is toughened up and eventually receives an assignment to Budapest to get info from an American spy. There is a mole in the Russian government. Throughout this Dominika wants to double cross the Russians so she can defect to America. Her plan doesn't work out, the Russians think she is hiding the mole's name and she is tortured. Then there is a twist at the end, and some how she convinces the Russians her uncle was the spy. So in a prisoner swap, her uncle gets killed, and she returns to the Russians to work as a spy for the Americans. I think?FINAL VERDICT: Film needs to be more fluid.

27,Cineanalyst,Spy Dance,4,27 November 2019,"I'm a bit bemused reading some of the comments for ""Red Sparrow"" heralding it as a deviation from the usual movies to reach theatres these days in the age of franchises, brands, remakes and reboots. I mean, in that respect it is, but, otherwise, it's derivative of the many spy thrillers to come before it. The sort of supposedly-smart, star and character-driven project studios used to make more of, one could say. From James Bond to ""Atomic Blonde"" (2017) or, gasp, Black Widow from the MCU, but with less action and more sex... perhaps, more graphic violence, too. I also don't sympathize with those bemoaning this variation as confusing; if anything, I think it relatively straightforward. Indeed, the twists are thoroughly--probably too much so--explained, and the results are plodding. It's more akin to keeping up with an episode of the ""Hunger Games"" series (three of which included the same director as this movie and, of course, all star Jennifer Lawrence) rather than, say, an espionage narrative from John le Carré. Too easy and not worth it beyond the sexual and violent exploitation.One aspect of the spy games intrigued me, though: the dancing. Lawrence's character is a ballet dancer before becoming a spy. There's a couple overlaps in these careers. Both are performative and both are often related to sex, which itself is a sort of performance act here. There are actors playing actors, and the game involves deciphering where the allegiance of these double agents lie as they dance around the truth. Many spy movies invite such a reading, but the inclusion of ballet here makes it more explicit.",Red Sparrow

32,atlasmb,Strong Acting By Jennifer Lawrence,7,8 July 2020,"Blessed with wonderful cinematography and locations that feel authentic, ""Red Sparrow"" is the story of a Russian ballerina who becomes an operative of the SVR, the Russian counterpart to the CIA. Jennifer Lawrence plays the title role of Dominika, who dances for the Bolshoi until an unfortunate accident. She is recruited for a special program that uses extreme methods to produce super-agents.A central theme is Dominika's enslavement by the entire government system. Perhaps that is why she is so unemotional and calculating; she must always seem to toe the line while trying to manipulate the politics in every situation. Lawrence does a good job portraying the coldness of her character---and she gets extra credit for the accent and the ballet moves---but the emotionally detached nature of her character requires that the film, if it is to move or interest a viewer, must have a story arc that is even more captivating.While the story is interesting, it never rises above the emotional entanglement of a chess match. There is a love story, but the viewer never knows if he is witnessing true feelings or just the manipulations of a skillful agent.For a somewhat similar story that delivers more emotional intensity, I recommend ""La Femme Nikita"".",Red Sparrow
33,tabuno,A refreshing return to a decent and exciting psychological espionage thriller,8,28 January 2019,"Finally, after many years, the audience gets to enjoy a refreshing return to a decent and exciting psychological espionage thriller instead of the typical action spy thriller. Over the last decade, action espionage has taken up most of the spy genre movies including Enemy of the State (1998); Bourne Identity (2002); Expendables (2010); Haywire (2011); Colombiana (2011); Hanna (2011); November Man (2014); Survivor (2015); The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015); Hitman 47 (2015); The Assignment (2016); and Atomic Blonde (2017). To a lesser extent, there have been more off-beat, lighter espionage fare including Wild Target (2010); Daisy & Violet (2011); Miss Meadows (2014); American Ultra (2015); American Assassin (2017). But perhaps not since Robert Redford and Brad Pitt in Spy Game (2001) has there been released on the big screen a thoughtful and intelligent espionage movie as Red Sparrow. Even though the beginning development of the movie doesn't quite match up to the French classic La Femme Nikita (1990) or the American version Point of No Return (1993) with Bridget Fonda and Gabriel Bryne, Red Sparrow gets stronger and stronger with psychological intensity in the fashion of The Ipcress File (1965) with Michael Caine; The Spy Who Came In From the Cold (1965) with Richard Burton; Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979) with Sir Alec Guinness based on the writings of the spy writer extraordinaire John le Carre; The Russia House (1990) with Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer. The cat and mouse game is superbly offered up in Red Sparrow with a great screenplay along with a very satisfying and acceptable resolution with fine performances by Jennifer Lawrence and Joel Edgerton.",Red Sparrow
34,The-Sarkologist,Modern Spy Thriller,7,4 March 2018,"I'm really not all that sure about these spy movies, though I suspect it has something to do with growing up on a staple diet of James Bond and similar films. The thing is that films like Red Sparrow are nothing like what you would expect from James Bond because they aren't action films, they are thrillers - and this is the case here. In fact Red Sparrow is based on a book written by an ex-CIA agent, and actually explores the spy world in a much more realistic way than what the average James Bond junkie would appreciate.
 The film is about a ballet dancer, Dominika, who has an unfortunate accident (which it is suggested wasn't actually an accident), and finds herself recruited into Russian intelligence. She is at first asked to meet with an oligarch, and upon witnessing his murder, is given the option of either being put out of her misery, or joining an elite group known as the 'Sparrows'. She obviously chooses the later, but is appalled to discover that it is, what she terms, little more than a 'school of whores'.
 Like a lot of these films, they tend to have a part where they are at school, and then they go off on a mission, though unlike many of them where the mission seems to be just tacked on at the end, the school is really only setting up the rest of the film where our heroine needs to go and attempt to determine the identity of a mole, or at least somebody who is passing information onto the United States.
 I actually didn't mind the film though, because even though it was a thriller, there was enough action to keep it moving. Obviously we have this element of a dancer finding herself caught up in the world of espionage. The other thing is that this film is set in the modern day, and suggests that very little has changed in Russia since the fall of communism and now. There is reference to an unnamed President, though we all happen to know who he really is. 
 The one thing that stands out is how we have this elegant ballet dancer being thrust into the hard and fast world of espionage. This is clear in the school, where her pride prevents her from simply becoming another object, and it is touch and go at times as to whether she will pass or fail (and failure is generally not an option if you want to have a life that extends beyond your time at the school). I guess there are a number of hints that are dropped throughout the film that point to what ends up happening at the end. I won't go into any further detail though so as not to give anything away.
 I didn't mind it, though as I pointed out, it isn't James Bond. However it does have its fair share of twists and turns, and was intriguing enough to keep me hooked to the point that I didn't even realise that the time was going by as fast as it was. In a way it wasn't what I was expecting, but I probably should pay less attention to the trailers and find a bit more about the film beforehand. However, it was still pretty good, especially if you like your intrigue.",Red Sparrow

36,Thanos_Alfie,Didn't reach its potential...,6,8 March 2019,"""Red Sparrow"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch a very famous ballerina be recruited by 'Sparrow School' a Russian intelligence service. Her main weapon is her body and she has to use it in order to succeed in any mission she has to participate. Her first mission is targeting a C.I.A. agent who has some very important connections in Russia.I liked this movie because it had a very interesting plot and some very intense and action scenes. Despite that, I believe that it didn't reach its potential, due to its duration and mainly because of the direction. Regarding the interpretations, I believe that Jennifer Lawrence who played as Dominika Egorova she was simply amazing and she made a very good performance. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Joel Edgerton's who played as Nate Nash and Matthias Schoenaerts who played as Vanya Egorov. The direction which was made by Francis Lawrence was below average since there wasn't any peak in the movie and despite some plot twists that were making the movie more interesting, the main flow of the movie was being interrupted with boring scenes.To sum up, I have to say that ""Red Sparrow"" is a nice movie to watch with some very good scenes, some interesting plot twists and some very good interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie but first, you have to be prepared for a movie with a long duration and with some boring scenes that will interrupt the action of the movie. If you are prepared for that and you will lower your expectations then I am sure that you are ready to watch it.",Red Sparrow
37,cruise01,Jennifer Lawrence delivered a beautiful stunning performance but the film is slow and forgettable.,6,3 March 2018,"Red Sparrow (3 out of 5 stars).Red Sparrow is a promising spy thriller film. With plenty of twist and turns. A promising performance from Jennifer Lawrence. A sharp direction from Francis Lawrence. But sadly it falls from a slow moving script and a concept that is serious and may be forgotten after watching the film once. Nor is it one of those movies, were you would say you watch it again. Dominika (Jennifer Lawrence) is a Russian Ballerina and after an injury leads her career to a shaky turn for her life's direction. And struggling to keep her mother in medical care. Her uncle (Matthias Schoenaerts) recruits her to a Russian Intelligence school, were she will learn to seduce, extract info, and execute any orders from anyone. After the Russian's learn there must be a mole in their government that is leaking important intel. The pros about the film. Jennifer Lawrence delivered a great performance. Her character was introduced into a world were she has to use her sexuality as a weapon. She was given no choice. Joel Edgerton was also good playing a CIA operative, were Dominika is trying to get information out of him. And he is trying to do the same. But when they both fall for each other, when Dominika realizes he can be her way out of this espionage world. If she helps him. Or does he have his own agenda? It is one of those movies that is entertaining to see these characters work together. But at the same time, leaves you feeling like you can not trust anyone. The direction is sharp. From a director that did the last few Hunger Games movies and Constantine. He created a perfect tone for an espionage thriller, were people are double crossing each other. And it does have a twist that will throw you off completely in the climax scene. The cons of the film. It is slow moving. It is not the typical spy thriller films like James Bond movies or Jason Bourne. It is about a Russian Intelligence spy trying to seduce a CIA operative to giving out information. But he is aware of and is trying to turn the tables around on her. So for any action enthusiasts may be disappointed. There is no car chases, action or fight scenes. Just a few execution kills and a very disturbing torture scene involving a skin graft device that can skin a person. I will have to say the film does lose its pace a lot when it is slow. And definitely one of those movies were you will only watch once and forget about it after it ends. Overall, Red Sparrow is a fair spy thriller. Direction is good to look at. Jennifer Lawrence was great. The concept and story kept you guessing. But it is slow and boring and forgettable.",Red Sparrow
38,zkonedog,Not Sure What's Worse: That I Didn't Get It...Or That I Don't Care To,3,4 March 2018,"After seeing the trailer for ""Red Sparrow"", this looked like the type of movie I could really get into. I'm usually a big fan of Jennifer Lawrence, I like psychological thrillers, and it just seemed to have an air of mystery around it. Sadly, not one of those elements pans out into anything substantial, instead leaving a pretty lifeless void of confusion.For a basic plot summary, ""Red Sparrow"" tells the story of Dominika (Lawrence), a Russian prima ballerina who suffers a catastrophic injury and is forced to basically work for the state in order to keep the payments coming for her mother's medical bills. She is sent to a program to become a ""sparrow"", or a woman who uses every tactic (mostly sexual in nature) to get information out of others. Eventually, Dominika is deemed ready to be put to the test, and her first job is to glean a very important name from American Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton). The catch? Nash is playing her just as quickly as thinks she is playing him. Who will come out on top in the end and get what they want?The first half of this film is incredible dull and ponderous. Lawrence as a dancer is meaningless and adds nothing to the plot, and the ""sparrow training"" section of the film is an absolute joke. Never once was I intrigued by any of that angle, instead viewing it all as filler to just keep the wheels turning and everybody in their proper places.The second half of the movie improves slightly, as there is a little bit of interesting intrigue between Nash & Dominika. Again here, though, the problem is that it all just devolves into a confusing mess of deception and counter-deception, to the point where I was utterly confused as to what it all meant. Too many names, places, dates, and such to keep straight, and none of it was compelling enough to really suck me in and make me care.I was also disappointed in the usage of Lawrence in the film. I feel like, because she played Katniss in ""Hunger Games"", she often is type-cast in kind of these stern, humorless, ""ice queen"" sort of roles. In this movie, she goes long stretches with the same expression on her face, never able to emote. I think she is a very good actress, and I mostly appreciate her in roles like ""Joy"" and ""American Hustle"", where she was actually allowed to smile or emote something other than sternness.A final comment I have is on the use of graphic sexuality in the film. I understand that this was kind of the point of the sparrow school, but at the same time even I felt uncomfortable (and I'm no prude myself) with some of the scenes they portrayed. I think this was mainly because these types of scenes seemed to be just thrust at the audience for the shock value instead of being integrated into the overall proceedings. It just didn't feel right to me.Thus, ""Red Sparrow"" ends up being one of those films where the trailer promises something that the actual film cannot nearly live up to. It takes far too long to really ""get going"", and once it finally does it devolves into a messy, non-consequential spy flick.",Red Sparrow

40,eddie_baggins,A polished but dull thriller,4,23 August 2018,"As a thriller, I Am Legend director Francis Lawrence's Red Sparrow commits the fatal and unrecoverable sin of being boring and uninteresting, where it should've been exciting and nail-bitingly captivating.All the elements are lined up for this Russian set sensually tinged tale of espionage, murder and double-crosses to become a white knuckle affair; one of Hollywood's hottest leading ladies Jennifer Lawrence front and centre, a solid supporting cast led by Joel Edgerton and Matthias Schoenaerts and some potentially pulpy narrative goodies but Red Sparrow over the course of 140 drawn out minutes fails to make the most of the tools at its disposal.Full credit to Lawrence for sticking to his guns in what was clearly a feature he didn't want to have hold back from the darker elements of this very mature themed experience, from violence through to the ample bubbling sensuality, in a product that uses its sexual prowess to drive the story of Lawrence's ex-ballerina turned Russian spy using her charms and wiles to become a weapon for her country but it can't help make Red Sparrow any less of a chore to sit through as we begin to grow increasingly cold towards the films main protagonists and their various mission objectives.Lawrence, who delivers a committed if never fully formed turn as the unfortunate but not overly affable Dominika Egorova try's hard to elevate Red Sparrow's lethargic delivery but it's mostly to no avail and while Francis Lawrence try's hard also to enliven proceedings with the addition of Joel Edgerton's CIA agent and potential love interest Nate Nash and an abundance of brutal and wince-inducing acts of violence, there's little point to it all when Red Sparrow feels so by the numbers and totally devoid of energy or heart.It's a shame, as you do sense that somewhere deep down Red Sparrow had the chance to be something quite different, something fresh in a sub-genre that has become rather unoriginal as a whole but with all its various sprinklings or originality and attempts to act like something it's not, Red Sparrow ends up feeling both overly familiar and high predictable.Final Say - There's a glossy Hollywood sheen to Red Sparrow that makes it a polished but undeniably hollow experience and despite the valiant attempts of its director and leading lady to try and do something different, Red Sparrow ends up being an overlong and increasingly uninteresting experience.2 skin graters out of 5",Red Sparrow
41,leonblackwood,Pretty Boring! 3/10,3,21 August 2018,"Review:
What a boring film! I get the whole espionage plot, and the fact that the main character, Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence), was going through hell for her sick mother but the movie seemed to drag after a while, and the fact that there wasn't any proper action through the whole film, just made it extremely dull and boring. The acting wasn't bad from Jennifer Lawrence and Joel Edgerton but there wasn't any form of character building with the other characters, so I wasn't that bothered if they were dead or not. I was expecting some sort of twist, or a major incident that would pick up the pace a bit but the dull tone that was set from the beginning just carries on straight to the end. Anyway, the film is set in modern-day Russia, were Dominika Egorova is a famous Russian ballerina, who supports her ill mother. While she is performing on stage, her dance partner makes a mistake, which causes her to fall and suffer a career-ending injury. After a severe operation, Dominika is approached by her uncle, Vanya Egorov (Matthias Schoenaerts), the Deputy Director of SVR, who gives her a task to seduce Dimitry Ustinov, a Russian gangster, in exchange for her mother's continued medical care. Dominika manages to seduce Dimitry but when they are in her hotel room, he begins to rape her. Dimitry is then murdered by Sergei Matorin, an SVR operative authorised by Vanya. He then offers Dominika a choice to begin working for SVR, or to be executed so there are no witnesses to Dimitry's death. Meanwhile, Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton) is a CIA agent working in Moscow, and while he is meeting with an asset in Gorky Park, they are confronted by the police. Nash creates a diversion to save his asset, a mole in Russian ranks code-named Marble, and he manages to escape unidentified. Nash is then reassigned to Budapest, where he will regain contact with Marble. Meanwhile, Dominika is sent to a special training school for ""Sparrows"", SVR operatives capable of seducing their targets. Dominika excels her training, after some friction with her trainers, and is assigned to Budapest. SVR has been tracking Nash and hopes to find out the identity of Marble, so they put Dominika on the case, to try and gain his trust to reveal the contact. It doesn't take long for Dominika to make contact with Nash, who correctly determines that she is a Russian intelligence operative. She then reveals her true identity, along with her plans to try and gain information about Marble. After agreeing to work for Nash as a double agent Dominika goes on a mission to retrieve some disks from the chief of staff to a U.S Senator but the mission goes terribly wrong, and she is immediately returned to Moscow, where she is tortured and interrogated for days. She is then returned to Budapest and informs Nash that she wishes to defect to America with her mother. After spending the night with Nash, she wakes up to see him being tortured by Matorin, who wants to know the identity of the mole. Initially, Dominika helps to torture Nash but she turns on Matorin and kills him. She then wakes up in a hospital where General Vladimir Korchnoi (Jeremy Irons) reveals that he is Marble. He fears he will be caught soon, and instead of dying in vain, instructs Dominika to reveal his identity to Vanya. He wants her to replace him as a mole and further their work by passing information to the CIA, so she decides to go ahead with the plan. She then contacts her superiors to reveal the identity of the mole but she frames her uncle Vanya, rather than betraying Korchnoi. He is then shot during a spy swap and Dominika is congratulated for her work by her Russian superiors. So basically nothing exciting happens! As the audience know every step of the plot, there isn't any suspense to keep the movie interesting. Your basic source of entertainment is if she gets caught or not, which becomes a bit tedious after a while because she keeps on defecting from one side to the other. I also found the relationship with the uncle a bit strange because he acted like he really loved her and he wanted the best for her and her mother but he didn't mind her getting tortured half to death, or sleeping with anyone for the great of the country. WEIRD! The only good thing in the film was Joel Edgerton, who was basically protecting his mole right from the beginning, so his role was pretty straightforward. Anyway, from an entertainment point of view, it definitely gets the thumbs down but from an authentic point of view, in terms of the cinematography and the costume design, especially during the ballet, it wasn't that bad. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Francis Lawrence. no relation, who also brought you Constantine, starring Keanu Reeves, I Am Legend starring Will Smith, Water For Elephants and The Hunger Games franchise. He has also directed many music videos for various artists, like Aerosmith, Fugees, Jennifer Lopez, Whitney Houston, Destiny Child, Green Day, Janet Jackson, Britney Spears and many others, so he has a lot of experience behind the camera. With the success of the Hunger Games franchise, it's not surprising that he thought that this role was perfect for Jennifer Lawrence but he spent most of the time concentrating on her role, rather than character building with the rest of the cast. I know that this movie was adapted from a popular book, so he was trying to stay true to the original story but from an audience point of view the script could have done with some more excitement, and it really didn't have to be over 2 hours long. I also found the ending quite abrupt but on the plus side, the ballet scene was pretty impressive, especially as Jennifer Lawrence done a lot of the scenes herself. Anyway, I wasn't a big fan of the movie but I can appreciate the amount of work that went into making it look authentic.Budget: $69million

42,TheMovieDiorama,Red Sparrow occasionally dances elegantly but ultimately falls from grace.,6,9 March 2018,"When we talk about the spy genre, most of us will shout ""Bond. James Bond."" in your best Sean Connery impression. In reality, and most certainly in my opinion, some of the best spy films are those that focus on espionage. For instance, the John Le Carré adaptations bathed in its dialogue as opposed to action. Red Sparrow attempts to replicate that. A famed ballerina encounters a career-ending injury who is then approached by her powerful uncle who eventually transforms her into a 'Sparrow' (not literally...). Russian operatives capable of seducing their targets, to which one of them being a CIA operative. It's cold, moody and revels in backstabbing and double-crossing, two intricately explored traits of the spy genre. Full credit to Jennifer Lawrence who gives yet another committed performance, using her sexuality and serious acting talent to deliver the goods. The Sparrow School segment was intrusively interesting, Charlotte Rampling was ominous and brainwashes her pupils with such ferocity. Those scenes and the interrogations surprisingly raised the tension. Whilst I was never bored and thought the pacing was decent, I left the cinema disappointed. A character-driven story that presents no characters worth investing in. The constant need to purposefully put on Russian accents was a detriment to the outstanding talent on screen, as if these actors couldn't multi-task. The dialogue is rarely intelligent and injects no personality into these characters. The consequence of turning an espionage thriller into a mainstream blockbuster is that it sacrifices an intelligent story so that the average viewer can understand the plot, thus subjugating to monotony. The 140 minute runtime didn't bother me, and fortunately the third act elevates the much needed tension with a few twists and turns but ultimately I remained underwhelmed. I appreciate the acting, the daring sexual violence and the cold atmosphere, yet a bland story with minimal characterisation prevents an engrossing thriller. I just wanted more...",Red Sparrow
43,digitalbeachbum,Another stupid movie from Hollywood,1,10 February 2019,"This is a good example of a movie which is not as good as the book; and the book wasn't any good either.There is no suspense. There is no thrill. The characters are flat and unrealistic. The Russian characters lack any life. Every scene was long, boring and predictable.The only good thing about this movie is the ending, which doesn't come quickly and causes a slow and painful death.And Jennifer Lawrence is over rated and over paid as an actress.",Red Sparrow
44,matthewssilverhammer,Ugly Inside and Out,3,10 March 2018,"The last time the Lawrences (Jennifer and Francis) got together, they were headlining YA phenomenon Hunger Games. With more sex, more violence, and more sexual violence, they have moved far away from those better days with Red Sparrow. On the surface, there are tons of problems: interminable length, bad accents, dumb filmmaking logic (why do the Russians keep speaking English?!), bland visuals, and just a general grossness. And as ugly as the movie is on the outside, it's even uglier inside.
Lawrence plays a Russian ballet dancer who joins a secret Russian spy agency that teaches young people to use whatever necessary (sex specifically) to help overcome the Kremlin's enemies. It's an intriguing enough premise I guess, as we're plunged into a dystopian-type underworld. And Lawrence's dancing is super impressive, yet sadly it's short-lived. What follows is a barrage of names, countries and agencies, all with different intentions and backgrounds, and none of which are memorable from scene-to-scene. Instead, we're stuck wondering how we're expected to buy any of what's happening, with a protagonist we know really know nothing about. Her sudden superspy abilities are so perfect she may as well have been Keanu Reeves plugged into the Matrix, instantaneously learning kung fu. 
The character psychology would be laughably inept if it weren't so frustratingly troubling. Sexual abuse and manipulation occur regularly for this woman, and yet there's is little reality in how this affects her in the story. Given the current (and far-too-late) climate we're in right now, this willing ignorance about gender and sexual power dynamics isn't just bad storytelling, it's inappropriate. To no end or purpose, Red Sparrow drips of ill-advised cynicism.",Red Sparrow
45,southdavid,Niet Out Of Ten.,4,13 March 2018,"Ousted from the Bolshoi and in desperate need of money to look after her sick mother, Dominika , is dragged into a world of international espionage by her uncle. Showing an aptitude for the work, she is sent to Russia's Sparrow program, which teaches recruits to honey trap potential targets. She is sent to retrieve information from Nate (Joel Edgerton) regarding a high ranking turncoat in the Russian government. However, when Nate offers her a chance to get herself and her mother out of Russia she agrees, but with the stakes so high, where do her allegiances really lie. The trouble with ""Red Sparrow"" is that though competently shot and edited, it neither has enough to say to be an ""issues"" film nor enjoyable enough to be considered ""entertainment"". In fact, it can be a brutal slog at times, with Jennifer Lawerence's Dominika seriously injured in the opening scene, surviving multiple rape attempts and enduring several other scenes of humiliation and torture. Further compounding the films problems is the fact that the plot is well worn material. Aside from the fact that all espionage films use the ""who can you trust double triple cross"" trope, last years ""Atomic Blonde"", not great itself, covered similar ground to a better effect, and the TV show ""The Americans"" has covered the sparrow program and the whole Russian Spy experience with greater depth and merit. The films failure at the box office has left some pointing the finger at Lawrence herself as not being a box office draw. This seems harsh to me, as the films failing go way beyond her and her occasionally hilarious Natasha from Rocky and Bullwinkle Russian accent. I hope it doesn't discourage her from taking varied roles in the future.",Red Sparrow
46,imseeg,Way better than I expected...,8,26 October 2021,"I had read so many reviews giving average or below average ratings, that I honestly thought this movie would be a bummer. NOT SO...The good: excellent direction with subtle and gorgeous photography. And a terrific sound score by the magnificent James Newton Howard. More good: wonderfully balanced editing, almost like in a dance. Every other scene flows ever so naturally into the next one. I usually never pay much attention to editing, but when a movie is edited right, it really strengthens the power of the rythm of a movie.More good: this story has got massive amounts of suspense. And it sparks! And it thrills. And it has drama, real true to life drama. 2 hours and 20 minutes flew by in a riveting woosh.Even more good: excellent acting performances by all the actors involved. Jennifer Lawrence really does shine in her role, with a really fabulous acting performance. Terrific actors chemistry.Not any bad? The story is a bit farfetched now and then. But so are many other spy movies. Let's say I dont give it a 10 for credibility, although I certainly did not think it was in any way silly.More bad: There is quite a lot of nudity and some of these nude scenes are so cliche and worn out, that I wonder why they even choose to put these nude scenes in. Jennifer does look stunning though, that must be said...Beware:there are also quite a few horribly, gruesome violent scenes, so this is definitely not a casual spy movie like James Bond and the likes. No jokes here. Serious heavy stuff with 2 torture scenes I had to skip because I found them to be too gruesome,so you have been warned...The story: Jenifer Lawrence plays a Russian ballet dancer and she is extorted to become a spy or face death if she doesnt comply. Will she be able to survive the horrors of her ruthless masters?",Red Sparrow
47,Vartiainen,Mediocre spy thriller,6,13 May 2018,"Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) is a talented Russian ballet dancer, who suffers a crippling injury during a performance and is rendered unable to continue her career. Her uncle, who works for Soviet intelligence, arranges for her to enter a highly sensitive program meant to train spies specializing in seduction.The director Francis Lawrence is most well-known for The Hunger Games movie franchise, and it has to be admitted that the strengths of those films shine through here as well. The cinematography is very good and the film looks great in general. He also pulled in Jennifer Lawrence, who once again gives a praiseworthy performance. The character of Dominika can go from showing strength and resolve to showing extreme vulnerability, and it all works thank to her acting chops.Unfortunately the script itself just doesn't have that something to truly shine. It feels convoluted, disorganized and, in general, a mess. For example, a lot of the trailers and marketing focused on this spy school where they trained these seductresses. In the film that's barely a fifth of the film. Granted, the studio and the marketing people are mostly to blame, but the film as a whole feels like that. It has clear, defined segments, most of them actually pretty interesting, but they're not joined together properly.Nevertheless, Jennifer Lawrence and Joel Edgerton are both great as the two leads, the film definitely does not pull its punches and some of the individual scenes are very, very good. As a whole it's barely average, but there are good things in it.",Red Sparrow
48,paul-allaer,"""Every person is a human puzzle of need""",6,4 March 2018,"""Red Sparrow"" (2018 release; 139 min.) brings the story of Dominika. As the movie opens, Dominika cares for her ailing mother, and then, while dancing ballet at the Bolshoi suffers a brutal leg injury (accident? or not?). We then go the ""3 Months Later"", when Dominika is forced by her uncle, the Vice Deputy of Security, to go to training school for sparrows (in return for which her ailing mom receives medical care). Sparrows are used by Russia to compromise enemies of the state in any way possible. ""Every person is a human puzzle of need"", they are taught. Dominika is tasked with finding a mole high up in the Russian government... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie marks the reunion of director Francis Lawrence and actress Jennifer Lawrence, who made 3 of the 4 Hunger Games movies before. Here they go a very different direction, namely an ol' fashioned spy thriller drama, as if we're back in the Cold War (and maybe we actually are). The movie is very plot-driven and, I must admit, quite convoluted, so pay attention! even then, there's a good chance you'll get lost during some parts along the way. Lawrence truly takes the movie on her shoulders, appearing in virtually all scenes, and no-one is going to out-tough Jennifer Lawrence! Speaking of Jennifer which: there are several extended torture scenes that are just brutal (I had to look away more than once). Besides Jennifer Lawrence, the movie also benefits from the performance of Belgium's Matthias Schoenaerts, in the role of the sinister no-good uncle. Charlotte Rampling equally delights in her small role as the sparrows teacher/trainer. The movie's production set is first class all the way, with Hungary standing in for Russia, and extended scenes in London and Vienna as well. Last but certainly not least, there is a warm orchestral score that plays prominently in the movie, courtesy of veteran composer James Newton Howard.""Red Sparrow"" opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was pretty much sold out, which is of course normal for a movie of this stature just opening. Whether it will have staying power, only time will tell. If you are a fan of a good spy story (even it it's a bit convoluted), or a fan of Jennifer Lawrence, you'll want to check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",Red Sparrow
49,Turfseer,"Despite some over-the-top violence, neat twist ending exposes Russian old wine in flashy new bottle",6,6 March 2018,"What is there to say about Red Sparrow? It's a solid mystery-thriller with good acting and a plot that keeps your interest. Nonetheless, when all is said and done, the characters don't exactly jump off the screen at you. You could say they're a little more than just one-dimensional but if there is any reason why you might watch this a second time, it would be to mainly confirm some of the more complicated plot points you might have missed.Yes it's set in Russia and it's worth watching just to catch a glimpse of the protagonist, Dominika Egorova, played by the most alluring Jennifer Lawrence, who certainly keeps her body in tip top shape which will certainly be appreciated by most men who are no longer pre-pubescent. Dominika is an expert Bolshoi ballerina whose career comes to an abrupt end when a fellow dancer accidentally crashes into her during a performance, smashing her kneecap. All her perks will be lost (she'll lose her apartment) and no longer afford to financially provide for her infirm mother, so she's approached by her sleazy Uncle Ivan (played by Matthias Schoenaerts, a dead ringer for Putin), who is high up in the Russian Intelligence Service--Ivan wants Dominika to seduce a powerful politician, Dimitry Ustinov, and replace his phone provided by the Intelligence service. Things go awry when Ustinov attempts to rape Dominika and then one of the Intelligence Service's professional killers enters their hotel room and promptly strangles him to death.With no witnesses permissible, Ivan doesn't give his niece much of a choice-death or join the service! Off Dominika goes to the special sparrow school where operatives are trained to do dirty work for Mother Russia! If you are faint of heart, then you might want to close your eyes in the scenes where Dominika undergoes her training (that includes forcing trainees to perform sex acts in front of the class).The plot picks up when Dominka is sent to Budapest to try and discover who the mole is (code dame: Marble) in the Russian Intelligence Service who has been passing secrets to the Americans. Specifically, Dominka must gain the trust of Nate Nash, the good guy CIA agent, played by Joel Edgerton (who most critics agree has no chemistry with Jennifer Lawrence).It was a little difficult following what happens next, but Domnika's roommate, Marta, another Sparrow, has been assigned to pay money for secrets from Stephanie Boucher, a chief of staff for a US Senator. I'm not exactly sure why, but Dominika butts in on Marta's case, arranges to negotiate with Boucher but soon Marta ends up dead at the hands of Simyonov (the same guy who strangled Ustinov the politicoan), followed by Boucher's accidental death--hit by a truck--and then Dominka's forced return to Moscow, where she is promptly tortured for blowing the Boucher case.Somehow Dominika convinces her superiors that because she refused to reveal secrets under torture, the CIA would accept her as a believable turncoat, so she's promptly returned to Budapest, only to find Simyonov attempting to kill Nate by skinning him alive with some kind of electric blade (again, for all squeamish filmgoers, please close your eyes if don't care to watch such unpleasant scenes!). Fortunately for Nate, Dominka turns on the sadistic Simyonov and dispatches him after a protracted fight on the kitchen floor.Red Sparrow might lose a few points here and there for reveling in all the violence, but the twist ending saves it from ending up in cinematic purgatory. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. Dominka finds out who the mole is-a bigwig in the Intelligence Service-who urges her to save herself by turning him in. But instead, she frames good old Uncle Ivan, and he's shot down on the airport tarmac during a prisoner swap, with Dominika returning to Mother Russia, now hailed as a hero and able to take care of her mother, which was her number one goal in the first place!If you can stand all the over-the-top sex and violence, Red Sparrow is actually quite watchable, with solid performances from all the principals, and a twist ending that ties everything up quite nicely. Oh did I mention why Uncle Ivan must get his comeuppance at film's end? It's implied he molested Dominika when she was a child-a fitting end for the neo-apparatchik, symbolic of the new Russia, the same old wine in a flashy new bottle.",Red Sparrow
50,stevendbeard,Slow & Not Much Action,6,3 March 2018,"I saw ""Red Sparrow"", starring Jennifer Lawrence-the X-Men movies, The Beaver; Joel Edgerton-Zero Dark Thirty, The Thing_2011; Charlotte Rampling-Hannah, Assassin's Creed and Jeremy Irons-Justice League, Die Hard With a Vengeance.
This is a spy movie that is based on a 2013 novel-of the same name-that was written by Jason Matthews, a retired C.I.A. operative. It's also part of a trilogy, but hopefully, there won't be anymore of these suckers. Unless, they are a lot better than this one. Jennifer plays a Russian ballet dancer that has her promising career cut short by a fellow dancer-don't worry, he gets his comeuppance. Jennifer's uncle is in the SVR-a Russian government agency-and he gets her a job in the Sparrow program. Charlotte runs the school that teaches Sparrows how to use their bodies and minds-but mostly their bodies-in the art of espionage. Jennifer begrudgingly goes into the program because her mother is sick and needs the medical benefits, since Jennifer can no longer dance. Her first mission is Joel, an American C.I.A. operative working in Russia. Joel has a mole that is in Russian security and the Russians are not too happy about it. Jeremy plays a high ranking Russian official that wants results from Jennifer. There are lots of twists and turns, where you don't know who to trust, as far as how their allegiances are concerned, but it just didn't do it for me. And I love spy movies-James Bond being my favorite-but if you want to see a good spy movie with a female lead, then watch 'Atomic Blonde' with Charlize Theron. FYI: Jennifer does have several nude scenes but the rest of the movie was slow with not much action.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, torture, language and sexual content-including nudity of both males & females-and has a running time of 2 hours & 19 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you really want to see it, I guess it would be alright, as a rental-the nude scenes of Jennifer might be the drawing point for the men.",Red Sparrow

Thereafter it gets quite complicated.Good to see another 'cold war' thriller (there just aren't enough) and with plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing. Lawrence is convincing as the Russian 'Sparrow' in very much a star vehicle for her - she's rarely off the screen, which in some ways diverts away too much from an interesting supporting cast (Rampling, Hinds etc). It feels a bit too long, although initially rushes through the opening / training scenes so it can get on with the core plot.So quite a good thriller, nicely complicated, often unpleasant and with a satisfying conclusion.One real gripe, every time Lawrence gets beaten up, she applies this magic make up which removes all bruises and cuts in a second so she can continue to look stunning in the next scene - silly.",Red Sparrow

59,kluseba,"Good for what it is, no more, no less",7,6 March 2018,"The idea behind Red Sparrow is everything but new. The idea of an innocent girl from a poor background who gets transformed into a machine using its body, intellect and strength as weapons has already been portrayed in the heavily underrated and quite emotional Naked Weapon or more recently in the quite brutal and sinister The Villainess. The movie also offers the usual stereotypes that are sadly still persistent in the twenty-first century. The evil Russian are still stuck in the Cold War while the good Americans try to help everyone and promote positive values. Women are treated like pieces of meat in the film and constantly seen as sexual objects by men. Even the American protagonist who is supposedly not like the other men ends up sleeping with the film's heroine on their second encounter at his apartment. If it were that easy to pick up girls in the real world, my friends certainly wouldn't be singles. Remember the final two movies of the Hunger Games franchise when Jennifer Lawrence was either being hysterical or crying throughout half of those films? That's pretty much also the case here. Half of the movie either shows her naked, how she gets beaten up by men or how she cries. Sometimes she does all these things at the same time which is quite tiring.Despite the weak story, those annoying stereotypes and predictable character traits, Red Sparrow is still an overall enjoyable film. First of all, one must admit that Jennifer Lawrence makes the best out of the plot and is actually quite credible as tough young woman with a fragile side. The film has a quite gloomy atmosphere that brings the spirit of the Cold War back to life with lots of shady conspiracies. The story is tense and offers some rewarding minor twists towards the end. The action scenes are brief but intense and quite realistic as they even silenced the teenagers stuck on their cell phones at the cinema. The locations in Vienna, Moscow, London and Budapest are also nicely chosen. Instead of showing us beautiful monuments like so many other movies do, the film shows us glamorous hotel rooms as opposed to cold bunkers, rich banks as opposed to poorly equipped apartments and isolated mansions in snowy landscapes as opposed to crowded airports.To keep it simple, if you like tense spy movies, you are going to be entertained by Red Sparrow. It might not reinvent the genre but it's well-executed, has an intriguing story and the acting performances are above average. If you like this film, you should also check out Naked Weapon and The Villainess. In this movie, Russia is behind but in cinema, America is behind these days. Red Sparrow isn't a movie that will be featured in many top lists by the end of the year but it is good for what it is. I will give it a very generous seven points.",Red Sparrow

Her creepy uncle Ivan (Matthias Schoenaerts), a senior SVR (Russian Foreign Intelligence) officer provides her with evidence showing it was no accident and she use a golf club to beat the crap out of those responsible. Her uncle then coerces her into seducing an oligarch, using medical treatment for her mother and retention of their large apartment as an inducement. The seduction actually results in assassination and she is given the choice of death or training as a Red Sparrow, SVR General Korchnoi (Jeremy Irons) would prefer to liquidate her.Red Sparrows (male and female) are SVR Special Forces who concentrate on seduction but are trained in all aspects of spycraft including assassination. The headmistress of their training school is ""Matron"" (Charlotte Rampling). Dominika graduates from the scholl after some misadventures and is posted to Budapest. Her assignment is to seduce CIA Agent Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton) and to get him to reveal his secret contact in the SVR. But they fall in love or do they? A game of smoke and mirrors ensues and the truth provides ever more difficult to perceive.This is a story of secret histories where the Cold War never ended and KGB style spy/assassin academies continue to exist. There is an ethic of service and loyalty to the State which is equivalent to that of the old days of the USSR. Actually it's almost as if things never changed, to Korchnoi and Matron defence of the Russian Motherland appears to be their raison d'être.Lawrence, Edgerton, Schoenaerts are convincing in their roles but Irons seems to be just there for the paycheck. Lawrence in particular shines as she has to suffer indignations during her training but is never the victim, when she is attacked in a shower she rips a lever off and batters her assailant with it. She later undergoes torture which shows a tad more than what is necessary. Another torture scene involving Edgerton makes you think you've seen more than you actually have, similar to the ""ear cutting"" scene in Reservoir Dogs. But these scenes are of short duration.Director Francis Lawrence has put together an effective spy thriller but at times the script by Justin Haythe is confusing. The film could also have lost 19 of its 139 minute running (especially most of the the torture scenes). It has received mixed reviews but then so did La Femme Nikita when it was first released.

62,3xHCCH,Modern-Day Matahari,6,2 March 2018,"Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) was a prima ballerina of the Bolshoi Ballet until a freak accident forced her out of her rising career due to injury. Desperate to be able to keep supporting her ill mother (Joely Richardson), Dominika accepted the sketchy offer of her very own uncle Vanya Egorov (Matthias Schoenaerts), a highly-placed Russian spy official, to help them lure a certain subject for an extra-judicial execution. She was sent to an academy for Sparrows under the tutelage of the ""Matron"" (Charlotte Rampling). This was a training ground for select agents who would use their looks and bodies to seduce required information out of targets. Her first case was to make contact with an American agent Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton), and coax out of him the identity of the Russian mole he was protecting. The film is a long one, 140 minutes -- more than two hours. It took its time to establish Dominika's back story in the first act. It devoted a lot of scenes of her Sparrow training, and these were some of the most interesting, controversial and sensational parts of the film. The rest of the film would be standard double-crossing spy dramatics we are more familiar with, a femme fatale spy is one of the oldest tricks in the book. However, not without some unexpected nifty twists of its own.Jennifer Lawrence finally conquered her fear to do film nudity in one very bold scene in front of a room of people, as she taunted a fellow trainee Nikolai (Makar Zaporozhskiy) to have sex with her. I was expecting bone-crushing fight scenes like those we saw in other female spy films like ""Salt"" or ""Atomic Blonde"" but there was not much of that here. That does not mean though that this was short on painfully gruesome torture scenes -- both inflicted on, and inflicted by, JLaw. She felt really ice cold here, not easy for us to connect with.Joel Edgerton played an unconventional movie spy -- a one-dimensional good guy. There was never a point where you felt Nash would do anything bad to Dominika. Funny how the men (not JLaw) kept on referring to him as handsome, like we need to be convinced. On the other hand, I was more impressed with the characterization of Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts of Dominika's Uncle Vanya. You knew the character was bad news, but the actor tries to give him some layers to make that final scene worth your while. Jeremy Irons looked miscast as the Russian General Korchnoi. I wish Charlotte Rampling had more to do in the film than in only in those training center scenes. I was hoping that she and/or any of her classmates would figure in actual action somewhere else in the film, but there would be none of that. Mary Louise Parker was as quirky (and spaced out) as ever as Stephanie Boucher, the chief of staff to a US senator who was not averse to sharing secret data with her lesbian lover who turned out to be another Sparrow Marta (Thekla Reuten). The storytelling of director Francis Lawrence (best known for having directed JLaw in three out of the four ""Hunger Games"" films) was not complicated and engaging, but may have occasional drag in certain points in Act 2. It sort of felt like a ""Mission Impossible"" the way the elements of the complex scheme all fell neatly into place. I think there could have been a more deeply psychological exploration of sexual espionage, as that was its main selling point. The Sparrow academy part could actually have been a whole film in itself, but here, it barely scratched the surface of its cinematic potential. 6/10.",Red Sparrow

Cops arrive, one of guys fires a weapon, the other guys makes a run for it.Then we meet a ballet dancer who suffers a ridiculous on-stage accident and ends up in crutches. That means, unsurprisingly, the end of career, at least for a while. The girl takes care of her ill mother. Her uncle is the #2 at the Russian intelligence service. He announces that the theater has found a replacement for her. This is somehow presented ominously. He also offers her a job at the government since he thinks she's particularly bright. Since she does well at her first unofficial assignment she gets an official spot. But first he has to undergo spy training, a special kind of training, mainly psychology and sex. Even though she pretty much refuses to participate in any practical training, sort of outwitting everyone else to avoid actually doing anything, she does graduate and now is officially a Sparrow. Her sole job in Hungary is to go after an American spy to discover a mole in Russian intelligence. Turns out the intro involved these two characters, the American who shot his gun to allow the mole to escape. Sparrow and the CIA spy meet, and right away they drop the pretenses. He thinks he can recruit her. But she reports to the wicked Russian station chief in Hungary and lives with a fellow Sparrow who has turned the chief of staff of a US Senator. The CIA guy and our sparrow start a romantic relationship, or do they? She doesn't make much progress when it comes to the mole so the Russians become suspicious. But they are no match for the little girl. She seems to be playing both side because all she cares about is her mother. When sparrow and CIA guy end up in the hospital the mole reveals himself to her (!?) and asks her to take his place in Russian intelligence. By now her plan, which is something of a revenge plan, is in motion. She never forgave her uncle because her first unofficial task involved her getting penetrated by her target.Red Sparrow too politicized a spy thriller. You have the evil Putin-lookalike Russian spy chief, the sweet and innocent American spy who falls for the girl and wants to rescue her from the clutches of the evil Russians. The sparrow school is presented as some sinister perverse affair, when using love and sex are probably the most harmless ways for spies to get what they want. The mole's motivation for being a mole are ludicrous and sound like something written by a neocon. Our newbie sparrow operates in god mode, predicting and setting things in motion long before she could have known a thing, outsmarting the entire Russian intelligence apparatus. Lawrence's performance is stiffer than a Scarlett Johansson alien/robot role. It's not hard to make Lawrence look attractive but for some reason they didn't even bother here. And somehow we are supposed to root for her, even though she lets both her country and her family down, to put it mildly. Spy movies tend to be exciting and this one had potential but the excessive length, political correctness, and establishment-approved predictability made this movie far worse than it needed to be.",Red Sparrow
64,s3276169,Red Turkey....,1,25 April 2018,"There is so much to dislike here I'm not sure where to begin. Modern Russia is apparently trapped in the 1960's with austere, brutalist architecture the norm. Poor Jennifer Lawrence is a down trodden ballerina in the Tolstoy ballet. She and her dear old ailing mum live in a tiny box of a apartment that, for all anyone knows, could be something they inherited from Lenin's grandma. Worse still her nasty old uncle who looks a bit like a certain Russian politician has wicked plans for her as a cold blooded spy for the state. If this isn't enough to have you chortling with laughter and wondering if in fact the whole thing is bad satire, then to be honest I'm not sure what will. To drive this turkey of a film to even lower levels of banality is trite, bland narrative, tedious and stereotypical characterisations, repugnant sexual innuendo and a plot so emaciated it would not look out of place on a French catwalk. Are there any redeeming qualities on offer here? Well there's an absurdly good cast in what is an absurdly bad film and the action scenes are reasonable but that's as much as I can muster that's remotely positive. If you like political espionage style thriller's my advice watch the series The Americans, its everything Red Sparrow aspires to be but isn't. 1/10 from me.",Red Sparrow
65,dierregi,Better than I expected,6,25 February 2021,"There are two types of spy stories: the totally unrealistic, fast moving, glamourised ""à la"" James Bond and the slower, more realistic ones. This film belongs to the second category, while main character Dominka, perhaps would fit better in the first, being a big, attractive, young blonde.Obviously, your appreciation of this movie depends on your preferred style. A large part of the audience would definitely prefer the cheap thrills of a violent, fast and furious travelogue with an invincible hero bedding everybody (we live in equal opportunities times, very soon even Bond will be bisexual 😉)I prefer the second type, even if I find slightly boring most movies based on Le Carré novels. But we're not in ""Tinker, tailor"" territory because Lawrence is too young and beautiful to disappear in the background like a good spy should (except the ""Sparrows"" of course).Spies should not attract too much attention for obvious reasons. In this case there is a reasonable compromise between the too flashy appearance of the lead character and the miserable, dreary and dangerous daily life of spies. Expect also a considerable degree of gore, because of a torture instrument I'd never seen before and hope never to see again.",Red Sparrow

During Red Sparrow, Jennifer Lawrence's Russian espionage thriller, I first checked my phone at about the forty-five minute mark, and again around an hour and a half in... and then even a few more times before the movie finally ended. When the credits rolled, I gave a sigh of relief, stood up, left the theater, and didn't think any more about this film until now, when I sat down to write a review for it.

69,robertemerald,Solid spy drama,8,18 May 2019,"Red Sparrow is reasonably gripping although it had the irritating habit of awarding Jennifer Lawrence innumerable get out of gaol free cards. I guess that's implied in the story, as she certainly has some aces up her sleeve that the story made clear. However it wouldn't have hurt the timeline not to have her so fast-tracked, or make better connection between the training and the ultimate deceptions. That's a splitting hairs criticism, but it was certainly something that held me back from full belief in the plot. I liked the violence in this movie. It was well-placed and tastefully done (real) which helped with authenticity. I enjoyed the professionalism brought to this movie by the major stars (great casting) and the way it brilliantly tied the former ballet star with soundtrack strings to the subsequent drama and action. That underlying premise was really well done and worked a treat. If you are a fan of John Le Carre then this movie, despite set in our modern day, is more of the Smiley style of thriller than perhaps his Bourne books. Red Sparrow is not a super-action winner, and it's with a certain satisfaction that the heroine here possibly believes she is, but is confounded by reality in that regard. The framing of the shots and the editing were top notch too, ensuring we stay involved even at the duller moments. I have to admit it, it's a great movie and a welcome addition to the spy genre.",Red Sparrow

71,jadepietro,Anemic Blonde,4,8 March 2018,"GRADE: C- THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Except for a strong performance by Jennifer Lawrence, this is one of the worst spy films ever.JIM'S REVIEW: Did any of you moviegoers out there happen to see last year's espionage thriller, Atomic Blonde? It told the story of a seductive female spy using her martial skills and sexuality as a lethal weapon to combat enemy agents. At least, that film was high energy and stylishly filmed. Red Sparrow follows that same not-so-secret formula, with more talk violence, and sex to tell its predictable story. Perhaps a better alias might have been Code Name: Anemic Blonde, as this film version may follow the same course of events, but it's a real yawn-fest. You know, the standard double crosses and fight sequences are intact and expected in this genre. The story goes something like this: Dominika Egorova, a premier ballerina for the Kirov Ballet, is unexpectedly forced to change jobs in order to support her ailing mother. (Are there any other types in Russia?) Dom is blackmailed to become a master spy by her evil Uncle Vanya (no relation to Chekov, although it could have used his creative talents). So it's off to Sparrow School or ""whore school"" for some in-depth training . Our little minx is taught how to be a successful spy in seven easy lessons that include sexual humiliation, rape, and violent charades. The film meanders and takes its time indoctrinating our heroine with the art of the spy prior to her mission as she is trained to use her body a tad more than her mind. After graduating the top in her class (or bottom, she's not fussy, the state owns her body now), Dom is send by the KGB to go on a mission to seduce a CIA agent and assess some sort of file...who knows, who cares. There are so many double crosses, amid violent scenes of gore and torture, that the film loses any shred of credibility. Red Sparrow does boast a fine performance by Jennifer Lawrence. She uses her Natasha Fatale accent quite well and makes a convincing anti-hero, even if the Tonya Harding bangs are a bit much. Too bad the actress is written as a mere sexual toy by Justin Haythe who is more interested in creating clever ways to depict gratuitous nudity (mostly Ms. Lawrence and some refreshing male frontal shots) and shocking violence in its frequent torture scenes to tell its tale. Oh, the mission...something about finding a mole. The plot grew very confusing and more convoluted as the film progressed. All the sinister talk and pointless exposition was tedious and under developed. By the midpoint of the movie, in my mind, this spy's license to kill was revoked and reissued as a license to bore. The sluggish script introduces some sketchy stock characters, then they disappear, only to return later for no apparent reason. Their motives made no sense and their allegiances shifted throughout the movie as par for the course in these espionage thrillers. The jerky story structure goes global from one scenic European city to the next with occasional stops in Russia, but everything seemed off kilter as did some anachronistic props that had this reviewer questioning the time period of the story at one point (floppy discs?) Francis Lawrence (no relation to Ms. Lawrence, although it could have used her creative talents) does a sub-par job at directing, building no suspense at all. To keep the moviegoing audience awake, he throws in location sights to add authenticity while objectifying Ms. Lawrence in every conceivable nude scene in the most voyeuristic way. He also prolongs the torture sequences with a graphic glee. It is a exploitive cinematic step backwards.Except for Ms. Lawrence, the acting was disappointing, especially coming from a talented cast that included: Charlotte Rampling, Mary-Louise Parker, Claran Hinds, Bill Camp, Douglas Hodge, and Jeremy Irons. Matthias Schoenaerts is the villainous uncle and he overplays the part. No animals may have been killed in the making of this movie, but the Russian accents were certainly mangled. Except for Ms. Lawrence's consistent diction, nothing else was remotely believable. 
 
Joel Edgerton is Dominika's love interest, Nate Nash, a perfect name for a comic book superhero, but merely unintentionally comic as played by this usually reliable actor. The chemistry between Ms. Lawrence and a miscast charmless Mr. Eggerton is non-existent. Red Sparrow is for the birds.",Red Sparrow
72,rgkarim,"Come Spy With Me, Let's Spy, Let's Spy Away",8,3 March 2018,"Jennifer Lawrence, a chameleon in many forms as to what role she will play and how well she will act in it. What is never questionable though, is that it will often involve some type of edge, with some anger thrown into the mix. And this weekend, yet another film for her to exercise her emotions is back in the form of Red Sparrow, the latest spy thriller to sneak into the theaters. The movie promises to be the same intense dynamics, perhaps with a little sexiness thrown in. Does the movie have the same fire that it's lead actress has, or is it another flop? Robbie K happy to help you out with another movie decision with yet another review. Let's get started: LIKES: Costumes: In a spy movie of such caliber, you are hoping that the costumes are going to be chic, sexy, and feel like the super spy role. Red Sparrow's costumes are worthy of the mantle of high fashion, being pleasant on the eyes and fitting so well with the roles given to Ms. Lawrence. They add a nice flare to the movie, being utilized to sell her cover and infiltrate the secrets held within all parties, and in such a subtle way as that. It's a small like, but one that warrants appreciation. The Strong Woman Character: If it's a Jennifer Lawrence role, it's going to involve a strong female role and Red Sparrow is again no exception to the movement of strong female characters. Dominika has many layers, all built around a solid core value of family, bringing duty and loyalty to the heart of her character. They build upon these values, weaving a complex character who with each peel exposes layers that continue to evolve with each dive into the dark depths of espionage. And as more characters join the deadly game, Dominika gets to adapt in an attempt to juggle all the information being handed to her. And not only do her actions speak volumes, but Dominika has a few lines to throw out that are empowering to many in the theater. I enjoyed the strong, ever adapting character that hopefully can teach a few lessons amidst the destruction taking place. True Spy Thriller: With James Bond films, we've been spoiled with the spy and action series blending together. Yet, the world of espionage is a lot less flashy given the emphasis of blending in and breaching the trusts of so many people. Red Sparrow flies into the territory of representing the espionage game, utilizing heavy writing, ingenuity, throwing out plenty of leads, and utilizing plenty of tactics to complicate the tale. The mysteries that are presented are the lure to keep you invested in the 2 hour 19 minute run time, all screaming of a true spy thriller that has been missing for some time, including an ending that is worthy of being called a respectable twist. DISLIKES:Slow: Sadly, the movie is very slow at parts, focusing more on the jargon, psychology, and training that is involved in this harsh environment. While this is interesting, it is also very hard to keep attention when the plot doesn't move to keep the thrills going and make learning the information fun. Spy thrillers need to be thrilling, and I didn't really get into the plot until the last thirty minutes of the film when the stakes increased dramatically. Drama fans won't have quite as big of an issue with this, because the love, sex, and relationships fill these slow moments, but fans like me need to have some coffee before coming in. Complicated Jargon: This goes with the slow speed, but Red Sparrow is not a conversation light movie. Where many movies have simplistic dialogue that leads you in a linear fashion. Red Sparrow however is like one of those word webs, with so much spreading out it can be confusing to piece things together without paying major attention. So many relationships to keep track of and so much information to maintain, you have to keep everything in check to figure out what the point of all this is. And given how the tone of the characters fluctuates, it can sometimes be difficult to hear what they are saying as the cavalcade talk in whispers and hushed tones. Graphic Torture: Serial killers rejoice, you'll see the dark dealings of punishment unfold in very disturbing moments, but for others with weaker constitutions you'll need to turn away. There is plenty of Red in this movie, and not in the slasher movie cheesiness Hollywood has made famous. This movie has been majorly grounded in terms of thrills, but with it comes some realism that is more gruesome to see. I appreciate this darkness to some extent, but the there are some nightmare inducing images, and in some cases a little unnecessary to the story. The VERDICT: Despite all the mixed reviews, I think that Red Sparrow is a fine film that shows off Lawrence's talents to be edgy and a strong women character. The film has plenty of mystery to solve as you try to uncover the true meaning behind this thriller, searching for any information possible. And given all this convoluted information, this movie certainly is the closest thing to an espionage film we've gotten in a long while. Yet, the movie is slow, and geared more toward romantic drama lovers who could care less about the story and more about the sabotage the characters throw at each other. Nevertheless, this dark story is not for the faint of focus and should be geared towards those who like a darker story with lots of kinks to unravel. My scores are:Mystery/Thriller: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0",Red Sparrow
73,Kingslaay,Misguided directing and writing but all not that bad,7,17 March 2018,"Red Sparrow has not been received well by many. However the film is not as bad as it seems. In terms of story and being based on a book it is an interesting, dark and cold thriller. Jennifer Lawrence gives a very good performance and the supporting performances are very good as well. The film could have definitely benefited from having better direction and a well explained plot. Simplicity should be the goal otherwise the audience plays catch up. And given its dark and inhumane context a lack of simplicity does the film no favors and makes the audience have distaste for it. Better directing and screen writing could have transformed this film into a thrilling classic that many could have appreciated.

75,Weirdling_Wolf,"A blithely calamitous, silkily streamlined, outrageously sexy, super-spy, action-fest!",8,10 December 2020,"Director Francis Lawrence's gorgeously giddy, sensuously slick, singularly vapid 'Red Sparrow' (2015) is a spectacularly scurrilous Euro-spy yarn given some additional, lissom-limbed lustre by having a luminous, bodaciously ass-kicking, lock-picking, pulse-quickening Jennifer Lawrence playing the glamorously glacial ex-ballerina, Dominika Egova, turned exquisitely dangerous espionage smut-siren, who cannily conceals her devastating set of 'special skills' beneath a décolletage-popping, snug-fitting, head-turning bikini! 'Red Sparrow' is a deliciously inhospitable, especially frosty, John Le Carré-styled, high-gloss, cold war, sweaty-bollixed thriller about rapaciously double-dealing, double-whiskey downing double-agents, blithely globe-trotting their bravura, bullet-dodging machinations across some breathlessly cinematic European vistas. These beautifully austere, sublimely evocative exteriors being headily contrasted with some intimately lurid interior clinches worthy of smut-master Zalman 'Wild Orchid' King himself!
While I have a zealous, slightly absurd passion for bellicose Euro-thrillers and 'Red Sparrow' certainly delivers on all the requisite thrill-spilling, skull-shattering, neck-garrotting spectacle this blissfully bloody back-stabbing genre requires, but, for all that greasy hyperbole, if one scrutinizes the film a little too closely, the frequently facile, over-burnished allure soon dissipates, thereby exposing its greatly hollowed out, emotionally barren core. Taken as a breezily entertaining, adrenalized rush of prettified pulp fiction it is certainly not without merit, and, perhaps, those more ardent fans of fellow action stylist, Oliver Megaton's no less flighty and garishly adorned 'Red Siren' should find their fitfully fluttering hearts soaring in amorous response to Ms. Lawrence's no less dazzling crimson plumage! Without over battering the celluloid cod, if I might just reiterate, while Red Sparrow's narrative aspirations aren't especially lofty, this doesn't hinder its awesome impetus as being one of the more blithely alacritous, silkily streamlined, outrageously sexy, super-spy, action-fests in recent memory, and I remain mustard keen to witness a second bloody bout from our sultry, blonde-haired, sleazoid-slaying seductress!",Red Sparrow

Lawrence's performance has a consistency of toughness which rarely falters. The over-confident, garrulous persona she has become known for is replaced with a compelling iciness and it is this that makes her very watchable. The audience will be intrigued by which direction her Russian spy takes at different stages of the plot.
One of the film's flaws is authenticity. The characters seem stereotypical, and it's hard to believe a secret service would employ a famous prima ballerina to carry out field operations when real spies are anonymous faces in a crowd. It's also worth pointing out that actors who are very famous to audiences don't help with suspense in films which aim for a serious tone.

RED SPARROW is a nice companion piece to the RED ARMY documentary released a couple years back, which spelled out how ""Mad Vlad Putin"" dispatched a team of male ""Red Sparrows"" to run beta drills for ""fixing"" the Sochi Olympics and doing the legwork to seduce states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania over to the Kremlin's side. ""By any means necessary"" is one of the slogans of the Red Commie KGB (and the alphabet soup of its successor organizations), RED SPARROW reveals. RED ARMY showed that sometimes it was deemed necessary to hijack the Detroit Red Wings and the Pittsburgh Penguins to mask clandestine meetings with and kickbacks to the local secretaries of state. RED SPARROW shows that at other times bashing someone in the face with a hockey stick will not suffice, and it may prove more suitable to the nefarious Pinkos' Purpose to skin someone alive. The bottom line is that every True Blue Patriotic Union Label American ought to have BOTH of these explosive flicks--RED ARMY and RED SPARROW--on their DVD shelf (preferably encased with an innocuous and misleading labels such as ""Yule Log Burning"" or ""Work Your Abs"") , unless they're looking forward to learning the Cyrillic Alphabet!",Red Sparrow
83,Troy_Campbell,"Stylish, debate-starting spy thriller.",8,5 March 2018,"Misleadingly marketed as a kick-arse thriller, this espionage yarn is short on action but heavy on drama, employing the spy genre framework to explore provocative themes of female empowerment and state control over its citizens. Centred on Jennifer Lawrence's Russian ballerina Dominika-who reluctantly finds her way into the KGB's 'Sparrow' program, an intense course of espionage through seduction-Justin Haythe's script is fiercely intelligent and unafraid to take the more difficult route. Dominika's regular refusal to use sex to achieve a mission contradicts the femme-fatale stereotype, whilst her resistance to, and complete lack of need of assistance from, the all-male hierarchy makes for an altogether more interesting and complicated protagonist. One classroom scene in particular, in which Dominika bears all to a male student (who attempted to rape her the previous night) is almost unbearably confronting, the calculating manoeuvre successfully antagonising the power-seeking student and ultimately giving Dominika the control. It's also the point that Lawrence truly announces her unbridled dedication to the convention-busting role. Sure, she's an attractive lady, but she offers so much more in a performance that boasts layers of hatred, ferocity, vulnerability and unwavering determination. Lawrence's engrossing turn, as well as Joel Edgerton's solid supporting work, goes a long way in being able to forgive the occasional convenient plot machination and overlong scene, whilst also making the climactic rug pull completely effective. A warning for the squeamish though: the violence, albeit sparingly utilised, is brutal. A methodical torture sequence is unsurprisingly savage, although it's a scrappy three-way knife fight that delivers the biggest gut churn. A stylish spy tale that is visually splendid, narratively taut and thematically rich, Red Sparrow is both a fun thriller to those looking for escapism as well as a stimulating debate-starter for those wanting to dig a little deeper.",Red Sparrow

If you are, you get a nice mixture of action, agency work, personal stories and egoism. However, it is ridiculous how in this movie, decades after the cold war, America is still the shining hero that defends everyone's rights and has to face a Russia under Putin that has schools where pupils get raped every single day as a part of their training. I mean come on.. seriously? Not that I am a great fan of Russian politics but that might be a bit black and white. And, to be honest, that ruins the film for me. When will American producers learn that patriotism that's not based on facts is never a good basis for a film?All in all this is an enjoyable film with some nice twists that unfortunately chose to mix reality and fiction to a point where it becomes misleading.

RED SPARROW is one of those movies. I wanted a tension filled action-spy thriller, and that's what I got.But the level of explicitness is what indeed shocked me to the core. There's a lot of sex and violent action throughout the film. It's not for the faint of heart. I was really finding it unbelievable that it got past the censors without a slight cut. RED SPARROW has a fast paced first half and while there are subplots later on, it's only due to the thrilling tone of the film that it doesn't really feel boring. But by the time the second half is about to begin, it feels as if the film is already over in a way. The second half is fine but quite slow. Once again, the tone makes even the dullest of all sequences shine. RED SPARROW excels in the writing. Those who enjoy thrillers will have a good time watching it, though even action fans who want action in limit will be satisfied. Don't expect action of ATOMIC BLONDE or MISSION IMPOSSIBLE kind. There's a good amount of well executed action in RED SPARROW as well, it's just that it's done in an unusual manner for action thrillers.The film feels far too stretched at 140 minutes.

It also reunites Hunger Games series filmmaker Francis Lawrence with Jennifer Lawrence (no relation... I think).The film offers a lot of style, yes more so than substance. its shot well and the locale adds to the brand of the film. Lawrence's accent seems wonky and I'm not sure its ever really easy to get used to. However, she's good in this. She was also great in Mother! but got nominated for a Razzie for that, go figure. The film is long, maybe a little two long but I thought it was interesting enough. The film also offers brutal torture and violence and sexual scenes that will make people uncomfortable. Get past that and I think its a fairly decent spy thriller.Its not overly smart and doesn't offer any thing that makes you feel like you experienced an excellent twist or exquisite storytelling. The film does manage to meet expectations and offer a bit of beauty on the screen, despite the rather ugly and violent nature of the film. Lawrence is very committed to the role and I still believe she's one of the best actresses in the industry today. Don't expect anything spectacular, but go in to see a decently made spy thriller that does not shy away fro sex, torture and violence.6.5/10",Red Sparrow

I knocked it down from a 10 to 9 only because of its length. It runs over two hours and drags out the ending. But it's still full of action' suspense and sex. Although the sex is very graphic --- and I do tend to be something of a prude in these matters --- it still was tastefully done. It also catches the atmosphere of both Moscow and Budapest --- I've visited both --- even though nothing was actually shot in Moscow. This will be a satisfying and well spent couple of hours whether your interest is espionage, creative film, ballet, excellent acting or intense drama.

93,RforFilm,"With no consistent tone or interesting characters, Red Sparrow is an uninspired thriller with an audio pilot performance from Jennifer Lawrence",3,5 March 2018,"In the spirit of her new movie, let's talk about Jennifer Lawrence. Most people remember her for two things. One, she was the lead of The Hunger Games franchise, which seemed to kick start the young adult trend of movies (you could make the argument that Harry Potter series did this, though that started off as a family friendly series). She took this character and made Katness Everdeen into role models for those to stand up for themselves. Second, Jennifer Lawrence has been nominated (winning for Silver Linings Playbook) several times, making herself not just popular with the critics, but solidifying that she is a phenomenal actress.I too see her as such. Her look and body type allows her to step into a variety of film roles, and she can also play comedic and dramatic roles (this is more difficult them most people realize). It makes sense that she would try a variety of roles to see if she can further separate herself from The Hunger Games. Some have been good and some have been...interesting. I'm always excited to see what she'll attempt to take on. Now that she's teaming up with Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence (no relation), let's see if Red Sparrow can push her further. In modern Russia, famed ballerina Dominika Egorova (played by Jennifer Lawrence) suffers a leg injury that ends her career. This puts her in a situation where she can't care for her sick mother. Her uncle Ivan, who works in Russian Intelligence, offers her the governments pension in exchange of seducing a state politician and replacing his phone. Instead, the politician is murdered and because there can be no witnesses, Dominika is given the choice of being a red sparrow, an agent that uses their bodies, or be executed. For the sake of her mother, she choses the red sparrow. She's sent to a camp where she and fellow Russians are broken down psychologically in order to be able to handle any situation, no matter how sexual or crazy. She manages to exceed in her class and is even given her first assignment in Budapest. She's tasked into getting information from a CIA operative Nate Nash (played by Joel Edgerton). Though he figures out fast that she's a Russian operative, she reveals that she's willing to become a double agent if this means getting her and her mother out of the country. With the recent controversy of sexual harassment and the ""Me Too"" movement going on, Red Sparrow seems like the right kind of movie to be made; of a woman who uses body and mind to her advantage. The problem is of how the content is played out. It's clear that Red Sparrow was made as a more adult film to separate itself from the director's and Jennifer Lawrence's past Hunger Games movies. Though she does allow herself to be filmed in the nude and we see the character go through some dark things, I cant shake the feeling that the studio was trying to find the balance of mainstream acceptance and the kind of raw content that's usually found in independent movies. It still feels too safe.But that wouldn't matter if the story and cast was good...and it's not. Jennifer Lawrence gives a passing performance, but nothing special. It sounds like I'm being mean, but much of it isn't her fault. A lot of it is the script that despite giving her a lot of time as a ballerina and as an agent, I still don't know her personality. What are her likes? Dislikes? It's another autopilot performance. It's not like Katness Everdeen where the first thirty minutes of Hunger Games did give us what her personality was like. Even it's tone is all over the place. The trailer will trick people into thinking the majority of the story is of her at camp. It does do that, but most of it is of her as an agent. As much as the film tries to put her into a situation where she's conflicted by her country and doing what's right, I couldn't care. It jumps around without a set place or focus other then her as an agent. I might have been more on board had the characters been better.I'll give this three Russian propaganda posters out of ten. Jennifer Lawrence is giving everything to a script that doesn't progress her as an actress nor even challenge her too much. Red Sparrow is one bird that can fly away.",Red Sparrow
94,carbuff,"Prime American-style ""Sex & Violence""",6,21 January 2019,"Although fundamentally conventional, ""Red Sparrow"" is a well-done spy thriller with one, major, glaring flaw; specifically, Jennifer Lawrence. Every other member of the cast gives a strong performance, but Lawrence is an outstanding example of the difference between a movie star and a movie actor. Hardly any cynicism is necessary to recognize that this film is a vehicle built to exploit Lawrence's extraordinarily attractive physical attributes, but never once did I feel that she ""was"" her character--basically, she's the female equivalent of Tom Cruise, both of whom are possibly computer-generated holograms stuck in the uncanny valley. Still, once you put this issue aside and focus on the positive, this is a pretty good film. The plot keeps moving and twisting, and, in the end, the film doesn't feel nearly as long as it is. The run time is actually about that of a typical self-indulgent director's cut, yet it manages to feel properly edited. The basic plot themes aren't particularly sophisticated or original, but they are very slickly executed. It's hard to see anything other than a fundamentally simplistic world view in this film, since the Russians make Satan look like a slightly mischievous Boy Scout, while the Americans are as pure as the driven snow, although they might sneak out back for an occasional guilty smoke. (I'm not going to bother thinking about whether I've just mixed too many metaphors.) My major, huge, caveat about this film concerns its depiction of violence. The killing and torture scenes feel so realistic, that they really gut check you with their gruesome and graphic nature, much more so than in most horror movies. I'm almost inured to violence in modern films, as are most people nowadays I suppose, but I wasn't really expecting it to this degree in this film, and it knocked me way back on my heels (I cross-dress in private, oops, TMI). I really think that quite a few scenes easily qualify as ""Torture Porn"". I watched this right before going to bed, and that turned out to be a big mistake, since it really messed up my sleep. I'm not that sensitive, but some scenes really are extremely disturbing stuff. So, there you have it, a more-than-serviceable plot used to deliver American-style ""Sex & Violence"" at Hollywood's highest production standards. If that's what you're after, this will ""git 'er done"".",Red Sparrow

Everything else is a blur and it's not because I'm not paying attention either it's because Jennifer's so super sweet and so ultra and uber hot plus so dang cool she's making it really hard to concentrate. She's making it pretty hard! I love Jennifer Lawrence I do hope I'm not alone in that. Oh my God Jennifer Lawrence is so hot in this movie Red Sparrow. I can see why she took on the script. It has an assortment of excellent purely essential movie viewing qualities such as the finely tuned editing, the diverse bold screenwriting and the intensed-up acting, but the lackluster sets, the depthless story texture and the laugh-out-loud laughable direction is only mildly stimulating my senses. LOL!! I LOVE Red Sparrow but I really REALLY Love Jennifer Lawrence the Kentuckian. Lol!! This is no laughing matter. Jennifer does her first fully unclothed and wide open nude scene in Red Sparrow, if you've seen it, and it is glorious. Red Sparrow is really sexy and really stupid but Jenny Lawrence is beautiful. I love Jennifer Lawrence. She looks like she's really feeling the character. Lawrence is an elite actress I love it. I love J-Law. She has the beauty of Angelina Jolie with the heart of an angel and the skill to play make-believe amongst the likes of Bette Davis. Red Sparrow starring Jennifer Lawrence as Catalina. I love this movie, and I absolutely adore Jennifer Lawrence. She's the hottest, the most awesomest actress in the whole wide world. Joel Edgerton's real good too no doubt. Red Sparrow has bad pacing, clumsy dialogue, terrible chemistry between mostly all the stars, except for Jennifer and Joely, including Joel and Jenn in particular, but it's very carefully crafted scene by scene so I like it.

96,bankofmarquis,A SEXY Spy thriller that would have been better without the SEXY,7,3 March 2018,"The new Jennifer Lawrence spy thriller RED SPARROW is being advertised as a ""sexy"" thriller, and if you watch the trailers for it, you would think it was a Jason Bourne/Mission Impossible-type of action thriller - with ""sexy"" action - and you would be misled and disappointed.For, RED SPARROW, is a sexy, intelligent, inner-workings, ""out-smart-the-other-guy"" type of spy thriller in more of the mode of a John LeCarre novel (like TINKER, TAILOR, SOLIDER, SPY). It does have some action and some GRAPHIC torture scenes, but I would not classify it as an action film, so those looking for that will be bored.RED SPARROW follows the tale of Bolshoi Ballet Prima Ballerina, Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) who, after an accident ends her ballet career, is drawn into the deadly world of International Intelligence by her Uncle and must her her body as well as her mind to survive.This is billed - and shot - as a ""sexy"" thriller with ""SEXY"" being the primary driving force - and that is too bad, for I found the sex and nudity to be gratuitous and didn't really drive the narrative forward. When the film stopped focusing on this aspect and focused on the mystery - and misdirection - at hand and Dominika's ability to outsmart and outhink those around her, that the film really catches it's footing and is quite good.Unfortunately, you have to sit through the first 1/2 of this film - the training portion - and that is filled with gratuitous sex and sexual conquest and using your sex to disarm the enemy. It's an unfortunate choice that almost took me out of the movie, so when the (really) good second half of the film came about, I was surprised by it.But if you can get through that, you'll be rewarded by a pretty good, pretty smart, pretty INTELLIGENT thriller.Letter Grade: B (C for the 1st half, A for the 2nd half)7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Red Sparrow

I don't know if this happens in the real world (pillow talk) but presumably it does. So we have an attractive intellectual female spy using the skills she has been taught to seduce a man into giving up secrets, ok equal opportunity and I'm fine with that but the spies in this film don't keep much a secret in the first place! Very long winded and in my personal opinion the first 40 minutes were just there to pull in the male audience (the parts in the state school) which wasn't needed and become irrelevant. Honestly the only part of this film I enjoyed was the twist at the end. Quite disappointed after all the hype, give me Atomic Blonde every time. Rating 4 out of 10",Red Sparrow

101,abisio,"Predicatable, full of cliches and ultimaltely boring spy thriller",3,11 March 2018,"I understand the book was a real hit; however I doubted the transalation to screen has been totally faithful otherwise how its spanned two sequels is a mystery.
Jenifer Lawrence is a ""good girl; almost a saint"" , Bolshoi ballerina that after an apparent accident lose her job and medical coverage for her and her ill mother (I am the movie occurs in Russia when the right reference will be USA). In order to keep medical insurance and her house she accepts to work for her uncle at the FSR and is trained as a SPARROW (basically a seductress spy).
It looks interesting but not; she is so pure that everything related to sex seems terrible to her. 
She is sent to special academy for training (remember La Femme Nikita ?) ; well nothing interesting happens there aside from some unnecessary monologues from a Charlotte Rampling that looks as bored as the rest of the unknown cast.After a training were apparently she only learns how to open doors; is sent by his uncle to follow a USA spy who has been contacting a mole on the Russian government.The rest of the movie is back and forth of forced dialogues; slow burn scenes and almost nothing else. A complete waste of a very good secondary actors trying to do something.The final twist at the end is so predictable that when it comes only disappoint.As if the slow almost moronic pace that takes 2 hours and 20 minutes to finish in a very stupid conclusion; the movie is not situated in a particuar time which makes things even more absurd. For example a traitor steal information from 3 inches diskettes; but she reads the information in a very modern laptop that do not seems to have a disk drive. Cell phones are all over; but novody is able to locate anybody or even record a person movement; only by follow them.In terms of sexual tension; aside from very brief nudity from Lawrence, the few sexual scenes are basically clothed and cold.However the depiction of Russian spies as cold blooded killers and certain phrases about patriotism looks like seventies Rambo message.It is not worth to explain any more how bad this movie is. If you are like this type of thrillers get a copy of Atomic Blonde; it is ten times more fun, more cerebral and unexpected than this crap.

102,bob-the-movie-man,Good Lord! How much sex and violence is acceptable for a UK-15 film?,6,8 March 2018,"""Red Sparrow"", the latest film from ""Hunger Games"" director Francis Lawrence, has Jennifer Lawrence (""Joy"", ""mother!"") as Dominika Egorova, a Russian ballerina, who after a horrific accident (cringe) is forced to serve the State in order to keep her mother (Joely Richardson, ""101 Dalmations"") in their Bolshoi-funded apartment and with the necessary medical treatment. She is sent to a spy ""whore school"", ruled over by ""matron"" (Charlotte Rampling), to learn how to use sexual and psychological means to 'get in the pants' (and therefore the minds) of foreign targets. And she turns out to be very good and - without nepotism of course, given that her creepy uncle Egorov ( Matthias Schoenaerts, ""Far From The Madding Crowd"") is high up in the special services - she is sent on a mission to Budapest to try to uncover a high profile mole, who's CIA handler is Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton, ""The Great Gatsby"", ""Black Mass""). Supervising Egorov's operation are his two line managers General Korchnoi (Jeremy Irons, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"") and Zakharov (Ciarán Hinds, ""Harry Potter""). Sucked into a web of intrigue, Dominika needs to use all her skills and charms to complete her mission... which equates to keeping herself and her mother alive.This is an extremely uneven film. In places it is quite brilliant, particularly the twist in the ending which leaves you thinking (like ""Life"") that the film is actually better than it was. In fact - subject to a couple of severe reservations discussed below - the script by Justin Haythe (""A Cure for Wellness"") and based on a book by Jason Matthews, is quite sharp. But - man - in its direction the film seriously takes its time. In my book, a film needs to have a pretty good reason to extend its stay past 2 hours, and this outstays its welcome by an extra 20 minutes. Many of the scenes are protracted - leisurely walks across streets etc. - for no particularly good reason.And so to those major reservations: the sex and the violence.I'm no prude when it comes to sex, but some of the scenes in the 'whore school' left me feeling like this was less about a ""Times Up"" initiative of empowering women and more about providing an array of sordid titillation on the screen that just help entrench mysoginistic views about women. (Did anyone else hear Kenneth Williams saying ""Oooooh, matron"" to Charlotte Rampling's character?) There were men and women attending this training camp, but did we see - later in the film - any of the men subjecting themselves to sexual humiliation or subjugation in the field: no, we did not. I love a really good erotic film... but this just left me feeling dirty and used.And then there's the violence. I'm definitely not a fan of the sort of violent-porn of the ""Saw"" type of films, but heavens - if there was a reason to make this an 18 certificate it was the violence involved. Violent rape, a vicious revenge attack, extreme torture, skinning alive: was there nothing in here that the censors thought, ""hang on a minute, perhaps I don't want a 15 year old seeing this"". I have seldom seen and heard more flinching and whimpering from women in a cinema audience than during this film. If you are adversely affected by screen violence, this is really one best to avoid.""The Cold War hasn't ended - it has splintered into thousands of dangerous pieces"" intones the matron. Similarly, this film has potential but splinters into many pieces, some good but far more sharp and dangerous. With similarities in tone and content to ""Atomic Blonde"", there's a good 'post cold war' spy film in here trying to get out. Unfortunately, it never quite gets both legs over the wall.",Red Sparrow

105,kjproulx,A story for our times. A movie that doesn't deliver.,5,8 March 2018,"Movies that build up to something incredible can be forgiven for being slow throughout the majority of its duration. That being said, if your film is only mildly engaging and leads to a conclusion that feels overly complex for the sake of being overly complex, then I feel as though it has failed. Some viewers may feel differently and enjoy a calm film with a very slow pace and a cool twist to pay everything off in the final act, so I can see where some people may enjoy Red Sparrow, but I've seen this style of storytelling done far better on multiple occasions. For its unapologetic look at rape, manipulation, and seduction, here are a few of the many reasons why I think this one can easily be skipped if you're deciding between a few movies to see at the cinema.Following Dominika Egorova as she is sent by her uncle to attend a school to become a sparrow, Red Sparrow is about using your body as a weapon in order to seduce and manipulate criminals. The premise of this film is easily one of the more relevant when comparing it to today's climate, but comparing a movie to reality isn't the only thing that should make it worth watching. Yes, there are some truly graphic moments sprinkled throughout this movie and I can confidently say that they will turn off many audience members. With that said, not everything about this film affected me in a negative way.Jennifer Lawrence has always had a divided audience when it comes to her performances, and while I have enjoyed her in pretty much everything, for the most part, I'd almost go as far as calling this a terrific performance. This was her first time using a different accent in such a drastic way and for the most part, I wasn't distracted. Her performance, along with the unsettling chemistry that worked very well between her and Joel Edgerton, made this a bearable movie to sit through.As mentioned earlier, a movie can fall apart if your story is solely relying on impressing your audience in the final act, and that's exactly where Red Sparrow fails the hardest at accomplishing. The premise itself is engaging enough to keep you intrigued as to where it will all end up, but the third act of this movie tries too hard to impress its audience, using multiple twists that feel forced in order to bring closure to certain loose ends. I liked some of these loose ends being brought to a satisfying conclusion, but my biggest complaint is that this film didn't know where it wanted to go.Where this film shines is through its direction and cinematography. Although subtle, I feel as though cinematographer Jo Willems has crafted a unique looking thriller that takes you from point A to point B with visual ease. Director Francis Lawrence has worked with Jennifer Lawrence many times on the sets of multiple films in 'The Hunger Games' franchise, which is why I believe him to be a great director. His work has always impressed me in terms of getting great performances out of actors/actresses and Red Sparrow is just another example of that exact talent.In the end, Red Sparrow isn't really a film that I can recommend to anyone, especially in theatres. Sure, if you have nothing else to watch and you're a patient viewer, then you may get a kick out of certain sequences through the course of this movie. For the most part, I feel that the majority of filmgoers will either be bored or grow uninterested by the time the credits roll. It tries very hard to win you over in the third act, but I didn't fall for it. Red Sparrow has divided audiences around the world, and I seem to be right in the middle of all the criticism. I can see where people may enjoy it, but I can just as easily see why people are hating on it. If you're planning on checking this one out, I think renting may be the best option.",Red Sparrow

I had pretty low expectations going into this, yet it didn't even manage to meet those.At a time when gripping real-life espionage stories are flowing at an ever increasing rate, they still somehow managed to make this an uninspired, uninteresting bore.It felt like Jennifer Lawrence was trying to do nudity on her own, more empowering terms, following being a victim in the unfortunate 2014 iCloud photo leak. 'Red Sparrow' no doubt set out to be somewhat empowering for women, with its strong lead character, but it was woefully misguided in execution, and came across just plain sadistic.I struggled to follow it at times, with the plot weaving into a confusing mess in the latter half. Struggled to want to follow it also, as by that point I just wanted all the characters sent to a gulag. Or was that a different era to this setting? I'm not even sure, because the time period was confusing too.It was clear this was a film about Russians made by Americans - with horrendous accents and one or two lines of Russian dialogue all film. I love Russia, the cold war, espionage and spy thrillers - yet hated this with a passion.One of the CIA guys said it best during final scenes; ""What the hell is going on?""",Red Sparrow
113,Andres-Camara,Como Los juegos pero mejor. Like the games but better,6,19 May 2018,"Como se nota que es el mismo director de ""Los juegos del hambre"". Básicamente es la misma película pero por suerte está mejor rodada, aunque tristemente, este director, nunca sabrá rodar bien.Tenemos un estado fascista comunista y un personaje libre que lo que quiere es salvarse él y vivir en paz. Es lo único que me gusta de este director, su mirada bajo todo el decorado.No llega a ser una estupenda película, porque le faltan varias cosas. Lo primero no tiene el aire de gran película. El casting no es bueno. Lawrence, que está muy bien, como espía, es fría como una buena rusa, pero al principio, yo no entiendo mucho de ballet, pero creo que no es que baile muy bien, me parece que no es una doble, si no ella y lo hace bastante mal. No le pega el papel del ballet. A Schoenaerts no le va el papel de su tío el malo, es demasiado joven y no es malo. El resto está todos muy bien. 
Me gusta cómo se diferencia la parte rusa de la americana. En todos los sentidos, en cuanto a frialdad de personajes, arte, iluminación.La iluminación está bastante bien. Ayuda mucho a diferenciar los sitios, las situaciones, te ayuda a meterte y narra la película.La pena es que este director, nunca sabrá colocar una cámara y hay veces que la pone demasiado mal. No se ve bien al principio, porque se trunca su carrera, graba demasiados primeros planos de perfil. No hace planos bonitos ni que narren. Por suerte, en esta película, no hay una carrera por meter muchos planos por segundo como en Los juegos del hambre, eso se lo agradezco. Y eso sí, es bastante más entretenida que la otra. La película no aburre, al revés se ve bien. Es una buena película para pasar dos horas largas.
As you can tell he is the same director of ""The Hunger Games"". Basically it is the same movie but luckily it is better shot, although sadly, this director will never know how to shoot well.We have a communist fascist state and a free character that wants to save himself and live in peace. It's the only thing I like about this director, his look under all the scenery.It does not become a great movie, because it lacks several things. The first does not have the air of a great movie. The casting is not good. Lawrence, who is very good, as a spy, is cold as a good Russian, but at the beginning, I do not understand much ballet, but I think it's not that I dance very well, I think it's not a double, but she and He does it quite badly. He does not hit the ballet paper. Schoenaerts is not playing the role of his uncle the bad guy, he's too young and he's not bad. The rest is all very well.
I like how the Russian part of the American differs. In every way, in terms of character coldness, art, lighting.The lighting is quite good. It helps a lot to differentiate the sites, the situations, it helps you get involved and tells the movie.The pity is that this director will never know how to place a camera and there are times when he puts it too badly. It does not look good at first, because his career is truncated, he records too many close-ups in profile. It does not make beautiful plans or narrate. Luckily, in this movie, there is not a race to get many shots per second like in The Hunger Games, I appreciate that. And yes, it is much more entertaining than the other. The film does not bore, the other way around it looks good.It's a good movie to spend two long hours.",Red Sparrow
114,Alexander_Blanchett,Recycled story with some good aspects,7,11 March 2018,"Its nothing we haven't seen before, in fact we get those films about female super agents now basically annually. Last year Charlize Theron gave us the ""Atomic Blonde"" and while that was pretty original in its execution, ""Red Sparrow"" is rather classical story telling. Its not a bad film at all, in fact it had many fine aspects and nice tension but it was also flawed. A bunch of british or american actors acting with russian accents - yeah it was irritating. Jennifer Lawrence still gave a pretty decent performance, at least most of the time. She had some nice scenes to showcase her talent. I also liked Joel Edgerton who was not as colorless as I expected. Because usually the male lead in those films is colorless. Charlotte Rampling was terribly wasted and underused. Its the kind of roles he used to play before her Oscar nomination and now she continues with it. Matthias Schoenearts was doing his very best to give his one dimensional role some life. Jeremy Irons was fine, especially towards the ending. Mary-Louise Parker was terrible. 
The film had some continuity issues for which I mostly blame director Francis Lawrence. I did not feel that this was the right project for him. Also I did not see the reason for it being so overlong. You could have easily cut it to a 2 hours running time. Also the screenplay was often not too believable. Or the mix of the rather weakish direction made it not always believable. What I liked were the twists and some smart turns. Lawrence also makes the film interesting as it was a brave turn for her. Nothing new but besides the running time quite enjoyable.",Red Sparrow
115,bshaef,"Entertaining, But Typical",6,2 May 2019,"I've seen 4 or 5 variations of Red Sparrow.

Jennifer Lawrence and her fellow actors give typical performances.",Red Sparrow
116,TheTruthofItIs,Better casting would've greatly improved this,7,14 October 2018,"Geez, reviews are all over the place. This is a good film, not great, not poor, it's not a waste of time. I think the underlying problem is with JLaw's casting, she's just not right for the part. In fact, a rising unknown would've worked out best. I think JLaw brings certain baggage/expectations that hurt this story; she's more of a distraction than attraction. Otherwise, the story is engaging and the double-cross isn't as evident as some say, though it's understandable - I think some mistake that for predictable.",Red Sparrow
117,CANpatbuck3664,"The Payoff, Performances and Tight Plot Make Red Sparrow Worth Checking Out",8,11 March 2018,"Addressing the elephant in the room, there are moments in this movie that will leave you squirming in your seat. Normally this would be a major negative, but this is an intentional choice. For a movie with so much sex in it, little to none of it is hot or even sexy. I think this was a brave and chancy thing to show so much raw abuse and although it is graphic, it really underscores the traumatizing effect of what Dominika is subjected to. It is uncomfortable, but I think its more realistic than people want to admit. This is an adult movie dealing with adult themes and although there were times where I wanted to look away, it didn't dissuade me from wanting to see where Red Sparrow would go.The other big criticism I hear when it comes to Red Sparrow is the running time. I don't hesitate to gripe about a movie when there's a lull in the middle or if they stretch the movie out another 15 minutes longer than they should, but I actually didn't think movie overstayed its welcome at all. There aren't many scenes that could have been cut or moments that didn't serve a purpose. If you were going in expecting Atomic Blonde, the lack of action might not be to your liking. But I never found Red Sparrow dull or poorly paced. There isn't a ton of action in this movie but when this movie gets violent, you really feel it. Its raw, bloody and stomach churning. Its also done in a way that feels realistic and believable. There are some brutal torture methods and the hazing that Dominika and the Sector 4 students are subjected to doesn't pull any punches. The victims develop scars that they wear for the rest of the film (a nice touch that few movies do) and the discussions surrounding it are brash. But again, I enjoyed the fact that it felt a little closer to reality.Jennifer Lawrence is still a top shelf actress but there's a chance of oversaturation developing with her celebrity status. I'm still of the opinion that she's one of the more talented lead actresses working and she does another fine job leading Red Sparrow. She's very reserved but she conveys Dominika's calculating nature and her shock and rage under a veil of indifference. She's powerful in drawing you into Dominika's story and all its rough parts. I would like to see her do this part again in a possible sequel. I'm a fan of Joel Edgerton but I didn't like him as much as Nate. But that may be more due to his character and I thought he got better as the movie went on. The surprise standout was Matthias Schoenaerts as Vanya. I've liked him in other movies, but it was normally in a thug like role. This was a big departure from that and he was great. Charlotte Rampling is suitably chilling as the Matron of Sector 4. Jeremy Irons and Ciaran Hinds are great, you just have to ignore the iffy accents.My issues with Red Sparrow were minor and most of them were resolved by the end. The first one was that it seemed like Dominika and Nate were given way too much leeway to be realistic. Both of them keep having setbacks and face very little blowback but the movie addresses that. You also have a couple of sub-par accents but I could look past that too.Speaking of that ending, I was really pleased with the direction they went with. This was one of the few movies lately that was able to keep me guessing and the ambiguity surrounding Dominika's motivations was essential to keeping the viewer in the dark. I watch a lot of movies and for the movie to come up with a genuine surprise made me want to pat the scriptwriter and the author on the back.I think that this was a risky property for the studio to back and despite the troublesome nature of the plot, this was a good spy movie. It's more Jason Bourne than James Bond but it even feels topical with all the gender politics in the news right now. I think the movie is empowering in the fact that Dominika faces all this difficulty (and I can't stress enough that she goes through a $#!T storm) and she's not just using her body to get through this, its her mind that's her most valuable asset. I wouldn't mind checking out a sequel and although I think this will be a divisive movie, I would still recommend it if you can handle the subject matter.",Red Sparrow

It makes a HELL of a lot more sense than ""Atomic Blonde"" and it has a great set up. Then it drags out.Other than that, Joel Edgerton just isn't convincing as a C .I.A. agent who falls for a Russian spy. Is J-Law's Russian accent the reason for the vitriol? I get that. Is it because we're constantly reminded what an attractive woman she is, though her frosty cold exterior says otherwise? I'll drink to that. In the end, it just doesn't add up to the feeling I think they want us to feel. A better movie that treads over similar territory is ""The Sum of All Fears"" or ""Salt"" in terms of spy games. This feels like they were attempting to cram too much into a single movie and doing it without that much conviction.

Uplifting theme: 
Sacrifice for a higher purpose
Extreme patriotism Things I liked:
The talented cast includes Jennifer Lawrence, Jeremy Irons, Joel Edgerton, Charlotte Rampling, and Mary-Louise Parker.
To enforce the title of the movie and the Russian setting, the color red plays a dominant role, from the movie poster, to the clothing that people wear to the bloody scenes. 
Jennifer Lawrence trained in ballet for 4 months, although Isabella Boylston was her lovely body double who did the more difficult choreography. 
Directed by Francis Lawrence, this movie is his first film since he directed The Hunger Games movies. Clearly, Jennifer Lawrence trusts him completely.
You don't know who is telling the truth, which makes it intriguing and suspenseful. 
The movie is based on the book by Jason Matthews who was a former CIA operative. Cool. 
The opening sequence is a bit confusing, but mesmerizing. 
Things I didn't like:
The telling is uneven.
Way too much graphic nudity and sex. There are so many awkward scenes.
Women are used as tools in a one-dimensional portrayal.
It's very dark and violent, which must have rubbed off on Jennifer Lawrence who, apparently, got into a bar fight in Budapest when she was filming the movie.
Jennifer Lawrence has basically the same expression on her face the entire movie. It's hard to see her character arc.
The movie feels long and tiring. Interesting lines:
""There's no such thing as luck."" - Scumbag guy
""Your body belongs to the State. Since your birth, the State nourished it. Now the State asks for something in return."" - Matron (Charlotte Rampling)
""In my experience, the proud are the first to fall."" - Matron",Red Sparrow
122,davidgee,"Tinker, tailor, soldier - Mole",6,16 March 2018,"When a nasty accident cuts short her career as the new star of the Bolshoi Ballet, beautiful Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) is left in dire straits until her handsome but creepy uncle (Matthias Schoenaerts) recruits her to be a 'sparrow' - operating what used to be called 'honey traps' on foreign businessmen and enemies of the State. Dominika goes to a sexual training camp run by a very dour Charlotte Rampling. Then the top guys in the FSB (still remembered by most of us as the KGB) - Ciaran Hinds and Jeremy Irons - insist that her first urgent mission is to seduce CIA agent Nate Nash (Joel Egerton), who is the controller of a mole deep within the FSB. Will she or won't she fall for Nate is - predictably - the crux of the movie.RED SPARROW is a fast-paced mash-up of a Soviet era John Le Carré and one of the earlier MISSION IMPOSSIBLE movies. Lawrence is excellent as always. She does nude scenes which will please her more pervy fans - in one of these scenes she is water-boarded by the CIA. To show that the Russians are much more sadistic than our gallant allies, Egerton gets tortured by the FSB in a scene that belongs more in a SAW spin-off. There are three obvious candidates for the Mole - and I made the correct guess - but there's a 'twist' that gives the movie an agreeably bleak ending. By setting it mainly in the Russian camp, the story comes over as fresher than its constituent parts. Matthias and Jennifer wisely leave the Nazi-sounding Russian accents to the old guard (Rampling, Irons and Hinds) who try not to overdo them.Not much new here, but it'll keep things ticking over till the new Ethan Hunt or Jason Bourne.",Red Sparrow

The story is a bit predictable and the twists are nothing special, but it never felt as though it dragged - it is long, but it just meanders along, focusing more on the character development of the titular 'Red Sparrow' rather than modern day spy craft. Good use of colours and architecture at times, and the shocking torture and spy school scenes create a good contrast to the glamorous side.",Red Sparrow

125,latinfineart,Unbelievably overrated. Written by children.,2,15 May 2018,"This movie really left me cold. It tried to be so many things, to so many different audiences. Poorly directed and written. The plot was so inconceivable and convoluted. There were at least five leaps of faith that the filmmakers asked me to take, and I was unwilling. It felt like a real sophomoric effort. There was nothing about this film that was convincing. Even the sex scenes. They were done with an American sense of prudity, a Quaker type mentality, and barely registered at all. There was a kind of ""lets shock them, and see if we can get a reaction"" to the quality to the story. Weak. Poorly done.Though Lawrence was good in the role, I did not find her particularly convincing, as she is simply not that hot, and therefore a poor choice as a seductress.But the bare facts are that it's a film where we watch Lawrence get beaten up, raped and humiliated, as well as spend a lot of time in (and out of) sexy pants and totally impractical swimwear.A British support cast, including Jeremy Irons, has a lot of fun almost camping it up in dodgy Russian accents. I'd have loved more of Matron (Charlotte Rampling channelling butch, spiky-shoed 007 baddie Rosa Klebb), Sparrow School's headmistress, whose lesson modules include 'manipulation of the nipple'.It looks great and there are moments of gripping spy-thriller tension as well as those of truly unwatchable torture (there's a beyond-grisly skin-peeling scene).

128,sweidman-28016,Underrated,7,28 October 2018,"Really excited. Supposed to be controversial.Red Sparrow was a violent thriller. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing like usual. She never disappoints. She did really well with her character (I loved her accent) and it all felt real. Joel Edgerton also did well. I think he is a really good actor and under appreciated. I liked the story. Although it was a little bit long and some scenes were a little tough to watch, it was pretty good. James Newton Howard's score was one of his best. It was classical and sounded like a Russian ballet. The cinematography was beautiful! I don't know who did it, but it was gorgeous. As for flaws, some scenes were fast paced and some were slow which caused some pacing issues, but it didn't take away from the story much. Also, there was one plot line for a little bit that took away from the story, for me at least, but I understand why it was needed. Overall, I think this was a well done movie that doesn't deserve the negativity it's getting. I really liked it more than most people.

It isn't that explicit. What year are we living in anyway? The film Hardcore came out in 1979. Color of Night came out in 1994. Are we really shocked that a film about Russian prostitute / spies has a few scenes of *gasp* sex in it, in the year 2018? This movie isn't as slow as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, but it's pretty slow. But who cares? Nobody ever said it was going to be Sucker Punch. It's a Soviet Era spy saga (I guess, though I admit the time frame of the film is confusing since they were still using floppy disks but you could buy a burner phone out of a vending machine).I think the biggest problem this film has is that it stars Jennifer Lawrence. Don't get me wrong; she does an incredible job. But people still see her as the innocent girl from Hunger Games. People are clutching their pearls that she might, oh my god, take on a more complicated role for once. I think in the future, when she has starred in a larger variety of roles, this film will be much more appreciated because people will stop obsessing over preconceived notions about the actress and watch the actual movie.

132,ethanbresnett,Enjoyable but a bit too flat,7,12 July 2021,"Red Sparrow is a pretty decent watch that fans of the spy/thriller genre will most likely enjoy.The plot I found to be pretty good. It had everything you could want from this sort of spy film, not knowing who to trust or what anyone's true intentions were. It was well done, well put together, and didn't fall into the trap of becoming overly convoluted and confusing to the point of frustration, which films of this genre can easily slip into. It wasn't particularly revolutionary but was still enjoyable, with some genuinely surprising twists and turns.There was a strong cast on paper, although this didn't always translate to great performances. There's no doubting that Jennifer Lawrence is a talented actress, but I don't think she ever had a chance to shine in this role. She excels when she can inject her personality and charm into a role, or when the character is a bit more meaty and gritty. Unfortunately her performance in Red Sparrow required a steely and cold exterior which, while 100% necessary for the film and character, led to a bit of a flat and at times unengaging central performance. There wasn't a lot to connect to with the protagonist which was a bit of a let down. None of the other characters were particularly memorable or engaging either which separates this film from some of its better peers.For the most part a very solid and enjoyable thriller, although it maybe could have been better given the cast and the promising plot.

134,CineMuseFilms,a pre-Weinstein era espionage thriller full of gratuitous violence and degradation of women,5,9 April 2018,"If ever there was a movie ill-suited to the times it is the espionage thriller Red Sparrow (2018). In the Weinstein era, films that are heavy on gratuitous violence and sexual degradation of women feel strangely out of place. Today's seismic shift in gender politics turns this film into an unfortunate miscalculation that not even stellar talent can save.Like most spy thrillers, the fractured and complex plotline requires close attention to detail or you risk getting lost in the criss-crossing double-speak of Cold War espionage. Beautiful Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) is an emerging Russian ballet superstar whose career ends abruptly after an horrific on-stage accident. In debt for her State-supported flat and medical expenses, she is recruited by her uncle for training at a Russian intelligence-run ""whore-school"" that produces elite female spies skilled in seduction and torture. She is assigned to uncover a mole working for the Americans and her target source of information is CIA operative Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton). A personal relationship develops that was not covered in whore-school curriculum and Dominika becomes a double-agent with hopes of defecting to America, if she survives.The classic spy thriller keeps you guessing who can be trusted right up to the final scene, but this one focuses more on our heroine's appearance under unusual circumstances. Dominika is quick to expose her flesh and sexual charms in pursuit of her quarry, and she has no qualms about smashing heads or surgically removing skin from uncooperative victims. On the one hand, her performance is commendable for its icy bravado and lack of emotion, but on the other, her expressionless plasticity makes it difficult to warm to her. The chemistry between Dominika and Nate is tame at best, and the only moments when she appears human is when showing tenderness towards her ailing mother. It is a challenge finding anyone likeable in this film and the fake Russian accents add a comical element to their performance. Even the addition of luminaries like Jeremy Irons and Charlotte Rampling fails to raise the movie beyond a modest B-grade effort.Of course, there will be viewers who enjoy seeing Jennifer Lawrence bare all in the name of art, and many will find the classroom sex tutorials titillating. Others may question whether repetitive sex and violence are a worthy platform for celebrating talented women, or if it is fair play to depict Russian female operatives as graduates of the oldest profession. But those questions are far too serious for a film that is more about appearance than substance.",Red Sparrow

'Red Sparrow' had been castigated for unnecessary violence and sexual scenes and implications. This may be true, and I have to admit some of the scenes and narratives are too disturbing, not just hard to watch but hard to comprehend. Sexpionage itself is uncomfortable topic because it exploits and undermines the dignity of sex. However, the story involving Dominika's double espionage and double identity and Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of her are so entertaining and perfect. The whole 140 minutes pass by really fast while focusing on the path of finding a mole, on figuring out where Dominika's loyalty lies, and on her relationship with Nash and his uncle. The twist at the ending especially deserves the compliment because it signifies her loyalty, her decision, her resolution, and her revenge. Perfect ending for those who has been rooting for her for more than two hours. 'Red Sparrow' is totally worth of watching it again. It has received all the hate it does not deserve.",Red Sparrow
137,socrates99,This is a badly conceived project with few redeeming aspects,5,3 March 2018,"Though I'm a fan of Ms Lawrence and wouldn't fault her performance all that much, this film's attempt to portray Russia as the home of overly cruel spymasters doesn't ring very true to me. It smells of over-the-top propaganda hoping to cast Russia as some soulless country without moral compass. If the US were given this treatment, we would all see through the overwrought bias. But as Russia is in the news, we tend to tolerate this kind of hyperbole.At the start I really couldn't picture Ms Lawrence as a Russian for some reason. But she does a fairly good job of bringing her role to life, despite a lame accent. Quickly, however, I started to wish I had read the book first. There's a buildup and then a middle act that the director pretty much bungles. The problem is Red Sparrow's psyche is not well delineated during a crucial time in the story. All the plot elements are there but they're deliberately not gathered together. Why, I have no idea, as the story might have been much more compelling if played out under better direction. But then that might have been how the book does it.Anyway, I was sorry to have missed Bruce Willis' new movie by the time it was over. It was also opening this weekend. Red Sparrow didn't work for me on several levels but I doubt Ms Lawrence's career takes much of a hit.",Red Sparrow
138,frukuk,Failed Fledgling,1,15 November 2020,"Somebody should be inspecting that spy school, because the curriculum is severely flawed. Only two things seems to be taught: how to ""magically"" tell what people want, so they can be seduced into willingly divulging their secrets; how to hide things in such a way that anyone else who has taken the same training will be able to locate the hiding place immediately. (One thing they really need to be taught is that, when taking down an armed adversary, it's essential to make sure they stay down; don't just wound them so they're able to get back up and inflict worse damage on you and your compatriot.)This is all very plot driven, rather than character driven, and the plot is very weak. Perhaps I wasn't giving this the attention it required -- as opposed to deserved -- but I struggled, as this progressed, to work out if R Sparrow was an agent, a double-agent or a triple-agent.You'd be much better off watching a single episode of ""The Americans (2013)"" than this turkey.",Red Sparrow

144,kgprophet,Prostitute or Super Spy?,6,4 March 2018,"This movie is based on a novel. It can be tough to translate the body of a novel into a movie. 50 Shades of Grey is an example. The book is a spy thriller. The sexual aspect of the tradecraft goes back to ""From Russia With Love"". I remember ""The Debt"", also dealt with spies falling in love with each other. It was not interesting the same reason I don't find soap operas interesting. The film version of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" depicted the Soviet Union back in the 1970s as a cold and harsh intelligence agency that would easily kill one of their own if necessary. This film visits the mythical spy school that creates sexual bait to blackmail the enemy in the name of the state. However, you would think the break up of the Soviet Union would have retired that style of cold warfare. Evidently not. Red Sparrow takes place in present day. The movie indicates that our heroine played by Jennifer Lawrence is merely a puppet to be manipulated by those who want personal gain at her expense. It sounds more like the rampant sex trade that exists in Russia and other nations than a super spy. I figured the extra running time (2 hours and 20 min) had mostly to do with including more of what was in the novel. I think the depiction of the sex school is what will make or break audiences on this film. It feels surreal, like a strange science fiction set (makes me think of Zardoz or other sexually oriented fiction from the early 1970s). Meanwhile we also follow what is to be the male hero in our story, Joel Edgerton, a CIA agent that may or may not have the machismo to lure a valuable female spy. They are to meet in Budapest, something that the CIA recognises as an attempt to get secret info from Edgerton. There is a moment at this point in the movie where several subplots appear. Lawrence's roommate in Budapest has a secret plan as another sex spy. The spy ringleader in Budapest has his own agenda. The different members of Russia intelligence have their own agenda. The story bounces between these subplots as Lawrence blows up expectations in order to preserve her life. One question that the audience may wonder about is how come when Lawrence's loyalty is questioned, her mother isn't used by the State for leverage. Another is how the pieces of a puzzle that consist of the final plot twist are a little too convenient. I found myself willing to go into extra innings due to the extra plot twists. Lawrence does well not telegraphing her real intentions. The movie also is put together well, making good use of the locations in Hungary. There are also a couple good shocks in the film, doing well to catch the audience off guard as some of the characters meet their doom.",Red Sparrow
145,Tak005,Conflicting,6,9 May 2019,"The film effectively is about female Russian agents being trained to use their sexuality to achieve their goals. It is quite explicit and disturbing how they are trained to complete these roles. Following their completion of their training it also becomes quite violent. Whilst it may appear truthful how these women are trained and operate, it is disturbing for the same reasons. So on the one hand the story is intriguing on the other hand it is upsetting.

147,shanayneigh,Subtle,1,9 July 2018,"I gave it my best try, but I couldn't finish this movie. Red Sparrow is basically La Femme Nikita with wooden acting, dodgy faux Russian accents and lifeless direction.At first I thought this movie was a period piece given the look of ""Russia"" in this movie. The only thing more bleak and drab than the Russians themselves were the lifeless olive green and sickly urine yellow interiors like in Lawrence's apartment and the school where nothing seems to have been made post 1963. You do know Russia is a modern country, right?Having been involved with dance for many years, I have to say that Lawrence as the curviest ballerina in dance history was quite jarring and took me right out of the picture. She was was not believable as a ballet dancer. Look at Natalie Portman in Black Swan and you're closer to the truth. Stuff happens and Lawrence's evil uncle (I can only assume he's evil since he's a dead ringer for Putin - real subtle, guys) enrolls her in rape school which is led by a steely headmistress who is as much of a coldhearted automaton as any of the Russian characters in this movie. Halfway or so through the school sequence is where I gave up. I had no feelings whatsoever towards the main character (or any other character for that matter) and the story was incredulous beyond repair.This movie brings back memories of thinly veiled propaganda movies from the Cold War period where valiant Americans and nefarious Russians faced off. Not much has changed.",Red Sparrow

This was someone's dream project ruined by absolutely terrible casting. It hurt the movie a lot, it was very clear.Number two, the Sparrow school didn't make sense, nor did it really seem to be important to the movie. Why train people to do this job? Seems like there are others who could easily step into the role without training. Worst thing about the whole thing was, no one at the school seemed to know what they were there for, from the one girl being horrified about performing oral sex to the guy who tried to rape Ekaterina, only to be beaten up, given the chance to do her and failing to get aroused. The whole thing was a set-up to preach about rape being about power, not sex. As a guy, I'm sorry, that's just bunk made up by women who don't know how men think.The whole Sparrow School thing is dropped and Ekaterina is dropped into the real world to perform missions again, and the plot just devolves into a convoluted mess that I could probably understand if I cared to, but I don't.Very weird movie.",Red Sparrow

150,ginocox-206-336968,"A mix of cerebral spy thriller, chick flick and exploitation with a miscast lead",8,18 April 2018,"Red Sparrow (2018) combines elements of cerebral spy thrillers like Tinker Tailor SoldiervSpy (2011) and Spy Game (2001), with chick flick sensitivities and tropes, and a liberal dash of 1970 cinematic exploitation. Jennifer Lawrence seems miscast in the role of a Bolshoi ballerina. While deserving applause for having the self-confidence to disrobe for the camera, she lacks the taut musculature of a professional dancer, especially a prima ballerina. At 175 cm, she's above the height limit for many ballet companies. She's pretty in a girl-next-door sort of way, but doesn't have the stunning, haunting beauty of an archetypical femme fatale or the physical strength to defeat an athletic attacker who seems to outweigh her by twenty-five kilos, even armed with makeshift brass knuckles. Her fans may consider her performance subtly nuanced, but others may find it one-note, or possibly two-note: I am hurting inside and angry at the world, and I am hurting outside and angry at the world. Natalie Portman underwent rigorous training for Black Swan and reportedly cut twenty pounds from an already trim frame. She looked every bit the part of a prima ballerina. Lawrence doesn't look, act or move like a dancer. She doesn't even stand with the poise of a dancer. She was good in Silver Linings Playbook (2012), as a quirky girl-next-door, but that's her look, a chick flick rom-com heroine, like Sandra Bullock or Doris Day. Pretty, but not stunningly gorgeous. Feminine but not super hot. An actress mid-American women can relate to, without feeling threatened.Charlotte Rampling plays the headmistress of a school which trains young men and women to seduce and betray foreign officials. It seems reminiscent of movies from the 1960s, like Our Man Flint (1966). Repeat after me: I am a pleasure unit. My sole purpose is to provide pleasure to my master. The students wear proletariat work clothes, until instructed to strip naked and engage in sex before the class, at which point the female refuses and the matron tells them it's okay, they can learn to pick locks instead. The students are cautioned never to reveal their true names, even if one is a celebrity that everybody recognizes. The plot is actually very good, with plenty of artifice, shifting allegiances, misdirection, betrayal, etc. The film has a strong recurrent theme of betrayal. The protagonist is deceived and betrayed, then wreaks revenge by becoming a master at deceit and betrayal. Strong performances by Joel Edgerton, Matthias Schoenaerts and Jeremy Irons. Good production values. Refreshing lack of distracting jiggly-cam shots.",Red Sparrow

152,kaptenvideo-89875,Jennifer Lawrence wants to be a sexy spy. Of course we want to see it!,7,16 March 2018,"Jennifer Lawrence is certainly one fine young movie star but somehow her performances have always struck me as kind of lacking in heart - at least after becoming really famous in ""The Hunger Games"".It's partly but not mainly about that she comes across as distant or emotionless (although some of her characters have asked for that). It just feels like something in her as an actress has not developed or opened up yet.I like everything about her - the acting range, the role choices and how she looks - but then again I never feel like she's really authentic and putting herself out there for the movies. Maybe it's just me?Nevertheless, Lawrence's constant state of guarded-ness works well for the role of Russian spy in ""Red Sparrow"". She's also not shy about sharing her ""bodily charms"" on screen which even helps make it more memorable than it is.I'd argue that the physical attractiveness part is so important here than if the movie had been released 20 years ago, it would have become famous like Sharon Stone and ""Basic Instinct"". Too bad that it's 2018 when naked bodies and sex are everywhere, so Lawrence's confident and cool sexy role will not gather that much attention.It's also difficult to gather much attention in spy movie world these days, because there's a high number of those being produced constantly, including action, thriller, drama and comedies.If one has to place it somewhere, ""Red Sparrow"" would fall into thriller category, although it has some drama and action, and the action scenes turn surprisingly and stomach-churningly violent indeed.Another relatively rare thing about the project is using Russian spies and spymasters as central characters and letting the known actors speak with light faux Russian accent all the time.What would probably feel laughable with lesser cast and director turns out just such fine using actors as Lawrence, Ciaran Hinds, Charlotte Rampling, Jeremy Irons and Matthew Schoenarts.(There are also solid supporters such as Joel Edgerton and Thekla Reuten, so not everybody sounds the same.)Thanks to confident actors, this approach works well enough to avoid falling into camp category. There's no joking around, everybody means business both behind and in front of the camera, and you will buy it because they seem to believe in it themselves. Which is good enough.There's only one notable problem with the movie - it's such a mainstream endeavour that doesn't really stand out from the crowd of all kinds of good enough modern spy movies which have been released during this decade.Almost nobody in the genre wants to concentrate on proper character and world building, and the result is they all feel kind of same-y.""Red Sparrow"" would probably win by being a bit shorter too. There's not too much filler content (although almost the entire final act feels like one) but it's still long at 140 minutes. And we don't even get enough interesting backstory for the she-spy and the world she's living in, including the relationship with her powerful relative.The biggest letdown is the titular heroin who remains beautiful but bland as any successful spy should. But anybody who has seen more than a couple of recent spy movies will probably yearn for some depth, realizing that there's not much point to care about her. Just watch and be moderately entertained.The character development remains limited and whatever one might think of her during watching, the authors will try to twist it into something ""surprising"" in the final act, making the previous journey together matter even less.Thus, the emotional stakes never reach particularly high and one can just hope for some passable entertainment. But there's a lingering potential to be more than that in this otherwise well-made thriller.",Red Sparrow
153,Miles-10,Sex and Death,8,6 March 2018,"At the outset it occurred to me that this would be a movie about sex and death, and that is exactly what it is. Jennifer Lawrence proves to be a real actress. The characters are cold but the movie tells you believably why they are that way. Espionage has never been portrayed so unglamorously. (Well, maybe in ""The Spy Who Came In from the Cold"".) The plot twist at the end, though evidently not faithful to the book, is clever and shows just how cynical and calculating spies have to be to stay alive.Some say there is no Russian in this movie? Other than Joel Edgerton speaking Russian to Jennifer Lawrence in the middle of the movie, I think Joel's first line in the movie is ""Kofe, pozhal'sta,"" which means, of course, ""Coffee, please."" Follow this rule, moviegoers: If Russians are talking to each other, assume that they are speaking Russian, but if Russians are speaking to Americans, assume they are speaking English unless they are actually speaking Russian and have subtitles underneath the picture.",Red Sparrow

Not to say that it was amazing in any ways but it really just was a decent spy thriller with hard R violence and gore, certain scenes of the movie was completely cringing to behold. Nonetheless, I was surprised by the good time that I actually had with Red Sparrow. Obviously, it isn't groundbreaking in any ways and the normal conventions of a spy thriller was used but seeing as it was just well acted and intriguing viewers can be hooked into the story and buy into the quote on quote twist at the end of the film. Because of Jennifer Lawrence's brilliant portrayal this film actually is a good watch. Red Sparrow also takes several bold choices, really pushing the envelope in some cases when it comes to its sex and violence. But in this case, I think it worked, it wasn't just to get some sort of audience reaction but rather served a purpose of telling this brutal story and the harsh conditions that are faced by Jennifer Lawrence's character. Well executed, filmed and acted resulting in a fairly decent film in which audiences could forgive its lack of a meaningful story.",Red Sparrow
156,asifahsankhan,"Lawrence gives a ""Star"" performance!",8,2 April 2018,"Jennifer Lawrence's Red Sparrow spy is surely, no James Bond. Or Jason Bourne. Or Jack Bauer. Or even, for the older folks, Emma Peel. But that's all good.Based on Jason Matthews' novel, the actress stars as a Russian rookie secret agent who's more liable to use sex as a weapon than, say, a switchblade in her stiletto - though the film is still plenty violent. Red Sparrow veers from its genre by focusing on methodical spycraft and juggling emotions; unlike Charlize Theron in last year's Atomic Blonde, Lawrence is seducing people instead of kicking them in the face.Though the film may tickle a little, but in contrast to pumped-up espionage potboilers like ""Atomic Blonde"" or ""Salt,"" Charlize Theron and Angelina Jolie have gone through the motions of imitating male action stars at their most kick-ass grandiose. They're slickly ""empowered"" women, yet it's hard to distinguish that power from the thriller-video decadence of 21st-century action filmmaking.In the elegantly tense and absorbing ""Red Sparrow,"" on the other hand, Jennifer Lawrence portrays a cunningly desperate human being - or, at least, enough of one that each scene rotates around the choices she makes, the way she appraises and seizes the destiny of the moment.

157,ferdinand1932,Hollow,3,25 April 2018,"Ostensibly this is an example of excellence in film entertainment with leading actors, proven quality in all the technical areas and professional talent executed throughout. However, the certainty of this judgement doesn't fit with the experience of the film. The film is pleasant visually but the story is a hackneyed piece of stale Cold War espionage - replete with Russkie accents straight out of Get Smart; that 1960s parody of all Cold War spy movies. The movie pivots between sex, physical pain and some lengthy explanation to move onto the next phase in its structure. But even with an updated, more candid, sexual angle which is about as erotic as a week old fish in St Petersburg's Kuznechny Market, the pulse barely rises. The rhythm of the narrative lurches between dull but necessary plot exposition/transition episodes through to the deliberate fulfillment of the plan. 
The plotting demands acceptance of the incredible, of the nearly miraculous strategic mental capabilities of the protagonist. The apparent complexity to the plot is intended to add layers of intrigue; hey, it's a spy movie after all, but it actually loads the finished product with reams of material that is a dead weight. 
Like so many movies of its ilk it has to deliver a trick, yet another twist, which may surprise and excite a goldfish, but otherwise looks strained, exhausted and unfulfilling. The question arises whether the Russians ever made similar espionage movies and the answer is, they didn't. They didn't innovate and were still beating Nazis while Westerners were being made familiar with the tropes of this genre over 50 years ago. By now it is a certainty that some innovation is way past overdue in the West.",Red Sparrow

159,Gresh854,"Strong Filmmaking, Mediocre Development",5,10 August 2018,"A majority of the filmmaking formalities behind Red Sparrow can be best described as solid effort. This features solid directing, solid performances, solid dialogue, solid tension building, solid atmosphere construction, and just an overall solidly crafted enigma. There isn't anything super special about it's technical approach, but it concisely works well. The story isn't explained obviously, and actually asks the viewers to pay attention to current events in order to follow along with the story, which I profoundly appreciated considering I respect films that don't treat their audiences as if they are idiots. Now, concerning the controversy behind the film, my personal opinion about issues like this is that despite how tough specific material may be expressed, especially in cinematic or novella format, an artist sometimes needs to use ominous visuals or subject matters in order to make their messages more apperent and belivable, so in many cases it's hard for me to get offended when an artist is just trying to make their film more effective (its sort of like how I perceived some of the hard to bear and truly nauseating sequences explored in David Fincher's The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo). Even though, I would've preferred not seeing some of these particular scenes in Red Sparrow, at the end of the day, I learn and train myself to just accept that the overarching product is only just a movie, and that I shouldn't take it too seriously considering the fictional finatics behind it. Plus, it's not like the film is trying to glorify rape and torture, it's more so trying to show the terrors and disorder behind its existence in human society. If you are sensitive to the material however, I highly, highly recommend passing on this film. Now, my real issue with the film is more so the fact that I couldn't find enough substance to maintain a completely entitling and bearable attentiveness to the film's story. There isn't enough meat on the bones in this movie. It's just a decent story that drags and drags, and by the end of it, you're just kind of numb to what's occured. Okay, maybe you've been disturbed but by the end of it, the experience doesn't feel memorable. It's got a neat twist at the end of it, but by the time it happens, my mind kind of just shrugs it off a couple minutes after my viewing concludes. In no way is Red Sparrow as awful as people like to make it out to be, it's actually, I'd say, more fresh than rotten. In conclusion, it isn't anything I'd ever see again, however, I respect Francis Lawrence for making an unconventional spy thriller that you don't often see being made during these modern times.

She carried the film really well and made her character really interesting to follow and route for in a strange way. Joel Edgerton is always good value recently and he again doesn't disappoint, plays the role really well. Even though I must say he has not got so much to do as Lawrence's character or any of the emotional trauma that she goes through, but still good.Story was really interesting from start to finish, won't say anything about the twist because I'll keep this non-spoiler but it is very satisfying for the story and the characters. It will definitely make you think of all the little details that you didn't pick up on the first time round.Overall it 75% out 100 or 7.5 out 10 its almost very good, Im not to disappointed that I missed seeing it at the cinema cause it wouldn't really add anything to the film.

164,ctowyi,A frigid and turgid dish,6,4 March 2018,"Jennifer Lawrence plays a Russian secret service operative who gets raped, endures an attempted rape, gets beaten, gets a black eye, slashed, stabbed, gets a gun put to her head, has to strip in front of dozen pairs of indifferent eyes and has a man died on top (and inside) of her. Sounds like a helluva thriller if I put it that way. However, it turned out to be a totally bland experience. I am filing this under the ""trailer is better than the movie"" category.The movie starts rather well. Cross-cutting tensely between two characters in two separate locations in Russia, the opening has pizazz and attitude, but it quickly simmers down to a lull. Granted this is not a spy thriller in the mold of The Bourne Trilogy and more in the plaintive vein of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Francis Lawrence's fourth outing with Jennifer Lawrence doesn't even strive to be at least exciting. So much is at stake and everything seems to fall on both Lawrences' shoulders, but just like the perennial cold Russian weather, they serve up a frigid and turgid dish.Jennifer Lawrence puts in a professional and fearless performance and in one chilling moment performs a difficult scene with aplomb. It is a scene that takes a lot of guts to bring to life and you will know it when you see it. But her character is painted with little guile and her cold exterior is impenetrable. Her character is humanised by her love for her bedridden mother and every time she appears the heavy-handed mawkishness nearly pushed me into a near-diabetic coma. Why can't her character motivation be painted differently? So I am to gather that she messes up men for noble reasons? Cliché.For a movie that mixes spycraft with erotica, Red Sparrow doesn't do either particularly well. The narrative sidesteps into clandestine territory with vague purpose and the cards are held so close to Lawrence's ample chest that it is difficult to sense who her allegiance is to or her cunning wileness. The cloak and dagger intrigue and mental chess games are not on par with the best spy movies that have graced our consciousness like Munich or The Bourne Trilogy, so much so that when the final denouement arrives it touches down with little impact.In terms of erotic drama, Lawrence and Edgerton have zilch chemistry. It begins well enough at the swimming pool, but I find it hard to buy into their relationship and the huge stakes involved. A movie like this rise or fall on their on-screen chemistry, but their pairing left me cold. When it should sizzle with sultry energy, it barely purrs like a malnourished pussycat.At a runtime of 139 minutes, nothing of note happens and my mind isn't engaged by all the espionage manoeuvrings. Violence comes in bright red flashes, but isn't compelling in terms of stakes when characters are so uninterestingly drawn. It is a shame because the story offers up so much promise (I am currently reading the book and I hate to say this, but the book is better). On top of needing a tighter edit to quicken the pace, what Red Sparrow needs is a better storyteller. As it is, this is just an unmemorable and mostly functional ""point A to point B"" fare. Imagine if the film were to be helmed by a director who could gel all the elements into an organic beast. Now, that would be a film blooded in crimson and Jennifer Lawrence would have disrobed for a worthier film.",Red Sparrow

In reality no such thing would be needed: for a lot of blokes the mere offer of sex with an attractive woman would be enough, without all the emotional gymnastics; and if not, as The Americans shows us, there are other ways to lean on 'em.And in fact, the 'Sparrow' aspect plays little part once the story gets up and running - which it eventually does. It feels as if the author merely believed it was needed to liven up what is otherwise a humdrum seen-it-before spy thriller, of the John Le Carre type but not as good. Other than - almost - full frontal nudity from Jennifer Lawrence, the most notable thing about it is that it's the first film to acknowledge explicitly that the new Russia has reverted to much the same attitudes and activities as the old Soviet Union.

None of this comes off as a storytelling mechanism, instead, it just ends up being exploitative action that tries to sustain your waning attention from its overlong runtime and dull plot. Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) is one of Russia's top ballet dancers, but all of that changes when a gruesome stage accident breaks her leg and ruins her career. Desperate to be able to afford taking care of her sick mother, Dominika reluctantly agrees to become an agent for the state and to be trained to become a ""Sparrow"", young soldiers who use sexual tactics to get close and eliminate high-value targets. Heading the program is Matron (Charlotte Rampling), who breaks and molds Dominika into the perfect sexual soldier. Her first mission, which is being led by her devious uncle (Matthias Schoenaerts), is to track down and get close to CIA agent Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton), who is hiding out in Istanbul. Nash has a contact within the KGB that is feeding him state secrets, something the Russian government fears will make them fall behind in the new Cold War. The plot has been done before and better by a multitude of films, most notably 2011's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. There's a revolving door of sets as we trot around the globe in a game of cat and mouse. None of the locations are that interesting and, except some nice touristy shots, feel like they are only included for name value. The film fails quite miserably to act on its main theme of female empowerment. Dominika is never once given the chance to be empowering or independent since the whole time she is being controlled by someone else. This is quite the surprise as director Francis Lawrence worked with star Jennifer Lawrence on the last three Hunger Games films. You would think he would know how to use her to fulfill his purpose.Director Lawrence also feels like he is overcompensating here. His overuse of action and sex takes away from the already conventional plot, something I don't think Lawrence knew when he was doing it. I think he felt he had a smart story that could be boosted by hard action. But what he really had was an overlong run of the mill spy caper that, apart from a pretty good ending, is dampened by cheap thrills that come off as a poor attempt to get a reaction.The two stars, Lawrence and Edgerton, each give adequate performances to make up for their inadequate characters. They work fine independently in separate locations, but together they don't mesh well. Their relationship feels very forced and fake, which can be attributed to the director as much as the actors. The film does bolster a surprisingly large supporting cast of established actors. The problem is that none of them really get enough material to make themselves stand out. Schoenaerts and Rampling do the best, mostly because I could actually remember their characters names once the film was over. Jeremy Irons and Ciaran Hinds fall into the background as stereotypical Russian officials that have no interesting traits. They both do a fine job, but it doesn't really matter in the end.Red Sparrow sells itself on being a spy film for adults, one with a complex plot and hard edge action. That promise never comes to fruition because we learn instead that this film is nothing more than a generic spy thriller with a lot more unneeded violence. My review is sounding very harsh on the film, mostly because it's really easy to point all the things this film does wrong. Overall, it's passable, but not memorable.",Red Sparrow
168,JurijFedorov,"It's not bad, but there is one scene I really hated",6,2 October 2021,"I initially didn't really want to watch the movie for 3 reasons. 1 it didn't get a great reception at all. 2 the fake Russian accents when they speak English is nonsensical. They speak English all the time with this accent. At least they could maybe speak regular English when they were supposed to speak actual English and not fake Russian? 3 Jennifer Lawrence is an actress I just don't trust. Her lazy performance in X-Men was a big black spot in the movies and you really cannot trust such a person to deliver a good performance unless she somehow wants to so I have to guess if she wants to or not. She was totally arrogant about the X-Men role and other roles making me not really trust that she is a focused or smart actress. She made the discussion about the paycheck not the role. But she has done amazing work in Passenger for example.The movie turned out to actually be a decent spy flick and not as bad as I assumed it would be. There are some good tension-filled scenes here. And the Russian accents are not as irritating as you'd assume. They didn't really take away from the product. It's a 7/10 spy thriller, but it does have some issues. It's a complicated plot where you never know who wants what. That makes it hard to root for any side. They did it to add some mystery, but it just makes us not care for the people which is a 10 times bigger issue. There are also overblown scenes that are completely unrealistic. This is nothing how spy work works. This is not even how USSR spy work works. This is an exaggerated version of KGB, but just way worse. What they do in this movie could start a war. It's completely insane and nonsensical. All Hollywood. You also have scenes that are not connected. We see one scene and then the characters are in another city or doing something totally different and you wonder what the hell happened. They also spoke about secret matters in their apartments not even caring about any mics as they don't exist in this universe.But why I gave it a 6 instead of 7 is because it has a disgusting torture scene in it. I'm not a fan at all. I get that some may not find it too horrible. It's just that I personally dislike watching this stuff so I rate such movies lower. For most adults this would be a fine enough watch, but nothing hugely fun. The plot unfolds behind the scenes. You won't really follow the plot it will be releveled at the very end. At that point I'm not impressed. Sure you kept this hidden from the viewer. But I would be way more impressed if you made a really fun movie instead of thinking you made a really clever one. Overall I did enjoy watching it in most scenes, but I won't really be recommending it unless you don't mind R rated stuff.",Red Sparrow

171,edicionccq,"""Red Sparrow"" is a movie that exists.",3,7 December 2019,"Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress; this movie is a satisfactory evidence of this. Red Sparrow is all about her and the espionage game. Full of twists and sex and I didn't like it.The first part of the movie about she being trained is beautiful because how raw and cruel it is. Watching Dominica (Lawrence) learning of the training to use her abilities for this work is just an astonishing part of the movie. But when it comes to the actual mission of the film, it got short. I mean, it's extremely long but it's slow and you can lose focus easily.The pacing and the visuals are moderately wrong for me. It feels so slow pace and so boring directed. I'm not an expert in cinema. This is just my opinion.",Red Sparrow
172,Nightmarelogic,This wasn't as bad as I heard it was,6,11 March 2019,I considered not watching this because it got pretty weird reviews. I heard it was overly and overtly violent and not in the good way horror movies are. I finally decided to put in on my Netflix queue and settled in to watch it and actually found the majority of it an interesting story. Yes some of it was unnecessary sexual and unnecessary violent and there was a bit of torture porn in there for good measure but it was an interesting story and a pretty good spy thriller.I dropped a point for the torture porn but other then that I liked the story of a young russian dancer who after a tragic accident is forced into the Russian spy community in part to keep her sick mother in decent medical care. The cloak and dagger stuff is interesting especially since the men continue to think of her as a victim and she continues to prove she is anything but.This is by no means perfect but it does not deserve the poor reviews it has gotten.,Red Sparrow
173,torrascotia,Not for the squeamish.,7,3 March 2018,"Having watched this on a preview screening I have been aware of some of the backlash against this movie...from people who haven't seen it. It seems that Jennifer Lawrence has a few haters for some odd reason and this seems to be colouring the feedback from this movie.
Red Sparrow tells the story of a ballerina who by a twist of fate is forced to become a spy. What is different about this movie is that this is a gritty and realistic spy movie, the book was written by someone who had first hand experience of this world. 
The spies are taught to manipulate through using their bodies which mirrors real life however the online backlash seems to promote the idea this is a sexist idea by the studios. They live and die on their wits, theres no James Bond style gadgets on show.
The violence is this movie is extreme and sadistic as it depicts torture. I was very surprised this was not an 18 rating in the UK. However the violence is not one sided, males and females both dish out and receive violence so its gender balanced. 
The film keeps you engaged and as long as you havent read the story you will be surprised by the many plot twists and turns.
This is an old fashion cold war era spy movie which relies on a solid story with great acting and almost zero special effects or overly-choreographed fight scenes and explosions. Its almost the polar opposite of Atomic Blonde, its a spy movie for grown ups and I would recommend it if you enjoy tense movies with good storyline. You may however wish to look away from the screen on more that one occasions.",Red Sparrow

Woman is trained to be a super soldier who then dares to think outside the box and things fall into place. Very predictable.

178,Dr_Mark_ODoherty,Very good spy film about current challenges in Russia.,10,20 April 2021,"Very good and dramatic film; being symbolic about current challenges in Russia, I think. However, in my opinion, one drawback of this intense spy thriller is that the portrayal of the Russian spy apparatus is rather pessimistic and nihilistic - lacking a humanistic and uplifting angle, I think. The whole story is very serious, set in Moscow and Vienna, spy capital of the world... Having had some contacts with female Russian spies in Vienna myself, I can safely say that they are not that fixated on manipulation and extraction as depicted in this film; and actually can be quite funny and amusing - even though I also think, in my experience, that female Russian spies may focus too much on sex, and not put enough emphasis on romance, when initiating contact with a person of interest - just as depicted in 'Red Sparrow' :)",Red Sparrow

Whether she's playing the leader of a revolution in The Hunger Games or a metaphorical Mother Nature in mother!, Lawrence is known for being as much of a chameleon with her acting as her character of Mystique is in the X-Men franchise. With Red Sparrow, Lawrence portrays Dominika, a desperate woman looking to take care of her sick mother, and will do this by any means necessary. The means are becoming a Red Sparrow, a special Russian operative who uses his or her body in order to seduce people for the betterment of the country. Dominika's task is to get close with an American CIA agent, played by Joel Edgerton. But it is never quite clear as to which side she is truly on, as she expertly plays both sides in this increasingly tense battle over intelligence between the two countries.

But it really isn't anything like that. Its not quite along the lines of Tinker Tailor, or Bridge of Spies, perhaps more like excellent TV show 'The Americans'. You really do have to pay attention to details to get the most out of the slow-burning story, and there ARE subtle levels of depth to be unpicked in appreciating motives. It doesn't treat the audience like a bunch of morons, which is getting rarer. People whinge about Jennifer Lawrence's russian accent but then when don't people whinge about any accents in films? It was fine. Overall I found the tone/vibes refreshingly different (perhaps because they were more gritty old-school than modern Netflixy like everything seems to be these days).

She is imminently watchable, with lots of emotional diversity and on screen magnetism. On this film, it lacked emotional depth and was poorly written in some areas, with lots of gratuitous violence.

This one was close enough to yes to both questions. I know there is argument about the accents, but it was for an English speaking audience and it did make me believe (unlike Margot). The story felt confusing but not to the point of getting lost. Great period sets and I love when movies sell themselves on cleverness instead of technology. JL has some serious acting chops and a couple of things really surprised me. I think one was a huge push back regarding her stolen pictures some years ago and she did it in style (watch the movie to see what I mean). She carried the movie exceptionally well and could easily have dropped the ball, she didn't.
It would have got a higher score from me if it wasn't trying a little too hard to be clever and the characters hadn't made some questionable decisions. But I enjoyed it and that's what counts, and I didn't see the ending coming.

It's a glossy exploitation film in many ways, and I found it a bit too convoluted at times. But at least it takes itself seriously, has a vision, and ""goes for it"", if you will.

191,jeannefrancoise,"We only need past truth to create new truth, not new lies to cover past lies",8,1 March 2018,"Dear readers, Red Sparrow is definitely an acting and intelligence movie. Acting term here is because there are some scenes that are really hardcore, intriguing, sadistic, full of blood, and I think they employ some stunts. Also the audience would already guess that this is an intelligence movie while watching the trailer. Well, these movie is about actions, tricks, sex, smartness, betrayal, and an unexpected ending. This is not a movie for children. What makes this movie is so different with other intelligence movie is; If some intelligences movies use some emotions and love as the weakness, this movie positioned that kind of human being feeling as a power to combat enemy. Also if some intelligence movies use sex and women as a tool of power, this movie positioned that stuff as the weakness of intelligence system. Quite contradictory but make sense.
From the first time while we watch the intelligence plots, we can assume that Jennifer Lawrence is the main story, but while other characters are developing, it is her who had created the real main actor. Of course her face is on the poster of the movie and her name is on the first list, but her character is deeper and deeper existed by the existence of other actors and this existence is deliberately made, so slightly and slowly the audience will figure out for whom she is playing for. Moreover, we do not know whether this story based on true events or just imagination, but we can assume that the narration of this movie is coming from the sense of Cold War between two countries, USA and Russia. In this political substance, the Director must explain why there are also some scenes places other than in USA or Russia, but they took some scenes also in Hungary and UK. If there are some scenes in Asian countries, I will give 9 points for this movie, because the story could be more developing if touched with Asian cultures, not just to show the intelligence story of white people power, but also the politics among nations with more complex issues.
Also why I gave this movie point in 8, not 9, is because the bridge of plots is quite easy and so-coincidentally-built. Jennifer Lawrence, a broken-leg ballet dancer and the religious one, became a high spy intelligence with no morality in just three months just because his uncle is working for Russian intelligence. This is quite perfect for me, but I really appreciate her great acting in this movie; she is really talented, sexy, and charming. It is her who makes this movie worth it to be watched. This movie is the combination between Elektra, Black Swan, Munich, and Bridge of Spies as a whole package to give the surprising ending. I also appreciate the wardrobe and audition team who can dress up all the actors as normal as intelligence life, not too much, but fit in like a daily normal life. The actors, including Jennifer Lawrence herself, they have a Russian face and they might be learning Russian accent that clearly showed up when they are speaking English language. Quite impressive. For me, this movie has a message to shows us about old quote; that there is needed new lies to cover past lies; but with the unpredictable ending in this movie, I think we do not need new lies to cover lies, we only need past truth to create new truth, because if we cover lie, someday this lie is being known, but if we create fact, this gonna be fact forever, no matter this is a created-fact, or natural fact.",Red Sparrow

Red Sparrow begins with a lovely dance sequence, but from there it's all a downhill ride on a sled without snow to smooth it out. 
I've never seen or heard of a star ballerina who didn't spend practically every spare moment at home or at the studio practicing, limbering up and try new moves, usually under the tutelage of an instructor. But this gal doesn't have time for that nonsense. She's too busy doing little or nothing aside from a little sex show from time to time.
Finally, after much too long a wait, she came back out and danced some more as the screen darkened.

This is a pretty cartoonish depiction of Russia. They even have a character who was clearly designed to look just like Vladimir Putin.

201,jasontheterrible,Why this excellent film bombed at the box office,10,9 February 2019,"The answer is very plain and simple: it was a think piece from start to finish and it was brilliant. Young people automatically eschew a film if isn't packed with moronic action from start to finish. The idiot who called it torture porn cries when he chips a nail. The one scene that is truly brutal and chilling is nothing compared to the shower scene in ""Eastern Promises"" with Viggo Mortenson and that was an exceptionally brilliant film as well. You will never see the end you get in this one coming. It was amazing. The complaints about Jennifer Lawrence's accent is the director's fault, not hers, if there is a flaw. For some reason her accent is more pronounced in some scenes and less in others. It did not detract from the gritty story and JL's tough yet vulnerable and loving character. She was the jewel in this film, but all the actors were outstanding. If there is one thing that was off-putting just as with most recent films of this genre, it is the lousy mood lighting. It always appears dark, dingy, and dull. I long for the days of thrillers like Hitchcock's that gave us brilliant color inside and outside, day and night with real film. They let all the beautiful color show and bolster the film. The darker scenes brought moodiness but in this film there is little contrast. All these films you cannot see very well are hurt by flat, colorless cinematography. Whatever it does for the feel of the location, it takes away from the reality and enjoyment. Still, a very plausible and gripping story and film.",Red Sparrow
202,DaegT,Typical Hollywood formula,7,29 May 2021,"Many of us have watched a lot of Hollywood version of Russian stereotypes, so it won't be wise to argue about it here, right? No single stereotype in the film is correct, very strange passport names and shop names, poorly illuminated Moscow, etc etc. Well that's pretty much what we have to expect from Hollywood.Apart from all the clichés , the movie is overall quite a good one in every aspect. JLaw has done her role well. Her performance is totally up to my expectation. She is the reason why I give this movie 2 bonus stars.BTW, JLaw's uncle looks so much like Putin!!!

After messing up badly as a dancer, she is invited to take part in Sparrow School. During her time there, she has to go through many trials and tribulations before going on a particular mission. That's all I can remember from this movie because I found it very hard to follow from then on.Lawrence is once again a great actress throughout this movie. Her character's physical strength is put to the test constantly by both her allies and enemies. She is put through many disturbing and torturous practices, such as being lashed multiple times and having water get mercilessly poured down on her. This is supposed to be a sign that her body at that point belongs to the Sparrow School. After the 40-ish minute mark, I feel like the movie starts to go downhill. It becomes this complex spy thriller that I somehow had trouble following. I don't know why this was the case, but I think it's the shift in plot that did the trick.Red Sparrow for the most part really wasn't for me. I enjoyed the first act and how it was handled.

204,Eclectic-Boogaloo,"Red Sparrow is a callous, manipulative bird that you'll either learn to love, or hate.",7,31 March 2018,"It's a film about the ends to which a young woman, a ballerina who's basically forced by circumstances out of her control to sell her body and soul as a spy, will go to pull herself out of slavery, and lead herself and her beloved mother out of the wretches of poverty. The means to those ends made for a cold tumultuous ride that sometimes left me wanting, and other times left me looking at my watch, although I ended up enjoying the film as a whole.As others have more eloquently said it's is an old fashioned adult spy thriller. Its sexiness and romance are only as deep as the protagonist, commendably played by Jenifer Lawrence, would lead you to believe. And she does a lot of that. If you're looking for this movie to be really sexy, or really romantic, you WILL be disappointed.The realization that this movie wasn't what I imagined, neither sexy nor romantic, was basically part of the twists and turns of the film as the ever endearing and seductive lead character pushed all the buttons that her Soviet handlers trained her, like all Sparrows, to do. And as I alluded to in my opening remarks... at times this film was a chore. But the story twisted and turned and finally came together in a way that both re-framed the journey in a more favorable light and gave the lead characters journey a satisfying conclusion.A couple of odds and ends:The supporting cast was very good, despite Jeremy Irons' almost non-existent Russian accent. Joel Edgerton was especially good. I really liked the cinematography, and the Russian, European backdrop was really a breath of fresh air.",Red Sparrow

It was less about becoming a super spy and more about the relationships and intertwining plots of espionage. This film was totally different from what I expected, but that's not to say it wowed me, and that also not to say it wasn't good. I found that writing to be the best part, it was a solid spy story with a little ironic romanticism mixed in there. I was super skeptical about Jennifer Lawrence's performance/accent and it was definitely not as bad as I expected it to be. The story had unique aspects as well as has aspects from classic espionage thrillers. while its not the greatest spy thriller I've ever seen, its still a pretty good.To be honest, I'm not the big fan of Jennifer Lawrence, but I did enjoy her performance in this one. The performance of everyone else wasn't really wasn't anything notable. The cinematography was also pretty average, nothing to really be wowed about. Like I said before, the writing and story are really the most notable parts of the film.

208,cyifly-2,Decent Spy DRAMA,7,28 May 2018,"Red Sparrow is a decent spy drama with a bit of action, worth checking out on DVD or streaming. It plays out more like a drama, so don't be looking for much of a thriller. The script and the acting is decent. It's a little slow in a few different parts and is a little long, but if you like this genre, you should enjoy this one.I recommend you watch it with subtitles, even if your hearing is fine. It makes it easier to understand and follow. After I watched the movie, I read some of the reviews to see if they fell in line with my opinion. There are a lot of people hating on this movie for a variety of reasons. Personally, I disagreed with most. 1. It's true they don't speak Russian in the movie. If they did, you would not have these great stars playing the roles and most Americans would not watch a movie mostly subtitled in Russian. The language is rough-sounding and people would not buy tickets. Same with the accents. The typical American is not going to sit for 2:20, listening to thick Russian accents and barely understanding the plot. You get the point without forcing that on the audience. I think, for coherency's sake, it was a smarter move.2. The violence is hard to watch, but it's not so frequent that it's a major role in the movie. I've certainly seen more in other shows.3. There is some nudity, but not a lot. If you read the reviews before watching the movie, you'd think it was soft porn. It's not. At all. The few times it's there, t's over in a blink. Maybe 10 blinks. Some people freak out if a penis shows up in a movie. It was a blink. JL shows a boob and her butt for about 5 seconds. She walks around a few more seconds in underwear. It's not a big deal. You would think she got spread eagle for Playboy, doing full-frontal by the way people reacted. I thought maybe I missed something.4. It's true that it moves a little slow. It's a drama with a little bit of thrills. But not in a bad way.I recommend it, but - again - only if you like spy dramas - If you are expecting anything else, you will be disappointed.",Red Sparrow
209,c-kelsall,The Cold War just got hotter,8,6 March 2018,"There are no trolls in this film, but there sure are plenty writing 'reviews' of this film, and others. I just don't get it, the hate, and the one-star ratings. It's an increasingly annoying theme afflicting the hallowed pages of IMDb, and probably other movie review sites. In my book (or film reel if you prefer), a film that's one star should be so terrible in EVERY department that it makes any normal person want to weep. The cinematic equivalent of supermarket basics own-brand sponge cake, or a bottle of £2.99 Liebfraumilch. I'm sure you get the picture. Now everyone's got the right to an opinion, but the opinion of a lunatic is not worth a much as that of a sane person. Happily, enough people are recognising the need to put this film in its proper place in the spy movie canon by giving it a good rating; this is the first time I've ever seen a film's rating get better after its release, rather than dropping, which is generally what happens. That's got to be worth something, and what better evidence that some fools got on the back of Red Sparrow before it even had a chance. It's a damn good thing I don't pay much attention to my fellow IMDb reviewers, because frankly an increasing number of you seem to be total a***holes.
Okay, rant over.
Plot in a nutshell. Beautiful (and perhaps spoiled and proud) prima ballerina (Jennifer Lawrence) at the Bolshoi has her career ended in a freak leg-breaking accident. She recovers to find that her sick mother's future is in jeopardy, as she can no longer support the family financially. Her uncle, who works for the Russian security services, offers her a way out of her predicament, with increasingly tangled strings attached. She discovers that she is expected to give herself, body and soul, to the whims of her country's spymasters.
I'm guessing this film might not appeal to Russians, as it's very much 'Russian state BAD, Americans GOOD', but if you're prepared to overlook its obvious bias, there's plenty to enjoy from a traditional-style spy film. Imagine there's a spyness scale, kind of like the Beaufort scale for wind, but in this case the Fleming scale of spyness (it exists now, because I just made it up). A Fleming rating of 1 would be, let's say, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, or maybe Bridge of Spies, while a rating of 10 would be The Bourne Ultimatum, or pretty much any of the Bond films. On the Fleming scale, I'd say Red Sparrow is a 3-4, so not so great if you're obsessed with Bond or Bourne. Don't get me wrong, I love a Fleming 10 as much as the next man, but I also like a 2 or a 3 now and again. Some of the plot elements are a bit of a stretch (the 'accident' which ends Lawrence's ballet career is notable), but mostly I found it believable and absorbing. The way the Russians behave in this film, especially toward each other, may seem entirely unbelievable to some people, but their attitudes as portrayed are on some level born out of a paranoid fear of what we in the West don't understand...like North Korea, or aliens, or Islamic terrorists. The Enemy is always painted in an unfair light in Hollywood, because there have to be inscrutible villains to rail against. So, buy it or don't. It's up to you. Do you want realism, or entertainment? As I think on this, I begin to see why this might be regarded as a Marmite film.
I thought Matthias Schoenaerts (you see I took the trouble to spell his name properly; some losers on here can't even spell Jennifer Lawrence) was excellent as Lawrence's scheming ambitious uncle. Schoenaerts is always good value, with the ability to play sympathetic characters or monsters equally well. In Red Sparrow, he managed to look suspiciously like a sort of younger clone of Putin! I'm not sure if that was intentional in the casting, but it certainly struck me that way. The often excellent Jeremy Irons was rather underused here, but I've seen him chewing the scenery outrageously while taking a paycheque in other films (anyone remember Dungeons & Dragons?). Jennifer Lawrence herself has to carry Red Sparrow, which in my opinion she does pretty well (though I doubt she'll ever top her performance in American Hustle). Her reactions to the different situations she finds herself in seem entirely in keeping with her innate character, but moulded by her gradual accrual of experience in espionage. The one note in this regard which might seem a little off is the Russian security bosses agreeing to allow such a green spy to carry out such an important mission. It would probably never happen. At least her character doesn't display any vastly unrealistic physical skills along the way, except perhaps for powers of healing. Mind you, it seems to me that applies to pretty much every spy film ever made - spies really do appear to be made of tough stuff!",Red Sparrow

Jennifer Lawrence, one of the rare ""KING"" souls who acts in movies, but doesn't direct them (though Tommy Lee Jones comes to mind), has such a command throughout (duh!) that her tall-ness (apart from physical height) keeps your eyes on her and watching her throughout. Howevermuch people know about *the world* is going to affect whether you stick it out with this movie; annoyingly, a lot of reviewers I've seen (or glanced at, really) seem to feel it's up to them to check out, as the film's ""not plausible"" or (really) ""a bummer."" Don't know why ... maybe John le Carré scares them, too? Nothing to be afraid of, and nothing to shrug off, either; this is a creditable film, and I don't like to see it tossed in the wastebin.

In the recruitment of Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence), both by Americans and Russians, her training and torture provide extremely intense and emotional scenes.

As mentioned in the title, it is simply too unrealistic. There is no way that most of these things would ever happen in a real world espionage scenario. And since the goal was - I assume - to produce a serious film, the creators unfortunately failed in that department. It is also super predictable. I am sure you will know how it ends from quite early on and therefore the twists in the final minutes of Red Sparrow will lose the desired effect. Also, almost 140min runtime is a bit too much and I saw quite a few people in the theatre checking their phones which is never a good sign. Not everything was bad though. The direction is solid and the performances are first class. It is hard to expect anything else from such a stellar cast.

It's not a stretch for Jennifer Lawrence to play a trollop but speaking a bit of Russian to make her role more realistic is. Also, Jeremy Iron's Korchnoi is a disappointment. He is supposed to read the book before taking on a role but little remains of Jason Matthews' Korchnoi in the movie. Can Jeremy be short of money? The rest of the cast - forgettable wherever they hail from.Ah, the book. I read the three books and loved each one. They're completely unbelievable but have a certain quirky attractiveness that makes for a good read. There's nothing lofty or classical, just fun. Part of the fun is that Matthews places a recipe at the end of each chapter related to a food item that is consumed in the chapter. Ever wondered what is in Putin's pantry? The trilogy is an ethnic Foodie's tryptych. Because spy movies and Iron Chef don't mix, the movie can't import one of the best features of the books.In the books, Domenika has a superpower that she keeps as a secret to herself and that's what keeps her ahead of her enemies. That could have been incorporated into Red Sparrow easily and kept the movie from becoming the trashy spy knock-off it in fact is at the heart.Finally, the first of the trilogy doesn't have a happy ending (spoiler for the BOOK: Korchnoi is killed at the exchange, not the uncle - he gets his another way. I won't spoil that). Why does Hollywood avoid tragedy. Life is full of it.

A brief description of the people who read it is ""50 shades of kingsman"", ie deviant sex performed by agents of special services in execution. In principle, in this literature there is nothing seditious, if you take it simply as a trash banter.So. Somewhere our days. Ballet. The Bolshoi Theatre). In it - a well-fed prima ballerina (Lawrence). Her uncle is an agent (not secret, everyone knows this). Cold. The gray. Vodka. Angular faces. Thick Brezhnev eyebrows. Russia.One day, Primus Lawrence breaks his leg and finishes with a ballet (a curious spectator is surprised how she has not broken with such wide flops before). Uncle arranges a niece in a secret school of special agents. There, the Gestapo-style of Matron (the character's name), which by forcible viewing of pornography and through public sex scenes, makes ""sparrows"" from recruits that extract information using their attractive appearance and honed oral caresses.Traditionally, the bloody ke-ge-ba confronts their hatched ts-re-y. The agents of the latter fetch the enemy a mile away and put them in their bed with one stack of bristles. And then the traditional fun begins ""find the mole"".In short, the court handed down a typical secret service and special agent detective, abundantly flavored with erotic scenes. Attentive to detail, the viewer can calculate ""mole"" by the middle of the film already. After that you can relax and view the tape through the prism of a light comedy genre.The director did not dare to quote the novel verbatim, but the opaque half-notes very intelligently convey his spirit. ""Red Sparrow"", entangled in the cloaks of the Cold War cliché, is filled with vivid stereotyped ideas about the post-Soviet countries. But its most important disadvantage is in deliberate seriousness. Took part in the adaptation of the semi-pornographic trash, Francis Lawrence did not find the courage to ""ease"" his work and add to it a fraction, say, ""Johnny English."" Instead, all two hours the stone faces of Jennifer's companions in one breath are sipping traditional soup from tovarish, babushka, balalaika, matushka rossija.Like the ""Hunger Games"" with ""Mother"", the story of ""sparrow"" revolves around the main character and allegedly demonstrates the girl's path from the ballerina to the special agent, through hard work on herself in the name of a high goal - mother's help. But it seems that Jennifer Lawrence is exhausted on the ""Mother"" site and has not yet gained her best form. Her character, with one face for all occasions, acts without an emotional tear and does not cause any sympathy. In this film, she is a face from the window, that her forms attract the passing spectator. But the feel of its shape is false, and it itself is made of plastic. Well-made mannequin.In a word, ""Red Sparrow"" is a typical Hollywood cranberry about post-USSR.

This is a well crafted and wonderfully acted spy thriller, full of twists and double crosses that kept me guessing to the end. I'm not a big fan of Jennifer Lawrence, I find her acting style to be somewhat detached, but in this film she is perfectly cast as Dominika, a former Russian ballet dancer who is blackmailed into joining the Sparrows after an injury.
The Sparrows are trained to gather information through seduction, the majority come from the military. Dominika is thrown into this world and is assigned to seduce a US handler and identify the mole he is working with.

Perhaps it works better in the novel, where the actions of the spymasters are confined to the boundaries of one's own imagination. Regardless, a keen eye for editorial discretion is key. Case in point: the ending flirted with sheer brilliance, and audience members might've actually been able to appreciate it had they not been shell-shocked by a bizarre and completely nonsensical incestuous kiss leading up to the finale.",Red Sparrow
229,catschasemice9594,Watchable with caveat,6,12 January 2020,"Not the best nor the worst film. It is uneven in execution. The film takes the time to develop plot and character but doesn't always succeed. The scenes of sex and violence that punctuate the progress of the story distract from this development. There is warning on the IMBD page that there is rape, violence and sexuality so if those elements are something you find repellent don't watch the movie then complain. I fast forwarded a couple torture scenes toward the end. I wouldn't call the film propaganda since both the Russian and Americans had contrasting characters who were flawed in similar ways. This is a movie to watch and forget.",Red Sparrow

232,prolelol,This violent spy film blew me away.,10,18 March 2018,"This movie blew me away! Jennifer Lawrence was so amazing in her insane role. I never thought she would accept to do nudity, but actually did. Since she was terrified and scared of doing this. Jennifer just literally started to star in insane movies. First 'mother!' and then 'Red Sparrow'. Is she's going insane? But however, she really impressed me what she's working. It's an excellent violent spy film with a good story and has 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' vibe.",Red Sparrow
233,garthlotel,Boring and abysmal,1,24 February 2018,"Not even the preposterous storyline manages to make this interesting. Pathetically gratuitous sex and violence doesn't help - the movie is trying way too hard to be edgy, but badly fails. The film is empty, devoid of any kind of genuine feeling, slow, painful and boring. The acting is also lacklustre at best, and none of the actors bother to master an even halfway decent Russian accent. The low-grade arrogance of it all is very insulting to the viewers. 
As always, Lawrence is abysmal and ruins the film for anyone with half a brain who can see this lady has zero acting talent. I am looking forward to seeing other actresses cast in movies once her way over-hyped IT Girl turn is finally over.
p.s. I can't help but notice that most if not all of the positive reviews on here are written by people who have never reviewed any other films. Gee, production company shills, much? The movie is bad. Deal with it and make a better film next time.",Red Sparrow

235,Ioreka,Pretentious,5,26 February 2021,"The film spends a lot of time being dark and mysterious while, in fact, being entirely predictable. If you take a look at the plot elements the complexity of it all is unnecessary and therefore not credible. There's some good sequences, and good performances. But it takes itself too seriously, for what it is, and ends up as pretentious. Meanwhile Jeremy Irons continues to play Jeremy Irons in every role, whatever accent he adopts.",Red Sparrow
236,Unknownian,You really need to pay attention,7,25 December 2019,"The first time I saw this, I didn't have the luxury of subtitles to help me understand the dialog, which is sometimes hard to dissect because of English speaking actors talking with Russian accents. I rated it a 6.My last viewing was on DVD, and I put on the subtitles so as to keep up with the plot. I upgraded my review to a 7. I would give it a 7.5 if IMDb allowed me to.This is not an action spy movie. There are no James Bond moments in it. It is a cold war movie deeply relying on a well thought out plot and twists to carry it through to it's climax. You can't miss a word of it, or the name of a character, or you'll be lost in confusion. This is a thinkers movie. Don't sit down to watch it with your kids. They'll hate it, and there are serious sexual undertones as well as a very naked Jennifer Lawrence. The sex is needed here, because Lawrence's character is part of a sexual driven spy program the Russians call: Red Sparrow.I found this flick to be a welcome relief from the childish drek that Hollywood has been putting out for decades. You'll need an IQ above 80 to really enjoy this piece, and you have to like great stories, and not be an action junkie. If that's you...go watch it, you'll love it.I only found two minor drawbacks to this movie. 1: It is a bit dreary. The sets, the weather, and the locations are dull. Actually, pretty much like we imagine eastern Europe to be like. 2: I felt no chemistry between Lawrence and Joely Richardson who plays her mother. It was almost like Lawrence and Richardson had an off-set argument, and they dragged it onto the set, and never resolved it for the duration of the flick. Strange, because the driving force behind Lawrence's character is to save her sick mother from losing her place to live, and having the Russian State pay for her medical bills.Other than those minor drawbacks,this is a very solid spy thriller.",Red Sparrow
237,MooWoolf1,Better than I thought,7,3 March 2018,"I was invited to watch it but I wasn't really interested and I don't even like the actress. 
But it was a good movie actually. Well made. 
There is a huge plot hole in it but forgiveable.( The plothole is that I have no idea who or what they want to take down I guess Russia or only the russian secret service thing but if the head of that secret service through like 30-40 or 50 years couldn't give any information to the CIA that could stop them I don't know what can and really, I don't understand how they want to do it.. The movie did not cover it )People say it was long I did not feel it long. I wan't thinking about when is it going to end. 1963 Cleopatra is more than 4 hours long and I had no thought about when is it going to end. So maybe it's just me. ( Can't tell anything about accents and other language problems as I watched it in my native language. )",Red Sparrow
238,mafdenver,Good spy thriller,7,15 June 2020,"It's fairly true to the book but has necessary short cuts because the book (first in a trilogy) was a very dense spy thriller. Lawrence was much too chunky to be believable as a ballerina and then as the athletic agent she became. I think without some of the long mood shots, the film could have incorporated what really made Dominika special and a superior operative - she could see people in color, which told her if they were lying, dangerous, happy, etc. It would have been a visually great addition - but understandably time consuming to explain it. The very handsome Nate Nash - I don't get Joel Edgerton as that.",Red Sparrow
239,yavoyavo,A cartoon of easy betrayal,2,18 May 2019,"This film felt like an attempt at a slightly more mature hunger games. Its like she can't shake that franchise because while the film tries for thriller reality, it still feels closer to the cartoon of tween fiction, more Atomic Blonde than Tinker Tailor Soldier SpyNothing is really earned, Jlaw is American, Jlaw is good, of course she's going to flip because waman strong, you know the deal. There is no tension, you only have to figure out what is woke Hollywood approved and the plot is predictable.There seems to be a political tinge to many of the reviews on here, seems like this was some kind of hate pornography for those obsessed with Russia, and so they enjoyed the cartoon of buffoonery while accusing everyone who wasn't impressed as being Russian bots.Anyways, it just comes down to this, when competence is replaced with cruelty, there is no intrigue in a spy vs spy story.",Red Sparrow
240,chrismonkee,It's not that bad,6,22 April 2019,"I only bothered because it had Jennifer Lawrence in it. I have the hots for her, though she's much too young for me.It has it all. Drama, sex, violence, a plot. It's almost John Le Carre like in places. I enjoyed it, though I didn't really care what was going to happen in the end.",Red Sparrow
241,lynansaysingle,Intense Spy Movie,9,31 August 2018,"Jennifer Lawrence prove to be able to do different roles well. Joel Edgerton is also becoming one of the Australian actors that guarantees you a good show. This is a great movie that has action, mystery, and suspense. Good story, good acting and unpredictable. Highly recommend.",Red Sparrow
242,jjlawler-98324,Fun spy thriller,10,10 August 2019,Another hot Jlaw film. Russia provides the backdrop with plenty of harrowing scenes. Several twisted and brutal scenes make it an edge of the seat ride.Thank god for the CIA..,Red Sparrow
243,spinova,It goes well until the end.,8,13 May 2018,"I ever read the book. But the screenplay develops a good crime-suspense story until the finale (predictable) and that's when you say: ""So much for nothing"". I like soviet and russian stories because are dark, even in the real world... (the sparrows academy and the skin peel off torture is so twisted) The ending you see it coming when Jeremy Irons confess to be the mole to Jennifer ""absolutely beautiful"" Lawrence.",Red Sparrow
244,elcoat,Demonizing the Russians again and turning girls into manhaters,1,20 January 2019,"The more I think about this film, the more downright evil it appears to be.Any young girl who sees this is going to be traumatized by it and just as likely turned into a manhater for the depiction of male manipulation and rape. It's traumatic even for adults and the sexual violence/sadism should have earned it an X.Previously I wrote: Thinking about the violence, I've dropped this a notch. We have indeed seen that kind of brutal competitiveness in Olympic skating, but no nude beatings, that I can remember.Jennifer seems built like a running back, with assets. I hope she has daughters.She actually *looks* Russian, and not just her figure. Considering her character's situation, I thought her stoic acting was quite appropriate ... and very Russian in character.And someone else has pointed out the advantages of floppy disks over sticks, as far as a shade more data security.Jeremy Irons makes an excellent intelligence general.I found the movie very long but suspenseful and it kept my interest. For sure, it's not a James Bond film.As to which side now is a prison, that is in question. Election 2016 was a real populist American uprising, so apparently we Americans still have our freedom. After everything that has happened in Britain ... Iraq war fraud whistleblower Dr. David Kelly's July 2003 ""suicide,"" the clumsy Salisbury ""Russian novichok"" caper, and now the revelations about British (government) ""intelligence""'s misnomered Integrity Initiative seditiously trying to smear Labour's Jeremy Corbyn to be a Russian tool ... I am very concerned about once great Britain.I do wonder if Jennifer's experience in Hollywood has been at all similar to a red sparrow. Ashley Judd would probably say hers was.In summary, the film is long and anti-Russian and hideously violent and hateful.",Red Sparrow

A Star Vehicle Strictly for the Birds
Viewed on commercial release in Budapest
 English with Hungarian Subtitles
 Let me say that two things attracted me to this picture; (1) Hollywood's youthful superstar, Jennifer Lawrence (26!) of whom I am an unabashed fan, and (2) the Budapest locations, since I live here. Thirdly, In general I tend to like espionage movies ....
Well, tonight,
I saw a doozie of a cheap sex thrills opus masquerading as a heavy duty Cold War counter espionage thriller -- RED SPARROW is little more than an expensive excuse for showing (gorgeous) Jennifer Lawrence peeling to the buff and spreading her shapely legs every ten minutes. 
A former ballerina and a great beauty, she has been recruited by the NKVD to seduce American agents as a sexual counter agent and she has the physical goods to be very effective. The cover name for the top secret program under which fetching young women are trained for such patriotic bodily duty is known as ""Red Sparrow"".
Lawrence looks great as usual in this highly off beat role -- even in bangs --but is, however, seriously cheapened by her abuse and misuse in this film. Also notable (If you can recognize them) some top British talent wasted on this picture by Jeremy Irons and Charlotte Rampling as high level Russians officials. (way beneath their level -- they must have been hard up for some spot cash)
This sad excuse for a spy thriller and meticulous exercise in sado-masochism with revolting torture scenes and an extremely patchy script would make more sense dubbed into Russian without subtitles. Unless you're really hot to see a Russified Jennifer Lawrence 98% naked no matter how sickening and disbelievable the circumstances, avoid this flick immediately. 
 Ps: Budapest standing in for Moscow is equally dubious. Except for the fact that a significant portion of the story actually takes place there, there is no geographic differentiation when we switch to ""Moscow"". which merely piles confusion on top of confusion. (Other locations are Vienna and London, but Budapest also has to stand in for Moscow)
 I finally got tired even of seeing beautiful Lawrence dutifully churning away in The Buff over and over with various victims but her boffo torture scenes are exceptionally crude, stomach turning, and diswatchable. She really took a lot of punishment during these gruesome two hours of quasi-pornography and deserves a Purple Heart if not an Oscar for her efforts in the line of duty. Despite the wandering duplicitous script and general murkiness Red Sparrow will probably break even or better at the till because of JL's indisputable sex appeal and dedicated fan following, but ~
Wait for the inevitable Bollywood remake starring Katrina Kaif and Salman Khan.

247,kiowhatta,Another piece of feminist claptrap,4,22 February 2020,"A stellar cast is completely wasted on yet another overtly unrealistic story that tries to keep twisting the plot that it twists itself into over complexity and utter trite.
Such in vogue political messaging devalues and ridicules real ideology because it is wrapped up in a contrived way - intelligent audiences will feel manipulated and insensitive to such bombast and Pomp attempting to pass as a high brow story or high political drama.

That is a deal-breaker, and probably why it is so difficult to get caught in the story...
The same thing happened to me with the TV-show ""Tyrant"", in which everyone spoke english all the time, even the characters you'd presume they haven't been to school to learn a foreign language.
Not a horrible movie, but not so great either. I think lukewarm covers it.",Red Sparrow
249,MichaelNontonMulu,A Unique and Dark Movie of a Different Kind of Russian Spy,7,1 March 2018,"This was a very different and unique kind of spy movie. It was not the conventional James Bond type since the spy here was not taught about the use of cool gadgets, fight skills or even the weapons & explosives use. But it was a rather psychologically advanced type of spy where the Sparrow would use their minds in finding out what the target was looking for in a person and became such. Therefore you should not expect a movie with full of action or fight sequences. This was more like a drama movie focusing on the lead character Dominika who was played truly brilliantly by Jennifer Lawrence. It was so amazing to see her characterization of this person, her transformation from an innocent ballerina to a ruthless, strong-willed, manipulative spy.The movie's main attraction was the high intensity dramatic moments which all involved Dominika. The way she had to adjust herself into many situations, or her expressions in various conditions even in the most scary times. My wife and I were really amazed by her performance in this movie. Aside from Jennifer Lawrence's factor, the movie was also excellent in providing us few surprising twists. The final twist in the end was really mind blowing. And be sure to really concentrate on the first 10-15 minutes of the movie where you would find out how dark the tone of the movie really was. Plus the background music was also very good as it really added the element of intensity during the suspenseful moments.This movie had a duration of more than 2 hours which for some audience might be too long for a thriller drama movie. But my wife was able to go through it without even going to the bathroom (that's how intense the whole movie was). Though for me personally, there were some moments in the middle which felt a little bit too slow. Before you decide to see this movie, you have to know that it was categorized for 21 years above in Indonesia (R rating in the US), due to the violent nature of the killing and some sexual content. So beware that the movie is really for mature audience and do not bring your children to see this.If you are looking for a different unique kind of spy movie, based on the book written by former CIA operative named Jason Matthews (who would really know his stuff), this would be an interesting option. But if you expect a full action spy movie, then this would surely not be your thing. For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",Red Sparrow
250,user-35583,Enjoy the ride!,8,10 November 2021,Jennifer Lawrence is in nearly every scene of this Russian spy thriller. That alone is a reason to take the time to see it. She is both convincing and able in the role the spy in training who eventually becomes a master of her craft. She's also beautiful and her nude scenes are true to her character and not gratuitous. The plot is not overly complicated and never drags. I'm hoping for a sequel some day.,Red Sparrow
251,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,Above average spy thriller.,7,30 July 2018,"Directed by Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence and starring Jennifer Lawrence, Joel Edgerton and Jeremy Irons. Red Sparrow is based on the novel about a ballet dancer who suffers an injury forcing her to quit. Her uncle works for the Russian secret service and decides to recruit her to seduce a man. She eventually goes to a spy training camp but not all is what it seems. Forced to give their bodies to the government they are treated like pieces of meat as they are expected to sleep with the enemy to get information. The training is brutal and there are some winch inducing scenes involving rape and graphic violence which won't sit well with many. It's definitely not a film for everyone. The trailers promised an action thriller similar to the likes of Salt and Atomic Blonde but it's more of a thriller that sometimes plods at a slow pace. With it being set in Russia everyone oddly enough speak English to appeal to a mainstream audience (who can't be bothered reading subtitles). It requires your full attention because it gets convoluted towards the end with its many twists and turns. But because it's such a slow moving film with a derivative story, its kind of hard to stay engaged. Veteran actors Jeremy Irons and Charlotte Rampling do serviceable jobs. Jennifer Lawrence does her best as always but the Russian accent is a little bit distracting. Joel Edgerton is great but like most of the actors he's underused and there is very little chemistry between him and Lawrence. However that being said the film looks great with an intriguing music score by James Newton Howard. It has a realistic feel to it as a real life former CIA agent advised the production of the film. With its violence, torture scenes and language it's a film that takes risks. And it's refreshing to see a spy thriller that doesn't just rely on action set pieces. It suffers from a slow pace but it's worth it.",Red Sparrow

What does it lack? Drama. Tension. Plot twists. Everything that makes a spy thriller worth watching. Ladling on brutal violence and twisted sex scenes doesn't make up for a lack of a good story well told. A film like Gorky Park (1983) is far superior in both mood and story. The Bourne franchise, though more of a comic-book-comes-to-life, has much more action and intrigue. Red Sparrow is actually very boring.For a different and quirky take on the genre, try the British-made series, Killing Eve.",Red Sparrow
255,ryanbartlett-870-746486,Hunger Games comes to Russia.,7,25 March 2018,"In a post-Cold War Russia Jennifer Lawrence finds herself in the center of Russian Intelligence operations. Being thrusted into a new life or death landscape, she adapts to survive. Jennifer Lawrence as usual thrives in the spotlight. From emotionally driven scenes, to becoming a character. Maybe not an entirely unique character to what she is used to but embodies the character none the less. 
Red Sparrow takes a long look into the retrieval of a mole. And yes, I do mean long. Reaching almost two and a half hours, brevity was not their goal. However, the movie keeps your attention for the most part to where it doesn't feel as long. But really not that much shorter. At points the film does linger, and you find yourself wondering when it will pick up, and who is this other Russian needed person for. People come in and out of the plot at points to just drive the story along. I think if the movie was to cut out 30 minutes it would have been more effective. 
The film definitely was a solid film, one that I know the general public won't fall in love with, based on some of the gritty and almost over the top violent scenes. But a film nonetheless that warrants a looking in to. 
Jennifer once again finds herself in a role that pushes the boundaries of sexuality and violence. In a different approach, yes, but one that may be more provocative than necessary.
Director Francis Lawrence is definitely riding Jennifer's coat tail into success. Not that she is bringing all of the talent, but with Francis putting her at the forefront, she is definitely driving his vision into fruition. I'm sure he will make another movie starring her, and we will see how much influence she will have on the subsequent films and how far they can push the envelope. Seeing as from the first hunger games he directed to the last pushed the boundaries a ton already. Red Sparrow was the next step, and by the next movie we could have a very crazy, sexual, and violent, rebellious J-Law on our hands.",Red Sparrow

When she finishes this school, she is dispatched by the Russian government to spy on a CIA agent (Joel Edgerton). I will say no more about this movie as more details could spoil important plot points. There are aspects of this film that I admired. First of all I didn't expect that the film would be as graphic and violent as it is. There are many awkward scenes that demand a lot from Jennifer Lawrence and she remains realistic and compelling. These scenes make the film more cringe inducing and realisitic. The audience is thrown into a real and authentic world. Authenticity is another aspect I enjoyed about this film. The world feels real and lived in with gritty and detailed set designs. No one seems safe in this society of espionage. The costumes give across this old fashioned but also majestic sense of a Russian culture, almost reminicent of USSR times. These style choices however contradict with the unfortunate choice of fake Russian accents. The idea of accents is very difficult, especially with a movie like this. We have huge movie stars like Jennifer Lawrence, Joel Edgerton and Jeremy Irons, all actors who aren't of Russian descent. They are forced to stick with Russian accents. This idea is very thin ice, it only worked limited times. One example that comes to my mind in this case is Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List. The reason why that worked is because the accents were there but didn't stand out. In this case with Red Sparrow, I immediately heard that Lawrence used an accent. This contradicted with the realistic and in depth world development we received otherwise. However the most glaring flaw with Red Sparrow lies within the story. It is simply too thin and uninteresting for a film like this. When Lawrence's character was training to become a sparrow, I was enthralled, the psychological aspects really intrigued me. When I saw the first 30 minutes of this film I was hoping to see one the best films of the year, it really did start strong but it then ditches the uncomfortable and disturbing story of basically creating a prostitute and turns into some normal spy caper. Don't get me wrong, the film doesn't turn into some action blockbuster, the slow burning tone remains. I enjoyed this initially when the story told the aforementioned tale of a woman becoming a tool for the government. Overall Red Sparrow did disappoint me, Lawrence continues to impress me with her selflessness in choosing these roles but this story simply justify many of the dark and brutal moments. So at the end we have a generic spy movie that is a little more sexually violent than others. With very little originality and flare.",Red Sparrow

Stylish, well acted, and a must for any fan of the genre imho. Well done Jennifer and cast and crew. I can't imagine how hard you worked.",Red Sparrow
268,jwcstorage,A real review,7,5 March 2018,"Unlike the people who give movies 1's and 10's, this will be a quick actual review. To start off with, this is by far NOT a ""black widow solo flick"". It is very much a real world style spy thriller. Dont go in expecting Jlaw to be doing crazy athletic dance-fu moves and exploding enemy bases while using her dance-fu to avoid thousands of rounds of ammo being shot at her, because if you're expecting a Marvel movie you're in the wrong theater! Jlaw is mostly ok in this far-too-long flick, but she stays very emotionless throughout. All the fake Russian accents all over the place are typically good enough, not amazing and not the worst fake accents like others are saying. Unless you live in a Russian community or are bilingual, it shouldnt have any impact on your viewing. The premise is interesting as is the approach, however during its 2 hours and change run time we get several repetitions that make the movie really drag. After the third or fourth time you see a shot of someone walk in their building, cut to opening their mailbox, cut to walking into their apartment, cut to in their kitchen sorting their mail before tossing the stack on the table, you will wonder why these repeating scenes werent cut. My fellow movie-watchers were also annoyed by these repeated shots and felt it was likely a red herring to ramp up the tension and make you feel that these people can be in danger anywhere at any time. However, since the movie never followed through with anything, its hard to fully know what the excessive use of repeated pointless shots are. It was refreshing to get a true spy thriller with a feeling that there could be 'real' consequences, not a bond-type spy flick, and the twists that come along with such a flick were a mixed bag. Some were very good, others fell flat. There was only one or two jump scares, but considering they were one of those *force audience to strain listening* to *EXPLODING NOISE FOR JUMP SCARE*, had they done any more than they had it would have absolutely impacted the score. The acting was pretty flat with no one really standing out or dragging the movie down. Jlaw kind of Kristen Stewart'ed throughout the movie, wearing the same one expression for a majority of the movie. Maybe she was trying to come across stoic, focused, or like an unflappable spy, but she ends up coming across as a plank of wood at times. Just because the flick is a drama thriller doesnt mean you cant show emotions! At the 1 hour mark the movie was starting to feel long in the tooth, but it was only halfway done. A lot of the movie could honestly be left on the cutting room floor. It would have been nice if all the filler were replaced with yet another subplot, this being a spy movie and all. Unfortunately we get those same repetitive shots instead. Replace all those repetition shots with another impactful twist and this could have gone to the 8-9 range. Nothing really stands out or elevates the movie, with most elements being just ""fine"". They use standard Russian locales, choice beautiful buildings, both interior and exterior, pretty much everything you think of when you think of ""movie Russia"". The score sat in the background and does not a whole lot for the movie, but every so often it bleed into the scene playing out in a nice way. This was a better than average movie, definitely not a 1 or a 10, but a 6.5-7 I would say is fair for the movie. Its best to go into this movie with the right expectations. It is first and foremost a spy thriller, so erase your thoughts of a ""solo black widow"" and more of a loooong realistic spy thriller. If you're looking for a superhero spy who can do everything perfectly with lots of action, look elsewhere. If you want a movie with closer to realistic spying, with all the boring stuff that comes with it and a pretty good plot and few action scenes, then this might be up your alley.",Red Sparrow

Jennifer's nude scene, I congratulate her on. It takes balls to shed your clothes and expose yourself for the whole world to see (redundant) (well, in her case it doesn't take balls) She pulls it off nicely.

Although it starts off rather dull, the 2 hour 15 minute ride gets tenser by every passing minute and comes to an end with a great climax. Even though some of the aspects of the story are predictable after a certain amount of time, the film still does a good job at surprising the audience, genre fans and regular viewers alike. The film is also striking due to its stellar cast. Lawrence does a satisfying job at transforming to a Russian ballet dancer first, then to an operator for SVR, while Edgerton has passive but assuring powerhouse performance as always. The cast also includes veteran actors Jeremy Irons and Ciaran Hinds, both of whom do a great job.Red Sparrow is a must for the genre loversç",Red Sparrow

277,gelmcchristop,Truly painful,8,25 August 2021,"Red Sparrow is the 1984 of modern cinema. The plot is remarkably well-written, and conveys the idea of a realistic story. But evidently its purpose is not to become a documentary. The bold decision of carrying the cold war atmosphere to the very present day, the journey from citizen to sparrow, both very successfully let the audience question their humanity, their personality.The inhumane violence doesn't cause discomfort. The nudity doesn't distract. They only cause pain, the pain one should feel watching a human be deprived of the basic merits which render them something more than a hairless ape.The plot aside, the movie is overall well executed. The directing never gets confusing despite the intricate script and multiple location changes, and the cinematography mostly stands up, even though the less important sets appear to have been rather poorly decorated. The visual effects are realistic as they should be, and alongside the makeup result in the highly engaging violence scenes. The acting meets the highest standards as well, and it definitely seems that the actors understand the characters and in so doing they can convey the arcs successfully.",Red Sparrow

You have to have read the book in order to understand what was going on. I'm happy they stuck to the material and followed a majority of the book but took some creative liberties with it. Did it ruin the movie? NO. I think it made it interesting. The only thing that grinds my gears is Nate Nash. In the book, he was 28! TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD. Here they make him like almost twenty years older. But I digress. I love the star power they got for this movie, J Law did a good job but, at times her Russian accent seems to fade in and out. Joel Edgerton did a good job as Nash, though not my first choice for the part. Jeremy Irons always stealing the spotlight whenever he can. Great work!! I don't want to go into details about everything that was changed or omitted. The bottom line is, I'm happy that a movie adaptation of a best seller stuck as close it can to the book.

284,mt-95256,"Decent Enough, But Nothing Compared to Le Carré",6,11 March 2018,"TL;DRBleak, depressing atmosphere adds to the film's mature, engaging personalitySome aspects don't feel fully exploredLots of sex and violence (see that as good or bad depending on your own sensibilities...)Captivating plot that keeps us guessingFrequent fake Russian accents tend to get a bit irritatingDecent performances all round, especially by Lawrence, continuing to demonstrate strong screen presenceA competent, decent enough spy thriller - but nothing overly memorable-----------------------------------------As I've often said, the 'spy' genre is only ever a sub-genre; a secondary genre describing the story told in either an action film or a thriller (the distinction often seen by whether they're referred to as agents or spies). For this reason there are only really two types of spy films; some are like Bond films or Kingsman, others more like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Red Sparrow fits safely into the latter category, the sort of film that acts more as a warning as opposed to glamorising the life of a spy. With less reliance on action and style (but with plenty of sex and violence), it follows the trend with an intricate and clever plot that engages the audience. On the whole, Red Sparrow is successful, though not without its hiccups.As is typical (and fundamentally important) with these 'realistic' spy movies, the whole film is very bleak and depressing; from the story and characters to the settings and cinematography. This feeling permeates Red Sparrow and the melancholic atmosphere works really well, confidently giving us an insight into the mind of a spy. However, sometimes it goes a little too far - the 'Sparrow School' section of the film, for example, was more disappointing. What could have been really exciting and interesting, instead seems more of an excuse for more of that nudity we're promised in the parental guide. And there are plenty of scenes with sex and nudity and more than enough violence to amp up the bleak, horrific nature of a spy's world - it's certainly not a film for prudes. Fortunately though these scenes aren't shoved in just to appeal to the sadists in the audience, but do contribute to the overall plot, one which is very intricate and complex. It can feel slow at times, but moves at a reasonable pace with enough twists and mystery to keep an audience engaged and always guessing all the way to the end.All of this is lead confidently by a wonderful Jennifer Lawrence, who uses this film to once again remind us of her star power and excellent screen presence. With an understated performance, Lawrence develops her character brilliantly throughout the film, the cold-hearted spy we see at the end of the film very different from the ballerina at the start. What she really excels at, however, is an enigmatic expression and delivery of lines, succeeding in never allowing the audience to really know what she's thinking or who's side she's really on. Opposite her stars Joel Edgerton. A charismatic and likeable FBI agent, he's a more refreshing and believable take on a spy than some we've grown accustomed to on the screen. Rampling and Irons are also valuable assets to the cast, their stony faces and harsh words having a powerful effect on the characters and film itself. On the other hand, though, there are times when the characters seem a little too bland; there seems to be a lack of deep characterisation which results in less sympathy from the audience. On top of that, the fake Russian accents soon run really thin. While they're thankfully consistent, they are also strong and frequent enough to quickly become a tad annoying. You can't help but wish either they'd spoken in Russian (although a typical audience doesn't have the attention span to read subtitles) or just forgone the accent altogether.Red Sparrow is unlikely to rank among the best of spy films and it seems at this stage somewhat unlikely that it will spawn the lucrative franchise that they seem to want. With slightly irritating Russian accents, an occasionally slow-moving plot and not much more than superficial characterisation, it's unlikely to stand proudly with the likes of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. But with an engagingly bleak atmosphere, exciting plot that keeps your interest and Lawrence leading the way, Red Sparrow makes up for its flaws and reminds us how enjoyable these kinds of spy films can be.",Red Sparrow

287,r-angle,WAY TOO CONVOLUTED,3,26 May 2020,"I hated the first act. Stiff and awkward. The story didn't flow. They spent too much time on the backstory. When the injury to the dancer's leg happens, we don't see what causes it. It just happens, without visible cause. But it's a key turning point in the story, so we need to see it to believe it.
But when we get into Act Two, it starts working. It is startling when Dominica lets the American CIA agent know her real name, so he can find out everything about her. It is just what she is NOT supposed to do. Yet it seems like a ploy to get what she wants, so it is interesting. But when you think about it, it doesn't make sense. How does she know she can trust him?
During Act Three, the last half hour or so, I kept muttering, ""BS,"" to myself over and over. I didn't buy any of it. I found the story too convoluted. The big fight scene made me laugh out loud. They keep cutting each other until there is blood everywhere. Too grand guignol for me.
I will say the movie is well-filmed and well-acted. Jeremy Irons is good, as always. Jennifer Lawrence had an impossible task to make her character believable.

When Dominika's uncle Vanya (Matthias Schoenaerts) gives her an assignment she cannot refuse, how far will she go to ensure the safety of her family?Reuniting Jennifer with director Francis Lawrence (no relation), Red Sparrow is her most ambitious film to date. Adapted from the book written by retired CIA operative Jason Matthews, the movie fairly crackles with sex, depravity and modern-day realism.If the trailers had you thinking this movie is a hybridized mash-up of Atomic Blonde, Black Swan and Molly's Game, you'd be only one-third right. Suffice it to say that while Red incorporates elements of all those thrillers, it is unique in its delivery and fresh in its style.Lush cinematography, intriguing dialog and a convoluted plot make this a true thinking-person's espionage thriller. Jennifer Lawrence is in nearly every scene, and her character burns up the screen with a heartfelt sense of purpose - even when we don't quite know what that is.

This is an original film for the most part but I am not likely to watch this film again.This film is very original and well through out. It is very cerebral and you have to pay very close attention to keep up with what is going on. While the film does explain everything in the end, I felt the plan was just ""too perfect"" to actually have been pulled off (nothing comes off that perfect in real life).Due to the fact the plot is very exacting, the film seems to move along rather slow and the character development seems to be slow as well. It was refreshing to see a film with a mix of good and bad characters of both genders. There is an even distribution of bad female and bad male characters in this film but also good female/mail character.A word of warning to those who have not seen this film yet, this film is gritty and holds little back from the viewer. As other reviewers have noted and mentioned this film has a lot of sex scenes in it or scenes in which sex is the instrument of power. There are even a couple of rape scenes. While I usually dislike (really dislike) rape scenes, these are passable as they are necessary to the plot/story line. They are just hard to watch. So, viewer beware! Additionally, nearly all the sex scenes in the film are also necessary to the plot line so the amount of sex is arguably not gratuitous as without them, the plot may have a few holes in it.

If you're not into that, and don't feel like you need to see Lawrence prance around naked, you've been warned this is NOT the film for you. Watching this, one has to question why Lawrence (a self-professed feminist) would choose to be a part of a film that glorifies such acts as brutality towards woman. This isn't art, parts of it come off as soft core porn and the violence certainly could have been toned down.

300,SUGAR2TWO,From premium cringe to yawnfest,3,27 May 2021,"I saw some funny reviews poking on ""Russian bots"" and stuff rating movie very low and got genuinely confused who's really the bot.So yea I'm Russian and the most minor flaw this movie has is the image of Russia and Russian language. It looks really dated, about early 00's. The timeline is also very weird. When the movie starts it's cold outside, some months later and it's snowy and then after couple months it's still winter. Moscow has all the seasons and the summer is often very hot. The school looks very soviet like including outfits, very unrealistic. I think implementing Russian accents is stupid (just like Swedish accent in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)"") and I also will never understand why actors can't learn just about 3 short phrases in Russian they have for a whole film without accent SO THICK you have to replay to understand what they were saying. And that's about it for Russia-related flaws from a Russian guy and that's very minor.Unfortunately this movie is very bad regardless of decoration and it's setting authenticity. The school is claimed to be teaching it's students seduction and deceiving and stuff, but in reality it's just degrades and humiliates them and apparently boosts their lockpicking ability to the max. How come it's everything you need to know to be a high level spy? Well maybe they taught them at least some foreign languages behind the scenes as well as seduction mastery because even seducing which was mentioned in synopsis I believe wasn't really present in the school or in the movie at all. All the sexual scenes are either awkward or straight awful and forced. Well okay I didn't like it but there's still a story, characters, acting. Right?Everything about acting and characters is bad. JLaw gives the most disappointing performance of her career. We don't really know her character except that she's caring for her mother she's vengeful, master of lockpicking and dead serious at all times. We don't really know much besides it, what she's thinking and why is she doing random lockpicking until grand reveal. Pretty much every character is very serious and emotionless. I didn't like Warrior (2011) but Joel Edgerton was great in that movie and I liked him. But here he's like a side character that had to replace a missing main one. Everyone here just says their basic dialogues until we see a final and that's it. Nothing is satisfying about this movie but one gory scene.At first I was laughing then frowning and then just yawning. I saw a lot of films with low rating that turned to be a good or even great ones. I became a fan of JLaw since she's great in almost every movie regardless of their quality (I can't stand ""American Hustle"" and she's great there) so watching this movie was a question of time. With that said ""Red Sparrow"" is a real stinker.",Red Sparrow
301,doveed,Dull Spy Story,6,25 March 2019,"I usually don't enjoy spy movies, because I can't relate to the world that they're in. However, I love the Indiana Jones movies. Why is that? Because the Indiana Jones movies have personality. Like a lot of spy movies, Red Sparrow is very monotone. It's as if the director told all the actors, ""I want every line in the movie delivered like this."" The effect was flat and kind of depressing. For me, it takes more than violence, nudity, and risky sexual content to hold my interest. I need to be able to connect. This movie started out on a very positive note, but then it became boring. It's a solid production, well shot, and had a strong grasp on itself, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.",Red Sparrow
302,KrazyJoke,Escort-Spy and Politics Gone Wrong,7,17 March 2018,"Red Sparrow the story of a Russian woman played by Jennifer Lawrence who, after an incident can't poursue her dancing career. Then after helping her uncle on a task where she finds herself in need to seduce a man to get informantion from him, she noticed a crime and because of that ,got sent away to become a sparrow, basically an escort-spy! So from that moment until the end we get lots of conflics between the Americans and the Russians, where our heroine finds herself in the middle of the conflict. The movie itslef is weird but good, yet I have a some major issues with the movie. First it's pretty racist. The way they show how the russians are savage and how the americans are sweethearts, was messing with me a little bit, since they spiced it up to a next level. Besides the fact that the movie was kind of racist, it was pretty intense, the movie was nothing like the trailers, it was way more dark and intense. Some scenes were really disturbing, such as some super dark erotic scenes, and some really really discusting scenes that pretty much make us think we are watching a *Saw* movie. The last thing that was a bit messy is, the accents, and the cast. The cast had a major issue such as there was no real russian in the movie, the whole cast are Americans and British people no Russians which is an annoying film, since the main subject is about the Russians. The Russians accent too were pretty much never really used or when they were used, well they were pretty terrible. Plus we did not get the chance to hear only one sentence in Russian. Enough with the bad let's talk about what was good in the movie. First of all Jennifer Lawrence besides her bad russian accent, delivered a pretty good performance, she was intense and she gave everything she could give. Joel Edgerton and Matthias Schoenaerts both deliver great performances. The story itself is really good too, it's a mix of everything and goes really deep, and it's not the regular Spy movie we usually see. The visuals were really good and some scenes were brillant and stunning. It's a great spy movie, it's original and intense.",Red Sparrow
303,trenmast,"Had everything to work, but didn't...",3,1 May 2018,"Could've been a good, albeit predictable and cliché movie... Instead, it's wrongly paced, poorly acted and just plain confusing. Character development is very poor, you keep asking yourself why would Russians talk in English 99% of the time even among themselves and, all of sudden, say just two or three words in Russian just to get back to English again. Jennifer's accent is simply atrocious. Acting is alright for the most part. Screenplay is a nightmare. I can see why the studio bought the idea, but the execution was just a plain mess. Just skip this one, nothing to see here...",Red Sparrow

It was choppy scene after choppy scene. No flow. There is no point to this movie unless you are entertained my watching mindless, gory killing scenes and mindless, violent rape scenes.This movie seemed like a disgusting man's erotic fantasy. The first half of the movie was the girl in a school where a women teachers women to let men rape them. Then the rest is just killing and violence and no story.So if you like watching 2.5 hours of mindless murders and rapes with no purpose/story line, you'll probably enjoy this movie. But otherwise, don't waste your time/money.Also, it the whole movie was in a Fake Russian Accent.
If I want to watch a long, boring, violent movie, with people trying to speak a language they don't speak, I'll watch the Passion of the Christ. At least that had decent looking male actors in it.",Red Sparrow

Jennifer Lawrence hits every nail, every mark, checks every box, giving a dry, crisp performance the role required of her, but her character seems to be getting lucky at every instance, that too for a cadet.

Lavish production, and tight story, at times difficult to follow. Jennifer Lawrence even took lessons with N.Y.C. ballet. By director of Hunger Games and Water for Elephants. No great social or moral lessons here, just a good spy story. Needlessly, pushes the edges of graphic violence. And, Jennifer Lawrence shows more skin than she ever has.

I'm not saying it was bad nor am I saying it was great. It is a psychological who-done-it kinda movie. There are certain international movies (from certain countries) that you expect to be this way. This is one of them. The dry, slow parts were the bulk of the movie. The juice was sporadic and few/fart between. The Red Sparrow we follow is all over the place. One minute she's a girl in need of help and 77 seconds later she is a fierce DOM in control and looking for blood. Only to find out she was faking the whole time. That is her theme in the movie. It got old quick. Be consistent in your character. Are you afraid and sincere or are you cold and calculating? You can't be both unless you have a personality disorder. Her Uncle was the best character. He didn't give a flying F about family. Family is what he says it is. The final thing...all the sex scenes were...a few seconds of, that's all you got? Lol.

There constantly is drama, conflict and (potential) betrayal.This was a wonderful experience, which you should celebrate by paying full attention.

311,Christina-Q,"All four stars to Jeremy Irons, none to the movie itself",4,24 March 2018,"I haven't read the book and I didn't read the plot summary before the movie, so I didn't know what to expect, so I was very open minded to this movie.I usually know after 20 minutes, if the movie is worth watching or not. And in this case I had a bad feeling that this movie is not getting better towards the end. And sadly I was right.I get that this is an American movie, but still it bothered me that when most of the people were Russians and location was in Russia, nobody actually spoke the language. Instead everyone had their own version of Russian accent, and in most cases is was terrible. When Dominika (the main character) spoke English with her old mother, it was too unreal. If a person that old as her mother was, was a Russian, she wouldn't speak a word English. I know it's a movie, not a real life, but I would have wanted some sort of explanation why everyone was speaking English. Any explanation. The second thing that bothered me, was the terrible way they had cut the scenes. It was like some trainee was there to do the job. I can't find a word for it, but it was like let's take a short scene from there, let's put it here and let's not think about what we are doing. And repeat.Well, the only interesting and good thing about this movie was Jeremy Irons, but even he couldn't save this one. Jennifer Lawrence started strong, but then she had the same expression on her face all the time, and it started to annoy me. She really didn't give the hard and cold spy's vibe at all. Mainly she seemed very bored and tried to be a serious actress. And the plot itself was kind of predictable. I have read a lot of thrillers and detective books, and I have watched a lot of movies that include these everybody fools everybody -type of things. And all I can say, that Red Sparrow was predictable (okay, there were few surprises along the way) and specially the ending was the way it seems to happen in most of this kind of movies. Well, not exactly, but the main idea. It's not the worst this type of movie, but if I hadn't been in the movie theater with my friend, I would have left somewhere in the middle of the movie.",Red Sparrow
312,garygwilliams,Less would have been more,7,13 May 2018,"Jennifer Lawrence is the #1 female movie star today and she carries a thin plot and weak cast to create an enjoyable glimpse into the former U.S.S.R. It bears a strong resemblance to Luc Besson's epic work ""La Femme Nikita"" which still holds up after 27 years as my favorite movie. But this is not that. It is overly brutal, depraved and cruel. There is none of the alliances the former had that gave Nikita (Josephine) her identity. And the characters of ""The Matron"" and ""Uncle Vanya"" were pure evil masters not mentors or teachers. Still Mary-Louise Parker was interesting as was Irishman Ciarian Hinds in his character as the head of Russian Intelligence.",Red Sparrow

314,austinfromdahood,I was let down with this one :(,6,24 November 2018,"Red Sparrow is a movie I've been wanting to watch for a while. To me, it seemed like a movie I'd like. I heard from many that it is a ""James Bond and Black Swan combined."" And being a huge fan of both movies, I really wanted to watch it. I picked it up from the library, like I do with most movies I want to watch. The first like 10 minutes of the movie was what I expected, but then after, it turned into something I didn't expect. The first 10 minutes of the movie is essentially Jennifer Lawrence's character performing ballet in a recital while Joel Edgerton is doing some spy stuff and it is not explicitly said what he is doing until much later, and that is one of my biggest problems in this film. I really love it when Jennifer Lawrence is on screen and kicking butt, but Joel Edgerton's subplot is kind of boring, and I did not care about him at all. He's actually kind of a weak character to be honest. And what comes along with Joel Edgerton's subplot is boredom. The movie gets boring when we pay attention to Joel Edgerton because he isn't interesting, and Jennifer Lawrence's character is way more interesting. The performances are pretty good in this movie, especially from Jennifer Lawrence, and there are many thrilling sequences as well, especially at the beginning of the movie. The second act of the movie is kind of boring because Joel Edgerton's subplot kind of intertwines with Jennifer Lawrence's subplot, and it creates a bland part of the movie that really doesn't go anywhere because not much is happening. The twists in the movie really aren't shocking, in my opinion at least, because it does not really bring the story in another direction. When the twist happened, I was just like, ""Okay, I guess that happened"", and that's it. I feel like if you're a huge fan of spy movies, I think you'd like this one. 7/10",Red Sparrow

319,SB100,Watchable,6,24 October 2021,"This was better than I had expected from reading critics' reviews - but that doesn't mean that it's a very good film. In many ways it's a routine spy tale of who is double crossing whom, with views of a few European cities thrown in. The back story of the lead character's career as a ballerina cut short, and her ill mother, is really just padding and not interesting except insofar as the family background motivates her later actions in a particular way. Various big name actors eg Jeremy Irons, do what are essentially cameos with accents. The grizzled American CIA man is a rather feeble character, making only a feeble show of suspicion before falling for his beautiful counterpart. Jennifer Lawrence naturally looks good at all times even after being savagely beaten etc etc, but physically is an unlikely ballerina. She certainly looks Slavic, and has the required hauteur for the role.",Red Sparrow
320,hnapel,"A strong woman uses what she has, which is both body and brains.",8,10 May 2018,"The defining nature of intelligence agencies is their secrecy (otherwise they are called news agencies) so for books and movies their benefit is twofold, first is that their hidden nature intrigues, the desire to know and understand what goes on in the back chambers of diplomacy and sometimes its cellars. The second thing is unless word comes out you never can know what really happens which gives fictional writers great freedom in writing their plots as by definition matters are unverifiable. Still the notion of a so called Honey Trap is as old as the Bible (Delilah) at least and if my Sumerian was better I might have found an example from their heritage too. Enter Jennifer Lawrence who I shall call by her real name because keeping track of all aliases her character uses in this movie Red Sparrow becomes tiresome, after all she is a spy. But before becoming a spy our darling is a ballerina and watching those scenes we are reminded of the hype Natalie Portman caused in Black Swan for portraying a believable dancer and if it wasn't for the fact in this movie these are only the overtures and unless when the DVD comes out they reveal it was all cunning CGI they may give Jennifer Lawrence an Oscar for this stage performance too. Then follows a really agonizing scene where she breaks her leg, I mean further down the line we are entertained sufficiently with people getting shot in the head or skinned alive but the leg breaking scene is really nightmare material. Without a job at the opera she becomes vulnerable and a devious uncle who is also part of the Russian intelligence community signs her up for a honey trap job which gets out of hand after which the girl is send to what can be best described as it is eventually done in the movie itself as Whore School. Whore School has an interesting curriculum, oh and failing it means you get one in the head for being no longer useful to the state. From the lessons in seduction our aspiring Red Sparrow learns to identify their targets' vulnerabilities so she can tune her strategy to what they really want which unsurprisingly is often sex. The overall problem for her handlers in the movie is that she is not a spy by vocation but rather tries to make the best of her situation an putting her own interests first. This starts to become clear on her first assignment as she is tasked to spy on an American but takes a liking to him and basically puts her cards on the table. It is quite endearing and also surprising to realize the two main characters in fact never seem to lie to each other while both of them are perfectly trained to do just that. When they inevitably hit it off we see the woman take the initiative which is a nice deviation from the common emphasis on masculinity. The plot that subsequently unfolds is quite intricate and complicated as spy stories tend to be and you will only understand in the end that Jennifer really played out the long con and then longer. Overall I liked this move, it has less cliches which is refreshing and some scenes at Whore School are quite startling so the Puritans can have a field day denouncing them but I think they are not overly vulgar. We see a strong woman and she uses what she has, which is both body and brains. Fine.",Red Sparrow

At points it's not very realistic. For instance, one cannot take serious that someone as young as Jennifer Lawrence would sort of take over from a senior general like Jeremy Irons, even if this is exactly what he proposes to her towards the end of the movie.

The basic idea is quite promising, but the way it is turned into practice is what the Germans call peinlich. Everything seems to be wrong.

328,Victreebong,IMDb needs better mods,9,28 March 2018,"As a preface, this is not the only JenLaw movie to get unnecessarily slammed by sham reviews. Since The Fappening, people have been on a mission to smear her image. (The personal comments about the president haven't helped.) But throw all that out, look at this film objectively, and you will be pleasantly rewarded with a spy thriller that's cunning, sexy and disturbing all at once.Lawrence plays a Soviet op who is conned into a femme fatale lifestyle of cutthroat operatives when her ballerina career is ruined from an injury. She crosses paths with Edgerton, an agent in the middle of a career SNAFU, as he attempts to redeem his status with the CIA after getting made during his cover. Romance and espionage ensues. The movie is one part Lawrence learning to survive covertly and two parts not trying to turn on her government to aid her mother, friend, and colleagues.The crux of why people are turning this down is the violence and graphic nudity. The violence is no worse than Fight Club and about as disturbing as Black Swan. Those are your benchmarks. As for the sexuality... yes you get to see a penis, some breasts and butt, but at this point you should know Jen is human. Body parts do not make the actor. The acting makes the actor. Lawrence does a pretty convincing job pulling off a Russian dialect, but it's being sociopathic while undercover where she shines. It's a tale of espionage. She starts off scared and green, but over the course of 2 hours she is brutally beautiful in her façade. Edgerton is handsome and sweet. He is excellent as a supporting actor and he only makes Jennifer that much more focal in the story. One of the other standouts here is Rampling, the stoic mission driven school commandant who effortlessly instills guile in her students through psychosexual manipulation. She is equal parts mechanical and overtly invasive in finding sexual quirks. There's another standout performance in Red Sparrow, but I promised I wouldn't spoil the movie in my review.I'm sorry I'm late with this review, but if you plan on Redboxing the movie or catching it before the theatrical run ends, do so! It is not a first date movie, but is definitely sensual, very engrossing and yet another star for both Lawrences' track records.

331,Amonute-Matoaka,Only Americans would think this film represents the reality of Russia,1,22 August 2018,"American actors play Russians who live in Russia but speak to each other in English, with fake Russian accents. But this is a realistic film.There is no reason the mother wouldn't be able to afford to go to the doctor for her illness, Russia has a public healthcare system. It's not ideal, but it's free. She would also be entitled to some form of pension. Not to mention the protagonist -a renowned ballet dancer- would be able to find employment as a teacher, a trainer, or a choreographer, probably within the Bolsoi company. Plus, after the accident, she would also receive some form of work injury compensation pay, not to mention that all these people have health insurances in case stuff like this happen (because otherwise she could sue the company). Also, I don't know why she didn't press charges against the guy who dropped her, especially after she received evidence of it not being an accident. Even if she couldn't go to court, she could at least get them both fired. Those are the things that people do in the real world when a tragedy happens. They don't suddenly go to expensive hotels to meet with mafia bosses. How does that sound as a realistic decision?I find the ""such a realistic film after all the Marvel-DC shenanigans"" comments hillarious, since this movie is such an obvious rip-off from a Marvel character's backstory. Black Widows, Red Sparrows, potaytos, potahtos.As for the spy stuff, as far as I'm concerned, it was shocking without any depth, or meaning, just for the sake of shocking viewers. Because since the character didn't have to be in that situation, it was to me unrealistic.Also, switch the Russian locations with literaly any other country, and you get the exact same movie, without any issues.

The movie begins with Jennifer Lawrence performing as a lead ballerina for the Bolshoi Ballet. (God bless Jennifer Lawrence, but it's kind of hard to accept her as a ballet dancer.) She soon breaks her leg, ending her dancing career and starting her down the path to becoming a ""Red Sparrow."" Her uncle, Deputy Director of the SVR, arranges for her to attend State School Four, or as she refers to it, ""whore school."" Charlotte Ramping is absolutely wonderful / horrible as the school's ""matron."" At some point, Lawrence is sent into the field, and the twists and turns begin. The cast is perfect and includes Mary-Louise Parker as a Senator's alcoholic Chief of Staff, Jeremy Irons as a Russian General, and Joely Richardson as Lawrence's mother, and many many more.The Moscow scenes, as with most recent movies, were shot in Budapest and Bratislava.See it now if you like Jennifer Lawrence, spy thrillers, Quantico or The Americans.

Sure it was loopholes if you really start analysing, but it's the kind of movie that keep you asking questions long time after you left the cinema. Why did she, what if, etc.On the other hand, I see a return of the Russian evil theme. After years when the wold enemy were the Arabs, North Koreans, and terrorists in general this movie returns to the cold era age when the Russians where the greatest enemy. I think the movie exaggerates in depicting Russians are heartless, cold-hearted and evil. And the main Russian villain is an actor that resembles president Putin too much to be just a coincidence.

Lawrence to Russia and to Russian people (my homeland), I have stopped to respect her Forever and since this day I don't want to watch any more movies with her participation, because I'm always keep in mind this peace of trash, named ""The film"" only by mistake.Cranberry JellyImagine a standard school lunch. If you're lucky, it won't be so bad. Lunch on the classics consists of the first, second and something to drink. So, sometimes drink proposed wildest nasty thing called jelly. This is some viscous substance, which did not quench the thirst, but only gave you a strange feeling to the taste buds. Warm or cold - the taste of this thing can be hard to find. Therefore, in the future, it is logical desire never to pick up jelly, leaving it somewhere in school times. Who needs to know that this is unclear now? Francis Lawrence, probably, never faced with such matter, which why he sat in the Director's chair with great actors and gave the audience a taste of the nasty jelly from sour cranberry, trying to hide behind this substantion his ""Great Spy Thriller"" . But the true lovers of delicious drinks can not hold that, not a tiny bit.""The Red Sparrow"" is up to a funny bad tape, which is unclear why there is exists in 2018. And it would seem that foreshadows trouble? The most that neither is present. The main character of Dominika Egorova is a Russian ballerina of the Bolshoi (Grand) Theatre. In one case, Dominika will never be able to speak again, because what is the name of Russian girl, I'm live here all my life and doesn't know NO GIRL with such ridiculous (for ears of Russian people, of course) name. Unfortunately, she has a sick mother and no money. Therefore the uncle working on Secret Service of Mother of Russia comes to the rescue. And because in Russia all beautiful women and ballerinas can be spies, offers to help her. The usual ballerina Dominika must decide whether she is ready to become a special agent from the category of Red Sparrows, that among the common people are called a sonorous combination of ""magic vagina"". And now she is waiting for the school of seduction, harassment and attempted rape, meeting with a good American Agent, Spy Games and, of course, understanding the importance of Family, Love and Freedom.""The Red Sparrow"" is up to a pleasant bad in the most masked of the Cold War stereotypes in the first half, when nothing but laughter, the tape is capable of causing. The school of agents, designed to seduce the Enemies of the State, which is located in the forest, where Charlotte Rampling says simple Russian truths that their bodies belongs to the State, and makes each agent undress, simultaneously talking about how and who should be seduced. And, of course, harassment and rape are everywhere. In Russia there is no other way. And watch to the formation of Egorova before her going to the main thing at least funny. The next hour of the film feels incredibly drawn out, where the creators who doesn't know what to do with the main character, make Jennifer Lawrence ride like a roller coaster in the directions of ""No, I'm not a traitor, but Yes, I'm a traitor"", in the end, not just confusing the viewer who just can't understand the elementary motivation of the heroine, and showing the stupidity of the Ballerina-Spy that seems to act only on the occasion, for some reason, with only one word: ""Oh?"" However, at the end of this absurdity, creators still trying to twist the tension associated with the intrigue of the double game and the search for the mole to the maximum, which, of course, gave a little interest for viewers, but the final denouement of this ""Great Spy Thriller"", glancing through the blood-red color of berries, absolutely does not follow from the character of the heroine, which remains incomprehensible even, probably for herself.But the most unpleasant thing in ""The Red Sparrow"" - is not this ugly tightness, already embarrassing from the middle. Simultaneously the most ridiculous and stupid is a branchy cranberry straight from the days of the Cold War. The creators, of course, are trying to defend the idea that the Cold War continues now, but that only sounds like a stupid excuse. Move the effect of commercials for 30-40 years ago - and film might have received fewer claims. But with firm confidence that we are now in the present day, not in the past century, where the Evil Russian Government only tortures, and the American Earth blows Spirit of Freedom for everyone who are ready to betray this Evil and Cold Country, where if you are a man, you are only a rapist, and if you are a girl, you are only just the victim of rape. And though this contrasts with some deputies that like to dissolve the hands, may works, yet, in addition to laughter, these arguments can't stand on their broken legs, and don't cause any positive emotions from the experienced viewer. And Francis Lawrence, along with the screenwriter, is absolutely serious in his twisted and warped-out-the world realities, completely forgetting about the banal logic of the now changed world, where espionage games have become more subtle and developed, and Budapest in appearance is not equal to Moscow with its gray identical houses, where lives the poor and oppressed residents who are afraid to leave the house, because the State will immediately take you by the throat, because your body belongs only to the Power, and the True Beaten Patriots fights for the Country.Undoubtedly, this is the influence of the literary source, but the tape of Lawrence looks exactly like a separate work, which is at least can be called a minor valued, but should be filled with meaning for the viewer. But the only sense in Russia, which you can see in the ""Sparrow"" - is the desire to rape a beautiful girl. On the screen there is almost no man with whom the heroine of Lawrence communicated, who would not want to get into her panties after a couple of seconds. And only one Good American she can trust. Cold Russia with its arrogant and a priori evil cardboard characters faces the bright American side, where no one forbids doctors to treat people and no one fresh their enemies. And let the creators are trying to show the importance of Love and Family through the brutal torture of the main character in the name of these things standing, but behind a veil of stupidity, bad stereotyping, uninteresting characters walking with the same faces, ""The Red Sparrow"" will lose any message and attempts to do something interesting, because even trying to treat at least some ironic to this show and simply keep up with the time, just as the ridiculous heroine of Rampling, who is fully confident that since the Cold War nothing has changed in Russia. And adequate spectator somehow have to enjoy ridiculous cranberry stereotyping, so the movie obviously turns out to work as a Comedy far more than satisfactory as a ""Great Spy Thriller"" (as intended The Director).It would seem, having grown up, it is felt that this unpleasant ""kissel"" should remain in school years, and with ""The Red Sparrow"" it seems that this ""Masterpiece"" had to remain somewhere in the past. However, it is 2018 on the yard, and cranberry jelly in a faceted glass is served on the table. It is the same tasteless, viscous and unpleasant. And at the time of its filling and serving this dish is completely cold. Of course, at some point, the most adequate audience will enjoy the level of ""so ridiculous that funny"", but the creators obviously NOT intended this, because in Russia, as we know, there is NO HUMOUR. There's only ballet, torture and spies. Thanks to the Grand Chef of this, passing that is not necessary. Better get the drink back, before it completely rotten up.",Red Sparrow

343,Elwood_Blues,How not to adapt a novel,5,3 June 2018,"Having read the book the film is based on, I'm really disappointed by this movie. The major reason for this is the screenplay by Justin Haythe.It removed way too many interesting points from the novel, for example Dominika's synesthesia. It would have been really interesting to have seen this translated to the screen. Also, the novel is rich in details about spycraft. Of course, you can not include all this in a movie but the film features almost nothing.
Then, the screenplay changes major plot points for absolutely no reason, for example the demise of Matorin has much more impact in the book because Dominika defeats him alone. And the fact that Vanya Egorov dies at the end instead of Korchnoi changes the entire movie to basically a bland revenge story without giving Korchnoi the kind of resolve he wished for himself in the novel. 
And last but not least this film contains maybe the most awkward sex scene in recent time (when I was watching this in the cinema, the entire crowd was laughing about it) - that is saying a lot when you compare this to the way the intense relationship of Dominika and Nate is described in the book.Apart from the screenplay, I'm not really sure if Joel Edgerton was the right choice for Nash - the chemistry between him and Jennifer Lawrence feels off to me. And while I get that you need some name actors to sell the movie, are there no Russian actors available for speaking parts to play Russians in a spy movie involving Russia?In the end, the only things saving this movie from being a complete waste of time are Jennifer Lawrence's performance, the cinematography by Jo Willems and the score by James Newton Howard.",Red Sparrow

The entire plot was lifted entirely from real Cold War era spying. The plot makes an excellent thriller, with lots of twists which are nonetheless never too confusing. There is not a lot of fighting, but the level of realistic violence is quite high. All the characters were distinct enough from each other to tell who they were, so the twists on who was a good guy and who was a bad guy were easy to track. For some reason I cannot fathom, they updated the setting of this story to modern day Russia. This is only apparent in the teacher's speech at the school and in calling the Russian security apparatus by the modern name instead of KGB. Everything else was a perfect 80s-era period piece, which is what this should have been. Thus, one point off. Bottom line: if you like spy thrillers and you don't mind seeing a really graphic movie that you should definitely not bring your kids to, then see it.",Red Sparrow
346,liambean,A misguided consistency in bad reviews.,8,21 June 2018,"I'm just going to say this from the outset. People who don't like this film wanted it to be a certain way. Most often they complain that the two principals didn't have any chemistry. Clearly, these people wanted a romance to happen. When it didn't, they panned the film. Had they been even slightly open-minded about this, they'd have figured out that this spy film was not going to find the ""girl meets boy, girl falls in love with boy"" formula so often used in this genre. In short, they didn't really watch the film. At some point, when that hackneyed formula failed to materialize, they stopped paying attention and decided it was a ""bad film.""So let us address this now. The writer of the book that was used as model for the script is a former CIA operative. That means Jason Matthews might actually know something about current Russian foreign service people and their operating methods. This professional knowledge carries over into the movie.The film is worth the watch precisely because it does not follow the ""girl meets boy"" formula. It is a film about coercion, survival, and revenge. Our former ballerina, now ""sparrow,"" follows her own path and still convinces her superiors that she is not only a patriot, she's a very clever one. An agent worth of promotion and praise.In her rise to the top, she ""takes out"" some of the people who put her in such an untenable position and, simultaneously, rises to a position of power in the Russian government. The ""hook"" is that we don't know quite how she pulls this off until the very end of the movie.This is what makes the movie interesting to watch. Not that she's some very physically appealing woman who is easily taken, but that she's a very intelligent young woman who is dangerous when betrayed.

That said, if all the characters in Russia were speaking perfect English as Russians it would have been weird too... Does it work? Yes. It works. In fact, it isn't much more different than when an actor with a New York accent picks up a Texan accent. And this is fiction, not a documentary. It's a movie.Is it a good movie? Hmm... It's not a bad movie. All actors are very believable and Jennifer is lovely as always. So not a bad movie, but not a fantastic movie. I have rated it ""7"" and maybe I should have rated it 5 or 6, but I do have a soft spot for Jennifer and I like the simple visual language of the film with the slightly depressing lighting, trying to create the atmosphere of a depressed life in Russia where nobody can trust anyone...So what is the problem with this movie? First of all, I am not sure that life is so depressing in Russia as the film portray it, or that the Americans are such shining white Angels... But that is a subjective feeling, a subjective opinion, but it's a big part of the movie and I am sure that even a true American Patriot will find the black and white description of the Russian characters a bit boring. Ad to that a rather unbelievable story and you will begin to understand why this film is not rated very high in general.So what is the bottom line? The script. The script either needs a more believable story or it should have been a different film with a more over the top fantasy story of super agents in the East and in the West... Also, the script needs more details on the characters who all are simple stereotypes that we as the audience can't relate to...But Jennifer is gorgeous as ever and I might regret my rating of ""7"" down the line (but I know I will watch it again... so...)",Red Sparrow

Aside from that there are people who didn't like it, because they want more action like Atomic Blonde or Bond type spy movies, but this is more like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, but sexier. In short, this did not meet my criteria for going to the theater, which are explosion, lots of action, lots of stunts and in general promises a meaningless fun good time. To quote Kings Men, ""This is not that type of movie."" I saw it because, I have loved Jennifer Lawrence since Winter's Bone and my sister said it was ""AMAZING!"" Yes, you have to engage yourself and think for yourself and try to figure what is going on. You might be able to figure it out, I didn't. Nice little twists. By the way, it is brutal, but I remember only one rape, which was stopped quickly. I say that, because one reviewer said that it was about rape and raped and raped again. Obviously never saw the movie. There was an attempt that never came close to following through. The character was less about sex and more about the power of manipulation, which is a true movie spy thing. That statement in itself is probably the only real possible area of drawback in film and that you need to suspend belief on. Jennifer's character is in general playing a power game of cat & mouse and always seems to be in control, even when she is extremely vulnerable. I enjoyed it immensely. Stellar acting all the way around. Well written and good story line.

I love Russian/Soviet spy stories, my favorite being Gorky Park (which has a cameo in the opening scenes of the movie). The problem is this story doesn't live up to anything as good as Gorky Park the movie or ""The Americans"" TV series. I give the actors plenty of credit, even though Jennifer Lawerence's Russian accent is inconsistent (sometimes OK, sometimes completely absent... better than say Kevin Costner's English accent in Robin Hood). However, her emotional acting is excellent and makes up for the accent (plus, to be fair, some of the ""Russians"" in the movie have accents, some just sound like Brits pretending to be Russian). Without giving away any spoilers, towards the end of the film, there can really only be two antagonists and everything goes exactly that way. The questions over loyalty are resolved so early that you almost don't trust what you're seeing because generally spy movies are ""wheels within wheels"". Occasionally, the movie seems like it's trying to have a sense of humor but that's kind of executed inconsistently as well. It's not a chess game, more like a volleyball tournament.

I know that this movie is based on a book which I haven't read so I can't really comment on it but if the movie is faithful to the source material then this book is pretty bad.Right from the get-go, the plot makes no sense. You are left wondering why would the Russian services act in this manner. As the movie progresses, it becomes quite clear that the author was not after writing an engaging spy-thriller but was rather after portraying the Russians as some sort of evil cultists stuck in the 19th century. I wouldn't have had a problem with that if the story was interesting. Unfortunately it isn't. Combine the typical Hollywood ""we're the good guys and they're the bad guys"" routine with an awful story filled with plot-holes and you'll get a pretty good idea what this movie is like.It's not all bad though. The cinematography and the acting are top notch. Hollywood knows how to shoot movies and make them visually appealing.

380,jpatrick-68632,Better'n we thought it'd be,7,11 March 2018,"We went to see RED SPARROW as our date-day treat. There was nothing else we particularly fancied and we were near the reclining-seat cinemas so we thought 'why not'?A ballerina with the Bolshoi with the oddly alluring name of 'Dominika' suffers a stomach churner of an injury that puts an end to her dancing days. She has a super-creepy uncle who explains that she will be kicked out of her Moscow-posh Bolshoi funded apartment. She lives with her sickly mother, and she, creepy uncle assures her, will be victim to health-care-for-the-uninsured. Must've been horrified intakes of breath in America. Or at least the parts of America that call themselves 'America'. Parts of America that call themselves 'Canada' would have been indifferent.Creepy uncle blackmails her, and offers her a job as a sparrow. A sparrow is a secret agent who is trained to get under the guard of hapless Americans by rogering them. Dominika's secret rogering name might have been 'Stormy Daniels'. She is trained by Charlotte Rampling who reprises her 'Night Porter' role. Sort of. I think creepy uncle really just wanted to see her without any clothes on.Stormy has a gift for rogering and is very convincing. She can also give a bloke a VERY bad time if she so chooses and she so-chooses for a fellow trainee who has a very miserable time of it indeed.She's sent to Budapest to extract the name of a high-level mole from an American agent played by an Australian who also played an Egyptian. Why? Dunno. Although if those under MAGA hats are anything to go by, good-looking roosters are light on the ground in the US. As are teeth. As any devotee of spy fiction knows, moles are either traitorous dangers to the very fabric of the universe, or heroes. Depends on whether they are ours or theirs.Now, we lived in Budapest for three years, so we spent a fair bit of the Budapest part of the movie whispering excitedly ""Oooo; we've been there"". I looked back longingly and wondered in the way of wonderings why I hadn't been subjected to a steamy Stormy adventure, and consoled myself by thinking maybe I had, but I was subjected to a memory-erasing drug and couldn't remember. Or I was pissed. In reality I just didn't know very much.Anyway Stormy does what Stormy does with the American agent played by an Australian who also played an Egyptian in an attempt to get him to whisper the name of the mole so she can be a hero. She also does a lot of stuff that had us thinking ""Hmmm, why is she doing that"" and the same thoughts occurred to her bosses and suspicion falls upon her devotion to the cause and she goes back to Russia for a bit of torture. She becomes the first Russian EVER to be released after a trip to the cells and heads back to the American agent played by an Australian who also played an Egyptian. She skins him.She rings her boss with name of the mole, although the skinning bit is sort of peripheral to this. The rest of the movie is the ending-bit and I shan't go there.Is it any good?
Well yes it is. It has all the bits that make a good movie good. Uppances are come. There are bits that had us whispering 'well I didn't see that coming' and there are lots places where we have been. I would maybe have liked Champs Bar on Dohány ut to have featured but it wasn't and that's OK.

The claim that this is a smart, intelligent movie is a little unjust. Throughout the movie, we are see Dominika being used as a pion for the side of the Russians and the Americans. The mystery of the movie is which side she eventually would support. The American faction (good guys) or the Russian faction (clearly the bady guys in the movie). Throughout the movie, we learn that the main character is a good girl(although a little violent sometimes in her response to those that hurt her) with a crush on an American guy. The Russian faction also treated her really badly, while the American faction did not. Furthermore, the movie is directed by Americans, so yeah - you can see the final 'plot twist' coming from miles away. Other than that, there is not much depth in the story, other than some nagging events without real consequences. There are some very good and interesting scenes in the movie and each scene draws your attention in some way, but if you tie all of the scenes together, the overall picture just becomes a little unsatistfying to watch, as it feels a bit disjointed. I am not sure what message of the film was, maybe: 'The Russians are bad, mkay?""Luckily, most of the performances were solid, including that of Jeniffer Lawrence, even though I agree her accent is pretty mediocre and here character is mostly display. Mathias Schoenaerts was the most believable Russian in my opinion. Surprisingly good performance of him.I also had a problem with the fact that the movie seems ambiguous in the sense of period, as it looks like a mix between the nineties and modern times.Overall, wouldn't really recommend this movie to anyone, except for those eager to see Jennifer undress on the big screen.6.5/10",Red Sparrow

Ms Lawrence, who, I must admit, I had never seen before (I gather she was featured in youngster-oriented action movies), plays those scenes with excellent aplomb. I really look forward to seeing her in other films worthy of her talent. But I was truly upset with all those actors having adopted some pseudo-Russian accent. The action takes place in Russia, for the most part, with characters presented as Russians. We don't need a fake accent to remind us.This sounded like a throwback to the US quasi-propaganda films of the 1970s or 1980s, displaying the evil Soviets, but not as much as the disgusting cruelty featured in so many scenes.

396,timothyalanwilliams,"""Red Sparrow"" Never Really Takes Off In Order To Soar",4,29 April 2018,"""Red Sparrow"" which is based on a book trilogy written by former CIA operative, Jason Matthews, tells a long and winding story of a premiere Russian ballerina who is trained to be a spy after suffering a career-ending injury. Jennifer Lawrence brings her ""Hunger Games"" star-power to this severely sluggish film which runs about 30 minutes too long and saves all of its action and suspense for the ending.
I will admit, I have never been a huge fan of Ms. Lawrence (except for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" which she won an Oscar for) and this movie didn't change my mind too much. I think that she brings all that she has to the role, and even has some shining moments, but the movie overly sexualizes her and wastes her talents on flirting and seduction (as the Sparrows are known to be trained to use sex in order to get information from their targets).
The supporting cast shines where they can. Joel Edgerton (""Bright""), Jeremy Irons (""Justice League""), and Mary-Louise Parker (""Red"") are the stand-outs in the crowded cast. Mary-Louise pretty much steals the movie in just one scene, the best scene, which should have been the tone of the entire film.
""Red Sparrow"" tries really hard to be like ""Salt"" and ""Atomic Blonde"" but has none of the action that kept those films moving and at least entertaining. Instead, ""Sparrow"" takes itself too seriously and too sexually to be worth its over two hours running time.",Red Sparrow

There's something called the inter-webs in 2018 and computers aren't even made with disk drives of any kind.I had this movie running on cable, kind of half following it while doing chores, as I often do. At first it struck me as a lousy excuse to show naked bodies and sex scenes. Then it struck me as a poor ""La Femme Nikita""-wannabe. But the double-twist ending intrigued me and I watched it again.The ending was worth sitting through the cheesy, outdated mess again. If you are like me and come to these reviews with spoilers specifically to see if a film is worth sitting through, here is a recap: Dancer with sick mother gets her leg broken and gets sent to 'state' school by her Russian spymaster uncle. Then dancer is sent to Budapest to discover name of mole working with the American, Nate. Nate tries to turn dancer into a double-agent. After a mess in London involving a US Senator's chief of staff, the mole reveals himself to dancer. Dancer gives up her asinine uncle as the mole instead of the high-ranking Jeremy Irons, so she can keep working with the Americans.There. Hope I saved you 2 hours of your life.Jeremy Irons is always worth seeing. That line from him, ""At least (our clumsy American friends) aspire to individual liberty""-is also dated. I dunno if the average American still believes that in 2019, with wages stagnant and rents escalating for the last 20 years. We are prisoners of large corporations, and the corporation is not a democratically run entity. The only free people are the super-rich. Even the millionaires are servants of the billionaires.That is, Mr Matthews's understanding of the socioeconomic landscape also needs to be updated.I have no opinion of Jennifer Lawrence's performance, since I've never seen any of her other movies.

406,weejockxxx,A magnificent 'Old School' thriller,10,12 March 2018,"This film is a throwback to the days of realism. No sound stages, green screen or cgi, Red Sparrow relies on good old-fashioned acting. Jennifer Lawrence plays the former ballerina Dominika Egorova whose on-stage accident(?) leaves her and her sick mother at the mercies of the State and her creepy Uncle. Threatened with the loss of her status, apartment and medical assistance for her mother, Dominika is persuaded by her Uncle, in return for security, to play 'Escort' to a man who is then murdered in front of her whilst he is raping her. 
Dominika is then given a choice, as there can be no witnesses, she must become an agent of the State or be eliminated. Reluctantly she joins the Sparrow School but during the torture and humiliation she is put through (her body has been nourished by the State and so it belongs to them) , she maintains enough of her sanity to use her body and her intelligence to exact revenge on the man who put her in this nasty situation.
Eschewing the tired and worn tropes of recent 'espionage thrillers' Red Sparrow has no high-octane car chases, unrealistic kickass fight scenes or implausible stunts. Instead, what you get is a 'grounded in reality' adventure where the heroine feels pain and is tortured both physically and mentally. 
Jennifer Lawrence is fast maturing as an actress and in this film, we see her at her best. 
Much has been made of the so-called similarities between this film and the upcoming Marvel imitation, Black Widow (which probably wouldn't have happened if not for this film). This comparison is woefully laughable as Black Widow, like all its predecessors, will be a cartoonish film with no real peril whereas Red Sparrow leaves you with a sense that Dominika suffers real pain. In fact comparing 'Red Sparrow' to a possible 'Black Widow' is like comparing The Maltese Falcon to Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

408,CuratingAesthetics,False Advertising,5,3 January 2019,"This was promoted as a Black Widow-esque Russian spy movie, but that was a very broad comparison. There was virtually no action in the film. Instead it focuses more on the psychological aspect of being a spy and the consequences. Jennifer did a passable accent, but she only ever spoke English. I would've expected a Russian spy movie to have some Russian language, yet no one ever speaks it.She was blackmailed into going to Sparrow school, but then did nothing they asked and eventually got removed from it to do something else. They weren't learning fighting from what I could see. They only shows one quick scene of some people shooting guns. The whole education process seemed to be figuring out what kind of sex their targets wanted, but not what they'd actually be getting from the targets.I didn't quite get the relationship between her and the American officer. She's trying to manipulate him to get what she wants, but then she tries to kiss him and he shuts her down. Yet later out of nowhere she goes to him and forces herself on him into a super awkward and very short sex scene. She's on him super into it and he's just underneath not even really reacting, aside from touching her side a bit. It was a very unnecessary sex act that that did nothing for the story.I thought Jen's overall performance was good. She had some intense scenes to film, including rape and torture. Though at the same time nothing really stuck out for me in terms of memorable scenes. Then the ending was beyond predictable. I knew who the mole would be and that she would give them her uncle in the end.

But I couldn't tell for sure and the constant use of ""the President"" implies otherwise.
And that's one thing I find disappointing. It's a bit too obvious who the good guys are. ""Personal freedom"", ""living in a prison"" - that's so 90s. True, the propaganda is presented in a clever way, but also it's not subtle enough. And I think for a movie created in the 2018, it should be.

The story of cold-war honey-pots to trap diplomats to extract sensitive information is not a new one. Like most of the sexpionage movies, adequate scenes of grueling brutalities are added to pep up the storyline and create the base of the characterization. What tries to separate it from the lineage of those movies is its skilled star cast and first-rate screenplay. The action scenes are fast and well-choreographed. However, the plot seems to ride too much on the soldiers of its titular character and fails to provide the requisite nail-biting suspense.

Jennifer Lawrence, an amazing actress, plays here very well.And together with Joel Egerton she creates a kind of harmony and form of play.I've also loved the entire plot of the movie. Narrated from beginning to end.",Red Sparrow
417,blanchjoe,Classic Cold War Thriller,8,18 April 2018,"While there does appear to be an overabundance of GRU funded FancyBear negative reviews on this film ( and it is easy to see why ), it is actually a very well made Spy vs Spy Thriller in the classic John le Carré mode, not quite the cold distant calculation of a George Smiley, and not quite the cartoon quality of a James Bond.Some feel this film creates a caricature of the post Soviet Russia, and this is not fully true, while modern Russia is not the Soviet State and few if any of the individuals we see in this film are ""average"" Russians, it is instead an interesting window into an Oligarch Mafia-State that tightly controls all forms of dissent and communication, in that sense the portraiture of the individuals in power is not far from the Truth. Well worth watching.",Red Sparrow
418,chestern-80136,"Wonderfully grim, but lacking overall",6,15 March 2018,"Spy thrillers are quite an odd genre, at least in my opinion. Oftentimes, they vary massively in quality. There are some incredibly mature films, focusing on the grim reality of international espionage. There are also ones which enjoy themselves more, relishing in the glitz and glamour of their line of work. Then, there's many which are simply aimed at the widest audience possible, and end up leaving nothing of substance as they do their best to play it safe and remain inoffensive to anybody. I'll be honest, after watching the trailer and seeing Jennifer Lawrence's casting, I assumed Red Sparrow would be the latter of my list. I've nothing against Jennifer Lawrence's work, but for the most part, she seems to feature in films I rarely find enjoyment in. I enjoy X-Men comics, and the occasional film, but the recent ones she's featured in gave me little-to-no pleasure from watching them. The Hunger Games films, based on the books I enjoyed at the time, were also ultimately lacking. They even dragged out what I feel is many people's least favourite book into two films in order to maximise profits. I've yet to see Mother! but from what I've heard, it's terribly divisive. Still, it means it's the second bleak film Jennifer Lawrence has starred in, in a row.I was even less certain about this film following the online reaction. With the recent success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, many people have been pushing for a standalone Black Widow film. Marvel seems reluctant to do so, and regardless of what people's thoughts on the matter may be, it seems we won't be getting one. Still, when Red Sparrow was announced, many fans were excited. There was certainly many links between the characters (female, russian, spy etc.) but, personally, I don't think a Black Widow film would work. At least not in the way Marvel and Disney would attempt it. Regardless, this certainly wasn't a fun, kick-ass superhero film.Red Sparrow certainly isn't aimed at what I would consider a standard Jennifer Lawrence fan (12-20 female). It is a surprisingly adult, and remarkably depressing film. Comic relief is almost entirely absent, and the violence was cranked up to 11. In England, the film was rated a 15 (after a single scene was trimmed to keep the rating), presumably to pull in as many viewers as possible. After seeing it, however, I feel it would have been perfectly fine as an 18. I imagine they made use of various loopholes as the rating system has many odd rules regarding what you can and can't show. There was full-frontal nudity featured frequently throughout, something which I came to believe would earn you an automatic 18+ rating. Of course, adult language was also utilised throughout to a point where I was left scratching my head; I don't know what else could have been added that would have bumped the film up to an 18.That isn't to say I was disgusted by the content. In fact, it's what I enjoyed the most. It was a pleasant surprise to see what I assumed to be a star vehicle flesh out into a grimly gruesome thriller. There was also genuine moments of beauty, with some wonderful shots sprinkled throughout the first ten minutes. In my opinion, in fact, the first third or so of the film was by far the best. The tone was terribly uncomfortable throughout certain scenes, and I was hoping the whole film would be of similar content. Unfortunately, the plot progressed.Personally, the writing of the film was the weakest aspect for me. All of the characters felt rather flimsy, unfortunately. I appreciate that in spy films, everyone is a trained professional doing their job, and oftentimes that leads to drier scenes, but I was struggling to stay focused throughout this particular cinematic venture. The most engaging points in the film were all littered throughout the first third, once again.The plot was also rather flimsy. Honestly, halfway through the film, I wasn't sure what the main objective was. I don't know if I simply missed an important line, but it felt like we were juggling subplots needlessly. When the actual climax of the film came, I was surprised; I assumed the main conflict we were addressing was simply a side-plot.As lacking as I felt the characters were, however, the actors weren't to blame as far as I could tell. Jennifer Lawrence was perfectly fine, and her accent was consistent throughout as far as I could tell, so I can't complain too much. Joel Edgerton was also perfectly serviceable. Matthias Schoenaerts was probably my favourite in the film, but a single enjoyable performance can't carry a film. Unless it's Nicholas Cage, of course.The pacing of the film was terribly slow, too. I can enjoy slower burning films, but in good films, you're fed information at a steady pace to keep you invested. In Red Sparrow, it felt like we were told something, then there'd be a half hour slump, then the plot would resume.Unfortunately, I also found much of the soundtrack to be forgettable. I hate to continue saying it, but at the beginning, the music was used well with the scenes. Beyond that, however, I barely noticed it. I know many people may argue that means it served it's role perfectly, but I much prefer the more memorable tunes I can hum a year after seeing it.Overall, I feel Red Sparrow was a 6/10. I can absolutely recommend it if you enjoy grim spy thrillers, or if you are simply a fan of the cast, but if not i'd steer clear as this film offers little else.",Red Sparrow

This movie clearly took a lot of work on her part to make and she does a pretty good job with the material she had.WITH THE MATERIAL SHE HADThe positive reviews seem to assume that those who didn't like this were unprepared for a thoughtful twisty spy thriller. I WAS prepared for a thoughtful twisty spy thriller, full of tension and surprises. What I got instead was a VERY pedestrian, nondescript waste of my time. Non-engaging, completely linear, unremarkable, unsurprising.I honestly can't be bothered to write more about it. Suffice to say that I am very disappointed.

427,ailishcrombie,Edge of the seat stuff,9,4 April 2018,"I went to see Red Sparrow having watched the trailer once whilst seeing another movie. I was pleasantly surprised!Jennifer Lawrence and Joel Edgerton give two very different and convincing performances. The cinematography of the whole movie (and particularly the opening scene) was captivating. There were a lot of good twists and turns as the movie went on and alot of violence both sexualised and torture themed (so not for the faint of heart). I was constantly on the edge of my seat with nervous anticipation for when the next difficult-to-watch scene was going to appear. However it did not take away from the story or cinema experience. I enjoyed seeing Jennifer Lawrence taking on a different and challenging role and she did the character credit. The supporting cast including Mary Louise Parker and Jeremy Irons as well as some of the non speaking actors were all fantastic and professional, giving the movie a chilly realistic feel. I would recommend this to anyone who likes movies about spies, the government and corrupt agencies. Also if you like Jennifer and Joel they don't disappoint!",Red Sparrow

433,bigbadwolf666,Red Sparrow,10,5 August 2021,"Impressive Movie with an Impressive cast. I've never thought I'd like it so much. It always gets better every rewatching and I've rewatched it a lot of times. The story is impeccable. The directing is wonderful. I think the film has a bit overly gore but it is needed for the sad subject. I think this is the movie Jennifer Lawrence should've won the Oscar for not the other one. There was much anticipation for Jennifer Lawrence nudity which was well done but I think overall the film is much more powerful than that. I think it's funny that I checked this film with Salt which is similar and reviewed it as well but this film is miles better. Though the only knock on it is of course is if a woman gets beat up like that she'd have permanent deform not look normal the next scene but it's done in good taste for the sake of the film. I don't think anyone would like it if Jennifer Lawrence was actually deformed through out the film. I also don't like the abuse on women but they don't hold anything back. I'm sure that's done in real life. Sadly.The film starts out great. I like when the American who's played by an actor I really enjoy( Joel Edgerton) is running away and shoots out and goes to the protective embassy. I've never seen an embassy so overprotected like they do in the movies but it's well done. I did enjoy Jennifer's theatrics as a ballerina though of course I don't think she has a ballerina figure. I did enjoy it but found odd how they added that ballerina's suffer career ending injuries through the extensive dancing. I've known this and have heard of this but it's never really shown or promoted. The film's beginning is very memorable and interesting when Dominika goes through Sparrow school. I really did like this American version where they avoid the sex. In real life we know she would've gone through a lot bad disgusting sex. There is a lot of disturbing scenes in the beginning but I thought it was worth adding as it was so Russian and so realistic and needed to be added for the sake of the story. The story between Dominika and her uncle is very strange and disturbing. It must be a nod to real life common family occurrences where there is unethical family relations. It was never well known or developed why she hated him so much. I didn't really find him that bad but more of obsessive about his country which you cant really say it's a bad thing. The relation between Dominika and Nash isn't also well developed where she is attracted to him but it's not well understood. He is known through the film not to be well attractive though there isn't really any hot shots but still there is no reason why Dominka would fall for him so hard. The duality of her patriotism is extremely similar to Salt which I find funny as two big stars try to play a similar story of multiple agents in a usually confusing story sequence but here I found this film to be a lot better done and interesting. I think the premise here made a lot more sense and was more understandable. The training sequences along with the torture stories were so well done and realistic. I thought it was one of the best films of its subject I've ever seen. I really enjoyed the entire cast. Knowns and unknowns. I really loved the add of Jeremy Irons which I'm a huge fan of and who played the role perfectly. It has Miranda Richardson as the Mother which I thought was nice since I like Miranda Richardson. I liked both the actresses they picked as the teacher for the sparrow scenes and the torturer who I found extremely memorable and haunting. I don't think anybody wouldn't have given in. I would've that's for sure. I like the beginning and ending connection to the song and ballerina theme. Overall like Salt, I would enjoy a sequel of this. I think despite all it's wonderful attributes Jennifer Lawrence did carry this film and was worth the 15 million, actually deserved more. As her big name and star status brought-in the audience. I think Jennifer Lawrence is an incredible actress which I'm a big fan of despite a lot of naysayers and many thinking she's not attractive I think she's beautiful and I am impressed by her for continuing to take risky choices like this film. I'd wish she continue on her super star career and would hope she continues on her road to more films like this of a serious theme which I think is her best and think makes her a much better actress than those other type of big box office films. I highly recommend this film.",Red Sparrow
434,directorgod-2,Two not brave Laurence ruined the movie,3,5 April 2018,"A woman like Jenifer Laurence needs to be really brave to make this kind of old fashioned Spy movie cause honestly there is no new stuff in this kind of movie any more. Cold war is finished and there is no more spy game like this anymore. But she was not brave or really made up her mind to be the charactor this time. 
Why now making this kind of movie?
But still if you wnat to make this kind of movie, there should be a new stuff to added such as 
1-real suffering from spy school learning all kinds of brutal and 'sexually going too far training'. But all she've done was saying I am not a prostitute when she was forced to have sex for training. So we saw nothing that can sympathize her from training. She learning or suffered nothing from it. 
2. Jennifer really didn't seduced the opposite males to make him fall into her when she was in the line of work. When she was seducing the CIA guy, she was not even half naked. She was wearing all of her clothes on and just robbing herself to him. That's all she've done. This is not seducing enough to make us feel something. Think about the movie like LUST and Caution. 
3. torturing scenes should be really extreme which did not happened. Most of the torturing were all just not scary at all. We've seen much much scary tortures from other movies and these are just simply not working to make us feel wow it really is scared. IT was merly to show that they are torturing and that was not enough at all.
I think the both actress and the director found the easy way to make this movie. Why even rated R making this kind of soft just bypassing incidents? To just make a TV rated movie? Jennifer thought that she is a great star and will still work for the audience just to show herself a little bit without really suffering to act that will really make the audience feel that she really felt things during acting. She just pretended to act in this movie. She was not really suffering or trying enough to make us feel something. Think of movies like LUST and Caution (mentioning this movie already twice right?)
I am not crazy about watching extremes nudity or torturing shots. But this movie had nothing to really make us feel the charactor. 
No real breathtaking story or great acting or new experience. All of the members of this movie just wanted to get done with it. They really didn't worked hard enough to make it real.
Simply aweful movie to watch.",Red Sparrow
435,kjarvis1212,Don't Waste Your Time,5,22 August 2018,"I'm told the book on which this film is based is quite good. Having not read it, I had high expectations for this film based on the trailers and some good reviews. I was also anxious to see Jennifer Lawrence in this type of role. I was massively disappointed. The story starts off well enough. JL's character has her livelihood taken from her in an ""accident."" As she recovers, she's consoled by her shadowy, definitely connected uncle. But he has ulterior motives, and uses JL's fragile mother to convince JL to do a dirty job. This entire set up, in which we also meet Edgerton's U.S. secret agent trying to protect an asset, is quite good. But then it all just falls apart, and rather quickly. Too much time is spent depicting JL's time among fellow recruits in a strange ""school"" where the trainees are taught to manipulate targets using their sex appeal. By this point in the flick, little makes sense. What's worse, there's no emotional ties to any of the characters whatsoever. We never get a true sense of the stakes or what it is about these fictional people that drives their emotional state. By the time the final triple double cross is revealed, I'd lost interest long before. It's a shame, because Lawrence definitely showed potential for such a role, but sadly the script left her little to work with. Edgerton's character is also wasted, as is an all-too brief performance by Jeremy Irons. And save for one great, nail-biting fight scene, there's not much action to get excited about in this film, either. Filmmakers don't seem to understand that you can't just plop some theoretically interesting characters into a movie and expect people to relate to them without showing us WHY we can relate to them; character development is key, and this film is almost completely void of it. The only reason I gave it five stars was because Jennifer Lawrence is so completely and utterly gorgeous. Again, her acting here is good, but the script is not, so it's only natural that it's her beauty that ends up being the thing that resonates. And that's too bad.",Red Sparrow
436,spiderbat-863-656723,"Something good, something bad, something ugly",6,25 February 2021,"My rating of this movie is the result of averaging some good factors and some bad, IMHO. I appreciated the plot, which lets you at least a bit uncertain until its conclusion, and the ambiguous complexity of the lead character.
I felt an excess of unnecessary nudity throughout the movie: I'm no puritan, but I find such exibitions more suited for B movies with pirañas, giant reptilians or multi-headed sharks. Moreover, the depiction of Russian Federation as a perfectl Evil Empire, where everything, from artistic career to politics, is ruled by violence, cruelty and unrighteousness and the the only innocent characters are old poor sick mothers (or, more precisely, just one old poor sick mother) ends up being more ludicrous than offensive.
Two final remarks: 1.: I watched the movie dubbed into Italian; there was no spur of fake Russian accent but Russian characters occasionally uttered expressions like 'spasibo', 'konechno' or 'idi siuda!', which I found rather funny.
2.: I paid no attention to particulars that might pinpoint in which year the action takes place, but floppy disks seem rather archaic for 'modern-day', as wikipedia locates the facts temporally.",Red Sparrow
437,csbob447,Deeply unsettling,4,16 September 2018,"Red Sparrow is a lot like last year's Atomic Blonde. Both films are about femme fatales, both films take place largely in Russia, both films have twist and turns in their spy thrillers, both films use some bold colors (Atomic Blonde blue, Red Sparrow red), and both films are by the number spy thrillers that are not interesting. The only different is that Atomic Blonde was at least fun and did not have really uncomfortable undertones like Red Sparrow does!One thing that I can absolutely give Red Sparrow credit is that it is a technical well made spy thriller. Francis Lawrence, most known for directing three of the four Hunger Games films, as well as I am Legend, isn't exactly an interesting or stylish director, has definitely stepped up his game, making a visually striking film with some great use of red color hues. I won't call this movie stylized really and there's not a lot of subtly and substance to really analyze, but there is certainly a lot of interesting shots that does feel pretty cool. The score is also pretty great too, being done by James Newton Howard. It's largely classical inspired and even using classical pieces, that both fit the film and adds a bit of tension and even beauty to what is going on. And that's about it for the positives really.I mean the acting is alright really, but these characters are so bland and by the numbers they just feel like carbon copies of characters you've already seen before in spy thrillers. This is very much true for Jennifer Lawrence's character, Dominika or as she is referred to ""Sparrow."" J-Law has proven to be a great actress, and she goes as far as she can with her role, even with her fake Russian accent, but her character is so flat that her natural charisma does not elevate her role as far as we really want. Add to some stale chemistry with Joel Edgerton, who is shockingly bad in this film, and any sex appeal from this movie is gone down the drain.Speaking of bland, this story is just so dull! It's nothing you have not seen before, the plot is convoluted and hard to follow at times, and it's just so long and the film drags! Like I was so bored by this dull movie. It's not a constant fun, action-packed spy film and more in the vein of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, a spy film more about wit and intrigue instead of being action oriented, which I can respect. But like I have to care about what I am seeing, which I do not! It's just so uninteresting.And not to mention really uncomfortable! Like this movie is super graphic with it's violence and sexual imagery. Like there is a scene in the film that basically was going to full blown rape, I am not kidding. This is to add to some feminist subtext with the film, but with how needlessly graphic the film gets, and really analyzing this movie in a feminist critique it is incredibly shallow. Sparrow doesn't do much work on her own as she basically has to be told what to do, including having a man forced upon her! Yuck! I can somewhat respect this movie if it was at all handled the touchy subject respectfully, or just full blown exploitative and unapologetic, but it never goes that extra step and just feels like a tepid mix of Tinker Tailor and Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Maybe the book did it better but I have no interest in picking up the source material after watching this.I can't hate this film too much because it is a well shot movie and the score is good, but it's just a long, boring, and uncomfortable slog to sit through. It's too boring for a spy film, too shallow for a feminist movie, and too scummy for J-Law fans. Just skip it altogether!",Red Sparrow

445,dkwestbrook,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,1,14 July 2018,"This is honestly the worst movie I've seen in a very long time. The whole ""spy plot"" is lazy and derivative and feels like it's been plucked wholesale from some 80s Cold War thriller...hence why this movie makes no sense. They've essentially made a Cold War thriller but set it in the modern day, without updating anything, meaning that the conflict is outdated and the movie is incredibly unrealistic. You could credit this movie by saying that they don't make movies like this anymore, but there's a reason they don't. How anyone under 30 is supposed to make sense of any of this is beyond me. It almost feels like they forget the time period at times though, seeing as this movie expects me to believe that the CIA is doing file transfers by floppy disk in 2018. The only area where this movie is putting any effort in at all is how the violence and nudity, which is excessive to the point of being repulsive. I get that a Cold War thriller needs violence, but I don't think any cinema goer anywhere can profess to wanting to see graphic and bloody depictions of a woman breaking her leg, of torture by skin grafting or a man struggle to get an erection in front a competently naked woman (am I watching an actual movie or is it porn?). It feels almost like the point of the movie was to be provocatively gratuitous and to make it's audience feel sick. When violence or sex aids the story, then by all means. But in a movie with a plot as piss-weak as this, it almost feels as though this movie exists to be graphic and extreme - and honestly, it's disgusting.But apart from that main issue, another problem is that this movie is just plain mediocre in every other regard. It's directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games) and across all his films he has demonstrated some very bland and undistinctive filming. The cinematography is nothing special, the style is nothing special, the music is OK but certainly not James Newton Howard's best work. And there's the acting...oh boy. OK, in fairness Charlotte Rampling, Jeremy Irons, Mary Louise Parker and Joely Richardson are all pretty good...if somewhat unremarkable. Joel Edgerton as the stupidly named character Nate Nash is flat out terrible, and the low point of the movie. Jennifer Lawrence is also not doing her best work her. I think she's an overrated actress, but she can be OK in the right movie. The issue is she frequently chooses the wrong movies (Passengers, say) and in this movie she's distracted from her acting by trying to keep up the terribly uneven Russian accent she's doing. The romance between Lawrence and Edgerton's characters - which mind, is central to the movie - is unbelievable, lacks chemistry and is plain boring to watch. Francis Lawrence and Jennifer Lawrence had the exact same problem on The Hunger Games movies. I've been blaming Josh Hutcherson for years, but maybe it's these two that are to blame.Ultimately, in different circumstances Red Sparrow could have been passable. Had the studio put its foot down, the casting had been better and Francis Lawrence (who is a hack who should never make a movie again) had not been involved, it could have been alright. I don't think it was ever destined to be great, but it wouldn't have been this either. As it stands, this movie is plain terrible as it lets its mediocre elements be dragged down by the excessive obsession with violence and sex, making it a down right nasty movie to watch, that I can't imagine would bring pleasure to anyone. If the plot had been more clever or original, or the tone had been more campy and fun, it might have been OK. But what we have is a mean spirited, dour and plain boring execution of a script packed with dumb ideas. I cannot recommend this movie at all.Just a final comment: this movie may well prove how TV is overtaking movies as the dominant medium. Answer me this: why would anyone pay $20 to go the cinema and see this when they can stay home and watch the TV show The Americans, which is a fantastic execution of a similar idea? The Americans is amazing, Red Sparrow is a waste of time.",Red Sparrow

There are beautiful vistas and costumes, and you can see some time and effort has been spent on the production, in particular the design. It is not a 'poor quality' film in a production sense. I think there is also the potential for a genuinely good film here. Where it falls down is ...... everything else.I was honestly dismayed by this film in almost every way. The script is really poor with very basic, boring dialogue and the terrible dialogue is further exacerbated by very poor direction and editing. The film is all over the place, it is very messy, the way scenes are cut just seems all wrong. It actually feels like a rough first draft rather a final cut. I think much more time needed to be spend in the editing suite to clean this film up. Because, as is, it results in a very poor experience for the viewer.The acting performances are also very poor, it honestly doesn't feel like any of the actors wanted to act in this. They are all walking through their lines with no effort or any feeling. This results in no tension, no chemistry, and no interest from the viewers. I was extremely bored and disappointed throughout this film, to the point of falling asleep. Towards the end, I considered walking out and I understand why others have walked out. This film is just not compelling at all.Then there is the very poorly handled gratuitous nudity, sexual violence, and violence in general. I am by no means a prude and I love action films and fight sequences - when they are done well. But the sex and violence in this film was just plain awful. It was gory and shocking, and amateurish - as if it was being written and filmed by a sick teenage boy. There was also absolutely no need for it. I think the director was delusional enough to imagine it served as a ""motivation"" for Dominika but as a woman let me tell you there was nothing motivating about those ridiculously bad rape and torture scenes. Finally, it is clearly an Anti-Russian propaganda piece. The fact that the book was written by an ex CIA agent tells you all need to know. The story is basically a dull, juvenile, patriotic fantasy. In this film, Russians are all evil sick and twisted while Americans are angelic heroes. It is very insulting to sit through. At one point, when the film was once again cutting jaggedly from incredibly long and boring scenes to jarring gory scenes, I wondered if the audience was being force fed horrible images and brainwashed in some kind of MKULTRA mind control experiment.

This is a harsh film, but that is the subject matter it deals with, and it is well done, not the frivolous treatment espionage usually gets in a shaken not stirred manner.I liked this film, and found it very entertaining, and it had a story I felt really captured the dangerous and stressful situations in the spy world. Probably not for everyone, but if you want a good edgy thriller, this is it. The cast was very good, everybody brought their best game in my view.

This movie was not what I expected. I thought it would be more of a female ""Jason Bourne"" type movie, with Jennifer as the spy, kicking-ass. But I was a bit disappointed. It was a blatant sexual depiction of mostly 'females' being trained to use their SEX as a ploy to extract information from men.

It was very well done. Are there errors? Yes. I've yet to see a perfect movie. But the acting is great. The cinematography is nicely done. Story is very well written. Are the twists and turns predictable? Maybe. But I don't sit in movies trying to figure them out. I like to let the movie take me on a journey. And this one delivered.I honestly don't understand all the negative reviews. Everyone around me in our theater loved it. Was it violent? Oh yeah. More than I expected. Even a bit vicious, if you will. It was hardcore. Was it a bit harsh on the Russians? Yes. But this is fiction. It's not a biography. And having been to Russia and soent time there, it had a very Russian flare. I would say that it was modern day mixed with cold war.But let me tell you, I doubt the concepts were horribly off the mark. And, honestly, you could probably reverse the countries positions in the movie and still wouldn't be horribly off the mark. I mean, we're talking about espionage and counter-espionage...

 I watched this because I like Jenifer lawrence but I have honestly got to say that she was pretty awful in this role - her accent, her over-acting and her lack of credibility.

It isn't that the acting is horrible, it's the whole premise that makes the movie come across as exploitive and distasteful, not to mention silly at times when it wants to be profound.As her personal fortunes fall, she is given an ""opportunity"" by her uncle, no less, to go on a secret mission. When the mission goes sideways, good ole uncle offers her a chance not to have a bullet put into her head by allowing her to train as a Sparrow; or rather go to wh*re school, as Lawrence's character refers to it. The inclusion of that line evaporates all possible gravitas the film was trying to have (and made me laugh out loud for a couple days after I saw this thing).The typical espionage tropes are here, only they all seem to have nymphomania and antisocial personality disorder. Overall, the plot follows a somewhat logical progression, with the mandatory intrigue mixed in. Sadly, the over-sexed, violent, and exploitive plot detracts far to much from the film to allow it to be really landmark cinema. Shocking cinema, yes. Good cinema, no.The motto of this film should have been, ""What happens at wh*re school, stays at wh*re school.""

So thinned skinned!The film is fascinating and Jennifer Lawrence was exquisite. Her range from naive ballerina, to hardened spy, to ingenius triple crosser is magnificent. Joel Edgerton has indisputably been handed the baton as the most talented actor in Hollywood. He also does not disappoint with this role: he is tough, tender, and believable. I can't imagine another actor who could have filled this part as well as Edgerton.I have not read the book, but the screenplay is well done - the pace of the story is captivating, each of the characters are fully developed and introduced cleverly to the audience, even when only getting limited screen time. It is fascinating how the story gets wrapped up in the end and you are in a cliffhanger throughout.It has been decades since a really good Cold War Thriller has come out (Robert Redford Spy Games?? The Good Shepherd???) and this one is timely with the current compromise of so many in the immediate circle of the present administration. You get a peek behind the curtain of the ugly side of world affairs in this film. The use of ""Sparrows"" by the Russians is such a fascinating subplot.My only question is how did Dominika find ziplocks in Budapest (or was it Moscow? I can't remember the location of the uncle's apartment).The editing, staging and camera angles were also exceptional - when Dominika meekly walks to her first ""appointment"" at the hotel bar, you could feel her tension and nerves. The camera angles and the silence of just her heels on the marble floor. So many excellent scenes throughout the film that were expertly woven together.The trailer gives away nothing which is also a great thing!If you enjoy Jennifer Lawrence, if you are a history buff, fascinated with the current affairs of US-Russian relations, or if you just like a good action film with a wild ending, add this to your watch list.",Red Sparrow

472,junshiwilda,👎 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,2,6 August 2019,"Red sparrow is technically a spy action thriller film but that I say is not the genre of the movie. When I saw this on the airplane entertainment program I was expecting a entertaining enough female led action thriller film. But what I got was the polar opposite. Red sparrow was a confusing mess that was just frustrating and simply boring. I feel very obligated to save as much people from watching this trash. This perhaps will be the most boring movie I have ever seen.Though this movie is very bad I will start off with a couple of positives. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a relatively good performance in a very poorly written script. The looks of the film itself was actually pretty good from the music, the cinematography, the production design.But sadly this is where the positive ends. The movie itself is a jumbled mess that moves from one place to another. It just dumps a whole load of information you eventually cannot follow along and jump from plotline to plotline and perspective to perspective. Because it is so convoluted you eventually cannot follow through. 1/4 into the film I was simply not following along and didn't know what was going on at all. Beyond that this movie is just so boring. The movie does follow a investigation which I didn't understand because I lost the film 1/4 way through, but even if I did follow along this movie is just so slow paced. It didn't have any sense of tension or excitement and in general lacking action sequences for its genre. All this film has to offer is a couple of sexual violence and some sequences of torture. I felt very accomplished when I finished this long, boring, dull movie I was half sleeping while watching.Overall this is a movie that is going to be on my list of most boring films of all time. This was not the action spy thriller I watch to entertain myself but the equivalent to a sleeping supplement. There is really nothing to enjoy at all about this movie except for the production design and Jennifer Lawrence's performance.

473,matthew_hoh,A Cold War fever dream.,3,25 October 2019,"This movie is simply inane.Most of the actors playing Russians seem like they are auditioning for a live action version of Rocky and Bullwinkle, the actors playing the Americans could have been replaced with cardboard cut outs, and it seems like every exterior scene has a tram running in the background, I guess so we don't forget the film is taking place in Europe. For a big budget spy thriller there is little depth to the cast, production value is limited (this kind of film should be grand and lavish), and above all else the story line somehow both doesn't make sense AND is predictable. Think of the worst James Bond film you've ever watched, then take out whatever was redeeming and you get this movie.Sex has been undoubtedly been used by spies for as long as spies have existed and it's no doubt the Russians, and the Americans, use it to their advantage. However, rather than getting a thoughtful film that might explore all the many aspects of sex that would inculcate an espionage story you get a muddled mess of a plot, full of holes and insipid decision making. There's a bunch of gratuitous skin and sex scenes, to try and entertain the reptilian parts of our brains, but it's all rather tawdry, machinated and far from stimulating. Meanwhile the rape and torture scenes fail to elicit much guttural reaction, let alone empathy.If you want simple Cold War chauvinism and fear mongering or if you just want to see Jennifer Lawrence and a bunch of other actors nude, then you'll enjoy it. Otherwise re-watch the Americans.This is the first negative review I have written on IMDB.

479,debrecenisrac38,"In the eye of the beholder, quite literally",9,2 July 2018,"Hello all,Since there's nigh 600 reviews here already on this title, I'm trying to deliver one from the aspect of where it was partly shot and how it's obviously a movie.Way back when, there was this semi-authentic joke about easily discovering an American spy because they read the newspaper from the front. It's authentic in the sense that I too have learned to start reading from the back, and thus, any movie shot in Budapest and generally in Hungary I take with a grain of salt. I felt no compelling to open a goof tab on errors in geography when the characters quantum jump all across town, that being the only explanation how places really far away from each other just share a corner.Yet, there are other signs this is simply a movie. Yes, it's genuine that applying for a pool membership only happens in Hungarian, and Dominika is still Mystique because she knows what expression means what. Nice feat in a language that isn't even Indo-European. Even more amusing that the public transportation is never late, or, that the subway cars don't catch fire as they do in reality. Nate is also a magician or has found a cool way to rip off Uncle Sam without him batting an eye. I'm basing that on him ad hoc renting that very quiet, very downtown apartment by his lonesome. Such places in reality only go on a yearly basis and they are not cheap, not even by Western standards. I haven't read the source material so I'm unaware how much of it was used, but I do know that it was published 5 years ago, at which point Hungary's foreign affairs started to stray away from NATO and into courting Russia, so in real life it wouldn't be too smart for an American agent to operate under hostile conditions.I did enjoy it, and the one thing I do say to detractors is this: it's not inaccurate to portray Russia as a continuous system of exploitation and favors, voters do acknowledge this much by looking to the state for solving all their ailments. It's also accurate to state that there are many things that Russia censors from its citizens to ""keep societal order"".Having said that, this movie had showed me Lawrence's limitations. Either production wanted to save on preparation costs or she simply can't do it, but that accent was atrocious. I can buy a Russian operative not speaking the language publicly to keep a cover (Richard Sorge pulled that off for decades), my beef was a different scene, where she used an Americanism. When in control, actual Russian operatives would either use a transliteration of a Russian adage, or an internationally known one, not something from the enemy which they genuinely view as decadent weakness.",Red Sparrow

Sadly not. Wherever Jennifer went in the movie her fringe went with her. To the strip club, her fringe was there. To see her sleazy boss, her fringe was there. She went to the pool, guess what? Her fringe was there too! After 2h of nothing but fringe action I gave up. Perhaps in the last 3/4 of an hour she gets a haircut, I don't know, anything could happen.

484,am-39702,Sadly this movie was just not good,5,3 March 2018,"This movie had all the potential to be a great movie, but unfortunately it fell very short.The negatives:The plot was all over the place.There was no connection between some scenes, or a way for the audience to put the pieces together until the end, and when the end came which was about 30-40min too late no one cared. There was no tension. It was established from almost the very beginning that she was looking for a way out of her uncles clutches, so subsequently there was zero tension on ""is she on our side or isn't she"". Due to this the twist at the end fell flat. They should have kept her working for both sides till the very end, and not make it obvious that she had already chosen a side.Zero chemistry between Jennifer and Joel. It felt like they received different scripts and different directions on what their relationship was supposed to be. Joel was firstly just using her, and then he felt sorry for her, and then just acted like her big brother/protector. Jennifer on the other hand was attracted to him, fell for him. Very confusing to watch.Horrible acting. Both Jennifer and Joel acted like they did not want to be there. Very flat performances. Joel was a miscast. Matthias as uncle Vanya was by far the best part of the movie. Very complicated character and a great performance.Unnecessary sex scenes and nudity. The nudity added nothing to the movie, neither did the random sex scenes. Just added for shockvalue i guess.The positives:I was happily surprised that they did not make the main character some kind of fighting machine, like Salt and Atomic Blonde. The character felt real in the sense that there could've been women like her during the cold war.The idea and concept was good. The scenery was beautiful.",Red Sparrow
485,anibeli,"Don't listen to the bad reviews, they probably didn't understand it.",8,3 March 2018,"I decided to write a review because I'm seeing a lot of complains about the movie's content. The people who are complaining about too much sex, have never seen Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction, or even Fifty Shades, the sex scenes are very well done, and not just thrown into the movie to entertain you, they are part of the movie sequence and plot.Also, the gore. Excuse me, what gore? I have seen more blood on Japanese movies or the Saw franchise, the Kill Bill movies had 80% more violence and blood than this film. The movie is rated R for a reason, meaning it contains violence, sex, strong language and more. If you are not prepared for this, then don't go to see R rated movies! Simple as that. Red Sparrow reminds me of the Salt movie with Angelina Jolie, they are both Russian spies, and that's where the similarities end, because Red Sparrow is more about psychological intelligence than action or fighting. If you like spy movies, thrillers, smart plots and Jennifer Lawrence, go see this movie, and decide for yourself if you like it or not.",Red Sparrow
486,Bambikilled,Don't believe the hate - NOR the praise... It's decent enough if watched through objective eyes.,6,28 January 2019,"Wow. You seldom see quite this level of sandbox-war... throwing 1s and 10s at each other like brats playing cops 'n' robbers. (Not that kids today do such ancient things... But if they did, the Russians would be the robbers, for sure... )I seldom have the patience to review movies that already have tons of reviews, but I'm just so annoyed with the ridiculous rating war that I had to add a leveled one to the few existing...It's a mediocre, stereotypical Americans-vs.-Russians-flick, not great and not awful. Average stuff - but executed decently enough to make it a tad better than the usual 5/10 standard movie version of a tv-dinner.I expected to hate the flick. I read a bunch of the reviews and as usual didn't quite believe the positive ones since the negative ones were the verbally most eloquent ones. I sure didn't like it at first, but it mellowed out into a mild interest for finding out who killed General Mustard in the Dining Room. (No, that wasn't a spoiler, in case you've never been into classic boardgames) and in the end I felt that it was a decent enough watch for me to not want to throw the screen out of the window.
IF having an objective view. Which I can clearly see in many reviews that most - haters AND lovers - DON'T.I didn't particularly like it, but I didn't hate it either. Imdb'rs should grow up and stop dropping extreme ratings all over the place, it's so tiresome. There has been very few movies made that could deserve an actual 1/10. This is not one of them. And for the opposite end of the scale; the 10s should be reserved for movies that have a lot - a LOT - more than this one has. I do agree with most of the negative opinions, but not to the extent they seem to get enraged and personally offensed by this movie.I can't be bothered to write any passionate rants about pluses and minuses, so I'll keep it breaf.Acting;
Half a point for the haters. The acting is pretty bad. But not THAT bad. Acceptable. Lawrence just isn't an amazing character actor, and will never be, but she did a fair job with what she had to work with. (Except the accent. God, Hollywood... please... ditch the fake accents... EVERYONE hates them... If you won't do it in Russian, just have them speak English normally...)Plot;
Standard set menu meal, paint-by-numbers spy flick. No surprises. Except the hardcore school-that-teaches-their-students-how-to-use-their-bodies. (Imdb apparently doesn't allow me to write the most common word for a ""worker"" of that ""trade"". Seriously? Imdb? Really?)
Not hardcore as in especially graphic, but that ice cold training of humans to be walking, talking, spying sex tools. (Was that profane or offensive too, Imdb?)
Haven't really seen it portrayed quite that as-a-matter-of-factly before.
Some unpleasant scenes but they just weren't emotional enough to make me feel all that bothered by them. And that's a BAD thing when those scenes are about torture, rape and abuse in the name of schooling. Then they didn't get through.My biggest issue;
The usual one... ""Russians are evil, Americans are nice guys. Hooray."" Sigh... I'm neither Russian nor American. (Thank God...) Maybe that's why I'm actually allowed to take part of what's going on in the world on an objective basis rather than through patriotic, deceptive, polished, distorted (choose one or all) channels nor by having inherited societal xenophobic, ignorant preconceptions and biases towards whole countries, their people and their cultures.
You know what? There are no good guys nor bad guys. Both countries are currently governed by men that could probably get on paper that they actually suffer from psychopathy, who both have hubris that by far supercedes the original namesake's...
Absolute objectivity isn't necessary. But this kind of crucifixion vs. sainthood - is just ridiculous. Especially when it's so conceited as to blatantly serve it in weird pieces of dialogue or shove that awkward social critique towards Russia's persecution of LGBTQ people (which I'm a very harsh critic of) into one of those ""school""-classes, It just felt so contrived, no matter the importance (and truth) of the topic.I'm much more likely to rewatch some South Korean spy flicks than this one. They usually don't resort to pure propaganda wars in their spy movies.If you, as a watcher, have some brains and insight and can try to separate the annoying parts from the actual movie in itself, it can give you a couple of hours of not-very-intellectual entertainment. And you'll forget it as quickly.It's just one of those movies; ""Didn't completely blow but didn't quite get me hyped up either"".Mediocre, standard, run-of-the-mill. Just that it had a lot more propaganda.PS; Imdb, seriously? I get a warning for my text containing profanity/offensive words, for including the most common word for ""the working girl""? Are people not allowed to mention nor even pretend the ""trade"" actually exists...? Lol... What word would you prefer?
Or is it that I had a hypothesis about the mental status of two world leaders? Is that profanity? Perhaps offensive?

She first showed promise in the underrated Winters Bone but then for me went on a downward spiral (with the exception of fantastic Silver Linings Playbook) with the Hunger Games films. However since she made Joy in 2015, the only way has been up with her performances in Passengers, The barking mad Mother! and now Red Sparrow. She seriously deserves another oscar soon.This film is a no punches pulled thriller about seductive spys in Russia. Lawrences character is forced into recruiting to help save her sick mother and her first target is a US CIA agent, played by Joel Edgerton. Nothing is what it seems however, and as the 2 of them forge a relationship, they discover lots of secrets.

I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them, and it didn't really seem like must was at stake. Red Sparrow isn't the spy-thriller the trailers make it out to be and that's not an entirely bad thing. It's an almost painfully realistic spy movie. This isn't James Bond or Atomic Blonde, and most of the actual spying is portrayed as more political in nature.

513,Scott-344,Russian bots and apologists hate it -- Americans who know spy movies will enjoy,8,24 July 2018,"Spy movies in a le Carré vein can be judged on how well they handle issues of deceit and personal loyalty. ""Red Sparrow"" does a solid job of creating a plot that's complex, making us wonder who's deceiving whom, without being so jumbled it doesn't make sense. Solid performances, directing, and -- this I admire -- clear and impactful editing of fight scenes earn this a solid recommendation from me, an aficionado of spy movies. 4 stars out 5, 8 out of 10 for IMDB.The film is violent and sexy in the way ""Marathon Man"" was in the '70s, and while there's no villain here as memorable as Laurence Olivier's Nazi dentist Zel, there are some nice supporting characters. Performances are first rate. Accents didn't bother me one bit. This is an American film geared toward English-speaking audiences. It doesn't need to have dialogue in Russian, as one clueless reviewer suggested. (I think there was one line in Russian at the beginning) Gimmicks like the one used at the beginning of ""The Hunt for Red October"" -- Connery et al speaking Russian until the moment the camera pushes into Connery's mouth and then pulls back and the rest of the movie is in English -- are fine, but not necessary. We've been there and done that. It's good to just get going with the story with dialogue we can understand.I love non-realistic Bond movies for their action, humor, and production value, and I also love gritty spy films like ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" and ""Three Days of the Condor"" (even though Condor is a pure political statement -- unrelated to the actual world of CIA in any way). ""Red Sparrow"" falls somewhere in-between Bond and grittier '60s and '70s spy films. If you're a puritan who hates male and female nudity, then stick with Nickelodeon. And if you're a Russian kleptocrat's lackey who hates the way this film portrays the bankruptcy of modern Russia, then stick with... I don't know... ""Battleship Potemkim.""Reviewers who give ""Red Sparrow"" one-star either have an agenda unrelated to film reviewing on their minds, or they don't know what they're talking about.

(Predictably enough, all Russians in the book were universally bad, except for the spies, spying against Russia.)Even though I did not think it could possibly get any worse than the book, I will have to congratulate everyone involved in this production, as they have achieved the nearly impossible and made the movie even more stupid. All the issues with the book are, obviously, present in the movie, too - but they are amplified by fake accents, misleading visuals and totally stereotypical acting. Numerous scenes with partially or fully naked Jennifer Lawrence - which, as it looks like, were supposed to be the safety net - feel completely out-of-place and make it worse.What's the point of this movie besides very thinly veiled propaganda? Frankly, I find the movie (and the book) insulting to any reasonable intelligence.

The premise of the search for a mole within the Russian intelligence establishment is interesting to begin with, and as one gets deeper into the lives of the protagonists, the difficult choices they face, and the compromises they end up making, it's pure cinematic joy. Can't imagine how we ended up with a 6.6 rating here.Jennifer Lawrence really gets into the role of Dominika. We feel her pain, we cringe at her disgust, and her fear makes us scared too. If anything, it's worth watching the movie only for her, but no, we get more, much more, ably supported by Joel Edgerton, Jeremy Irons , Ciaran Hinds, Joely Richardson.

Uncle so-n-so is a Russian agent of some sort, and offers her help. Jennifer Lawrences character tries to refuse as Mr. Uncle comes off somewhat domineering, but Uncle tells her it'll be easy, just 1 day and I'll make sure your mother is taken care of, and you can keep your home. Secret mission? Get raped. After getting raped, teary eyed Jennifer Lawrence meets with uncle so-n-so who casually says, ""I needed to make sure you would be good for the State."" ""I was raped."" ""like I care."" ""You better be willing to spread your legs for Mother Russia some more, or else I cannot help you or your mother, I'm sorry.""""but I was rapped.""""OMG can you please just get over it.""Part Deuce: Sex camp. It turns out, in Russia apparently, only after you've been molested, raped, forced to commit sexual acts, raped some more, suck fat ones, muff dive, get molested, raped, molested.. only then can you be a spy. I forgot to mention, countless hours of being forced to watch torture porn, that is apparently Russian spy training 101. Once Jennifer Lawrence completes Violate-Every-Orifice camp, it's time for the torture. All kinds of human torture, very imaginative stuff, really. Some more rape and things too. Then end. The sex scenes, if you're the kind of person who'll watch a film just for those, they aren't any good either. If you'd like to live the gist of this movie for yourself, just get yourself captured and sold into the human trafficking sex trade. It'll be pretty much spot on, though you'll likely be in the warmer climate(even better!)If you've read this, you now have no reason at all to watch this film. I gave it 3 stars because, for as bad as it is - and it's reallly bad - I have seen some movies that were an even more egregious waste of human resources than this bomb.

While the trailers drew masses of ""Fast and Furious"" fans who wanted the same thing, plus steamy sex, they instead got a twisting storyline that requires ... oh, scandal! ... concentration!

The Red Sparrow is a beautiful, but, a soul crushing experience.One has to work hard in order to find ease or even a little bit of light in this story. It lures the spectator down on a path to the underworld, the one of the strong and the powerful, a world that is accessible only to a few, this few is shown to us by a considerate range o characters, leading to the inevitable conclusion that human nature is capable of being unique in every individual under the most impossible of circumstances even.It was close to a meditative experience, though a dark and scary one, the one you have when you finally decide to face your fears and accept that all is possible.The plot is gripping, anything one can expect when it comes to the level of power this movie depicts.Every good piece of art has to have something to do with romance, well, here I found a kind of ""in your face"", primal, raw and tempting kind of it.Not for the faint at heart that's for sure, however, good cinema is like good food, it's important the way one plates it up.

Lawrence plays a talented dancer, who by no choice of her own is forced into surrendering her life and body to the state and re-purposed as a spy trained in manipulation of important targets based their sexual desire.

Level of demonization of russian people in this movie is incredible. Subtle message of the movie is that russian people are so vile that it would be better for everyone if they wouldn't exist at all. Especially I liked the phrase that was said by character of Mary-Louise Parker that russian men are ugly as turds. Thank you, moviemakers, I hope you are proud of yourself. Try to say this about muslims nowadays and you'll have a press-tour of apologising for the whole year.While watching, I couldn't get any idea of why some of the best actors in the world took part in this non-sense? Jennifer Lawrence is all about feminism and women's rights, but she is in this movie just to have sex with some guys and show her naked body. Joel Edgerton is like playing nobody with no character at all. Jeremy Irons is playing stereotypical russian general grandpa with funny accent.Everything about this movie stinks with straight-to-VHS smell, but somehow it's a big Hollywood production instead.

Her acting was spot on, if a little bit flat. Cinematography was also good for the most part in terms of shot choices and similar. For me, good things end there. Whole movie we are being fed this idea of USA good, Russia bad. Everything on one side is bright and white, done for the people and out of sheer goodness of their hearts. On the other, bricks are painted black, lamps are red and girls are forced to have sex. There is absolutely no parts of this movie that are not either black or white. There is absolutely not a single character, on the Russian side that is good or even indifferent, save for the main character and her mom who is the driving force for this story. Everyone is evil and exploits everyone, from theater, dancers, nurses, government, police officers, bosses, roommates.In short, movie is a disgusting blind and one-sided attempt at making a spy movie with some love interest.Also I found it pretty ironic how director kept showing everyone being evil and wanted to exploit Jennifer's body, while at the same time exploiting Jennifer's body to make people interested in the movie.In my own opinion current grade of 6.6 suits it rather well.",Red Sparrow

Plus the final twist was, how best to put it, sexy.Some people and critics are bickering over things such as Lawrence's accent, the way she is trained, the sexuality, feminism, and so on. To me, these things seem trivial when I compare them to the rest of the movie. I haven't watched The Hunger Games series by the Lawrence-Lawrence duo (director-actor), nor do I intend to, but this movie in my opinion is very well worthy of its genre.

552,woralo,The good and the bad - In depth review,7,7 March 2018,"After last year's Atomic Blonde, I was thrilled for Red Sparrow. 
For me Atomic Blonde was one of the best Spy-Thrillers of the past years. It had a great ambience, good plotline, great actors and acting, but just a little bit too much action and it somewhat seemed like a smoking commercial. CinematographyI was hoping Red Sparrow would be able to catch the same cinematographic and ambient feeling as Atomic Blonde, but sadly it did not deliver on that part. For a movie set mostly in Eastern Europe the colors were too vivid. It did not give me the spy-thriller movie experience I was expecting. They should have gone with another director. CastJennifer Lawrence had a rough start in Red Sparrow, her acting in the first half of the movie reminded me of the Hunger Games, where the character had very little depth. I know she was supposed to play the emotionally stumped balerina girl, but it wasn't convinving enough. luckily she bounced back in the second half of the movie, where her performance was much better and where you really didn't know whether or not she was good, bad and on Russian or American side. Joel Edgerton's performance didn't stand out enough in this movie, he was just a character filled in by 'some' actor. That's how it felt. There was very little dynamic with Jennifer Lawrence and their chemistry seemed boring at least.Matthias Schoenaerts as Jennifer Lawrence's Uncle did a pretty good job, he was genuine and convincing. Nothing to add there.The movieThe movie started out feeling like an edgy teen flick, like the Hunger Games or worse. Especially when the protagonist was taken to the training facility seemingly full of teens where they had to undergo some sort of too typical training jampacked with clichés and onliners that were repeated during the movie for no apparent reason. These onliners actually made the movie more predictable, which of course is terrible for a spy movie. Gladly after her training the movie lost it's edgy teen feel and started to feel like a spy movie. At the point she met with Nate Nash the movie started to get interesting and this is where everything got a hell of a lot better. From this point on, you basicly didn't know what Dominika was up to and on which side she actually was. She played her role to perfection, but there were some issues I had with the story. For instance, why doesn't an elite spy girl have a weapon? She let's Nate get tortured for no good reason and eventually picks a terrible moment to attack her torturer. How is it possible for a Russian spy to enter a CIA safehouse without much trouble, while everyone seems to know everything about each other in this movie. And when in the end Vanya is betrayed, I would presume real intelligence agencies would instantly see that it was staged. 
But what bothers me most is the English with a (bad) Russian accent.
I mean come on, if you want to make a movie convincing, make it genuine!
This had me feeling like War Horse again, which was an epic movie, but when you make a movie where the French, Germans and everyone else in the world speaks English with an accent, it just loses every bit of genuinity.
TL:DR

Good acting after the first half hourPlottwistsJust enough unpredictabilityCon's

I would like to take a moment to speak about the book and its author, Jason Matthews. I try to find the source material for movies, and often I find the book to be as good as the movie.However, Matthews' writing, his word craft, far exceeds the movie. The plot of the film (adapted for the screenplay) occupies about a fifth of the book. There is so much more: Matthews spent thirty-three years in the CIA and it shows in every paragraph. His career as a ""Spook"" gives him an authenticity that I've rarely witnessed. This book is a very rewarding read, on a par with La Carre.Let me put it this way: I normally read three and four books at a time, switching back and forth, enjoying the different plots.

At one point Jennifer Lawerence's character says ""You sent me to whore school"" and that pretty much sums up the movie. Ughhh... it was painful.

560,cameronsfx,"Exploitative, Sleazy, Extreme Violence Against Women, Anti-Feministic",1,1 March 2018,"Possible SpoliersJennifer Lawrence is Dominika, a prima ballerina, who is coerced by her spy Uncle to become a spy and use her feminine wiles to spy, which is shown in graphic detail. Even the description promises graphic nudity. But, anti-feministic as it is, it is also features graphic violence against woman in the spy agency's ""whore"" school, including against Lawrence's Dominka. In fact, the sexual violence against women in this film might even make Game of Thrones fans blush. Yeah, it is that sadistic and cruel. The movie reminds me of something you'd see on late at night on pay-per-view of the skin channels. Most of the film, past ""whore school"" for Russian spies of the female variety, is Lawrence in skimpy costumes showing off everything to seduce her targets. So, if you are into seeing Jennifer prance around half-naked for most of the film, hey, I guess that is the selling point of the movie. Has feminism really become, I'm nude, look at me, while selling female empowerment? It's also not something like last year's spy noir Atomic Blonde, either.Also, since they are supposed to be Russian, you think they would offer decent Russian accents. Most don't and Lawrence, being from Kentucky, certainly doesn't pull off the Russian accent. And, why Charlotte Rampling is even in this thing, except to fill time, is beyond me. She doesn't do much.The overall plot really isn't in attendance. Yeah, I'm sure the Soviets had female spies do this sort of thing, but do we really need to see women beaten if they don't drop their clothes and have sex with whomever to gather information? And, the film is supposed to be circa 1968 and feels more like something of today. The basic plot is Dominika is doing all this to uncover a mole in the Russian spy agency. There are twist and turns, but not much of it to justify 138 mins of run time. They should've cut out the beatings of women, but I guess we wouldn't have gotten to see a lot of women naked had they done so. Yes, Bond girls are sexy, but in a fun way. There is no beatings if they don't conform. The movie is more like something Eli Roth would deliver. You know his films where torture is done to the extreme that it depraves the mind of the viewer.Jennifer's lackluster performance isn't helpful either. Her accent of a Russian is atrocious. The rest sound British. Nevertheless, this is another bad movie from Jennifer like Passengers (innate boredom all around) and the really far out there Mother! that bombed at the box office. Do yourself a favor and pass on this skin flick and watch the Hunger Games 1 and 2 or Silver Linings Playbook. Far better movies for when Jennifer actually knew how to act and the movies actually had a coherent plot. Otherwise, you're really just going to see this film to see women brutalized and naked. Something I thought feminist were totally against. Under 18 should definitely not be going to this film.",Red Sparrow

My respect for Jennifer Lawerence as an actress inclined after watching her perform and commit to this movie. She puts out a very convincing Russian accent, and is willing to go the extra mile in terms of nudity. She's able to bolden her character in a web of other well written characters played by other big stars, with the exception being her mother who I failed to empathize with. The movie shuffles through clever twists that engage you into the story, compelling you with anticipation as to which side Dominika will fall on. You're suspicions of her swing like a pendulum, being pushed by the cold violence that drops in every once and a while. Dominika and Nate are the spine relationship of the story, and while I bought into it, I didn't buy into how far their relationship went. It seemed to move ahead of itself. I expected the training Dominika was put through and her actual fighting skills to be more advanced as they implied. Her uncle tells her that the training would be hard, but all we see her and the trainees do is jog and learn the arts of sexual deception. The movie implies that Sparrows are very dangerous people physically as well as psychologically, but only psychologically seemed to be the case. Overall, I think that Red Sparrow is a well put together movie that switches and deceives your expectations constantly, but at times can feel slightly slow but yet a little rushed at the same time. So I give it a 7.9",Red Sparrow

There are certain scenes and particularly the openingthat feel so enthralling and a lot of it has to do with his score.
Red Sparrow is frustarating film. I would say that I liked half of it and the other half I had a difficult time grasping.

Sparrows are real Russian operatives and trained to use their wiles just as Dominika does in the film. As has been proven over the many decades, female Russian spies are first taught the art of seduction. It is how they rise within the ranks as well.
Jennifer Lawrence excels as lead actress. Hopefully she will also appear in the next 2 films. All the casting was great. I can see that many Russian bots are trying to pull the ratings down with ridiculous claims. Don't let them deter you, check Red Sparrow out for yourself. I believe you will give it the minimum review of 8 out of 10 and watch it at least twice, yes it is that Good!",Red Sparrow

I've read a couple of reviews saying that the acting is bland and there's no chemistry between the main protagonists. J.Law's poker face acting is close to perfect to be honest .

One can't come from being a ballerina since childhood then switch to assassin within the next few years. I know Hollywood wants to empower women, but this is B.S.

593,douglasellice,Awful mess of a screenplay visually stunning,3,7 June 2018,"I see what the viewers who liked the film liked, and I see what the viewers who hated the film hated. It is a mess. 
Movies based on books are watched by two very different audiences - those who know the book and those who don't. I read and enjoyed the three Jason Matthews books. I adored the first one, loved the second one, and liked the third one. But this puts me in the group that sees everything in the movie as either from the book, or from left field. I also ""see"" everything that was in the book but WASN'T in the film,Casting - I'm so used to ""Hollywood"" using an international talent pool that I've run out of outrage when Englishmen play Russians and Australians play Americans. I'm over it.Language - (see Casting, above). Guess what? None of the accents are ever correct. And all the Russians speak English. Get over it.Plot - the carefully-constructed plots of at least 2 of the 3 books were put into a Blender and pureed together. The screenplay literally makes no sense. This will surely inflame all the book lovers, and some of the rest of the audience. Some deviations from the book are unimportant. Early in the book, Nate Nash transfers from the US Embassy in Moscow to the one in Helsinki. In the movie, he's brought back to Washington instead. That really doesn't make much difference to anything. On the other hand, the book makes clear that Dominika has had martial arts and espionage training in addition to ""whore school"". Leaving that out of the movie makes it unbelievable that she can kick so much butt.These are supposedly two highly-trained case officers trying to recruit agents (spies). She's looking for Nate, but he just stumbles on her. All the book's careful description of their attempts to suborn the other are left out, so here they just tell each other that they are intelligence operatives. On what planet would that happen? None of the Russian SVR Headquarters ""office politics"" make it into the movie, so it is puzzling that some of Egorova's colleagues are working against her. None of her inner feelings about her sexuality are explained, so her love scenes make no sense. None of her empathic powers are mentioned, so her intuitions make no sense. I could go on. To sum up: if you read the book, don't go to the movie - you'll hate it.
If you didn't read the book, and if you normally pay little attention to screenplays, dialogues, character development and plotlines, go for it. ,",Red Sparrow

Unbelievable action motivated by unreal situations due to #3.5. Over the top violence/sex/torture for no reason within this world.6. And, when the headmaster says she'll put a bullet in anyone's head who doesn't belong, there's no follow through when the students don't listen or behave.7. Yet, Lawrence's character manages to survive the very worst of Russian secret service torture?! How do these limp Sparrow agents manage to become bars of steel then??8. Languid pacing, poor editing, almost like watching a souffle fail under the hands of an inexperienced cook. Long stretches of Yawn, pierced by over-the-top sex/torture/violence that has nothing to do with the world this story is in - only there to wake you up again. 9. Torturous passages of exposition, repeating idiot phrases over and over and over. Okay, maybe a 2-year old will need this, but totally unnecessary for a movie like this.10.

609,fox_ronan,"A flawed, yet compelling international spy thriller",7,20 March 2018,"As a society, I think it's fair to say that we are captivated by espionage and infiltration. The vast array of spy thrillers produced for mainstream consumption, across various mediums, indicates our intoxication with this clandestine way of life. Red Sparrow aims to appeal to this fascination, by exploring a dark world showered in a web of political mystery. Red Sparrow is an adaption of former CIA operative Jason Matthew's critically acclaimed novel. I can't say I'm particularly familiar with the novel, therefore I cannot testify to the faithfulness of its adaptation. But from what I have gleaned from my research is that the film tries to capture the essence of the novel by cutting out the more mundane aspects of intelligence work. Justin Haythe's screenplay elects to focus on the stories of Dominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) and Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton). Dominika is a famous prima ballerina who performs for Russia's elite; after experiencing a career ending injury she is approached by her uncle Vanya Ergov, who is a significant player in Russian intelligence (Matthias Schoenaerts). Vanya tasks Dominika with a political mission involving a disloyal Russian politician, promising that the state will continue to support her mother's medical care in exchange. The result of this mission leads to Dominika enrolling in a state subsided intelligence program which produces 'Sparrows'. Sparrows are weapons of the Russian government who are trained to use psychological methods of manipulation in service of the state. Dominika is then sucked into a world of mystery where international powers play complex political games, games defined by moles and shifting allegiances. It must be said; the most praiseworthy aspect of this film is its central performances. Jennifer Lawrence yet again has taken on another bold and challenging role. Regardless of one's personal opinions of her, it cannot be denied that she is an exceptionally talented actress. Every time she is on screen she is absolutely mesmerising, whether that be in the quieter moments of political intrigue or during the intense, emotionally disturbing scenes. Joel Edgerton also excels as the CIA operative entrusted with protecting a mole within Russian intelligence. It still surprises me that Joel Edgerton is yet to breach the upper echelons of Hollywood, as the man has been delivering compelling performances for years, my favourite being his role in 2011's Warrior. Jeremy Irons is also engaging whenever he is onscreen, but then again when is he not. After all he did the impossible in the drab DC cinematic universe by bringing a modicum of charm and energy to proceedings. Despite Jeremy Iron's vast talents as an actor, I think it's fair to say he doesn't exactly excel with his Russian accent. Yet in fairness to Mr Irons, I think that's a problem that permeates throughout the whole cast. I might not be a linguistic expert, but even I (a layperson), could detect that the accents were fairly off at times. I understand that Francis Lawrence was probably striving for authenticity with his direction, but the inconsistent accents pull you straight out of this gritty world that he has lovingly created. Perhaps Francis Lawrence should have taken a page out of Armando Lanucci's 'The Death of Stalin', which despite it's Russian setting, had its actors perform in their natural accents. Another commendable aspect of this film is its overall narrative arc. Justin Haythe's screenplay is intelligent, as it aptly handles the most important parts of its story, mainly it's two central mysteries. Mysteries which are made even more absorbing due to Lawrence's layered performance. The narrative takes plenty of unexpected twists throughout, successfully subverting audience expectations throughout its runtime. Especially at the end of the film, where the final revelation brings together various narrative seeds planted in the film's earlier acts. All of this leads to a story which feels complete, which is impressive considering its vast scope. The ending is also satisfying, and leaves room open for a legitimate sequel. Whether a sequel comes to pass is currently up in the air, as the film (at the time of writing) has only recouped $106,198,534 of its $69 million production budget. Regardless, I personally would be very interested in further exploring this sordid world. It's also worth noting that this film has received extensive critical feedback, most of which is directed towards its portrayal of explicit content. The film certainly doesn't shy aware from depicting intense violence, torture and abhorrent sexual behaviour. However, in defence of the film, at no point did I feel that the film revelled in the immorality of its characters actions. Nor did I find it to be gratuitous, such explicit scenes were only included as they were essential in the advancement of the plot. However, I completely understand why some people would take issue with such graphic depictions. If you do find such content disturbing, I would advise against watching Red Sparrow. Nevertheless, I would argue that the real problems in the film comes from its hollow characterisation. The characters in the film are certainly serviceable, but at no point does the film really provide any definitive reasons as to why we should truly care for Dominika or Nate. Except perhaps Dominika's need to care for her ailing mother, yet even this dimension of her character is hardly explored. Another issue with the film I have is the romance between Dominika and Nate, it feels contrived and despite strong individual performances, I would even argue that Lawrence and Edgerton have little onscreen chemistry. If more time had been devoted to developing backstory and the character's relationships, the dramatic climax of the third act would have carried far greater weight. Yet I understand this would have been a difficult addition, as the film already has a 140 min run time. Despite complaints about length from critics, I personally wouldn't have minded an additional 25 mins of screen time, if that time was invested in deeper character development. Despite these criticisms, Red Sparrow is a riveting spy thriller with an intrepid performance from Jennifer Lawrence. It certainly isn't a game changer by any stretch of the imagination, I highly doubt it will be remembered as a 'cinematic masterpiece' in the years to come, but it's a welcome change of pace from the cookie cutter thrillers of the past few years. It's creative, challenging, and it gives me hope that studios will continue to deliver unconventional and challenging genre stories.",Red Sparrow
610,reckittspawn,how does this movie have a 6.8 star rating?,1,11 April 2018,"I think this may be the worst movie I ever seen in my life. It is 2 hour and 20 minutes of zero plot, fake Russian accent, scenes that don't flow from the next to the other, and continuous brutal murder and rape scenes that happen and then you never hear of them again.
Such as, at the beginning Dominika goes and kills them 2 ballerinas who are going at it in the change room and you never hear of it again.
Ivan/Vanya's friend rapes Dominika and you never hear of it again.
Dominika goes to ""WhoreSchool"" to learn to get raped better, and then you never hear of it again.
I felt like I was watching some sick deranged man's sexual fantasy(and I'm not convinced that isn't what I watched).
Honestly, I think rape and murder are okay in movies if they add to the plot. Such as a crime thriller about catching a rapist. Or a movie about a horrible person the rape scene is to show what a bad person he is.
But this movie had less story than pornography.
The best part of the movie was when they showed some guy's junk. And he wasn't even attractive.But in all honesty, if you wanna go watch a rape film that managed to get a big-name actor to star in it, watch the 2014 movie Knock Knock.

This whole Russia bad the West good just doesn't wash any more and the whole film felt a bit like a rushed attempt to squeeze out a propaganda piece in time for the Russian elections to remind everyone that Russia is still the enemy.

Not for everyone, and not a great work of art; but very well crafted and enjoyable, imho.'Red Sparrow' (2018) is a psychosexual spy thriller about a Soviet school that trained young men and women in techniques of seduction to establish relationships with foreign men (and women) with money or power, for obtaining information and possibly blackmail material. It ostensibly takes place in the current, non-Soviet era, but the school itself is thought to have operated during the height of the cold war. Its current status, if any, is unknown.Naturally, the Soviets hate the film. They apparently flooded social media with bots attacking it to undermine its reputation, with some apparent success. Who knows? But 2018 was when the bromance between Trump and Putin was topical, and the film was not received well in official Washington either.The film has a few shocking scenes with some violence, killing, torture, and worst of all, some limited sex, nudity, and bad language.So what's to like, you ask? This is a complex and intricate plot with elements that come into play with the regularity of a metronome, and paced similarly. There is scarcely a wasted action or insinuation, and in the end it fits together like a Swiss watch. It's not deep, but it is brilliant.",Red Sparrow

These excuses make NO sense to me, if you read the description of the film you know it will be extremely violent, J Lawrence's acting in this was superb, and unless you are Russian or have studied it extensively then shut up about the accent.
This film has LOADS of twists and turns that don't make sense until later on, which is great for a spy thriller (I mean isn't that the point?), I hate how so many films these days seem to think that the audience is stupid and need to be force fed every action and thought, show don't tell, isn't that the point of going to see a film instead of reading a book?",Red Sparrow

It was pure torture. Not gonna lie, the film made me hate Jennifer Lawrence. Her character was with one facial expression for all situations and her acting didn't make the audience feel any sympathy.The Script was not only poor and boring but also cheesy and predictable. The characters were mostly cringe and stereotypes and didn't develop throughout the film except for Dominika Egerova. This inevitable plotline was labored along by the director's attempts to mask it with desultory twists but it turned out twaddle.In a nutshell, It's a spy cartoon sideshow that is inarguably cheesy and pointless, with occasionally entertaining moments.",Red Sparrow

The one good thing they left out of this movie was the irritating, recipes at the end of every chapter. It was like a Food Network sponsored thriller. 
This should have been a two or three part mini-series in order to capture the depth of these characters and the intricacies of the story. Without including spoilers, it is important to note that there many aspects of the book that have been changed or left out that are significant enough to make this some sort of an alternate universe version of the book instead of something edited for running time in a theatrical film. I know the written story, and still had some trouble understanding what the film was trying to establish. For someone who has no idea about the book, I would imagine this would look like a hastily edited, hash of a movie with no real connection between the characters or richness to the intrigue, which is exactly what it is. The standard violence, nudity and language are about on par with the book, with a slight edge to the book on excessive graphic language and in depth descriptions of sex and violence. 
I didn't hate it, but knowing what it didn't do and how it might have been better presented made it a 5/10 for me... and that's including one point for not putting those damn recipes in the film.",Red Sparrow

Expected a typical, off the rack spy movie with predictable twists and turns, too much violence, car chases and gratuitous nudity. For the most part, Red Sparrow rises above all that.There are several flaws in the story that broke my concentration. I will not spoil it for you, but some scenes are grossly unbelievable when the previous scene is considered. Another issue I have is whether there is some pandering to anti-Eastern Europe bigotry that Americans are too quick to ignore. This movie is reminiscent of the Cold War era depiction of Russia, Eastern Europe and the struggle America had with dealing with them. The plot was too simple in that regard, almost lazy. I would have preferred for that philosophical rivalry to have been better explored/explained to really make this movie stand out from the rest.",Red Sparrow

If you liked this movie, you are just admitting that you enjoy watching women get needlessly sexually degraded and raped for two hours. There's nothing redeeming about this film, it is simultaneously horrifying AND monotonous. It has also set women's liberation back about 50 years.

It's another sterling performance, and it's a spy thriller that I for one definitely did not figure out as it went along. (In fact, I'm glad I was recently able to rewatch it through Fandango, because having seen the final twist, I wanted to go back over the film to see the events again, knowing the final story in advance).JLaw is utterly convincing as an innocent swept into a cruel profession she would never have chosen. Her character undergoes a transformation before our eyes. Lawrence successfully conveys her character's initial terror and near-helplessness changing into competency and iron resolution.The violence can be brutal (if you're not into that kind of thing). The sex and nudity is really minimal, although it is there.I'm really glad I saw this film twice. I'd see it again. I recommend it.",Red Sparrow

651,krapfhomes,"Not What I Expected, In the Best Possible Way",9,15 November 2018,"I waited for this to be on HBO so I could DVR it and not have to pay for it. The essence of the plot seemed like a hatchet job on the Black Widow's backstory from the Marvel universe, so I wasn't exactly in any hurry to see it. I probably should have known better. Sure, there's the whole special school for Russian, previously Soviet, spies, but that's actually historically accurate. That's pretty much where the similarities end. This tale is a lot more John LeCarre than Ian Flemming, and not at all, God rest, San Lee. It was actually a very refreshing take on the spy genre, from a female perspective. In most other films where people train to be spies there are sequences where they are learning proficiency with weapons, hand to hand combat, and high speed driving. Here we get a shot of some students in the distance at a firing range, and that's it. Why? Simple, its assumed these people are taught to be proficient with guns, knives, etc. There's no need to keep pounding that one home with a montage. In fact, what you actually see is that if a spy draws and uses his weapon it means something's gone horribly wrong and he's likely going to be disciplined as a result. A lot more realistic than James Bond in three different running shoot outs in public. The time in the school is more spent on what it means to be an object and how to turn that to your advantage. She picks up some tradecraft too, that foreshadows parts of the ending. Certainly there's a statement about the way women are viewed and treated in Russian society, as well as a pervasive feeling that there might no longer be an iron curtain, but the old Soviet way of doing things didn't just go away because that curtain fell. It has a masterfully crafted ending that is not really what one expects, especially if you're more accustomed to typical American films of this genre. I'm not going to spoil it, but true to her training she's become a master manipulator and the damsel has swum with and ends up eating the sharks.Its definitely a more realistic take on intelligence officers. Its dark and ugly at times. So why no 10 stars? Well, its minor, but there's a scene in it that involves nudity, which was not merely gratuitous; it was pivotal for character development. It seemed like a lot was done with camera angles, blocking,etc. to avoid her being stark naked. I suppose there's various ways to look at it. Arguments could be made that it wasn't about her, but about her becoming part of something larger than herself, but I find such an explanation at odds with the film's conclusion. In the end it just seemed that they tried to limit the skin time on screen, and I get it on a personal level, but it seemed like she was holding back, and an actor of her caliber should have just gone for it. The film had already earned its R rating, and a little more nudity wasn't going to push it into an NC17 (and if it was there were other scenes that could have been cut to get back to an R without negatively impacting the main character's believability).Otherwise it was a really good film, and well worth the watch. Be sure to pay attention because there's a decent amount of foreshadowing, but not a lot of the typical American cinema hand holding about it.",Red Sparrow

However, is it REALLY the traditional spy games or are there times when those straight lines wind and get blurred? You're left guessing as everything unfolds- drawn in to figure it out for yourself. History and some recent events show us this post Cold War practice is still utilized. Russian female agents have been trained to use their sexuality and intellect as Swallows, also referred to here as Sparrows. Not a Spoiler as IMDB includes this description on the page.The training the main character Dominika receives is a dual exploration into the psychology of Russia's mechanisms to infiltrate U. S. intelligence and other countries. Is she a victim or willing participant: a true Russian Patriot: and what drives her to continue in this capacity for Mother Russia? Trainees are mentally molded through a number of reprehensible activities. Does Dominika survive and employ her new powerful role without mental consequences?All players are fashioned into believable integral roles. No performance is written in without purpose. They are seamless and you find them either villainous or in some cases actually endearing.Red Sparrow is worth the watching yet do so without reading the Synopsis, Trivia, or Goof sections first.

The real life spy world is all about psychological manipulation, mind games, double crosses and staying one step ahead. This movie does exactly that. Jenifer Lawrence is awesome in her role, her character's journey from the innocent ballerina to the manipulating sparrow is a treat to watch. Action sequence are too few and they add to the realism of the movie. The cons are usual for the movies of these genre. They depict Russia as land of primitive savages who are always scheming and immoral. Well its Hollywood and CIA's propaganda so once you know it you can discard it. 
Other problem is Russian characters don't speak Russian they speak English with Russian accent. Well American audiences are too lazy to read subtitles.Overall excellent cinema, realistic depiction of world of espionage , bad political narrative. I loved it. If you like slow burning psychological thrillers than go for it.",Red Sparrow

678,alvinvigil-574-884399,Not An Easy Movie To Watch,7,2 March 2018,"Anyone who saw Jennifer Lawrence in Darren Aronofsky's mind-trip horror spectacle, mother! which was a two-hour psychological rollercoaster ride, would agree that it may have been Lawrence's riskiest and bravest performance... until now. In the new thriller, Red Sparrow, Lawrence stars as Dominika Egorova, a Russian girl whose entire life revolves around being a prima ballerina for the Bolshoi Ballet and taking care of her very ill mother (Joely Richardson). When Dominika suffers a career-ending injury (an injury that will make you flinch and cringe into your seat), it quickly becomes apparent that it is also the end of the ballet-sponsored housing and medical care that her mother desperately needs. In steps her slimy, but dashingly handsome, uncle Vanya (an excellent Matthias Schoenaerts), who pulls her into a world of sex, seduction, murder and espionage. But not before enduring a grueling and brutal military-like training at Sparrow School, a sadistic program for new, young recruits being molded to become Russian spies. Charlotte Rampling who plays Matron, the head mistress, is a veteran spy who teaches the new recruits how to lose their inhibitions and to pry the weakness out of their enemies, all for the sake of their country. She trains them to be as cold and conniving as she is with the power of seduction and manipulation. This is where Lawrence shows her vulnerability, in a career-high performance. In no time does Dominika starts using sex as a weapon. Whether it's with a colleague, an enemy, or a repugnant boss. She does what's needed to get the job done. No one said it was going to be glamorous. This has got to be Lawrence's most challenging role yet. Already, having earned four Academy Award nominations with one win (for Silver Linings Playbook), Lawrence is one of our best actresses working today. Not bad for someone who dropped out of school after eighth grade, which she recently revealed on 60 Minutes. Red Sparrow isn't an easy movie to watch. As a matter of fact, it's quite disturbing. There are torture scenes which are cringe inducing, rape scenes that look way too real and a fight scene between Dominika and two men which is one of the most brutal and gruesome fight scenes I've ever had the displeasure of seeing. Lawrence does bare all, but that seems tame considering the subject matter. Joel Edgerton plays the American CIA agent who falls in love with her. He's good, even with an American accent. Lawrence is fun to watch, too, Russian accent and all, especially when she utters lines like, ""You sent me to whore school"" to her uncle. But man, is Red Sparrow violent and graphic, and yet, offers no apologies for it. Many will find the film too much to handle. And rightfully so. Still, it's a great thriller that will leave you breathless till the very end.",Red Sparrow

683,zerkoto,Absolute masterpiece 10/10,10,5 March 2018,"To start with, pay no mind to the people who reviewed this title with low rating. I don't want to become too salty over this topic, but nowadays people are watching too much movies without a deeper meaning or thought and that's why their brains shrinked and can't get the full meaning and idea of Red Sparrow. I was literally laughing while reading through these reviews and couldn't resist but to write a true review, showing the opinion of someone who understood the plot and consept of this movie.Now on-topic - Red Sparrow is an absolute masterpiece. Every single step, every single move and action here comes from a deeply engineered plot which is revealed only at the last few minutes of the film. Literally, throughout the whole film, you can't surely tell which side Jennifer Lawrence is playing for. Its design is one of the best in the political drama genre. The thriller part is also very well inscribed throught all the bloody scenes and breath-stopping moments. The ending of the film comes completely unexpected. This is one of those films, which will stay for a long time in your head because it is a lot more than simple CGI effects.The film-effects are beyong what i have expected! Jennifer Lawrence did absolutely great in her acting! She proved to be a high quality actress who is not afraid of showing her body and did it with confidence which is hard to describe. I am glad that we are living in times where the real and shocking truth is not hidden and can be exposed using a lot of modren filming technology. Unlike 50 shades and some other lame productions (porn), here nudity is something which contributes to the film's atmosphere and is used not like a senseless sexual element.I deeply recommend watching this title if you are a person who uses his brain as well his eyes. The only negative thing that i could say is that, this film might leave you with a little unrealistic image for Russia. It's portraying probably the worst time period for that great country and a lot has changed ever since then. Always keep in mind that it's showing the period of the fall for the Soviet Union and not modren-days Russia!",Red Sparrow

688,kedove-225-231998,Waste of Time,2,26 July 2019,"This may be one of the first reviews I've ever written, but I feel an obligation to the general public to issue a warning: This movie is awful. The premise behind the movie sounds exciting; A beautiful ballerina has a career ending injury, but she still has a mother to take care of...what will she do? Enter evil pervy uncle who forces her to become a ""sparrow"" aka a spy wh*re for her country. She is not happy with this situation, and takes every occasion possible to disobey orders. Somehow all this disobedience endears her to the higher-ups and they send her on a mission to spy on an American CIA agent. This leads her to teaming up with the Americans.It sounds downright exciting. Except, this movie was somehow able to take this exciting story and turn it into garbage. It wasn't convincing at all. The acting was unenthusiastic and unbelievable, I didn't feel any sort of emotional attachment to any of the characters (except Joel Edgerton, he was fabulous). I generally like Jennifer Lawrence, but she was unable to make me care about the plight of her character. You know, I don't think I saw her smile even once throughout the movie. Her romantic relationship with Joel's character doesn't make sense. They are barely friends until she wakes up in the middle of the night...and have a pretty terrible rendezvous...even though he kinda says no and seems reluctant. Their encounter didn't even look very fun or exciting. It was weird and awkward....I actually fast-forward that scene because it felt embarrassing. I didn't find her character particularly interesting or clever or talented. That is a sad thing for me to say because I love spy movies. This one was just so bad.... All in all it was a terrible and terribly boring movie. Not even the ""suspenseful"" and ""action packed"" parts were either of those things. It was just bad.",Red Sparrow

Just reinforces the fact that not only can she not act, she picks scripts that she THINKS will make her more money since that seems to be what she bitches about in ""Hollywood equality"". I kept telling my husband it wasn't going to get any better and it didn't. Jennifer Lawrence is fussing because she's not PAID the same as a man? Her acting shows me WHY SHE DOESN'T DESERVE it. Her political views are running her career, she should focus on getting a good role, not just relying on her Hunger Games heroine to get ahead in her career.

Great acting by Jennifer Lawrence, solid performance by Joel Edgerton and the rest of the supporting cast. Some great twists in this movie as well.

Russian life is shown in typical Cold War villian cliches with KGB elites living in palatial splendor, watching ballet, while the proletariat must prostitute themselves to enjoy a lower middle class life style.The center where Dominika goes to train is so sexually sadistic, it's a wonder the female recruits don't all become turncoats. The nudity was a surprise. Jennifer Lawrence shows butt, breasts and comes very close to showing her cookie. In a mediocre film though, it seems more sad than erotic--made me think of Meg Ryan In the Cut. Two thirds of the way through, I knew where Red Sparrow was going; and yet the Nash character remains oblivious up to the very end. A smart film this is not. It's also ridiculous how JLaw gets brutally beaten but is able to successfully disguise it with makeup. And when Nash hugs her, she feels no pain in her battered ribs.

721,jdavies-41440,Action packed spy movie that does a lot right,7,4 November 2021,"Red Sparrow is a cold war spy drama, based on a novel which I wasn't aware of until after watching. The storyline hooked me and I was anticipating the ending however the ending itself I found was a little disappointing, couldn't quite work out if the 'twist' at the end was overly complicated or too predictable but it left me somewhat underwhelmed.The scenery is fantastic throughout the film and there are a great number of genuinely tense action moments which are gritty but for me were really entertaining, I think these are 2 of the best things the film offers. The story builds up very well too and I was really looking forward to an ending which didn't quite deliver.Schoenearts delivered in his role as the devilish Uncle recruiting his niece for the state. Lawrence did just fine in her role in my view, she was plotting her and her mothers survival after her ballet career was ended abruptly, there were some similar traits with her hunger games role but I thought it was played appropriately (after getting over her Russian accent). A highlight for me was her talking to her uncle after being interrogated by the state. Not sure Lawrence and Edgerton had the greatest of chemistry and there was one sex scene that I thought was incredibly flat. Also the hitman named Matorin was in most of my favourite scenes and was a terrifying presence in the few moments he appeared, definitely deserves a mention.To summarise there is a lot of good in this movie and for me it's a very interesting storyline for the most part. There are a number of action scenes to keep you entertained and even at well over 2 hours I felt the movie was paced fine. I wouldn't say the acting in this movie was outstanding but the movie is about spies who are expected to stay cool under pressure so for me it's no issue.

The film is a poor reflection of the book so if you haven't read the book, I urge you read it before watching the movie - or buy the book and see just how much is missing in the film!The trailer for this movie is flash bang wallop sex and violence. The film is better than that, just.For me, disappointment with the film revolves around the lack of depth to the romance between the Sparrow and the American agent. In the book there is tenderness within the relationship, challenged by the undercover motives driving the story. For me this was missing. A quick bonk does not equate to a heartfelt longing sufficient to put your life and undercover operation at risk - well not in my experience anyway! Also missing is the relevance of the search for the Russian mole and the American agent's desire to safeguard his identity. Both are pivotal to the ongoing story.There is too much torturing, after all, this film is rated 15 (though these days fifteen year olds can probably handle it!) I saw the film in the cinema and I heard someone in the audience say 'I don't think I can take much more of this.' However, there is one standout scene where our heroine and the American agent are in confrontation with the assassin and in this instance, the violence is justified and balances the torture quite nicely!For those who have read the book, the end of the film differs from the book in a rather odd way but I will say no more. Also, for readers of the book, missing from the film is Dominika's ability to see auras and read the mood and sincerity of people she encounters.Unfortunately Jennifer Lawrence is not my idea of the sparrow and as someone has pointed out, she goes through the entire film with only one expression.Would I recommend it? Yes and no! I found the book to be one of the best spy novels but I don't think this film lives up to it. However, as a bit of gratuitous knockabout nonsense, it's ok. Read the book!As a complete aside from Red Sparrow, Joel Edgerton, who plays the American agent, would make an excellent 'Jack Reacher', much better than diminutive Tom Cruise.",Red Sparrow

This movie is base by novel written bi hi rank ex-officer of the CIA, so this means that al the facts of this movie are real but but the real names of the craters and real time of the event happening in this movie are being hidden by the story teller , wich makes this movie very interesting if you are in to spy movies like Tinker, Taillor, Soldier, Spy or Bridge of Spys is not like the typical spy movie like James Bond movies this movie has . amore modern look and film making and spy movies like Atomic Blonde, This movie is about the typical spy them about the double agent/ mole, which it tries to explain how Russian female agents- spys are trained in the psychological part of seduction to establish assets, it is still very good story told and film and the picture is more then awesome, and Lawrence acting as the Russian spy is superb, in order to be a spy, a good one, you have to be the perfect lier and Lawrence dose it, in resume I really recommend this movie .

This movie starts off nicely, has some great scenes ie. the ballet incident. But once that scene happens it just goes downhill from there. Total plot loss. Ridiculously overt sexual scenes that become stupid and monotonous blah blah blah. When will actors do something original to enhance their careers, like find a challenging script?? Thats the sign of a great actor. Sorry JLaw it was so desperate and try hard.

739,ciscopike,A Balanced Review,7,11 May 2018,"Greetings from Oz,
I'm not a big reviewer here but perhaps that may change.
The reviews of late have developed quite a schizophrenic character so in the hope of restoring some balance here goes.
This film is definitely not a 1, nor is it a 9; I believe the actual current rating of 6.7 to be a quite accurate score.
Script, production values, acting and cinematography are all delivered to a hgih standard.
I imagine the problems most low scoring reviewers are having with this movie are largely due to the pacing, which can be quite languid, particularly in the first act.
Characters are a little stereotypical but that can be overlooked somewhat given the subject matter of Red Sparrows trained up to peform honey trap ops.
This was indeed a feature of Soviet Intelligence operations (though certainly not exclusively so).
Anyone after a round of Bond or Bourne should look elsewhere. 
This film is much more along the lines of LeCarre though sadly without Smiley.
It also lacks the nuances of plot development one would expect in those tales. 
Once move into the middle act, the pace picks up as does the intrigue.
The final act moves along at a good clip and produces a satisfactory denouement.
So in summary, a worthwhile watch though not the greatest contributor to the genre.",Red Sparrow
740,robertgreen33,Slow Cold War Thriller Worth It For The Ending,6,20 May 2018,"This film is slow and muted most of the way through in the vein of a 50's cold war thriller, so if you want something loud and action packed then this film is not for you. On the other hand, if you like 50's cold war thrillers then I think you will find this serviceable. I found the speed almost endurance breaking at points but it had spots of good dialogue and a few moments of uncomfortable emotion inducing violence that woke me up and kept me going until the end.And finally the end of the film. Most of the films I have watched, and mostly enjoyed, over the last few years have had terrible endings. This is not one of them. I thought the end was good enough to be worth the effort of watching the film by itself. I think one of the problems with the film is that they hide the climax too well in the rest of the film to the point where it can be a slight struggle to be invested in what is happening.",Red Sparrow

Red Sparrow is an excellent spy thriller and although not all Russian women work for the Russian security services they are all sparrows, beautiful, self assured, clever. Men do not have a chance against these women and the movie portrays this realistically.

But rather than tear into it or put out a spoiler, let me give you two words: Plagiarism. Torture. I am re-reading Ian Fleming, and there is no doubt that the main character in Red Sparrow is an adaptation of Tatiana in From Russia with Love. The similarities: ex-ballerina, conscripted to a ""KGB-style sex service"" for purposes of seducing men, or in this case a particular man. That's okay as far as it goes, but in the interactions between the madame/colonel (also similar to the Fleming character in Russia with Love) actual and entire speeches from the Fleming novel were reproduced in their entirety - with no nod to Bond or Fleming. Is the screenwriter responsible, or was this from the book upon which the screenplay was adapted? I cannot say. But having just read the speech within 48 hours of hearing it restated onscreen, I can assure you if anything was cold-blooded about the film, it was the plagiarism. Personal objection #2: since we became aware of Guantanamo, film-makers of a certain calibre have felt it incumbent upon them to include long scenes of the most gruesome tortures in movies. How this helps the plot along, or how valuable it is for the moviegoer to sit for 20 minute watching people having their legs broken or their skin stripped off, you must decide. For me, it's appalling and the worst kind of pornography. Next we'll be seeing snuff films at the Cannes Festival.",Red Sparrow

761,AmoraNightingale,Brave and Indomitable Red Sparrow - A Surprisingly Unique Story,8,16 March 2018,"I saw Red Sparrow on its opening weekend and I can't stop thinking about the movie! This movie isn't perfect but it's definitely a good one. It was the Top box office over the last two weeks, in my country.I don't understand the 1 and 2 stars on IMDB. I believe many of those reviewers haven't seen the movie and if they did, they weren't ready to see it. I'm not sure if you can complain about violent and nude scenes when you went to see a R rated movie, because I'm sure you all saw the R before you bought the tickets! Red Sparrow doesn't deserve less that a 3, even if you hated it or even if you didn't comprehend the story! The soundtrack is absolutely perfect, the opening scene is amazing and all the scenarios are beautiful. I loved the ballet scene! And those twists and turns were breathtaking. This movie is not predictable at all and it's completely different from all spy movies I've ever watched. Dominika Egorova, a successful prima ballerina, is confronted with the premature end of her career after an accident. While she recovers from her accident, she's shaken by the reality that she will not be able to afford her mother's medical treatments and their home for much more time. Then, in a act of despair to help her mother, Dominika accepts to meet a man in a hotel. And what appeared to be an easy favor to please the important people from Russia's government and the secret services turns into something she wasn't prepared for. Dominika is send for the Sparrows' School and she has to learn how to survive in this new world, while trying to keep her mom safe... At some point she is assigned to Nash and she has to put in practice everything she learned, with no space for mistakes. The story is really good. It's a little confusing because the rhythm is constantly changing, but the end is brilliant. The cast is amazing! Jennifer Lawrence, Matthias Schoenaerts and Charlotte Ramplimg hold you on your seat! Jennifer Lawrence does a great performance and completely deserves the big role she receives. All the performances are convincing and I'm not a specialist on Russian accent but they all worked fine, in my opinion. It sounds a little bit strange to hear those actors and actresses with a different tone and accent that usual but after 2 minutes you don't care about it anymore. 
Here's what you need to know before you watch Red Sparrow: 1.There will be many violent scenes, sex and nudity. You really need to be prepared for those scenes if you're not used to R rated movies. - In my country, this film was ranked for 18+ (for example, Fifty Shades is 16+) so I was prepared for 'bad scenes' and honestly it wasn't as bad as I thought it could be. I haven't seen many R rated movies because of my age, but I only felt uncomfortable watching one scene (however, I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen). Curiously, the rating was changed for 16+ last week.2. This is not ""007"", ""Salt"", ""The Turist"", ""NCIS"", ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E"", ""Black Widow"" or whatever you wish to see. Red Sparrow is Red Sparrow! This movie has it's own unique story. People are criticizing this film for not being one of those cliche spy stories. Red Sparrow is based on a book with the same name written by an ex-CIA agent. That being said, please don't expect a cute and lovely unrealistic story. I'm convinced that many scenes are based on true facts, so there is no fairy tails, no impossible moves or comedy. You will not see a glamorized spy movie. You will assist to a film that shows the dangerous side of this life. The book's autor said that all the details and techniques we watch in this film are real. So, you will learn the agents' tactics and witness their intelligent moves. 3. Dominika is not a bond girl! She doesn't carry huge guns and sophisticated technology machines. Dominika only has two weapons: Her mind and her body. She's an ex-ballerina, a beloved daughter and an intelligent women trying to stay alive in a world that's new for her. 4. There aren't huge scenes with special effects - again the director tries to keep it as real as possible and faithful to the book descriptions. 5. Don't expect a big romance. - That was the disappointing part for me. I wanted to see a lovely romance growing between Dominika and Nate, but thanks to the twists and turns you never know what they really feel about each other until the end comes closer. Anyway, that's probably the message that the director wants to pass. I think that Francis Lawrence wants you to feel insecure and confuse, just like Dominika. That's how you create a bond with Jennifer Lawrence's character. 6. Don't expect James Bond exaggerated action scenes. - You will not see people jumping in front of a train or escaping from a car that's about to explode. But that doesn't mean that aren't action scenes! The action starts right in the beginning. 7. In the middle, the movie appears to be slow, but the twists and turns happen really quick. PLEASE, pay attention because you're not going to understand this movie if you don't pay attention to every single detail. 8. Some parts aren't very well explained (That's why this movie isn't perfect) - While some parts appeared to be slow, when the action came, sometimes, I felt lost. The ending is unpredictable and explosive. Some scenes happen so quick that you don't have time to process everything you're seeing. - When the movie ended, me and my friends stayed inside the theatre and talked about everything. We tried to bring every piece together, so that we could understand every little details that may had escaped us. 9. The Sparrow School is a big part of this movie. - There's a big focus on the changes that happen on Dominika's life and how she deals with them. This school represents the beginning of a new life and it confronts her with a new reality, so don't be surprised that this takes a big part of the movie. 10. The suspense doesn't stop until the last minute. - Is Dominika with the Americans? Or is she tricking them to steal the information? What is she thinking? Is she defending Russia or is she betraying her country? Is Dominika interested in Nash or is she seducing him like she was taught to do in the Sparrows' School? Does Dominika have a plan? Is she a strong nationalist or is she opened to switch side? Does she know what to do? 
I would love to see a trilogy and I will definitely see this movie again! I need to see all the details that I missed on the first view. I also started reading the book right away and it's great! I highly recommend it! Ps: Even if you read the book, you will be surprised during the movie too. I have found a couple of different scenes.",Red Sparrow

774,Littletifas,This is an ESPIONAGE film!!,7,14 July 2018,"If you are interested in spies and espionage this is a great film. I suspect the 1 star reviews are from people expecting a SPY MOVIE. E.g Mission Impossible, James Bond , Spy Kids etc. This is a film based on a novel about an actual covert intelligence group known as Red Sparrows. In the scenes showing the degrading tasks the Red Sparrows must do in training (to dehumanize and make patriots of the recruits), we are taken to the brink of what we can stand to see happen on screen, which I'm sure is what the director was trying to do. Lawrence's character is a tough, highly Intelligent woman who goes through hell. Yes there is sexual violence in this movie but yknow what? Sexual violence is real, why the constant need to hide it? It is not shown in a gratuitous way to sexualize the act for creepy movie perverts like it is in some horror films, it's necessary for the plot, she is a SPY! Danger is part of the job.This movie is rated R. If you like gritty, psychological espionage films you will enjoy this. It's violent a few times but just the right balance (its not HOSTEL).

777,researchermichael,An Objective Review,3,10 March 2018,"I call this objective because my critique is non-emotional as some seem to be. A large number of people appear to rate this movie low because they don't like Jennifer Lawrence. Yes, she was the protagonist, but this wasn't the whole story-line. That is my first remark which merely points out my perception.
Pros -
The story line was good and had enough twists to avoid being overly predictable
Next, --- well, that is pretty much the only positive remark I can make (which gives toward the three stars)Cons -
No decent Russian Accent
It does not adapt to the Russian life-style - for example, in Russia or any other former Soviet state, you would not walk right into someones apartment or house without kicking your shoes off at the door - that is just the culture.
Additionally, there was a portion of a sentence in Russian - it didn't feel authentic because of this.
Living in Russia has made me more nit-picky I guess - but some aspects of the Russian culture are blatantly in your face and were avoided in the movie.
It dragged in a number of places where it could have been compressed to get the point across - this ultimately made it a movie that was much longer than necessary. Therefore, it also provided moments of napping.------
For those tearing the moving apart commenting that is was filled with pornography and sexual sadism, they are exaggerating greatly. There were only two scenes of nudity; one of a man, the other of Jen Lawrence - neither of which was full and they were both only seconds of time.If you have money to throw away or MoviePass - and the time - go see it - otherwise, check it out of RedBox when it is out on DVD or BlueRay. I have tried to provide a balanced review. I hope I have accomplished this.",Red Sparrow
778,stasapfob,Don't believe the 1 star raters - this is not a Disney film (and doesn't pretend to be),9,6 March 2018,"Well as someone who actually read the book and just saw the movie, and having seen how incongruous many of the ratings are here on IMDb, I felt obliged to pass on a few notes. Frankly, I'm flabbergasted at the large number of low ratings - some weirdo rated it low as there was not ENOUGH nudity (clearly he must have wound up in the wrong theatre!), on the other end of the spectrum are the puritan nut-jobs who will denigrate an entire film because their hyper-active sensibilities are offended! Perhaps reading and understanding warning labels on movies would be useful to avoid future surprises - did the terms ""brutal violence, sexual violence, disturbing content, and nudity"" not give you a clue?I'm always really impressed how screenplay writers take an excellent and very complex book such as Red Sparrow and, out of necessity, condense the story/eliminate sub-plots and still come off with a movie adaptation that captures the basic premise of the book (and is shorter than 6hrs long!). I'm not sure why they substituted locations from the book (Helsinki and Rome/Athens) for Budapest and London (budget/logistics/tax incentives?), but it doesn't impact the story. I'm impressed with how the movie deftly wove key elements of the book into a shorter narrative, and yet still preserved the key story line and character arcs of the novel (for example the book has Californian Senator selling secrets to the SVR, while the movie puts this as the Chief of Staff to the US Ambassador to Hungary - enabling there to still be a mole hunt inside both the US and Russian governments). In one of the opening scenes, I was ready to criticize the film for lack-luster research - Nate is receiving a coded message which comprises a letter ""F"" phonetically relayed as ""Frank"" vice ""Foxtrot"" (you don't have to be in the Air Force or Type A - I am admittedly both) to know that NATO, ICAO, International Aviation, and Western militaries/police services around the world use ""Foxtrot."" It kind of reminded me of those cheesy 80's cop shows that insist on using ""Baker"" vice ""Bravo."" However, after this one albeit extremely minor error, I found myself immersed in a totally believable and realistic world of post-Cold War espionage.One reviewer said there was not a word of actual Russian spoken in the movie - again proving that some people are just not paying attention - I recall of at least one line when Dominika's boss speaks to her in Russian in the London hotel room. The number of reviewers that criticized the ""fake"" Russian accents to me must be Russians more upset about how the movie portrays Russia and Russian SVR ethics/tactics in a negative light. Considering the pedigree of the book's author, I'm inclined to believe in the realism and authenticity of the storyline. At least the actors made an effort to speak English with a Russian accent to lend authenticity to the story (and boy have we come a long way from Sean Connery's Scottish ""Russian"" accent in ""Hunt For Red October"" - and I'm an massive Connery fan!).Folks, without any spoilers here, this is a harsh and graphic movie, but intended to tell a story based on how espionage, intelligence and counter-intelligence work in the real world. The violence, torture and nudity in this film is not gratuitous at all, but essential to the authenticity and realism of the story. If people want mindless, ""no thinking required,"" family-friendly fluff, they should stick to Marvel, Disney or Pixar movies. I think Jennifer Lawrence does a brilliant job in this film; she has made another bold movie choice to broaden her character portfolio (personally, I wasn't a huge fan of ""Mother"" - but that is more me, not being a fan of that genre). The movie ending has a surprise plot-twist that deviates from the book - a forgivable Hollywood nuance to show justice/closure, and end on a slightly more positive note. Like the book, the movie sets us up perfectly for a legitimate sequel - I, for one, hope this is something being contemplated!",Red Sparrow
779,marychriss-29626,Lawrence and the film are a hit!,10,2 March 2018,"Jennifer Lawrence gives a great performance here. I was worried about her Russian accent, but it was authentic and never took me out of the movie. She really does put herself out there in this, so if you're sensitive to nudity then this is not your movie.I was very impressed with the direction, too. There are some really intense moments in the film that had my heart racing and put me on the edge of my seat.This is an overall well made spy movie with great performances and great moments of tension.There is a section in the middle of the film that is very slow and drags the pacing on, and there are moments of poor editing throughout, but I still had a great time with this film, and you should see it when it comes out.",Red Sparrow

781,KipFlynnOz,Depressing for all the wrong reasons,2,3 March 2018,"If you're looking for some sexy thrills, watch something else because the most exciting thing that happens in this convoluted, dour film is a flaying. Yes, someone actually gets flayed in this abomination, I think in an attempt to wake the audience up. Which seems to be a pattern in the film because every time it gets too boring we are suddenly hit with yet another rape or sexual assault or a brutal and graphic torture scene. It comes off as desperate and amateurish, rather than edgy. There is also no need for it as it adds nothing to the plot. There are plot points and moments that are so stupid they could be funny but the film unfortunately takes itself way too seriously and everything ends up feeling sad and also rather stale. Zero chemistry between the romantic leads and a complete lack of character development left me not caring what happened, so when the plot lost itself halfway through, it didn't matter because, heck, I was falling asleep. Disappointing and boring, which is a real shame because there was potential for a good film here. The one saving grace is a surprising anachronistic appearance from Mary Louise Parker, who almost steals the film with a comedic role.",Red Sparrow
782,sacyislore,Joined IMDB to warn all future viewers,2,7 March 2018,"So, this is the first film I've ever walked out on and I wanted to share why. In a nutshell, watching Red Sparrow is a miserable insulting experience that doesn't belong in 2018.I've generously given the film 2 stars for beautiful visuals, for the opening scenes which had promise, and for Mary Louise Parker. I also want to begrudgingly nod to JLaw for putting so much effort into this terrible role. Her acting is awful but she does try so hard and I genuinely feel sorry for her after seeing this. The film loses 8 stars, and I walked out, for the following laundry list of reasons:The characters are mostly cringey one dimensional stereotypes, who don't develop. All they care to convey is that Russia is evil, America is great. Every Russian man is the devil. Ugh. We get it. 
The plot is a loose, waffling mess filled with either pointless scenarios, ridiculous scenarios or long drawn out useless scenes. Not sure why others are claiming there was tension or suspense, because there really wasn't any. Don't worry, I ""got it"". But it just wasn't worth getting. 
The atmosphere is stale, clunky, and stilted. It never draws you in. Others have noted the film feels empty. 
The dialogue is lower grade than the worst tv soap opera.
The accents are a joke. 
It lacks any semblance of class or intelligence.
It is trying so hard to be sexy and edgy and but it's actually just so boring. People were legit falling asleep in the theatre.
When people weren't falling asleep they were covering their eyes to escape the unnecessarily gruesome and jarring scenes of rape, rape again, gory violence, torture, more torture, Flashdance posed torture, skin peeling, etc etc etc. I can handle sex and violence but as others have said, this felt like a torture porn or a snuff film. It was very poorly done. 
The direction and acting is flat out terrible. There is no excuse in 2018 when people should know what constitutes a good film.
JLaw doesn't change facial expression. She is appallingly bad in this. Appallling. 
There are heaps of mistakes that are very annoying, like the floppy disks and the hair dye. 
The list goes on....This film is a blight on the industry, frankly. It is also an insult to women, an insult to sex, an insult to all movies, an insult to the spy/thriller genre, and an insult to all viewers. I'm not going to pay money to be insulted, so I walked out. Oh and did I mention that half the theatre walked out? It wasn't just me! Yes, this movie really is THAT awful. You have been warned. If you really want to see this for some reason, my advice is to save your money and wait a few years for when it's on television.",Red Sparrow

I've read the book, and this movie is missing half the story, with some stylised visual scenes which make no sense at allA film is about portraying a story, and this film missed the whole point of the original story.But when you take a mediocre story and turn it into digested offal which has no alliance to the book, then you have a problem.Bad casting, bad directing,
Bad Acting, atrocious screenplay.
Another 60 minutes of film this into a REAL story would have made it bearable to watch,given the miscast actorsI would rather eat the result of a disjointed prolapse than watch this tripe again.Spent the first 28 minutes vomiting mockingjays.Okay, so Jennifer Lawrence fans will love it,and give it a 10, then complain that anyone who don't agree with them are ""Russian bots"" and ""haters""
She received a best actor award in a film where she was just being herself, but I did not see Dominika in her.
Joel Edgerton was terrible and miscast as Nate Nash and the relationship between the two was not only rushed and abbreviated, also had as much spark as a wet match.
Yes, the violence, sex and torture is part of the story, a page out of Stalinist Russia, where Putin has returned it to.Knuckle dragging rednecks will give a 10 for the USA being the ""hero""...... and living in a free dictatorship with a polarised view of the world, you expect that.
This film adaptation of the story in the book is atrocious.I looked forward to seeing Jeremy Irons play a classic role in this, being a pivotal character who is supposed to ""bring it all together""... which was completely ignored.... but even his facial expressions seemed to show embarrassment in performing in this film.I think Jeremy Irons read the book too, and was wondering """"WTF is going on here... and not one recipe was given, or restaurant scene.So, i give a one for the Bad everything.....casting, acting, directing, screenplay, continuity, story adaptation..... you know, those important parts that make a movie good, regardless of the subject matter.P.S.

Stupid cultural references and mistakes. And first one is that girl have typical russian name Dominika. I think that it can be shocking ,but this name cannot belongs to any girl in Russia. This mistake of writer was corrected by russian translators to Veronika cause this mistake will not allow you watch movie seriously. Now a little about distortion of russian reality. If somebody wants to know something about Russia, this movie won't helps at all. Such kind of poor cultural appropriation for ex-USSR viewers can be percieved only as comedy (as Borat of Sacha Baron Cohen), but in case of this movie with some scenes of sex and extremely serious tone.Reason 2.

790,anitacharran,Super Hero Or Spy?,9,2 August 2018,"This movie is based on a novel. It can be tough to translate the body of a novel into a movie. 50 Shades series is an example. The book is a spy thriller. The natural human body aspect of the trade goes back to James Bond. I remember those action films, also dealt with spies falling in love with one other. It was interesting for the same reason I find most espionage films interesting. The film version of From Russia With Love depicted the Soviet Union back in the 1970s as a cold and harsh intelligence agency that would easily murder one of its own if necessary. This compelling film visits the secretive KGB spy school that creates bait to blackmail the capitalist enemy in the name of the state. However, you would think the ascendancy of former KGB spook Putin to presidency would have retired that style of cold warfare. Look at Trump. Clearly not.Red Sparrow takes place in recent past. The Russian spies want our heroine played by Jennifer Lawrence to be merely a puppet and be manipulated by those who want personal gain at her expense. they want more like the rampant sex trade that exists in Russia and other nations than a super spy. They fail because she is strong. I figured the extra running time (2 hours and 21 minutes) had mostly to do with including more of what was in the novel. I think the depiction of the sex school is what will make the audiences on this film. It feels powerful, sexy, curious and intriguing, like a blast of realpolitik.Meanwhile we also follow what is to be the American hero in our story, Joel Edgerton, a CIA agent who may or may not have the machismo to lure a valuable female spy. They are to meet in Hungary, something that the CIA recognises as an attempt to get secret info from Edgerton. There is a moment at this point in the movie where several sub-plots appear. Lawrence's roommate in Budapest is another Russian spook and has a secret plan as another sex spy. The fat Russian diplomat-cum-pervert ringleader in Budapest has his own agenda. The different members of Russia intelligence have their own agenda. The story weaves between these subplots as Lawrence blows up expectations in order to preserve her life. One question that the audience may wonder about is how come when Lawrence's loyalty is questioned, her mother isn't used by the State for leverage. The answer: she already is. She is being blackmailed all along. Another is how the pieces of a puzzle that consist of the final plot twist are in for a dramatic and sexy twist.I found myself excited to go into extra innings due to the extra plot twists. Lawrence does well not telegraphing her real intentions. The movie also is put together well, making good use of the locations in Hungary. There are also a couple of good shocks in the film, which means this is no ta Disney film with its millions of universe offshoots.Watch it for heart pounding thrilling action. Watch it for the natural beauty of a woman. Watch it to see how evil the American spooks and the Russian slaves to the state are.",Red Sparrow

I mean it is this or the umpteenth sequels and remake (is the fifteenth remake of Grinch and reboot of Star Trek out yet?).Even Jennifer Lawrence has made a career of sequels and franchise films so to see this film makes one feel a little better about the improvement in this world. The director does a fine job here. The film begins with Soviet Russians' mercilessness and takes on a life of its own. The leads dispense with glamour and embrace the gritty without dramatic shadows and light, and the plot (about modern inhumanity) is without hyped up dramatics. This is a movie as down in the mouth as the world it represents, and it's all deliberate, and smart. I love how Lawrence deploys her beauty and allure and how the super powers launch into warfare depicting their immorality.This is the stuff of a breakthrough movie. It isn't quite as gripping now, I think, but it still sucks you in. Although the cold war has restarted, hasn't it? There are many scenes in cars, including a speeding car scene and many good old street stuff. The plot and pace of things is more steady and exciting than anything else.Check this film out.

808,jhawkinson,"A true Spy film. If your looking for Kingsman, look elsewhere!",7,8 March 2018,"Okay, I like the genre in all its forms, but I am particularly pulled towards the more gritty spy films demonstrating what looks much more believable than James Bond films.Red Sparrow isn't the best films I have seen of its type, and, to be honest, the ""twist"" actually confuses the average viewer since her actions seem incongruent with the expected plot line. What I mean is in ""Sixth Sense,"" even without the ""twist"" the story worked. In Red Sparrow, it doesn't work as well. As I am finishing the book, I find much of the confusion is all of the films making, and not a failure in the book. Without giving anything away, the director chose to have Dominika's thoughts completely hidden. Without any confidant, or narration, Dominika's motivations are simply inscrutable. This would be okay, but some of her actions, without context, are just plain confusing. Sure, if you pay attention, when you leave the movie you can tie it (mostly) together, but still the twist isn't worth the confusion.I would love to talk the team to understand why they changed some fundamental elements from the book for what appears (to me) just because. Some of it is, naturally, to save film time, but her choices of killing instead of destroying careers (in the beginning), just don't save time, or add anything to the story. In context of the book, it could be explained because of her character's childhood rages, but that aspect of Dominika are not even discussed. In the book one of the main concepts of Dominika is her ability to see colors for everything (which makes her an excellent at understanding people). In the movie, its just a one line throwaway.No, all this said, is rather besides the point. As a ""real spy film,"" where people are people, and not just cardboard ideologies, this is a good entry. It is well paced, and enjoyable to watch. It isn't ""Kingsman,"" ""True Lies,"" or even an action film. It is a Spy thriller, and it fills that role fine.I'm deducting one star just because the ""twist"" should have been part of the standard flow, and improved the movie continuity. The movie not narrating or giving her a confident to leave her motives opaque is needed for the ""twist,"" but it could have been handled better and delivered a more even movie.",Red Sparrow
809,covert-13435,Mysterious and Thrilling,7,26 March 2020,"Red Sparrow is an intense thriller that follows Dominika Egorova, played by Jennifer Lawrence, on her journey from prima ballerina to Russian Intelligence officer. Dominika is a very driven woman focused on caring for her mother and creating her own fate.
Red Sparrow begins by focusing on Dominika's very successful career as a talented ballerina, however, when she obtains a major injury her life is forever changed. Persuaded by her Uncle, Dominika takes on a role she thinks will help provide the care her mother needs. After Dominika is a witness to a gruesome murder, she is sent to the Sparrow School, where the students are taught to use their bodies and minds as a weapon. Dominika is taken out of the school earlier than expected, and sent on a mission to gain the trust of American CIA operative, Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton). This sends Dominika on her dangerous but thrilling path to use her power to finally benefit herself.
I think the theme of this movie was all about the Dominika finding her power after being betrayed, and the sacrifices she had to make to put that power to use. I think it is safe to say that Dominika was mistreated many times in the duration of this film, but she seemed to come out stronger in the end. Dominika used the training, that had been basically forced upon her, in a way that would benefit herself and her mother in the future. Dominika was given the choice to be killed or to become someone she was not. Dominika was able to trick everyone in the end, and was able to get the justice she deserved from her Uncle. She tricked him into thinking she was working for him, but made her own path and power to change her fate.
Dominika did not leave her future up to anybody else, she was very smart in the ways she worked, and it was hard to tell which side she was truly on all of the time.When she helps torture Nate, she shows just how much in control of the situation she really is. She is always one step ahead, and uses her intelligence and power to control her own future.
The camera angles and sound effects help make the movie a lot more suspenseful. The scene where Dominika is being tortured the camera is often at a very close up shot to her face, and this helps the audience see the pain and fear in her eyes. The music in the movies is often added in at the perfect time in order to create more suspense.
The movie Red Sparrow has a very strong female lead, who seems to be very focused on setting her own future. The camera angles and sound add to the suspense of the movie. Red Sparrow is an entertaining thriller, that at times was maybe a little bit to graphic.

814,tomjanssens57,Liked this movie.. think it was a solid 7-8,8,25 July 2018,"First of all I want to warn you for any pmossible spoilers along the way. So if you do not want to be spoiled or havn't seen the movie yet, than this might not be for you...To get things started, I first wanted to mention the fact that i thouroughly enjoyed the movie. From beginning to end, and never bored me. Some people are writing that 'its to violent' or 'some scenes are not explained', etc... If you are an adult and capable of coherent thought than you should not have a problem with this. Seeing this is a movie about espionage, survival and plainly using people to get what ya want.
And to people saying 'the sex scene was't good'. Than maybe go see a porno movie, if that's what makes or brakes a movie for you.So, what didn't I like about it:
1. At times it was a bit drown out.. Not too much, but I did get the feeling (especially after seeing it a second time now) that some scenes were prolongued just for the sake of having a 'good length' of a movie.2. Sometimes the acting is a bit stail, Jeremy Irons does an outstanding job but is at times let down by his fellow actors. Jennifer does her best, and I love her as an actress, but she does have the same facial expression thoughout most of the movie. It does not bother me all that much, but I can see why it would to some people.3. Some things are just a bit to convenient, and thats something I would like to call plot armour. The movie has to go one way, so events do tend to happen 'a bit easy' at times so the movie would progress along the worrect path. That's about all i kind of disliked. Now for the good parts of the movie
1. The tension throughout the movie is incredible.. You start to feel for evey charachter, and you see it isn't just black and white. But there is a giant grey area in where all of them opperate.2. The way Jennifers charachter transforms from ballerina to spy, to surivor is well done. At times I was gasping for air (bit of an exaggeration), because of how well her chrachter copes with all that is going on.3. The end of the movie, at least for me, wasn't to predictable. I did predict a part of it, but not the exact way it went down. Which is always a plus. I immediatly made the comparison to the plot twist in 'Along Camte a Spider - starring Morgan Freeman'. And that's just something I love about a movie.4. As I stated before, jeremy irons does a great job. His charachter was well portrayed and his on screen chemistry between himself and jennifer was just amazing to see.All by all I think, for the plot, the acting, the twists and they way the movie draws you in, it deserves, even if you didn't like it thay I did, at least a 6. For me, because I love spy movies and unforseen plot twists, it gets an 8.So go watch it for yourself, do not just blindly believe these 1 star people. Cause Iguarantee you it will not be a waste of time.",Red Sparrow
815,jcledford,No where as good as the book,5,30 May 2018,I was terribly disappointed in the movie. The book is full interpersonal relationships that this movie did not cover. It had no soul and changed the plot of the book. I cannot blame the actors. The script and the direction of this movie were lacking. This was a missed chance to make great movie. It maybe should have been an HBO Series instead of a movie.,Red Sparrow

817,psathan,Mediocre if you leave out nudity and violence,6,15 October 2018,"First of all. The movie takes place mainly in Russia, where everybody speaks English with a Russian accent. What is wrong with Hollywood? Either go full russian or just use normal american English like in the other thousand adaptations that you have made! It's ok! Don't try to add originality with an accent cause it is really really cheap!!! We know it's an american film and it's totaly natural to be in English. Now the movie. The plot is a bit slow and at first bit it gets better, the acting is ok so counts as a plus, but all in all it's a quite predictable and mediocre film. Nudity and violence are there to keep things a bit interesting until somthething actually interesting happens. There is a light mystery dark atmosphere found in spy and crime dramas, so maybe that's another plus. If you are a Lawrence fun then maybe you will be pleased but if not then better find something else to watch. Only the fact that this is not another universe action super hero film it's not enough to make it a good film. I am very disappointed to see people be happy just for this reason.",Red Sparrow

823,andrew_singleton,Genuinely polarising film,5,30 September 2018,"I say it's polarising because as I thought it was a poor film but my friend loved it so it's getting a balance of our two ratings.After enduring this film for over 2 hours I thought I would check out the reviews on IMDB to see what ther people thought as it's always nice to know if other people agree with you about how good/bad a film is. I just found the film boring and unengaging and halfway through I was wishing I'd chosen to watch the Ryder Cup highlights on TV instead.I'm a fan of Jennifer Lawrence but this is one of her weaker efforts. Her Russian accent is poor, as are most of the cast's and the gratuitous violence is something I could happily do without. I didn't really buy into the main character's motivation for becoming a sparrow, I thought the ""spy school"" training scenes were utterly bizarre and I'm amazed that when confronted with a man sprinting towards their embassy that American soldiers don't shoot first and ask questions later, like the police would.Anyway, the standout performance for came from Matthias Schoenaerts as the uncle, who gave a very convincing display of a powerful man quite comfortable in using everyone else for his own gain and so convinced of his own abilities that he missed his own weak spot in the form of his niece.",Red Sparrow

Absurdity in reasoning every 5 minutes. What is the most intmadating that it recreates the Cold War perspective: the black and white world, in which Russian is undenably bad and inhabited by sexual maniacs. It supports a stereotype about all Russian women as only bodies. This is pure misoginia and very offensive just to watch it being a Russian woman. The rest of the world headed by the US is full of the white knights and a fairy god mothers. Obviously, the best character is a CIA agent, the only one real man who has compassion to a poor girl. Awful sex scenes: no sex, no feelings, no emotions at all, not even a reason to cut in such a scene. Weird language: not Russian but some constructed accent that trying to be Russian. Freedom exists only in the US and obviously CIA is the main agent of the free world. Amen.",Red Sparrow

833,smithdeb,Disappointed,2,31 August 2018,"Though I really like Jennifer Lawrence I will no longer choose a film based on her name. I really like spy and adventure movies but this disappointed. I just got tired of the porn aspect and the training process just got boring. I understand that they were trying to break her down to do the job they wanted but it started dragging and I got bored. I did not choose it to see a documentary on how the Russians (or anyone else) train their spies to infiltrate the enemy (no pun intended) I want to see the story. Other movies have successfully shown the breakdown process and the adventure much more successfully - this one did not for me. Since most of the reviews I have read (after viewing the movie) that gave this a thumbs up are gushing over the sexiness and beauty of Jennifer Lawrence or their distrust of Russia and Putin as opposed to a review of the story itself, their movie priorities differ from mine. Wish I had read them before taking time to watch this movie - I would have picked something else. Jennifer's acting was, as always, well done but I cannot say anything else positive about it. Her choice or her exploitation? I'm not sure. But I am disappointed. Good potential turned bad for my tastes.",Red Sparrow

Reunited with director Francis Lawrence, Jennifer Lawrence brings the star power to this cold and rough thriller. This is not an action movie as it has barely any action sequences, but it's a clever and well thought out political drama. It's one of those few interesting cases when you can't quite read the protagonist, and Jennifer proves a wild card here. The chemistry just isn't there though, it's hard to buy Lawrence and Edgerton's romance. And it bothers a bit that all the russian folks are played by americans (it can't be that hard to find decent russian actors). But make no mistakes, this is a hell of ride, it's violent, it's brutal, and it's nasty bones will creep up on you.",Red Sparrow

I can see that great effort, strides, and sacrifice for Jennifer on bringing to life Dominika, you feel genuine pain and grief with the need to find justice against those that forced her into that life. Well done.",Red Sparrow
838,durablu,I can't believe I thought this had potential.,7,12 January 2020,"Where do I begin?The plot is fairly straight forward, and was pretty much revealed in the trailer. So focus should be on the execution, right? Apparently not.First of all, what year is this supposed to be? We have mobile phones and yet all scenes set in Russia are grey and brown, everyone dresses like it's USSR in the 60s for some reason, and all the pictures are developed and printed in black and white?Secondly, people who made decisions for this film, decided to cast a bunch of English-speaking actors to play Russian characters. However, instead of speaking Russian or speaking English with their regular accents, they all speak English to each other with horrendous fake Russian accents. It's incredibly distracting and outright infuriating. Presumably, the viewers are supposed to imagine Russian characters speaking Russian to each other (judging by the level of fluency) and yet when Dominika goes abroad (and presumably speaks English now) she still possesses the same level of fluency and vocabulary (albeit with the same horrendous accent). Additionally, there's a mixture of Russian and English on signs and TV and drink labels, which once again - why?While we are on the subject, neither Dominika, Marta or Katerina would be considered common names in Russia (It could be shortened front Ekaterina, sure but who would put that on an ID).Or how about the fact that the main character goes from having long dark virgin hair to a perfect blonde shade in one night with just a box of home dye? I'd sooner believe Dominika was speaking english to her mum.And lastly, how are there so many reviews deducting the grade just because Jennifer Lawrence wasn't naked enough? Eh? Or that it wasn't super enough? Pretty sure the rape scenes weren't meant to be super, nor is a public ""giving him what he wants"" thing at school.Two stars are for the ballet part at the beginning.",Red Sparrow

844,master_s-t-a-l-k-e-r,Not worth watching,2,13 May 2018,"I generally like spy stories and the whole USA-Russia clash presented in the films. But, you have a good film like the ""Bridge of spies"", then you have this thing.Right out of the bat, Jennifer's performance mate this film tedious to watch. Very plastic acting - and for someone who's role is supposed to be ""le femme fatale"", that is not acceptable. That alone lost it 3 points.Then, politics. Now, I don't mind politics being drawn into a film, if it makes a good story - but this time it is really on the nose. Russia is presented as USSR, the main bad guy looks like young Putin, and the only bad people are Russians. I don't want to spoil anything but as you know the premise of the film, in one instance the American character says ""We would never do what the Russians are doing"" - which is a bit stupid given the fact how many female agents were sent to Castro, a well known story.That clearly one-sided story telling is what ruins the immersion of the film. Pure propaganda without any other purpose - and that is a problem.Scenes (let's not go through all) are poorly done most of the time. Really good actors with interesting roles don't get time on screen in order for film to give us naked Jennifer in some stupid scenes.As for the story and the twist, they are sort of fun, that is why I didn't give it 1 point. Nothing mind blowing, but fun.But the whole selling point of this film is ""Naked Jennifer"" and ""Those Russian monsters"", so I guess it is going to be very well received in USA. To those who don't like propaganda just for the sake of it and have a refined taste in women and require at least decent acting, I suggest to avoid this film. And for you who just can't wait to see naked Jennifer, go ahead - but there are much better looking women to look at, for free, fulfilling many male fantasies if you are into those sort of things. You don't need to waste money on this film for that.",Red Sparrow

It's a grotesque concept but it might have at least been interesting if the filmmakers had anything interesting to say about it. Instead, director Francis Lawrence's film tries to operate as a slick, sensual spy blockbuster while also constantly acknowledging just how messed up every single thing about it really is. It's hard to take the film's critique of dehumanization seriously when it takes every opportunity possible to luxuriate in its prurience, and it's impossible to enjoy the film as a superficial thrill ride when every single scene is built on a foundation of horrific abuse.",Red Sparrow

People, it's 2018 year, 21st Century in the yard. Stop digging ""Humiliated and insulted"" by Dostoevsky in research of Russian souls and details of their casual being. Russia is far more advanced than that already. 
 So what do we have here... James Bond is on vacation and Eliza Doolittle has been sent to replace him by her Uncle -pervert. 
I am surprised why the Russian spies do not escape to US every day if they are forced in fact to be prostitutes just for food, medicine for sick mothers and apartment. The ideals of freedom and patriotism apparently are not popular anymore? What about American spies then? Intellectual brains of CIA melt down like an ice-cream heated with hot blonde's butts...Wow, who wrote this ridiculous screenplay - teenager obsessed by sex? 
Lawrence is the way too far from not only ballet dancer but even from average statistical slim attractive Russian girl. And are they all that gloomy looking? And sure Dominika is the most common Russian name. 
So...nazi looking school, Rampling saying ""I will shoot you in your head"", Middle ages tortures for the young girl in local ""Guantanamo""...And finally the story and motives of Rat are so far-fetched, excuse me. The way Americans depict Russia is disrespect for Americans but not Russians.

883,kevlovski,Predictable twaddle.,2,2 March 2018,"Based upon the book of the same name by ex-CIA agent Jason Matthews, Red Sparrow is a modern-day spy thriller by director Francis Lawrence (Hunger Games: Catching Fire, I Am Legend) that harks back to the days of the cold war thrillers of the 70s/80s but fails to update it appropriately, coming across as a piece of vitriolic propaganda and little else. Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone) and the rest of the top-notch cast try their damndest to give it some credibility but the story and premise make for a predictably silly and gratuitous affair on many levels.Dominika Egorova (Lawrence) is the top female dancer at the Bolshoi ballet theatre in Russia, who succumbs to a terrible injury that ruins her career. As the Bolshoi theatre seeks to wash its hands clean of 'damaged goods', giving her job and home to a rival, Dominika and her sick mother's welfare are put in jeopardy. Seeing an opportunity, Dominika's spymaster uncle makes her an offer she can't refuse, in return for the safeguard of her mother's health, leading her into the world of espionage and the Sparrow program, where seduction and the art of the honey-trap are the key weapons.By the time you get through a quarter of the mind-numbingly long, 139 minutes, the viewer is left in no doubt of Red Sparrow's predictable outcome. This inevitable plotline is laboured along by the director's attempts to mask it with half-assed twists and turns that just don't feel plausible when putting it in the life or death, professional espionage scenario that the story is supposed to portray. Joel Edgerton (The Gift) is as reliable as ever playing the CIA agent that she ends up in a game of cat and mouse with but the relationship does not feel natural, especially with how the script moves their love-tinged story along. The dialogue is cliche-ridden, telegraphic and Jennifer Lawrence, although competent enough, acting wise, lets her slightly dodgy accent drop every so often, making for some unintentional moments of humour. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy this is not.The main trio of 'evil' Russians has the very talented Matthias Schoenaerts (The Drop) - looking very Putinesque! - playing the devious spymaster uncle to a believable degree, Jeremy Irons hamming it up as a ruthless general and Charlotte Rampling in an absolutely ludicrously over-the-top role as the sinister Matron of the Sparrow program. The whole Sparrow training scene is like something out of Armand Ianucci's fantastic, The Death Of Stalin, minus the satire, as it serves to show the viewer how Russia is trying to take over the planet and that Russians are inherent bigots, deviants, rapists and sociopaths. These scenes are probably the most significant pile of gratuitous excrement that I've had grace my eyes and ears for quite some time.The overall theme of this nonsense is to remind us not to forget that Russians in general are twisted, violent and manipulative control freaks, while all the men are partial to being woman-beaters and rather rapey, apparently. And of course, the CIA are all good ole boys who occasionally mess up, but are out to free the world from tyranny and have everyone's best interests at heart. I kid you not. No exaggeration.I'm not sure how much screenwriter Justin Haythe (The Lone Ranger) carved up the story of the book but this is trashy beyond belief. One thing that is for sure is that director Francis Lawrence clearly knows that the biggest asset they have in this is Jennifer Lawrence's body, as the amount of disrobing or scantily clad scenes, along with blatant arse shots that she's subjected to, is off the charts. And when that is the most impressive aspect of your film, then you should know that there's a problem. Red Sparrow is what I can only be described as twaddle - brutal, nasty, occasionally boring but always gratuitous twaddle.",Red Sparrow
884,alexandra-42521,Very interesting movie with an outstanding performance by Jennifer Lawrence,10,27 February 2018,"It is true that Red Sparrow without Jennifer Lawrence would just be half as good. She is the center of the movie and with minimal acting she tells us everything we need to know. It´s just a look into her eyes and you are inside everything she has to experience or endure. In the middle of a truly haunting story which will stay with you for a very long time. And which you´ll want to rewatch to catch all the twists and turns!
From the first scene on you are seated in a roller coaster which goes on and on and you don´t know how to leave - but that is all meant in a positive way! You never want to leave it, you want to know what happens next! You experience one hell of a ride and yes it´s violent and there are some sex scenes but it is a movie for grown-up people and they should not have a problem with that. Everything happening in Red Sparrow is for a cause and not violence and explosions with no sense at all. We see this way too often in movies nowadays so this one should be highly appreciated.
Alongside Jennifer Lawrence´s wonderful performance there is a really good supporting cast, especially Matthias Schoenaerts as her uncle Vanya. Joel Edgerton, Charlotte Rampling, Jeremy Irons and all the others were fine as well.
I loved the wonderful cinematography and the truly brillant score from James Newton Howard. it is definitely one of his best! You have to check this out as well!
Francis Lawrence and author Justin Haythe did a great job bringing Jason Matthew´s novel to life for the big screen. It is different from the book in some ways but this is good and the movie really keeps you guessing like the trailer announced.
Red Sparrow gives you insight into a world of its own, we are allowed to witness for 2 1/2 hours. You feel like being strangled at moments because there is no choice at all for the leading lady, but in the end you can really understand what being empowered means! It is a spy movie masterpiece! And Dominika is one of the brave, fearless, deep woman characters we need nowadays! I hope for the other books of Jason Matthews to become movies as well since we really need more of this powerful woman character. So go see this movie! It´s excellent!",Red Sparrow
885,ben_skyrme-1,"If you've read the book, avoid this like the plague!",5,6 September 2018,"I know it's dangerous to watch a film after reading the book, but I was looking forward to this one. I thought Jennifer Lawrence was well-suited to the role and the rest of the cast looked solid. What I hadn't counted on was the number of random plot changes that would be made. I understand that sometimes plot elements need amending to translate from paper to screen, but a lot of what went on here seemed egregious. Good characters became bad and key plot elements, like the fate of the mole, were changed completely. Perhaps those who have just seen the film will be able to enjoy it on its own merits, but I would defy anyone to say that this new, reworked story was a patch on the original.",Red Sparrow
886,mansour_awad,I expected more,7,3 March 2018,"I've been waiting this movie since it's trailer release and watched it as a first screening today, reason why, Jennifer Lawrence indeed, and the perfectly created trailer. And I'm sad ... very sad Red Sparrow isn't a good movie,and is a good movie, and that's bad, because you can see what it might have been. The story has intrigue built into it in a way that probably made perfect sense on the page; it just doesn't translate onto the big screen.First, the movie was a different kind of spy movies, it was not the conventional James Bond type, since the spy here was not taught about weapons and explosives use, it was rather psychological, seductive manipulation type of spy. AND THAT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING... until Everything went wrong, the storytelling, the acting ( will pass by in a bit ), not to mention THE REMOVED SEXUAL SCENES from our country policy ,that influenced negatively the flow of the story. ( AN ACTUAL WHOLE SCENE REMOVED AND LEFT 3 SECONDS OF IT) Jennifer Lawrence, the main reason i was waiting that movie, did a great job, it was so amazing to see her characterization of the lead character Dominika, her transformation from an innocent ballerina to a strong willed manipulative spy. The movie's main attraction was the high intensity dramatic moments which all involved Dominika, the way she had to adjust herself into many situations.BUT, it wasn't Jennifer's Best performance ...The music score isn't bad after-all, it suits the tension, the first 10 Minutes was amazing. The last 40 Minutes are well built and directed with a twisted ending .The movie had a duration of more than 2 hours which for some audience might be a bit too long. I overall liked the half of the movie, and the other half I was grinding. I had high hopes of a unique spy thriller with Jennifer Lawrence playing the lead, i was somehow disappointed.With sorrow i will rate this movie with a 7.5/10",Red Sparrow

890,killer_llama,"Interesting and well paced, but...",8,31 May 2018,"This is a very well done Cold War style thriller. I have read many of the reviews here, but I fall somewhere in the middle. This movie definitely is not for everyone. This is not one to take your children to because ""they see stuff anyways"". The violence in this film was brutal. I often hoped that the camera wasn't going to cut to a close up of what was going on, and fortunately, it didn't. The nudity, although used throughout, doesn't seem gratuitous. Nudity and sex acts here do have a purpose to the story, and don't seem to be an obvious excuse to put get actors naked. I can understand a spy needing to use their body to gain secrets, and in 2018 it shouldn't be shocking that it's a subplot in an R rated movie. I liked the fact that this didn't feel like a movie pushing feminist propaganda, and it didn't feel dated either. Dominica is a strong female character, and there are definitely some male ""pigs"", but not all men are showcased in that light.All this said, I am not really a fan of JLaw, but I felt her look and accent here was great for the part. My biggest complaint of the movie was that she always has the same expression, as in most roles. She did a good job reacting to what was happening around her though, and the movie was intriguing all the way through.Although the movie could have been done as a PG-13 with less swearing, implied sex/nudity and violence, this movie is well made. It's tense and feels like a movie from a different era.",Red Sparrow

893,viksninab,The missing piece,9,3 May 2018,"""Every human being is a puzzle of need. You must become the missing piece, and they will tell you anything."" 
Imagining the movie is a puzzle, there were a lot of missing pieces. A lot that didn't fit in either. A Russian woman named Dominika? An immensely famous ballerina being able to become a spy without anyone recognizing her as the public figure she had been until this very moment? Russia with no Russian speakers? The ""bad guy"" looking 90% like a copy of Vladimir Putin? A lot of moments were unbelievable - moreover, made me wonder - is it really a good piece if such things were not thought about? 
Yet, I have no idea what it was - Jennifer's master performance, the power she held over me even while being just a visual being on the movie screen? The way human beings were portrayed as these animals that just can't be trusted under any circumstance? And the way how painfully true and relatable it felt? It revealed more about people than some people learn in a lifetime.

Sometimes i think these movies start being created 5 years earlier and when they come out its like the world is years ahead, we're years ahead. Come on! Another spy movie with fake russian accents? 
This movie takes itself too seriously, tries to be original and ''shocking'' but it's full of spy cliches from beginning to end.

This is not the best movie of all time, nor is it ""The Room"" - it's somewhere in the middle.The production is high quality. Locations, cinematography, umm.. sound, I guess.The story is where the flaws are. This isn't some complex and nuanced story of two superpowers stuck in a complicated geopolitical and historical struggle. It's the good guys vs the bad guys. Russia is the bad guys. The US and the CIA are the good guys. It's really that simple.It attempts to say ""not all Russians are bad guys"" and ""not all Americans are good guys"" by having one token person on each side be the representative of good/bad. So we have two people that betray their country and work for the other side, Boucher, a lesbian drunk with a French surname, who betrays the US for personal, selfish, financial reasons, and Korchnoi, who betrays Russia to work with the CIA because they want to bring a better world for everyone.But other than those two, everyone in the CIA side is good, while everyone on the Russian side is horrible:1. Women-beating, sexual harrassment boss who sexually harasses Dominika, tries to get her fired, spits on her, punches her.. also has a small manhood. 
2. Betrayer roommate who tries to sell Dominka out for personal gain.
3. Ballet dancer that lets Dom fall to break her leg and ruin her career
4. Co-conspirator ballet understudy who is part of the leg-breaking conspiracy
5. Uncle Putin, who looks like Putin for some mysterious reason... is a pedophile and into incest... 
6. The headmistress at the prostitution academy, need I say more?
7. The rapist soldier at the prostitution academy, a soldier in the Russian army, who was beaten to a pulp by an ex-ballerina. Yes, soldier, beaten by a ballerina. He's also impotent, performance anxiety...
8. The oligarch, who tries to rape Dom, actually, he rapes her
9. The psycho torturer... need I say more?
10. The torturers of the Russian secret serviceDo I need to go on?The problem with such scriptwriting is that it's so heavy-handed and weak. It's one thing to be pushing a message, it's another to do it so poorly. This is the ""kick the dog"" trope, where bad guys do evil things to tell simple-minded viewers that this is the bad guy in the story.It's sad that this is the image the filmmakers wanted to show of Russia. It's not a normal place, with normal people, with an unfortunately bad government. It's an evil place, with evil people and an evil government. The movie shows that every segment of Russian society is evil - the businessman (private sector) is a rapist, the government is one of torturers/rapists/pimps, and even the artists are not exempt from this - the ballet dancers are evil people.It is enjoyable as a film if it were a fictional country with fictional people.

How do you jump from breaking your leg to that? Like they couldn't have come up with anything better? My biggest thing was that this credible CIA agent decides to sleep with his informant after 2 meetings knowing full well what she's been through and what she's trained to do. Their relationship was shallow and unncecessary.I didn't walk out in the hopes that it would redeem itself but it never did. There was no build up or climax.

The plot took some fanciful twists and overall left me feeling pleasantly surprised and somewhat taken aback at the bloodbath of a conclusion. The locations were admirably filmed and having travelled to each location I can verify they exist and to some extent had the ambiance of what it must have been like all those years ago for the real CIA agent Jason Matthews.If you want gritty drama, suspense, high speed car chases & honest portrayal of a true event then you will no doubt enjoy this film.

It is unbelievable how this movie could make it on a big screen (probably thanks to J.Lawrence). It makes you feel cringy and repellent towards the most characters, and especially towards the producers who are obviously lacking on any morals. The movie is full of scenes of main character getting abused, raped and abused again and the movie just drags on and on with flat violent sex scenes meanwhile portraying the typical 'evil' Russia and saviour America scenario.

It wasn't about James Bond chase scenes and more a cerebral exploration of the workings of espionage. Russian spies have been trained in seductive technique for decades including using Stanislavski's method of acting. Whichever side the russians are on, they pursue their intent doggedly--witness their repulsion of the Nazi's in WWII. A pre-Trump exposition, given all that is in the news--whatever high ranking, unboundaried American is playing in Russia, they will be collecting data to blackmail--this movie addressed that in its own way.

I still don't know the reason?, I guess the director just wanted to see her nude and in that manner, so that brings me to -> is this casting (director, plot writer, etc) a casting of criminals? I don't know if that STRONG word would fit them, but definitely something is wrong with them, the hate that they show (on purpouse) on this movie, is just aaaaawful.Don't go to watch this...

Then some of you give it 1 star for being too violent, which I could understand if you are a little bit squeamish but what would you expect from a film that states it's going to be violent, have nudity and be 18+? If you know a film is going to be violent, and yet you don't enjoy watching it in movies, go watch something else. Yes it is about women using their ""assets"" to gain the trust of men, but no it is not sexist. Jennifer Lawrence gets royally screwed up in this and yet she comes out on top, and shows her Uncle who's top dog. All in all the film does what it set out to, keeps you guessing throughout and makes you root for Lawrence's character. It's not going to go down as the greatest film ever made but you know what you're getting into. Ignore the low ratings because they are absolute nonsense. Decent movie. 7/10",Red Sparrow

Other than that, the first half is overly sexualised, awkward and uncomfortable to watch, the second half might save the film a little, although sometimes is was boring and sometimes hard to watch because of the bloody scenes.

I don't even know what kind of person can tolerate this for so long. And I know whereof I speak, I'm writing my master's thesis about the creating bad image of Russians in American cinema).

There are many reasons to skip this mess--Lawrence's bad acting, the lackluster direction and the silly plot. But mostly it's just plain boring. There's a big difference between a storyline that's blatantly contrived (I'm betting all of you eight and nine star raters don't know what that word means and will have to look it up) and one that contains real suspense.

I was also confused if this movie was of Russia or some kind of made up country in the 80's. Modern day Russia is a vibrant society that is really going out of its way to imitate the US. The director clearly lacks any knowledge of Russia or what era he is in. I wasted $7 to rent this terrible production and I could not watch it more than 20 mins in.

Luckily, her uncle is in a top special forces branch and can give her a ""leg up."" This film offers you a ""bird's eye view""of a young woman who has connections to the highest levels of the secret service. Not at all your typical ""expendable."" The main character is a rather spoiled girl who you're supposed to feel sorry for because her special forces uncle ""looked at her funny"" when she was little. Really? We can't explore that theme just a little more? The reality of Russian sexist culture is so horrifying as to make this movie a fantastical joke. You could even go so far as to say it's a pro-Russian movie: you'll be fine as long as you have not witnessed a political assassination, you're beautiful, one of the most successful ballerinas of your time and your uncle is a top secret service agent (although he may have looked at you funny when you were little - but we won't go into that because that's just inappropriate -wtf?!).

990,mindaugaspipyne,Stain on Jeniffer Lawrence career,1,1 September 2018,"Well this film is riddled with cliches, creators can't even remotely show what Russian secret service looks like.
It's an fruit of perverted mind like some cheap hentai. At moments it looks more like dark comedy, they could also add bears that were trained I spy school to seduce perverted western politics under the sound of Hell March from red alert. Vodka vodka balalaika!!!",Red Sparrow
991,svetikpinaeva,This film is disgrace to American cinema!,1,14 September 2018,"While watching the movie, I could not understand the time in which the action develops. At first, I thought that it was nineties, of course, a difficult time for our country. Then I noticed a smartphones, but I couldn't believe it was modern. What do you show? The Bolshoi's prima live in poverty in a rented one? Gorky Park shows garbage, where the bandits and traitors. What right do you have to show my house like this? The beauty and diversity of Gorky Park, the rich life of ballerinas, all this is shown so pathetic(or rather, not shown at all), that I was ashamed of you. Previously, the actors playing in this film were very authoritative and interesting for me, but now I'm no longer consider them artists, but only pawns of the government without their own opinion. You humiliated my home, my family, my culture. If I threw the money spent on the ticket in the trash, It would be useful, because I would not be paid for your work(and work it is difficult to name). I have nothing against the Americans, but you do not have the right to show our Capital like this, because the reality is different at times. Thank you for reading and sorry for my English.",Red Sparrow
992,almodh,Spy Girl,7,27 September 2018,"This film showed us how the dangerous intelligence services are. In addition to that this film was showing the dangers of Russian intelligence to the world. And yet, the film has some style, some sickening violence and unrepentant perversions, and Jennifer Lawrence. It could be worse. Also, the actress used her sexy espionage to get information from senior people and this is I think what is the way the spy people get the sensitive information. Jennifer Lawrence totally gave a great performance in this film and we can notice that from her passion and her love of her role. If you guys like watching action movies I highly recommend this film.",Red Sparrow
993,ixls,Truth about KGB revealed,1,30 September 2018,"They show everything as it is. My younger sister Karolina is in Sparrow School too. I test her skills every time she is at home. In the organisation, they taught her not to resist. Our president worked for KGB when he was younger. And now my sister does. It's very honourable. I hope she'll bring a handheld phone from the USA for me. Nobody here has those things.",Red Sparrow
994,tdragonphone,Anyone want a bad porn movie...this is it!,1,3 October 2018,"Basically a soft porn movie with no plot, no characters with meaning and nothing to save it. 
Debbie Does Dallas or Autobiography of a flea are better movies. They at least have a plot. I thought Walking through the tombstones was bad....this one would have to climb up 10 flights of stairs to make it to bad. Only made it a hour and then switched to a movie with substance, plots and characters with meanings. ""Sexy parts"" were not sexy but cringe worthy.Dont waste time or money on this super flop.Basically expected female James Bond...received bad porn!",Red Sparrow
995,ilya-52262,"Oh, I came out of a coma",3,4 October 2018,"I hit it 30 years ago. As soon as I woke up thinking what I should do, I'll write a script. So, what should I write it about? About now after all all scold Russian (as well as 30 years ago), has to be fashionable and Patriotic. The Russians have a ballet and the KGB (no matter what it is no longer called) and more I do not know anything about Russia, but nothing will do. I see the Director next to me in the next bed woke up, but still under medication. He slipped him the script and started. Made a great MOVIE. And never mind that I have all the countrymen believe the idiots who will swallow all of this, because I want to make money. It is a pity that Hollywood has fallen to such films and I feel sorry for the actors who agree to play in such a low-level action.",Red Sparrow
996,fosmummy,unrealistic film about imaginary Russia,1,17 November 2018,"You will like it if you like stupid superficial dull and tasteless films.
Did you know that novelist who writes a book Red Sparrow said is all truth? it's funny because we don't have any facts in history about that, but we have one very cheap russian detective book about ""sex-spy"" from 90's, which is fiction from front to end, and some facts from this two books are similar.",Red Sparrow
997,milla_avelar,Filme carregado por Jennifer Lawrence,6,30 December 2018,"Isso mesmo, o que faz a gente aguentar o filme é a protagonista, que atua muito bem e nos prende ao enredo muito mal feito do filme.
O enredo não prende o telespectador, em se tratando de uma perspectiva de fora o filme atrela a história da personagem uma característica massante, começa com uma cena no ballet, e findada carreira da protagonistas no mesmo.
Daí surgem determinados acontecimentos que levam ela a se tornar uma sparrow.
Os auges do filme se perdem na trajetória pobre de histórias, quando se pensa que aquele é o clímax, na verdade não é.
O treinamento para se tornar uma sparrow que é uma das partes mais esperadas e dada de forma rasa na história, de repente outro conjugado de cenas mostra a história na América.
O ponto é que nos perdemos no meio desse enredo, claro que o filme não é obrigado a dar tudo, porém com as táticas previsíveis e distantes de red sparrow o filme não prende o telespectador da forma que deveria. O que não deixa o filme um completo desastre é a atriz principal que consegue equilibrar uma história ruim com uma ótima atuação. Provavelmente se a protagonista fosse uma atriz menos competente o filme fosse um completo desastre de audiência.",Red Sparrow
998,peters1999,A boring and embarrassing movie full of clichés,2,4 March 2018,"From mostly British actors playing Russians speaking english with Russian accents to a boring, cliché ridden, overlong story, this movie is one big disappointment. The whole Russian ensemble, including locations and decor feels like it has sprung out of some American fantasy (It probably has) about how Russia is, thinks and operates. I went to see this with a group of friends including some Russian friends in Madrid and I wish we could at least have had a laugh at all the ridiculousness of this, but instead we were almost falling asleep as this movie is boring, confusing and way too long. Really bad for Jennifer Lawrence, who I really like to see on screen, but here I can only say : Do not go and waste your money on this.",Red Sparrow
999,kms-87320,Was this a huge misstep for JLaw's career?,1,4 January 2019,This film is nothing but a film for voyeurs who enjoy S & M. It even includes some incest for those who are really kinked. The background spy story is lame. Overall a complete waste of Jennifer Lawrence's talent.,Red Sparrow
1000,frankenpodie,No eye socket,1,5 January 2019,I didn't care about any of the characters and Jennifer Lawrence did not shove a shower spigot into anyone's eye socket. Very disappointed.,Red Sparrow
1001,john-77924,Excellent.,8,26 January 2019,"I'm sometimes put off by lower IMDb ratings - to me 6.6 is just above average. RED SPARROW though is way above average. Great acting by Jennifer Lawrence, Joel Edgerton (wouldn't he make a great Jason Bourne?) and of course Jeremy Irons. In fact great acting all round. I loved this film - graphical in places, sexual and violent but all of it meant something. It was there for a reason, part of the plot. Ok it's on a while, but enjoyable all the way through. Well done everyone involved. Great job",Red Sparrow
