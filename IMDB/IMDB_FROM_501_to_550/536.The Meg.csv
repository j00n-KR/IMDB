0,TheLittleSongbird,Mega mediocrity,4,12 August 2018,"My main reasons for seeing 'The Meg' were that there are classic shark films out there (there is an obvious example that won't be named by means of fairness in the review but has been mentioned elsewhere) and that it was part of my many quests to see as many 2018 films as possible. It did look from the cover that it would be some kind of guilty pleasure fun, which was my ideal kind of film for the day.Apparently 'The Meg' had a lot of studio interference, meaning that what was initially intended (and from the sounds of it what was initially intended would have made it a much better film) was not seen in the film, and it shows in the final product. Wanted some guilty pleasure film, a kind of turn-the-brain-off-at-the-door sort of film. Instead, 'The Meg' turned out to be poorly written and mostly devoid of tension and fun, one where one is rooting for the shark than any of the human characters. Is it better than any of the shark-creature films from SyFy and The Asylum? Oh yes, so much better, now those are mostly abominations. That doesn't stop 'The Meg' from being potential unfulfilled. There are positives. 'The Meg' does start off reasonably well with a sense of unsettlement and the climactic scene is pretty entertaining. The best character, kid you not, is the shark which had personality and one that was not too scary or goofy. It's pretty decent visually, nicely shot in particular, the music fits well and Jason Statham brings charisma to his role and is believable in that aspect.On the other hand, the rest of the acting is a mess. Worst of all is a dreadful Bingbing Li, with a character that bores and annoys and approaching the character in a way that's completely wrong and out of kilter with everything else. None of the characters are well written, too bland to be interesting and too annoying with dumb decision making to be likeable. A few of them are completely unnecessary. Development is zero.Special effects are uneven, some times they are pretty good and at other times they look so artificial and like they were made in haste. The action scenes with the shark are too few and they are generally devoid of tension, scares and suspense, ruined by unintentional humour, tameness, stupid goofiness and lack of sense, even when taking it for what it is meant to be. The story is as shallow and predictable as can be, with the pace dulling significantly outside of the shark action and indicative of padding out the already overlong by 15-20 minute running time. Faring worst is the script, which is even more atrocious than Bingbing Li's acting, bad enough to warrant a paragraph of its own. Far too much talk, very clumsy attempts at humour (unintentional and the cringe-worthy intentional), a good deal of waffle some of which adds nothing, a lot of ridiculousness and implausibility, excessive sentimentality, muddled and clunky scientific exposition and some of it perplexes in terms of clarity too.In summary, has good things but ruined primarily by the script. 4/10 Bethany Cox",The Meg
1,Leofwine_draca,Moderately entertaining,6,16 December 2018,"THE MEG is the latest movie in Hollywood's obsession with killer shark movies; this ranks beneath the likes of JAWS and even DEEP BLUE SEA, although it's moderately entertaining as a one-off watch. If you're looking for quality in the genre these days then I'd recommend going for the lower-budgeted likes of THE REEF or BAIT. THE MEG follows the fortunes of the crew of a scientific base in the middle of the ocean when they accidentally reawaken a megalodon from its prehistoric slumber; this massive shark proceeds to dominate and eat all and sundry. This is a co-production between Hollywood and China, so expect Chinese supporting actors and more than a little propaganda. Jason Statham does his action man routine with ease and is given able support from an up-for-it cast, while the action scenes are certainly larger-than-life, although with all the CGI they're hardly realistic. An undercurrent of humour makes some of the more ludicrous scenes easier to swallow. It's hardly great, but it does the job as a piece of switch-off-the-brain viewing.",The Meg
2,SnoopyStyle,first half ok,4,21 September 2018,"Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) leads an underwater rescue to a submarine. They are attacked by an unknown creature and he's forced to abandon two of his own men. He gets blamed by Dr. Heller from his team and withdraws into drinking in Thailand. Five years later, he is recruited to lead another underwater rescue. Billionaire Jack Morris (Rainn Wilson) has funded a deep water research to go beyond the deepest depths. Suyin Zhang (Li Bingbing) and her father lead the mission off the coast of China. Their submersible with three crew members are trapped after a creature attack.The first half is an underwater adventure. It's nothing great but at least, it's watchable. The second half has the movie and the shark coming to the surface. It rambles around and it stumbles to its cheesy finish. It would have been vastly better to make the whole movie about the deep water rescue mission and end the movie with the hot water jet escape. That's not to say the first half is any great filmmaking. The station is far too glossy and there are too many questionable issues. When Morris complained about the elevator, I'd rather have that type of dirty grime. It gives the movie inherent tension as if the station is ready to fall apart. All the hi-tech gloss works against that idea. Once the sharks get to the surface, their size is hard to gauge. There is one scene where the shark bites the station which shows the size but it's all lost when there is only the fin. This is half an ok movie and half a bad B-movie. It adds up to a rather flawed blockbuster.",The Meg
3,Prismark10,Sharknado,6,8 November 2018,"The Meg is a cheesy action film partly inspired by Jaws.Marine scientists have discovered a layer beneath the deepest part of the ocean in a project funded by an Elon Musk type tycoon Jack Morris (Rainn Wilson) off the coast in China. This uncharted deep layer of water contains marine life that has never been encountered including a long thought extinct giant shark from prehistoric times.When the underwater crew of the deep sea vessel are in danger; Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) is called to rescue. However as the crew ascend something has followed them up and starts to go on a gobbling mission.There are some shallow characters here straight from typecasting. Did the black guy had to be the annoyingly funny one with no discernible skills who could not swim?The film also suffers from horrendous editing, there are times the Megalodon rushes towards a vessel, is thwarted at the last second but the momentum would had meant it should had hit the boat.Yet it cannot be denied that there is something appealing and entertaining about the film. It is a fun B movie.",The Meg
4,claudio_carvalho,Brainless but Entertaining B-Movie,7,8 July 2021,"A team of scientists is sponsored by the millionaire Jack Morris (Rainn Wilson) to research the Mariana Trench in the facility Mana One in the Pacific Ocean under the command of Dr. Minway Zhang (Winston Chao). While visiting the facility, Morris witnesses the submarine commanded by Lori (Jessica McNamee) with two scientists attacked and trapped by a huge creature and soon they lose contact with the base. The manager James ""Mac"" Mackreides (Cliff Curtis) convinces the group to summon the rescue diver Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham), who was accused of leaving two members of his crew behind in a rescue operation in a submarine five years ago, and travels with Dr. Zhang to Thailand where Taylor leaves despite the protests of Dr. Heller (Robert Taylor) that participated also in of the former rescue mission. The reluctant Taylor accepts the assignment when he learns that his former wife Lori was piloting the submarine and heads with Mac and Zhang to Mana One. He befriends Dr. Zhang's daughter Suyin (Bingbing Li) and soon they all learn that a prehistorical predator Megalodon was released from the Mariana Trench and now endangering people on the nearby beaches.""The Meg"" is a brainless but entertaining B-movie directed by Jon Turteltaub. The plot recalls those old sci-fi films from the 50's with state-of-art special effects. Audiences that watch ""The Meg"" would neither expect an art house film nor an Oscar winner; therefore, the viewer sees a funny film with lots of action as expected. Many reviews are unfair. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Megatubarão"" (""Megashark"")",The Meg
5,nogodnomasters,That living fossil ate my friend!,7,27 August 2018,"Jason Statham vs a Megalodon is not a fair fight. They should have given Jason an artificial limb like Dwayne Johnson in ""Skyscraper"" to make the battle more even. A thermal layer keeps the megalodon at a depth lower than 11,000 feet. A private company violates that layer and releases Megalodon. In a scene, they entice Jason to help in order to rescue his ex-wife. Apparently, his relationship with his ex is a lot different than mine. I believe she is an alien as her liver is on her left side. Add a hot Asian chick and cute daughter for Asian audience appeal. I know nuclear subs cannot survive at 11,000 feet without being crushed. Not sure how effective you can enter the sub withing flooding it at that depth. Nor did I understand the paper filter respirators with a diving suit. It looked good but was more of a ""what is wrong with this picture"" type of scene. When it comes to Megalodons, it is okay to leave a man behind. Guide: no swearing, sex, or nudity.",The Meg
6,kosmasp,Deep Blue ... Meg,6,2 November 2018,"Now don't confuse this with the Asylum movie ""The Megalodon"". Which I guess is similar to this, but without Jason Statham and a rather smaller budget. Now since I haven't seen the ""cheaper"" version, I can't tell you how much fun it is. Asylum has done some interesting movies to say the least. Mostly copying the concept and not the whole (Hollywood) movie it is based on.Back to this, which is a whole lot of fun, even though they went the PG-13 route. I have to admit I was skeptical at first, but there is still violence, there is still death and there is even blood. So the bar on what can be shown might have been moved anyway. This might have been R-rated decades ago. It doesn't make much sense and there might be a touch too much drama and a weird love story patched on it, but overall it is what it is - you can't blame the movie if you don't like it is what I'm getting at. Watch it at own ""peril""",The Meg
7,Sleepin_Dragon,A film that makes refunds sound appealing.,4,10 August 2018,"What was I expecting, Jason Statham in a film about a monster shark, the Megaladon. Every stereotype I had expected came true here, plenty of siliness, some jumpy moments, and a few decent special effects. Sadly none of those could make for a decent film, it is nonsense from the start, the plot doesn't exactly exist. You watch the great Jaws and get subtlety, you watch this and get brash. The whole feel of the film is rather silly, it's produced in a way that makes you think they weren't taking it too seriously, despite Statham's valiant efforts. Hopefully this isn't the start of a series of Meg movies.Best part of thirty quid wasted.Disappointing, 4/10",The Meg
8,lee_eisenberg,"Oh Meggy, you're so dumb, you're so dumb you make me numb, hey Meggy!",5,11 July 2019,"Since it stars Jason Statham and focuses on a mammoth prehistoric shark, you can probably guess what sort of movie ""The Meg"" is. High action, lots of CGI, lines that sound scripted, and all manner of unrealistic things, the movie practically wears its corniness on its sleeve. If you expect that, then you won't be disappointed. If it's something intellectual that you're after, then your choice should be ""If Beale Street Could Talk"" or ""Capernaum"".As for ""Mickey"", I recognized it because ""Weird Al"" Yankovic spoofed Toni Basil's original song (his version was ""Ricky"", about ""I Love Lucy"").",The Meg
9,jboothmillard,The Meg,4,17 August 2018,"The shark movie has been an ongoing trend for the best part of 48 years, since the release of Jaws in 1975, it's been mixed results, from reasonable romps like Deep Blue Sea, The Shallows and 47 Meters Down, to awful absurdities like the Jaws sequels, and the Sharknado and Mega Shark series. Well, here came another B-movie featuring a shark to sink our teeth into, I debated whether to see it or not, but I took the plunge and had a ""Chomp on this"", directed by Jon Turteltaub (Cool Runnings, While You Were Sleeping, National Treasure). Basically rescue diver Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) attempts to save a group of scientists in a damaged nuclear submarine, but an unseen force damages the hull, he is unable to rescue a last survivor, at risk of killing everyone else, Dr. Heller (Robert Taylor) dismisses his story that a giant sea creature caused the disaster. Five years later, billionaire Jack Morris (Rainn Wilson) meets Dr. Minway Zhang (Winston Chao) at an underwater research facility called Mana One to oversee an exploration mission. The mission is to explore what may be an even deeper section of the Mariana Trench concealed by a cloud of hydrogen sulfide, forming a thermocline. The mission is being conducted by Lori (Jessica McNamee), Taylor's ex-wife, and scientists Toshi (Heroes' Masi Oka) and ""The Wall"" (Trapped star Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) in a submersible, it appears to be going well, until an unknown sea creature collides, causing the craft to crash and lose communication. Station crew member James ""Mac"" Mackreides (Cliff Curtis) suggests sending Taylor down to attempt a rescue, citing the similarity of this to his story. Despite Heller's objections, Zhang and Mac decide to travel to Thailand and recruit Taylor, while Dr. Zhang's daughter Suyin (Bingbing Li) attempts the rescue herself, taking another submersible and diving beneath the thermocline. Suyin's sub is caught by a gigantic squid, but it is taken off and eaten by the large creature, revealed to be a giant shark. Before the shark can return and attack Suyin, Taylor reaches her and the other sub, distracting the creature with flares. Suyin is ordered to return to Mana One, while Taylor reaches the damaged submersible, he saves Lori and The Wall, but the shark returns, Toshi sacrifices himself, closing the hatch door and diverting the attention of the shark. Back at the facility, the scientists determine that the shark is a Megalodon, a prehistoric shark, the largest known to mankind, thought to be extinct for millions of years. They then realise that the shark has escaped from the depths of the trench by swimming through a hole in the thermocline, breached by the submersible. The team work together to track and poison the Megalodon, or the Meg, with a large dose of etorphine, only to realise there is a second much larger Megalodon that emerges and attacks, killing The Wall, Heller, and Zhang. That night, Morris attempts to destroy the Megalodon himself, ordering a helicopter crew to drop charges on it, but he discovers the remains are that of a large whale, he ends up falling overboard into the water, and is killed by the shark. Taylor and the remaining Mana One crew resolve to track and kill the shark, realising it is en route to a crowded beach on the Sanya Bay in the Chinese mainland. The Meg kills several beachgoers, before the Mana One crew divert the shark's attention away from the crowd, using the loud audio of whale calls. Attempts to fire torpedoes at the Meg fail, Taylor and Suyin are chased around the Sanya Bay, until Taylor manages to cut the Megalodon's belly with his damaged sub and stabs it in the eye. Other smaller sharks devour the Meg, finally killing it, Taylor and the others rejoice, he and Suyin consider taking a vacation. Also starring Shuya Sophia Cai as Meiying, Ruby Rose as Jaxx and Page Kennedy as DJ. Statham does his predictable tough-guy fine, and the supporting cast are all fine as well, this is nothing we haven't seen before, a giant shark causing chaos in the oceans and near beaches, it just means more advanced special effects to bring it all life, blood and guts, and some cheesy dialogue, not much bite, just simple popcorn-fodder, a silly but fun science-fiction thriller. Okay!",The Meg
10,Tweekums,Jason Statham vs a giant prehistoric shark!,7,18 August 2020,"During the prologue we see protagonist Jonas Taylor attempting to rescue the crew of a submarine that has sunk at a great depth. He manages to rescue some of the survivors but loses some of his team when the sub is 'attacked' by an unknown creature. Five years later when an exploration vessel, piloted by Jonas's ex-wife is similarly attacked and stranded he is called in to lead the rescue. He is flown to the oceanic research facility his ex is based and leads the rescue. It looks as if things will be okay but something has followed them from the depths... a magalodon! That is an eighty foot shark thought to have been extinct for millennia. The crew of the station will have to find a way to kill the shark before it can become a threat to anything in the water.I went into this with mixed expectations; on the one hand Jason Statham movies are almost always fun and on the other the concept seemed like an inferior 'Jaws'... both of these expectations turned out to be true; it is fun but certainly more than a little cliché. Statham impressed as Taylor, and the rest of the cast were solid enough; notably Li Bingbing as Suyin. The film does start well; the rescue mission is fairly exciting and first glimpses of the megalodon are impressive... the clichés begin just as everybody things they are safe. Several scenes will remind viewers of similar ones in 'Jaws'; and make them remember just how great that film was in comparison to this (and every other shark attack movie). On the plus side the effects were pretty good and there is no material that is likely to offend anybody... it isn't even particularly gory. Overall I wouldn't call this a must see but it is fun enough if you are a fan of Jason Statham or like shark movies.",The Meg
11,BA_Harrison,"Not quite a megalodon't, but not the mega success I had hoped for.",5,8 November 2019,"I first saw Jaws in 1975 at the tender age of seven; it scared the hell out of me then, and is an exhilarating ride to this day. The Meg, on the other hand, is a formulaic, big-budget B-movie that fails to get the pulse pounding, despite it's prehistoric shark being three times as big as Bruce, Spielberg's iconic great white.Jason Statham stars as deep-sea rescue expert Jonas Taylor, who is brought to a high-tech facility to help save three scientists who have become trapped in a sub at the bottom of the sea after being attacked by something unseen. Jonas's mission results in the successful extraction of two of the boffins (one of whom is his ex-wife), but in doing so, he releases a very hungry Megalodon from the depths.Directed by Jon Turteltaub (Cool Runnings, National Treasure), The Meg is slick but completely vapid popcorn entertainment that proves that bigger isn't necessarily better. The plot offers few surprises and little in the way of imagination, and Statham is his usual stoic self, indistinguishable from any of his other movie roles. Bingbing Li adds a bit of glamour as pretty scentist Suyin (this is an American/Chinese co-production, so the film features plenty of Asian actors) and Rainn Wilson is fun as billionaire Morris (destined to become shark fodder), but most of the cast are forgettable. As far as the other stars are concerned - the Megs (for there are more than one) - they are fairly impressive CGI creations, but this being a 12A certificate, their attacks don't result in anything too graphic.As a big fan of shark movies, I had such high hopes when The Meg was first announced; what a shame that the finished film is so unremarkable and lacking in bite.",The Meg
12,paul_haakonsen,There's always a bigger fish...,7,19 August 2018,"We'll definitely need a bigger boat, oh wait, wrong movie...Right, well lets just be blunt about this, you know exactly what you are getting yourself into here when you venture in to watch a movie such as ""The Meg"". But still, it was something that called out to me and made me venture to the cinema to watch it.First of all, it is a shark movie. And I am a sucker for creature features, and I have always enjoyed shark movies ever since ""Jaws"". But unfortunately the genre is flooded with subpar movies that do sharks no justice with horrible CGI or multiple heads, swimming in sand, and what not... But it turned out that ""The Meg"" was going to correct all that and put the genre back on track.Secondly, it has Jason Statham in it. So you know that you will be in for an action-packed movie. And yes, he delivered as usual. In fact, this might as well have been a movie that had Dwayne Johnson in the lead, and it would still have been an enjoyable movie.While ""The Meg"" does follow that generic and straight forward formula of 'how-to-make-a-shark-movie' then it was still an enjoyable movie experience; one that was packed with action, suspense and a pinch of drama. The movie starts out slow and fairly steadily, and of course you don't get to see the shark right away, because suspense had to be built up. But we all knew it was coming, so why prolong the suspense by throwing another aquatic creature in the audience's faces?This is the type of movie that you exactly how it will end. And it was that predictable, yes. But again, that was not a factor that weighed the movie down or worked against in any fashion. Because the movie was entertaining from start to end.I will say that Jason Statham was actually quite nice in the movie, because he fit the role of the Jonas Taylor character quite well. And I was also quite impressed with the performances of Bingbing Li (playing Suyin), Cliff Curtis (playing Mac) and Winston Chao (playing Zhang).The special effects were incredible, as they should be in a movie such as this. And this is where 90% of the movies in the monstrous killer shark movie fail, by having laughable special effects that wouldn't even fool a blind man. The sharks looked realistic and real, not to mention menacing.I do feel that the beach scene was horribly shortened and made almost family friendly. That whole thing with the heroes managing to lure the megalodon away from the meal that was lined right up in the nick of time was just lazy writing. I felt so cheated out of a scene that would have and should have turned into a feeding frenzy and massacre of beach-goers. But hey, a matter of how morbid you are, I suppose...All in all a very enjoyable shark movie, and one that definitely takes the sinking shark genre and brings it back to the surface. I definitely think that your money, time and efforts will be well spent on taking the time to watch ""The Meg"".",The Meg
13,BandSAboutMovies,It's just OK.,6,19 December 2018,"Is it a stretch to believe that the maker of this giant shark movie also directed 3 Ninjas, While You Were Sleeping and Cool Runnings? I guess anyone can make anything and Jon Turteltaub lives up to that. But we're here to talk sharks. And this flick has a big one - a 75-foot long megalodon, a prehistoric shark through long extinct. The trailers and posters for this one whipped audiences into a frenzy as it seemed like non-stop giant shark action was about to swim onto summer screens. We finally saw it once it hit blu ray and are ready to share our thoughts.
Based on Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror by Steve Alten, this sat in development hell for over a decade before finally getting an approved script a few years ago. Eli Roth was originally going to direct but dropped out over artistic differences.A few years ago, Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) was trying to save the team of a sunken nuclear submarine when an unknown creature attacks. Taylor is forced to leave two divers behind to save the rest of the crew and is blamed for their deaths by teammate Dr. Heller (Robert Taylor, Agent Jones from The Matrix and Longmire from, well, Longmire) as he belives that Taylor has gone mad from pressure-induced psychosis.Billionaire Jack Morrie (Rainn Wilson) has financed Mana One, an underwater research facility, with Dr. Minway Zhang and his daughter Suyin. Their goal is to explore a deep section of the Mariana trench that has been covered by a thermocline frozen cloud. A submarine piloted by Toshi (Masi Oka, Hiro from Heroes), The Wall and Taylor's ex-wife Lori try to penetrate the trench, but are attacked by an unknown creature and their vehicle is lifeless on the ocean floor.James ""Mac"" Mackreides suggested that they get Taylor down there, as its very similar to his last mission. When they meet him in Thailand, all he wants to do is drink and stay lost until he learns that his ex is in danger. Meanwhile, Suyin takes her own sub to try and rescue them before a giant squid nearly crushes her craft, being saved at the last minute by a massive shark.Toshi sacrifices himself to save the crew and when they get to the surface, all of Taylor's stories of a mysterious shark suddenly sound a lot more plausible. Oh yeah - Suyin also has a young daughter named Meiying who comes face to face with the Megalodon, which they soon catch.But yes, you guessed it, there's a catch (sorry, punny today) and another even bigger shark attacks their ship, eating that dead giant shark and nearly all of the crew, minus the two I didn't mention, Jaxx Heard (Ruby Rose) and comic relief DJ (Page Kennedy).The elder Zhang dies of injuries and Morris claims that he's alerted local governments and naval forces, then evacuates the crew. However, he's really trying to kill the shark for himself to save his company from lawsuits. If you guessed that he gets killed himself, you've been paying attention to shark movies. Big points to him for trying to blow up the shark, as we know that usually works 100% of the time. However, this shark is so smart that it uses a whale as camoflauge. Yep. A super smart monster shark from the past.You'd think with a premise like that this would be more exciting. And it's fine - but maybe I've been spoiled by completely goofy exploitation versions of shark movies. Once the beast makes its way to a crowded beach, I was hoping for some carnage, but it's nowhere near the scope of insanity that I was hoping for.That said - the ending where multiple sharks attack the Megalodon is pretty awesome. But I was kind of hoping for that level of inventiveness throughout. I did kind of like the nod to Jaws with the fat child asking his mom if he could go swimming, as well as the fast version of the classic theme that played while Suyin was in the shark cage. Also, when the crew watches the presentation of the Megalodon, it looks like Matt Hooper is in the photo of the shark's jaws. There are also kids riding a banana boat just like Jaws 4, which is one of Becca's favorite movies ever in defiance of the rest of humanity. There's even a dog named Pippin, much like Pippit from Spielberg's film. And the biggest Jaws cue is that the sound of the Megalodon dying is the same as Jaws (and the truck in Duel) meeting its maker.They definitely set up a sequel here, but this was one expensive movie. With a production budget of around $175 million and a $140 million marketing spend, it needs a lot of money worldwide to break even. That said - it's obvious how much of this film was created to appeal to the burgeoning Chinese market for American films.",The Meg
14,Coventry,"If you go over the top, you might as well do it properly!",6,6 January 2019,"I guess ""The Meg"" proved once and for all that yours truly is an illiterate cinematic monkey and a culture barbarian in general! My wife and I started our Friday night by watching ""La La Land"", but this widely acclaimed multiple Oscar winner and alleged masterpiece bored and irritated me from the very first moments. I was so pleased that my wife kept falling asleep (not sure if she was also bored, or just tired) and eventually told me I could watch something else. I went straight for ""The Meg"", and - yes - I do prefer this dumb and shlocky piece of shark-horror over pretentious and fake feelgood musicals! The moto of director Jon Turteltaub and his crew must have been: ""if we are going over the top, we might as well do it properly! Why make another movie about a dull 15ft Great White shark if you can also work with a prehistoric 70ft Megalodon!? So far, this extinct species of mega-shark only appeared in cheap and insignificant B-movies so far, produced by The Asylum or other moron companies, but this is the Meg's very first stardom role in a hyper-expensive summer blockbuster, with a stellar cast and based on a profitable series of novels by Steve Alten. Quite frankly, I don't fathom all the hatred against ""The Meg"". Nobody honestly expected to see the most qualitative and tense shark thriller since ""Jaws"", right? Obviously, the script is heavily flawed. The characters do and say the dumbest things at the most inappropriate moments, but isn't that mandatory in pulpy monster flicks? Some roles, notably Rain Wilson, are walking & talking stereotypes, but simply every ""Jaws"" clone requires an ignorant authority figure. Call me crazy, but I enjoy brainless popcorn movies where people are shouting stuff like ""There's something down here"" or ""Everybody out of the water"", especially since most of the other summer blockbusters nowadays are either Marvel Superhero movies or Transformer spin-offs. The humongous shark, the special effects and the underwater set designs look impressive, which I reckon is normal regarding the enormous budget of the film, but still. Jason Statham remains, hands down, the most awesome and plausible action hero of this decade. He even keeps his cool when he's halfway vanished into the throat of a shark, but please don't ask him to flirt with a Cantonese beauty, because that looks embarrassing.",The Meg
15,michaelRokeefe,One large predator,5,1 January 2019,"An international research crew is in deep trouble when their submersible is force to the bottom of the Pacific by a massive shark. Not just a huge shark, but one that previously has been thought to be extinct. Expert deep sea rescue diver Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) is hired by a wealthy oceanographer (Rainn Wilson) to save the crew and stop any more threats from the 75-foot-long menace known as the Megalodon. A very predictable spectacle to go along with your typical movie theater treats. Not much of a dialogue, plenty of over acting and one ginormous shark.",The Meg
16,hitchcockthelegend,Child friendly horror...,5,25 May 2019,"You have to take in to context the post release statements by director Jon Turteltaub and lead actor Jason Statham. The Meg is not the film they either read on the page or filmed as a course of grisly schlock entertainment. This was meant to be a proper schlocker, a bloodletting monster of the deep on the loose picture, sadly the suits at the helm didn't see that as a viable money making exercise and had this cut to be a ""12"" friendly bums on theatre seats cash grabber. Shame on them.What we get is a run of the mill creature feature that although once viewed does not leave a lasting impression (was anyone really hoping for that anyway?), but is kind of fun in that time filling sort of way. It runs through the modern day creature feature playbook 101. So off we go with the hero having a troubled backstory, a money made funder out of his depth, ladies with life quandaries, a man who can't swim working in the middle of the ocean! and on we go. Throw in some quite awfully scripted dialogue and it's cheese sarnie time.Statham is nearly always a good watch - in the muscle bound action hero kind of way - though you see the cracks between what the film was meant to be and what it ended up as. For you see that The Stath comes off as taking it all too seriously, which in this released cut is ridiculous. He's surrounded by no mark actors, though no short supply of beauty (Bingbing Li socko gorgeous/Ruby Rose hard sexy) and the narrative feeds us all the pointers of exactly where this will end up. There's a couple of nifty fun homages to Jaws, some decent suspense scenes, and the cinematography (Tom Stern) is pin sharp and pleasurable.Best bet to enjoy this is to know it's a ""12"" rated friendly piece, to understand it has ultimately ended up as a same old same old monster movie. It's a million miles away from the class of Jaws, and lacks the tongue in cheek knowing of Deep Blue Sea, but it fills a gap in that undemanding time wasting way. 5/10",The Meg
17,Hey_Sweden,You're gonna need a MUCH bigger boat.,6,4 February 2019,"The popular Steve Alten novel gets adapted for the big screen in what can only be described as a Mega-budget, Mega-stupid, Mega-movie. The Stath (a.k.a. action star Jason Statham) stars as Jonas Taylor, a deep-sea rescue expert who has the death of friends & co-workers on his conscience. So he's turned to drink and seclusion, naturally. Still, he's the best chance to rescue some of the scientists from a massive underwater research base near Chinese waters. The culprit in the movie is the ""Meg"", short for Megalodon, an ENORMOUS prehistoric (and supposedly extinct) species of shark.You get what you expect with this kind of entertainment. Somehow sharks as animal antagonists always lend themselves to the cheesiest kind of movies (and special effects) imaginable. This is no different, really, despite the hefty Hollywood production values and the location shooting in New Zealand. You have standard-issue characters, some of whom are so excessively idiotic that you keep rooting for the monster to devour them. You have a VERY cliched script, full of bad, cornball dialogue.The film could have worked as sort of a grand-scale goof on such material, but as it is, the filmmakers, led by Jon Turteltaub (""National Treasure""), actually take themselves pretty seriously for a while. It's only near the end when they completely give in to true over the top nonsense, as the Meg finds a ton of brain dead expendable extras upon which to snack. Still, this movie IS entertaining: slickly made stuff that does manage to generate some great near-miss thrills. And the special effects here are actually not quite as terrible as you would think. But the movie probably would have kicked a little more ass had it not been neutered in the end in order to get a PG-13 rating (and therefore attempt to maximize profit).For the most part, The Stath does what he usually does, although he gets some opportunities to try some real acting. Bingbing Li is an enticing leading lady. Cliff Curtis (no stranger to aquatic creature features, having done ""Deep Rising"" previously) is typically solid as one of the smarter supporting characters, Winston Chao is good as Li's egghead father, and Shuya Sophia Cai is appealing as her daughter. Rainn ""Dwight Schrute"" Wilson has his moments as an unsubtle, obnoxious billionaire who you just KNOW is going to turn out to be truly odious.Enjoyable for what it is, but absolutely nothing special, it may still put a goofy smile on some peoples' faces.Six out of 10.",The Meg
18,CinemaSerf,Meg-a-don't!,5,26 November 2019,"This is such a hybrid of so many other films, it is hard to be objective when writing about it. The obvious comparisons are with ""Jaws"" and ""Deep Blue Sea"" but this is a distinctly poor relation.

Can't wait for the sequel....",The Meg
19,zardoz-13,"Big Shark, Small Saga",5,28 August 2018,"""Jaws"" for the ""SpongeBob"" generation, ""The Meg"" (** OUT OF ****) proves bigger isn't always better when it comes to atmospheric suspense and a bloodthirsty R-rating. ""National Treasure"" director Jon Turteltaub and ""Life of Pi"" scenarist Dean Georgaris with ""Battleship"" co-scripters Jon & Eric Hoeber have expunged all vestiges of horror from Steve Alten's twenty-year old bestseller ""The Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror"" and pared it down to broad essentials with a wholesome PG-13 rating. Moments that would have benefited from those deplorable, but effective jump scares are nowhere to be experienced. ""The Meg"" does manage with its $130 million budget to attain an aura of credibility. The people who made ""The Meg"" don't exploit the camp factor like The Syfy Channel's preposterous, so-awful-it's-good ""Sharknado"" franchise. The Megsters are playing everything for authentic thrills. Victims are eaten without buckets of blood. Indeed, you can see only one victim in the Meg's attack on a popular Asian beach. The leviathan glides beneath hundreds of sun bathers elbow-to-elbow without munching them. In Alten's novel, a surfer swerved his board into the Meg's gaping maw. Admittedly, the 3-D effects add a modest dimension, but not enough to make you dread each appearance of the Carcharocles Megalodon like ""Jaws"" with its Great White shark. Principally, 'the chomp' constitutes a fundamental element in any scary shark movie. Sadly, we never see anybody chomped the way the Great White in ""Jaws"" chomped Robert Shaw. A scene does occur which imitates Samuel L. Jackson's demise in ""Deep Blue Sea"" when the shark chomped him 'air jaws' style.Jonas Tyler (Jason Statham of ""The Expendables"") rescues eleven sailors stranded in a sunken submarine in an early scene in ""The Meg"" before some mysterious battering ram of sorts implodes the hull. Jonas believes a prehistoric shark may have destroyed the sub. He faces reprimands galore, particularly from the sub's doctor, Heller (Robert Taylor of TV's ""Longmire""), who labels him a coward as well as a lunatic. Jonas argues everyone would have died if he'd gone back after the two remaining sailors. Heller is adamant about Jonas' cowardice. In a rare exception to the rule, the magnitude of the film's opening gambit overshadows the novel's first scene where Jonas-suffering from too many hours on duty--reacts suddenly to the appearance of a Megalodon. Reacting in panic, our overwrought oceanographer blew ballast and his deep-water aquatic sub ascended to the surface like a Polaris missile. Miraculously, Jonas survived the encounter, while his two scientific colleagues perished in the process. Afterward, when Jonas swore he saw a Megalodon, his incredulous superiors refused to swallow his saga about the prehistoric predator and discredited him as well as court-martialed him despite evidence that proved what his story. A rival Navy officer tampered with the evidence and tossed a Meg tooth--wedged in the underwater Naval craft--overboard. A situation similar to the novel occurs when oceanographers are trapped at the bottom of the sea and a Megalodon attacked because their lights exacerbated the creature in its habitat that lies far beneath what was thought to be the bottom of the ocean. As it turns out, there is more ocean below a layer of hydrogen sulfide that forms a thermocline. Billionaire Jack Morris (grossly miscast comic actor Rainn Wilson of ""Galaxy Quest"") has erected a state-of-the-art underwater research facility code-named Mana One to study those lower depths of the briny blue. The entire set-up looks like something out of a James Bond movie. Dr. Minway Zhang (Winston Chao of ""The Wedding Banquet"") and his colleagues are studying heretofore unexplored depths of the Marianas Trench. The lady-in-charge, Lori (Jessica McNamee of ""CHIPs""), is piloting a submersible with Zhang's son, Toshi (Masi Oka of TV's ""Heroes""), and an obese guy called 'The Wall' (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson of ""Contraband""), when an unknown force smashes into them and disables their craft. James ""Mac"" Mackreides (Cliff Curtis of ""Training Day"") convinces Dr. Zhang that the only man who can get his son and their colleagues out of the trench is his old friend, Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham), and they recruit the reluctant diver, who had vowed to never descend again. Although Jonas rescues them, the thermocline dissipates enough for the 75-foot Megalodon to escape and terrorize the world.Basically, if you've read the gruesome novel, as I did recently, you're going to be appalled that the writers have eliminated the best scenes. The characters and the cover-up that gave the novel momentum as well as a long-standing feud between the Navy and the protagonist who had been summarily drummed out of the service for panicking during an incident in the Marianas Trench are AWOL. The filmmakers have altered significantly the Nautilus scene where the Meg pummeled the iconic sub into submission. Instead, they use a sub earlier in the action than a wrecked submersible for Jason Statham's opening scene where a doctor accuses Jonas of cowardice. Not surprisingly, the novel ""The Meg"" surpasses the ""The Meg"" movie.Combine this wannabe ""Jaws"" with ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,"" and you've got this tolerable nonsense. Incredibly, the Megalodon shark plays second fiddle to Jason Statham and the diverse cast. Statham swam with the British National Diving Team and finished 12th in the World Championships in 1992. At age 51, he looks at home in the drink. Hard as it is to believe, the scenes between Statham and the members of an ocean-going shark think-tank generate more interest than the scenes with the runaway shark. Mind you, the CGI is far better than it should be for a B-movie epic, but nothing about the Megalodon is as remotely creepy as the Great White shark in ""Jaws"" or comparably the revenge-mind killer whale in ""Orca."" If you cannot find ""Jaws,"" then ""Deep Blue Sea,"" ""The Shallows,"" and ""47 Meters Down"" would make worthy substitutes if you're disposed to postpone until ""The Meg' swims into home video. Altogether, ""The Meg"" is a polished sea monster yarn that lacks bite.",The Meg
20,grantss,Incredibly unoriginal and predictable but still reasonably entertaining,5,2 June 2019,"A group of scientists is exploring the Marianas Trench, the deepest point on the ocean. When some of them get trapped several kilometres below sea level they call in the best underwater rescue person there is, Jonas Taylor. His skills are to be tested to the limit as waiting at the bottom of the ocean is a believed long-extinct monster shark from the prehistoric era, the Megalodon.Just from the plot summary you know this movie is going to be incredibly unoriginal and derivative, and, it is, in spades. Reminded me a lot of Deep Blue Sea: scientists somehow think that studying a ferocious man-eating monster at close range is somehow a good idea, a clueless billionaire patron who doesn't care about risks and just wants the prestige, your usual dial-a-hero, deaths on cue, the several lives of the monster, just about every creature-horror cliché. This has all of those.Yet it is reasonably entertaining and almost works. There's some decent humour, usually provided by Rainn Wilson as the billionaire or the kid.

However, the filmmakers at the always eponymous Warner Bros. use THE MEG to warn us that both of these assumptions are likely fallacies. Just as a man-made thermal updraft allows a couple of megs to escape the methane barrier imprisoning them for eons, Warner seems to be suggesting that the Devil's Disciples toiling for the Kremlin's Red Commie KGB have unleashed the noxious hot air of a vicious buffoon to resurrect Lucifer from the Gates of Hell to preside in America's once Hallowed Oval Office. By depicting ""Jonas Taylor"" as initially stymied in his attempts to eradicate the monsters chewing up his friends, Warner's allegory warns us that it will be very difficult to impeach a Game-Show-Host-in-Chief just because he's Possessed by Satan. Is Warner literally prescribing depth charges and heavy artillery to deal with this current threat to the USA's very survival? That's a tough one to answer for those lacking the time to watch Shark Week. In any event, Citizens should be thankful that Warner is helping us through our current travails with THE MEG.",The Meg

24,view_and_review,Should've Been More Fun,5,29 April 2019,"I certainly liked the way this movie started. There was a tease of things to come and the characters all seemed likable: even the eccentric hipster billionaire.An expensive research center and research team is somewhere in the ocean not too far from China. They've discovered possibly the deepest part of the ocean that's hidden beneath a layer of hydrogen sulfide. Beneath this layer of extremely cold gas is where they run into the meg. The meg was happy as a clam in its hidden world until some nosy researchers intruded upon it. Now it must break free and feast upon the new world.I was OK with all of that. If that's how we get to see a megalodon in action, so be it. But then the movie fell into some tired tropes. The two most abominable were the a-hole billionaire and the superfluous destruction.I cannot name the movies where the rich guy is the jerk. It's almost like: he has money so he must be a bad guy. Like every single rich person is a worm because how else would he have gotten rich? It's so played out. Please try something else.And the gratuitous destruction to enhance the drama is old as well. Like: ""They may actually be safe, or this plan may actually work. Let's foul something up to create more deaths and/or make things a bit more hairy."" Sometimes plans don't work and sometimes people die but don't make the reason be because of some impossibly rare occurrence.Like all action movies there were your heroes and goats. That never determines who lives or dies, it just determines how significant your death will be in the case you do die. They made a few too many deaths overly tragic and overly courageous. You're doing a movie about a 90 foot shark, you're not getting an Oscar for it so enough of the dramatic death scenes. The Meg is supposed to be fun with a high death toll nothing more.",The Meg

Fortunately, it swallows people who rather than chomping them into graphic little bits, but still...Act 1 is deep sea darkness, but Act 2 onwards plays merrily with all the Jaws tropes as a fin the size of a bus cuts through the sea.Jason Statham is as physical as usual, swims well, and introduces some winning charm into the mix, particularly in his interaction with female lead Li Bingbing's daughter. There are some mildly familiar faces in the cast - Rain Wilson is the mildly corrupt big business boss, Cliff Curtis is the chief scientist.But what do the cast matter? This is all about an enormous shark scooping up people from the preposterously deep tourist bay like a whale scooping up plankton.

26,Uriah43,Not Great but Better Than Most Others of this Sort,6,7 January 2021,"This film essentially begins at a deep sea research facility in the Pacific Oceans which is owned by a billionaire by the name of ""Jack Morris"" (Rainn Wilson) who has come to check out his new enterprise for the first time. While there he happens to witness first-hand a miniature submarine carrying a crew of three scientists as they explore the bottom of the ocean. All of a sudden they are attacked by a huge creature which damages the sub and renders it incapable of returning to the surface. Realizing the immense difficulties that a rescue effort of this kind would entail one of the managers suggests the immediate hiring of a rescue diver by the name of ""Jonas Taylor"" (Jason Statham) who is residing in Thailand and was involved in a similar incident five years ago. Although he initially declines, he changes his mind when he is informed that his ex-wife ""Lori Taylor"" (Jessica McNamee) is one of the people in the mini-sub. What he doesn't know is that the giant shark swimming in the area just happens to be a megalodon which many people believe to have been extinct for over 2 million years-and it is very hungry. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that there have been a number of films featuring this extinct creature and that includes one that was released the exact same year titled ""Megalodon."" Having viewed both of them recently I can safely say that ""The Meg"" is definitely the better of the two. For starters, it wasn't apparently rushed into production and as a result didn't contain a multitude of basic errors prevalent in the other. Likewise, the budget wasn't nearly as limited which allowed for better CGI and a superior cast.

28,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Fantastically enjoyable mainstream creature feature,9,12 January 2019,"After a submarine accident in the middle of the ocean, a former diver is called upon to rescue the trapped crew only to find the cause that trapped them was a giant prehistoric megalodon shark that has now escaped into the world's oceans forcing him to track down the creature and stop it.For the most part, this was an enjoyable mainstream creature feature. One of the biggest attributes here is the strong mainstream qualities afforded to the film. Not only is the overall look and feel of the film, including the sleek and slick layouts of the underwater research station as well as the high-end special effects work all create a fantastically enjoyable entry. That effects work, featuring stellar shots of the underwater sea-life in the grotto and the titular sharks all being enjoyable enough to really like here. That also helps out considerably with the action scenes here. The rescue attempt requiring the two boats to get the crew out of the creatures' lair offers the kind of explosive action sequence that really works, while the initial attack on the station features some chilling moments. The lead attack on the first shark manages plenty of open water fun in the matter of tactics employed against it as they dive in the cage or tracking it with the restraining equipment which brings about the eventual method of capturing the first specimen in a fun, exciting manner. The last half of the film, though, is where this really wins out. The action in this section is far grander and much more spectacular, including the stellar sequence of the second shark making it's appearance to the crew as well as the ensuing race to stop it before it disappears. The beach attack is absolutely spectacular and wholly enjoyable with the scenes of the shark swimming through the sea of humanity attacking the support buildings or the various beachgoers there before leading into the over-the-top battle to finally put the creature down, resulting in a full-on spectacular battle to do so. These here are what manage to hold this one up over it's few flaws. The only real issue to be had with this one is the simplistic story that brings about a series of intense cliches. It's way too familiar with what's going to happen here which keeps things going along at a steady pace due to hitting all the familiar beats and plot-points, from the rescue attempts being pulled off at the last minute to the characters kept out of danger simply by their billing and rendering the encounters with them as quite bland. The idea of the second shark getting free and coming up only once the first one is defeated also feels rather lackluster due to being such a common trope of the scene. As well, the ending is a little anticlimactic that offers up a solid idea but is somewhat of a letdown in terms of storyline catharsis compared to what came before. These here are the film's few issues.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy.",The Meg
29,Aaron1375,Nice to see a shark movie in the theater for a change,8,19 August 2018,"These days, what constitutes as a shark movie is lame films on the scy-fy channel usually involving some stupid premise such as the shark being a ghost, a weather event or some other premise that just screams, not serious and not good. This one though, was a nice way to end the summer movie season as it is not great, but still a fun time at the theater. What is more fun than a big shark terrorizing the oceans as Jason Statham tries to track it down and kill it? Not much! The story has Statham as a rescue diver who had trouble with his last dive as something seemed to be crushing in the submarine he was trying to get people off of. Five years passed and he is considered crazy. A group find there way to a strange underwater realm beyond a strange mixture that keeps the sea life in the chasm separated from the rest of the sea. A group makes their way to this area only to be attacked by something and soon Statham's character is called upon to undertake this rescue operation and soon a huge shark is found. It makes its way past the natural barrier thanks to a fluke and soon this shark is terrorizing the ocean! The main problem I had with this movie is the cast. Other than Statham, the little girl and the shark, the rest of the actors and actresses were total crap! The rest of them aside from the badass, the child and the shark may as well been starring in one of those crummy films found on the Sy-Fy Channel! Thankfully, Statham makes this movie a lot better and the shark looks a lot better than anything seen on the aforementioned station.So despite the problematic acting, this film was pretty good. Kind of reminds me of Rampage with Dwayne Johnson as that one had a similar problem in that the acting beyond the Rock and the monsters was very sub par, but still a good movie and both of these movies were better than Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Still cannot wrap my mind around how that one's script got approved.

All I got was the same repetitive pattern occurring on a loop; a dangerous predicament, close call rescue, self-sacrifice and a lot splashing about (or better put constantly falling from boats into) the ocean. Now repeat. Sadly I found little tension, or excitement derived from these set-pieces, which would cut-away when you think it was going to deliver something big and causing everything to come to a grinding halt.

I've got to sense something really going on beneath the surface to venture out to a cinema to see it, and alas, on its theatrical release, The Meg just failed to do this. Now I've caught up with it on Netflix, and while it's fine as a distraction piece, I think I made the right decision where to catch it.Jason Statham has always had a real 'take him or leave him' effect on me (although he was one of the main components of Snatch) and his inability to really create a solid type of genre staple really doesn't help, and so he never made it any more appealing. And that leaves us with the film itself, which is aesthetically pleasing, with some spectacular underwater visuals, shark effects and action sequences, but with wooden characters you never really care about, a stale, predictable script and a mounting sense of preposterousness, that's to be expected, but is nonetheless an issue.I'm glad I took my time getting round to this overlong, overblown but underwhelming Jaws tribute act.

37,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Smile, you son-of-a...",6,13 August 2018,"'The Meg (2018)' feels incredibly long and poorly paced, continuing to push past several seemingly finale-perfect set-pieces with little thought to overall structure or appropriate escalation. It's because of this that it starts to outstay its welcome perhaps sooner than you'd expect, becoming quite repetitive and boring during its second act especially. Somehow, it manages to push past this problem for a brief window when it decides to get somewhat sillier than before - finally letting the 'Stath' go mono a mono with the eponymous 'Meg' - and it manages to provide those overtly tongue-in-cheek pleasures it feels as though it's been aching to provide since its opening moments. Still, it's not quite a schlocky 'syfy channel' shark movie-of-the-week, since there are several moments that have a little more heart than you'd think and its big-budget has clearly been put to good use (the cinematography and CGI are both generally really impressive), and I don't think it was ever even intended to be a throw-away, 'so bad it's good' affair, just one that appeals to the widest possible market. This all means that more attention seems to have been paid to the plot's distinctly science-fiction set-up and that there are even some standard but appreciated themes - such as 'man (or science) versus nature' and the more character-focused 'lives lost versus lives saved' - that allow for a feeling of competence, if not exactly passion, to ring throughout the picture. Sadly, though, Statham is perhaps the worst (by which I mean least cohesive) core player for quite some time. He seems to be in a different flick to the others, one that's just as hammy as his line-delivery, but at least he's having fun. Surprisingly, so are we (for the most part). 6/10",The Meg
38,bowmanblue,Mega fun,7,2 October 2018,"I always feel that the best films always ask questions of their audiences. 'The Meg' poses a real 'thinker' of a conversation piece in, 'Who would win out of a fight between a prehistoric, giant shark and Jason Statham?' Actually, it's not much of a brainteaser - I think we all know that it would take more than an aquatic, hungry dinosaur to stop 'The Stath.' But it's still fun to watch the fight go down.Yes, our very own British hardman Jason Statham plays, er, well kind of the same character he always does, but with one important twist - this time he's in the water! Anyway, he's a diver (sort of) who rescues people. Then he loses a load of people to Davey Jones' Locker and retired. Then a load of other people get stuck at the bottom of the ocean and - guess what - he's the only bald man who can get them out of their watery grave. And then a giant shark starts eating people.Come on... you've seen the posters and the marketing for this movie. What are you expecting? Something deep and meaningful with great dialogue and moving character arcs that question the very nature of human existence? No, if you're thinking about watching this then you basically like daft, fun B-movie-esque films which are just there to entertain. And entertain you this will.The Stath is the only real character you'll care about, however fans of the American 'Office' will probably recognise Rainn Wilson, as the billionaire who owns the ocean base most of the action centres around. The other characters are - predictably - there to, quite literally, dangle themselves in the path of rows of huge teeth.Before I watched 'The Meg' I did see a lot of other reviews mention how it was a bit 'tonally' all over the place. Now, I do have to agree. The film is at its best when it's not taking itself seriously and knows that it's just a daft (and yet epic) B-movie of a monster. However, there are parts where it does try to exceed its reach and inject some heavy drama into the action. This just feels a bit forced and could have been taken out so that the audience just either laughs OR cries, rather than trying to work the two in together.It's basically a B-movie with a budget that's been (cleverly?) marketed as an A-list outing. And it seems to have worked. It's great fun and hopefully there are schools more aquatic terrors for The Stath to punch squarely in the face. Leave the logical part of your brain at the door and just enjoy this for what it is.",The Meg

What else do you need for a fun flick. While this was no master piece, it was still fun to watch. The shark effects were pretty good, not awful like the movies on the sci fi channel. And how can you not love a scene in which someone jumps in the water with a 100 ft shark looking to hit it with a tracker, or inject poison. The final death scene of the meg was cool too. But the smaller sharks were worse CGI effects.FINAL VERDICT: If you love sharks, this is a must watch. It's fun and entertaining.",The Meg

41,CuriosityKilledShawn,Nothing like the novel,3,20 August 2018,"And the award for Biggest Disappointment of the Decade goes to...After 21 years in development hell this drivel is the best that they could manage? Really? I realize that it is hard to make a serious shark movie in a sub-genre now contaminated by spoofs and mockbusters but even Jaws 3 is better than this. Statham vs Shark could have been an entertaining movie, instead it's an extremely boring one.Jason Statham is Jonas Taylor (this character name and the nature of the beast are the only things retained from the novel, I am not kidding) a diving/underwater guy (his exact occupation is never disclosed, but in the novel he's a palaeontologist and a marine biologist) who encounters a big shark one day and no one believes him. Flash-forward a while and said shark attacks a craft exploring the bottom of the ocean in the Mariana Trench. When he turns up to rescue them the shark is set free from the extreme cold that has kept it confined to the lower depths.The scene is set for an enormous shark to go on a bloody rampage...which never happens. Those teases you fell for in the trailer...a product of careful editing. The Meg doesn't have the balls, or the teeth, to be a horror film. All it is capable of is low-brow schlock, and you don't need a $100 million budget for that when the mockbusters and rip-offs do it just as well.The story relocates from America to China because the studio wanted to cash-in on the Chinese market (or because Megs like Chinese food), the deaths are bloodless and telegraphed, and every time the writers need a moment of tension or excitement they have a character fall overboard. No joke, if you were to play a drinking game for every time someone fell into the water you'd be dead of alcohol poisoning long before the credits role. The cinematography is awful too, coloring the movie in nothing but greys and blues, resulting in a very bland visual experience. I also have to call out the dialogue as being particularly bad, especially the character of Zhang, who attempts to deliver meaningful soliloquies on a couple of occasions which just come across as laughable and totally out of place.If the studio are looking forward to developing this into a franchise then they have painted themselves into corner by deviating from the source material so much. Any sequels may retain the title of the novels but they too will have to be completely different in the same way that those awful Resident Evil movies were nothing like the games that inspired them.Jaws it ain't.

Now, it is up to covert naval officer Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) to reach the submersible without being swallowed by the gigantic jaws of the prehistoric predator.Spending way too much time on a superfluous love story, this American-Chinese adaptation of the 1997 novel is surprisingly boring for a giant shark movie.

49,paulclaassen,"Not perfect, but enjoyable.",6,4 October 2018,"'Deep Blue Sea' meets 'Jaws', yet the film is unlike any of them and not trying to be them, either. In fact, the film offers scenes we've never before seen in a shark movie. It felt exciting like the first 'Jurassic Park'. The draw card here is definitely the great big shark, and Jason Statham. And, off course, to satisfy his fans, there simply had to be a scene where he shows off his perfect body. Not complaining. His character was pretty much similar to every other Statham character we've seen in his films over the years, just with less physical fighting and he does manage a smile here and there. I actually enjoyed him in this movie. As for the rest of the cast, I found them lacking enthusiasm. None of the other actors gave standout performances, making me not care for any of these characters. They also tried so hard to include a romantic interest, but there was just no room for that in this type of film and it fell flat. There were a number of scenes causing me to raise an eyebrow. The explanation of why the 'new world' was secluded from the rest of the ocean was not believable. What are the chances of the diving expedition including Jonas Taylor (Statham)'s ex wife? She then disappears for most of the film. Bingbing Li was unconvincing as Suyin and I really didn't care much for her. She felt in the way at times. The billionaire was an idiotic character and DJ (Page Kennedy) was just stupid as the 'comic relief' character. It would have been better without him. The film wanted an LL Cool J type character for whatever reason - only LL Cool J was very good and likable in 'Deep Blue Sea'. Also, how on earth did they manage to get that megadolon on their little boat??? How did they get the shark out of the water in the first place??

50,Thanos_Alfie,A big shark...,5,14 November 2018,"""The Meg"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a group of scientists investigating the Marianas Trench because they assuming that there is a deeper environment which has never been investigated before. During their investigation, they are attacked by a mammoth, 23-meter sea creature (Carcharodon Megalodon), believed to be extinct for more than a million years. There is only one person who can save them, the rest of the crew recruit them in order for him to save the others.Since it's a Sci-Fi movie with a big shark I had low expectations from this movie and I wasn't disappointed by it. It's an average movie to watch, I am sure that you will have a good time and you are going to enjoy it but don't expect deep meanings from this movie or outstanding interpretations by its cast. I liked the plot of this movie because it was a bit different than other movies of the same type, there were some cliché but this is understandable, and I have to admit that I liked the interpretation of Rainn Wilson who played as Morris and he gave a different touch in the whole duration of the movie.To sum up, I have to say that ""The Meg"" isn't a bad movie, you just have to be prepared of what exactly you are going to watch and what this movie is all about.

51,cruise01,Jason Statham battling against Megalodon is entertaining and fun.,8,10 August 2018,"The Meg (4 out of 5 stars). If you are a Jason Statham fan or enjoy science fiction action movies than The Meg is for you. Ridiculous how it sounds about this movie. The Meg is a lot of fun; it does take itself too seriously, and has some intense action sequences. Seeing Jason Statham battle against a megalodon shark is pure entertainment. This film could have been a whole lot worse with cheesy dialogue, bad acting, and terrible action/visual effects. Which this big budget film must have spent a lot on the visual effects and the suspenseful action. The plot follows Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) a rescue diver, when his attempt to save survivors on a failing submarine goes awry when something else attacks the sub. Years later, no one believes Jonas on what went on down there. Dr. Minway (Winston Chao) leads a research facility were they sent a small sub to go beneath the oceans cloud surface were an unknown ecosystem inhabits. And they come across a bigger threat that stops them. They will need the help from Jonas until they discover Megalodon. Which it comes to the surface.Cheesy as the plot sounds. When a group of researchers discover a new level beneath the oceans surface that is so deep. That undiscovered species inhabit. The film does build a little suspense when a group of researchers in a sub get stuck down below. Facing against a giant octopus and a big shark that can eat ships. The film does deliver on the action sequences. You can expect to see Jason Statham doing a lot of heroic diving into the ocean to save another from a giant shark. And seconds away from death when they are being grappled in with a shark inches away from them. Or a climatic battle with Statham and Li Bingbing driving those underwater subs trying to kill the shark in a cat and mouse battle. The film can be a little suspenseful. Especially, when you do not expect anything to jump out of the water at you. You can have the camera zooming in a character in the water. Or a character sticking their head in a dead shark's mouth and something happening that puts you on the edge of your seat. Also, there is a twist that is surprising and predictable but still builds the suspenseful moment. Jason Statham is an awesome actor. And an action star that always saves the day. Yes, he does so with this movie. A lot of him getting in his swimsuit and diving into the ocean to save someone. Li Bingbing was good too playing Dr. Minway's daughter. Were she is trying to stop the shark as well. Rainn Wilson was fun too playing the billionaire that funded the research facility. He delivers some fun lines. Ruby Rose was great playing an engineer expert. But she barely had anything to do when they were trying to stop the shark. Besides some close life and death situations. Overall, The Meg is a good science fiction horror film. The visual effects are good. There is a lot of action with Statham and his team trying to stop Meg. There are some suspenseful moments that makes you feel like something is about to happen. The film is better than I have expected. It is like Jaws on steroids serious than being like the stupid cheesy Sharknado movies.",The Meg

A lot of negative reviews seem to bash the film on how it isn't as gory, violent or serious. But within the film, that is its intention. It seemed to be somewhat cheesy in dialogue and not overly serious.There is some action in the film and the plot although is typical but nothing too bad. Jason Statham is of course the lead and is portraying a character he has played many times before, but it's okay because it works.The visuals of the shark and overall cinematography is nice to look at all.

53,eddie_baggins,Keep your expecations in check and The Meg offers a decent big screen ride,6,17 August 2018,"Expectations kept in check are the key to unlocking the good times to be found in The Meg, a film not quite matching the high levels of dumb fun found in 1999 guilty pleasure favourite Deep Blue Sea or the shark classic thrills and chills of Jaws, becomes a genuinely fun big screen blockbuster that is tailor made to be consumed on the big screen with the right mindset.Any film featuring the return of a long dead Megalodon shark, headlined by Jason Statham and directed by the man responsible for National Treasure is going to be a certain type of cinematic experience and for anyone that caught of glimpse of The Meg's over the top trailers or social media campaigns and thought they'd not be entering The Meg's waters should steer very far away from this spectacle, while for the rest of us that thought the prospect of Statham v Shark looked like a rollicking good-time, The Meg is exactly what the movie doctor ordered.Filled with an abundance of questionable plot developments, poorly written supporting characters and some overly serious undertones, The Meg is far from what you'd call a particularly well-made film but for what it promises to deliver, which is CGI infused mammoth shark mayhem and thrills, The Meg is a highly enjoyable ride should you go along with its wave of unbelievable scenarios and cheesiness.Based on Steve Alten's series of books that have a cult following, The Meg's focus on Statham's hardy diver Jonas returning to the oceans after year's out of the game to fight Jaw's much bigger relative and save the world, provides The Meg with a collection of entertaining scenes from Statham continually saving his colleagues in frantic fashion through to Statham literally versing the finned beast in a man v shark fight, making the film work around its other missteps.Unneeded romantic subplots and pointless and badly acted supports like Ruby Rose's greasy haired Jaxx or Rain Wilson's billionaire Morris try their best to subtract from the good times but thankfully director Jon Turteltaub and Statham steer the ship in the right direction at the right times.Unquestionably the most disappointing aspect of The Meg (which has likely stemmed from the fact it went from mature rated blood bath to M rated thriller in the editing suite) is that is never truly enacts the type of carnage you think it will and while many trailers and marketing materials focussed on the what looks like a beach filled shark bonanza, the film unfortunately never uses its key player to the effect it could've, which is a shame, as you feel like had Mr Meg been let well and truly off the hook, The Meg would've become a far more memorable outing outside of the novelty of seeing an oversized shark trying to take down Statham and his crew.Final Say - The Meg is silly, preposterous and at times a little too serious for its own good but at the end of the day viewers heading into Turteltaub's film have signed up to see a shark on steroids battling it out with Jason Statham and in that respect, cinema fans will get exactly what they paid for. In an age of po-faced blockbusters, The Meg may not reinvent the wheel, but it provides a fun and frivolous time out at the movies which is sometimes all we really need.3 Pippins out of 5",The Meg
54,leonblackwood,A terrible attempt at a modern day Jaws! 2/10,2,4 January 2019,"Review:
What an awful movie! You can't watch this film without thinking about Jaws, which was an all-time classic, but this film doesn't come close. The acting was awful from the whole cast and the unrealistic storyline goes from one bad scene to another. No one seems to care about there friends who get murdered by the humongous shark, and it's obvious whose next on his menu. Personally, I'm really surprised that the movie made such a profit at the box office because I wanted to switch it off after the first half an hour. With that aside, the little girl was cute and some of the CGI was half decent but it's hard to find something positive to say about the film. Anyway, the film kicks off with a rescue team, led by Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham), saving sailors trapped inside a sunken nuclear submarine, when Jonas sees the hull of the submarine being damaged by an unknown creature. Two of the rescuers are stuck in the damaged submarine and say their return to the rescue submersible will take a few minutes. Jonas leaves them behind as he's afraid they will all die if they wait. As they leave, the damaged sub explodes and Taylor claims that it was a sea creature that caused the disaster. He is dismissed by his teammate Dr. Heller (Robert Taylor), who believes that Jonas was affected with pressure-induced psychosis and blames him for the loss of their friends. Five years later, billionaire Jack Morris (Rainn Wilson) meets Dr. Minway Zhang (Winston Chao), at the underwater research facility ""Mana One"", which Jack finances. Minway and his daughter Suyin (Bingbing Li), whose an oceanographer, are supervising a mission to explore what may be a deeper section of the Mariana Trench, concealed by a thermocline cloud of hydrogen sulfide. The mission is being conducted by Lori (Jessica McNamee), who happens to be Jonas's ex-wife, Toshi (Masi Oka) and The Wall (Olafur Darri Olafsson) in a submersible. The mission appears to be going well, until a very large creature hits the submersible, causing it to lose contact with Mana One. Mac (Cliff Curtis) suggests sending in Jonas to attempt a rescue but Dr. Heller doesn't think that Jonas is the right man for the job. Minway & Mac decide to go to Thailand to recruit Jonas, while Suyin attempts to rescue the people from the damaged submarine. During her mission, she is attacked by a colossal squid who tries to damage her ship. Just before her ship is destroyed, a massive shark appears and kills it. When Jonas finally reaches Mana One, he rescues Lori and The Wall from the submersible but Toshi sacrifices himself by closing the hatch door and detaching the rescue vessel. With the crew safely back at Mana One, they discover that the shark is a Megalodon, the largest shark ever known, believed to be extinct for millions of years. The crew decide to track and poison the shark, which they succeed in doing, but they soon realise that the teeth doesn't match up with the previous attack. Shortly after, a second, more colossal Megalodon emerges from the water, which kills one of the crew and the smaller Megalodon. With the boat capsized Dr. Heller sacrifices his life to save one of the crew members, and then the crew head back to Mana One in two dinghies. Jonas and the remaining crew decide to track and kill the shark, realising that it is en route to a crowded beach on the Sanya Bay. This is when the movie becomes more tedious than the beginning. They decided to play audio of a whale call to divert the shark's attention towards them. Jonas and Suyin try to destroy the Megalodon with torpedos but to no avail, so Jonas decides to take on the Megalodon by himself, by harpooning poison into its eye. What a load of nonsense! The only reason why I could see it going down well with audiences is that it must have looked, and sounded amazing in the cinemas but apart from that, I really don't understand how people enjoyed this film. Statham doesn't know what accent to pick throughout the movie, and the stupid one-liners and terrible attempt at wit, just made matters worse. There was also a bad attempt at a romance story, which led to nothing but it lightened the intense the mood. Anyway, I doubt that I will be giving this bad attempt at a Jaws movie, a second watch but I might try and watch it in 3D, just to see if I have missed anything amazing, which I very much doubt. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Jon Turteltaub, who also brought you Thing Big in 1989, Driving Me Crazy, 3 Ninja Kids, Cool Runnings, While You Were Sleeping, Phenomenon, Instinct, The Kid, National Treasure, National Treasure: Book Of Secrets, The Sorcerer's Apprentice and Last Vegas. With such an impressive back catalogue, I'm really surprised that this movie was so bad, especially with his experience behind the camera. With that aside, the movie did make an impressive profit at the box office, and although the reviews weren't that great, the studio must have been happy with the outcome. Walt Disney originally purchased the film rights to the book in the 1990s, but after several years in development hell, the rights landed at Warner Bros. The movie was eventually greenlit in 2015 when Turteltaub and most of the cast jumped on board in 2016. The film was shot in New Zealand and Sanya, China in 2017, so the project has gone through many hands over the years. I can only imagine how the movie would have turned out if Disney made it, but they might have got a director that could have done a better job.Budget: $130million

55,TheMovieDiorama,The Meg opens wide and takes a bite out of the summer season.,5,11 August 2018,"A shark film with an extensive budget whilst still incorporating B-movie tropes to heighten its ludicrousness. Trust me, it's stupid, yet simultaneously disposable fun. Unfortunately, it frequently takes itself too seriously and holds back on its absurdity to be deemed as a success. A research team explore the depths of the ocean where they soon discover a giant creature roaming the oceanic floor. ""It's a megalodon"" exclaims Statham in his gruff voice, who really was the only viable individual to make that line feel epic. He, and the rest of the cast, are clearly enjoying themselves as they battle against the gargantuan fish before it reaches civilisation. Both Bingbing and Statham have waves of personality that allow them to become investible, it's a shame that the rest of the crew were one-dimensional expendables. The screenplay forcibly injected banter and humour in an attempt to come across as self-aware, but ultimately felt drier than a beached whale. It worked for certain actors, particularly Statham, Bingbing and Cai, yet unsuccessful for Wilson and Kennedy. A tsunami of clichés, intellectual characters performing stupid actions and lucky escapes littered the plot. But that's when the film works. When it knows how absurd the premise is and fully embellishes in its B-movie tropes, in particular the third act. I was smiling, face-palming and eye-rolling as we witness a cute fluffy dog paddling away from the incoming jaws of death. Had that been maintained throughout, this would've been genius. Alas, it left me wanting more, lacking in gore and deaths. The technical aspects were decent, especially the visual effects. The ocean floor looked like it's own unique ecosystem, and the titular beast was colossal. The size ratios were depicted excellently. It's a shame that 'The Meg' was on a leash. Had that restraint been removed, we may have been in for a fishy treat. Fortunately Statham dives in to save this film from total disrepair as he confidently assures us that ""it's a megalodon"". Yeah, I want that as my ringtone.",The Meg

Jason Statham plays Jonas Taylor, disgraced professional rescue diver, who is dragged back for one more mission when an exploratory submersible containing his ex-wife is trapped deep in an undersea trench. Unfortunately, the mission has drawn the attention of a long thought extinct Megalodon who follows them to the surface and their state of the art scientific platform. The Stath isn't really suited to this role, not that he does anything particularly wrong (although a couple of scenes of him trying to have fun in Act One are a bit cringe worthy) it just feels like the character would be suited to warmer actor. His longstanding swimming skills were probably pretty useful to production though. The rest of the characters are all a bit generic, Rainn Wilson's Billionaire character in particular is well worn in the ""monster movie"" genre. The character I hated most though was Page Kennedy's comic relief character DJ. . awful cliché dialogue and weak gags.The effects of the film are pretty solid, the story is OK but generally is just finding repeated ways to knock a group of people who should know better than to be on the Ocean at all, into the water. Tonally is where the film lives or dies and in this case really struggles. I understand the decision to rejig the shoot to a more family friendly final product, particularly with the massive budget and lower the risk of failure - and in that regard I'm sure the studio are happy with the outcome. Personally, however, I'd rather have seen a gorier, horror version of the film that was originally planned - or at least one that was more enjoyable that the competent but rather generic one that was delivered.",The Meg

But more importantly, this is a joint US-Sino production, with Gravity Pictures as the Chinese partner. This movie is clearly aimed at the Chinese market with Chinese start Li Bingbing in one of the lead roles, and other Chinese performers also in the movie. Some of the non-action scenes are just cringe-inducing to watch, you can practically hear the director yell ""and... ACTION"". One of the great things of ""Jaws"", the gold standard of shark movies, is that the narrative matters a lot, and as it relates to the action, less is more. ""Jaws"" is outright terrifying. ""The Meg"" exactly 180 degree away from that. Why the CGI pictures at times are impressive, you never feel scared or worried, because the megalodon is never believable in the first place (75 ft, meaning 3 to 4 times the size of the great white in ""Jaws""). In other words, this is ""jaws on steroids"", but without the thrills. I have to say, I was really disappointed with this movie.""The Meg"" opened wide this past weekend and vastly over-performed at the box office ($45 mill, instead of the projected $25 mill). It will be interesting to see how it does next weekend, now that the word is out that this is a so-so movie. The (discount) Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great. If you are in the mood for a shark movie and can keep your expectations low, I encourage you to check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Meg
62,jtindahouse,Ironically lacks depth,6,24 September 2018,"Shark movies over the years seem to have been more hit than miss. 'Jaws' obvsiouly nailed it and is considered the benchmark for all future shark movies, 'Deep Blue Sea' put in an above average showing back in the 90s, but ever since and in-between there have been a real void of good ones. I would call 'The Meg' above average, but still nothing game-changing or overly memorable in any way. It was a fen enough ride, but it played by the rules far too much to be anything special or memorable. The best thing this movie had going for it was the sheer size of the shark, and it did an excellent job of making sure the audience knew just how big this thing was. It also would be very hard to come out of this film feeling cheated, the shark makes an abundance of appearances. My problem with the film was that it all felt very predictable. Every character who you foresaw dying at the start did, and very character you foresaw living also did. There were no twists or shocking moments whatsoever in the film. When Jason Statham is chosen to be the one who goes in the water you can pretty much skip to the next scene because he is untouchable.I really liked the inclusion of Rainn Wilson in this film. He was probably the only member of the cast who managed to connect with me that I could get out any joy out of. The rest of the cast are very forgettable. I did enjoy 'The Meg' to a certain extent (I wouldn't have minded 20 minutes being cut out of it though to be fair) but I certainly wouldn't recommend people rush out to see it. There are far better films on offer.",The Meg

The film is a by-the-numbers, almost tongue-in-cheek, nature-gone-wild adventure full of threatening sharks and all of the standard human characters (a reclusive pro haunted by his past, an idealist, a capitalist, a little kid, a couple of wise-cracking chums (in both senses of the word), geek-chic techie, etc). The script is mostly quips with a bit of exposition and some strained character development, and there are a lot of improbable, last-minute rescues. I didn't find the giant shark very interesting (a huge shark and a large boat looks about the same as a big shark and a small boat) and found the film's mix of action and humour awkward (especially Page Kennedy's constant shtick), with the tension constantly being undercut by comic-relief. The rest of the cast is fine (for what's expected of them), and Jason Statham is a good as always (playing essentially the same role as always). The film is about what you'd expect from a 'Jurassic Park meets Jaws', youth-oriented CGI-thriller: transiently entertaining but neither memorably good nor bad.",The Meg

What is summer without a good shark movie? This one contains the biggest one to grace a movie screen, yet. The Meg is short for Megalodon, the prehistoric shark that lived millions of years ago. The movie starts with Jason, a deep sea diver/rescuer, doing his job, diving and rescuing. While doing it, he encounters a big shape in the water-he thinks it's a giant shark-that causes the death of half his people and when Jason tells people what he saw, they just think he is crazy. He is dismissed of his duties and retires to an island to catch up on his drinking. Flash forward about 5 years and another incident happens while divers are exploring the Mariana Trench and guess who they call for help? Yep, good old Jason. Rainn plays a billionaire footing the bill for the dive. Cliff is in charge of the dive and he is also friends with Jason. Ruby is the brains behind the dive-she built the submersibles-and Bingbing is just Bingbing. Just kidding, I just like that name. She is the love interest for Jason. The opening credits are done as if they are underwater but no scenes at the end.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for action/peril, bloody images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes.

The premise and some of the plotting isn't so dumb that it could have been a good melodrama. But then the film has to throw in Dwight being Dwight but with money. The film is constantly undermining itself every other sequence.Now a couple of the actions scenes are exciting. The central conceit about the ecosystem was clever and actually sort of plausible.

71,arthur_tafero,Meg is Jaws on Steroids,6,15 August 2018,"Meg is Jaws on steroids. It also incorporates bits and pieces of other genres and water films. The result is an effective updating of the Jaws legacy. The hero, Jason Statham, is carloads of crazy brave, and of course, there is always the romantic interest; in this case a very brave Asian woman with a child. One scene with the child was reminiscent of The Shining, when the little boy is cycling down the isolated hall. You know something bad is going to happen.And that is the problem of the film. Despite great action sequences, you already know who is going to live, and who will be potentially killed off. You know the hero, his love interest and the child will survive. This is not a spoiler; you will guess this in the first ten minutes of the film. It is this predictability that limits the effectiveness of the movie.The arrogance of wealthy Chinese getting married on a yacht is particularly annoying as well. People are getting killed, and they are worried about some spoiled little mutt. I was rooting for Meg to destroy their yacht and eat all the people on it.All in all, an entertaining flick, particularly if you are able to see it in IMAX with the full special-effects seats that make you part of the action (not advised for older adults with any back issues).

Big issue number two was that it was so damn aggravatingly bloodless! It's supposed to be a movie about a freaking Megalodon that's been starving for a thousand years wrecking havoc so where were my rivers of blood and guts?! That stupid trailer with the blues singer was totally misleading.. It had somewhat scary scenes but overall it felt very PG and that really hobbled the fun of it for me, the climactic scene which I found the most fun at the end when the shark assaults a crowded beach should have had it devouring the packed swimmers left and right with blood flowing like crazy, but it just felt held back, tons of insane gore and a more tongue in cheek tone and a little black comedy here and there was what this movie clearly needed to make it good in my humble, as it was it was a bit of a chore to sit though, I thought it dragged a little, I was so bored when it had it's dramatic moments and the characters were talking for too long, I kept saying in my head ""get back to that goddamn awesome shark, give us what we paid for!!'"" And I'm never been a fan of Jason Statham but he actually was quite good in this, for what it was, which wasn't very much, do I think he held it all together .. The first act before you see the shark was very atmospheric and creepy, it reminded me a whole lot of the opening act of Deepstar Six. In closing I was considerably disappointed in this, I mean I never read the book but that popular trailer just flat out lied. Too much dull-as-dishwater drama and misplaced focus on weak uncharismatic characters except for Statham, some really annoying characters who just were kind of weirdly jarring with the film's seriously not very fun tone, lame comedy that doesn't work, not enough shark, the bloodless PG rating all but ruins it, it's enjoyable but it is not quite good, I can honestly say that I enjoyed it just as much as I did the movie 5-Headed Shark Attack that I saw the other day. *Somewhat* fun but it doesn't work as a B-movie and it makes for a bit of a lame sea monster thrill ride...

Actually a feelgood 90's style adventure with humour & exciting sense of wonder i loved it.
Meg was way better than most big budget creature features lately like Jurassic world or the Pacific rim films & the Marvel films in my opinion!!! Perfect fun entertainment.
I loved The Meg as it was exactly what i thought it was going to be but actually abit better with a nice little cast of characters i liked & the best lead role so far by the Awesome tough action hero Jason Statham.
The Meg shark looked amazing really good c.g.i & not cheap looking like most big budget movies & the detail was excellent on that shark & the action scenes was very intense & exciting in that summer Horror fun kinda way & also some nice little nods to the greatest Shark movie of all time the Classic Jaws & it's sequels!!!
I like most grew up watching & loving & being terrified by Jaws so this was a fun modern big budget summer shark movie & it did just that lots of fun with scary moments & comedy kinda like the excellent Lake Placid (1999) meg had that old school monster horror comedy mix up & it works perfectly & Statham is great here & he's having fun as well as doing lots of action he's actually funny here & a good tough action hero as always.
There's nothing too violent or bloody so it's a fun adventure for the family too!!!
Jason Statham as Jonas Taylor really is great i think this could be his best character yet? Jonas is a true hero, a good man who will always do the right thing when needed & would always put himself at risk to save you!!! He's a great movie character & i wish there was men like that out there for real? Maybe there is? Jonas really is a tough hero with balls of steel lol he will go face to face with anything even a 75ft megalodon!!! A real action hero.
Yes just sit back & enjoy this big fun Action Horror comedy fun movie that's a thrilling monster movie & big budget B-movie & could sit nicely next to flicks like Godzilla,Deep Blue Sea, Anaconda,Lake Placid,Jurassic park films & others.
Also loved all the little nods to the Jaws films so much fun spotting them!!!

Something big enough to destroy a new submarine.I'm happy I've watched this movie on the big screen. On the silver screen, the Megalodon (hence the title ""The Meg"") was even more impressive. But that's the only thing that can be said about this film. Every film with a shark as the main subject that suddenly transforms into a psychopathic, bloodthirsty hunter, is of course mercilessly compared to the film of all films ""Jaws"". A milestone in this genre and unbeatable. Give ""The Shallows"" and ""47 Meters down"" a chance and you'll notice that you watch it rather apathetic without any sense of tension. If you want to stand out in the shark genre, you can throw in some tornadoes so sharks move around in a strange way. By air that is. In case of ""The Meg"", they brought in a prehistoric shark who managed to swim through a sort of natural barrier in the ocean. If you want to exceed ""Jaws"", you make it all even bigger and more impressive. But apart from the gigantic dimensions of ""The Meg"", this film was nowhere truly gigantic.I was looking forward to seeing ""The Meg"", even though I knew it would be a fiercely exaggerated and brainless spectacle. The fact that Jason Statham plays in it was good enough for me to give it a try. You never get bored with Statham. And it's always fun to see him kick someone's ass. I was curious to see how he would handle this giant shark. That was the first thing I was disappointed with. It looked as if they had made a serious Statham out of him. No dry humor and witty one-liners. All the familiar humor gone. And probably they also threatened to wash his mouth out with soap every time he would start to swear and say the ""F"" word. Statham the deep-sea diver who's pining away somewhere in an Asian bar because he's feeling guilty about abandoning his former crew on the bottom of the ocean. And afterward, there's also something romantic between him and the Chinese oceanographer Suyin (Bingbing Li). And he also takes care of the lovely daughter Meiying (Sophia Cai). Can it be cornier?Yes, it can be even cornier when the giant shark also starts to behave civilized. Admit it. Don't you think such a mega-shark is constantly hungry? So when he ends up near an overcrowded beach with an immense amount of young people splashing in the salty water, wouldn't you expect a bloodbath with an unprecedented number of torn teenage bodies? It's not that I look forward to such a scene, but you expect that a little bit anyway. Again this was a disappointing feature. I even began to doubt the proper functioning of the natural radar system of this giant shark. And furthermore, there was only one moment I almost jumped out of my skin when an innocent young whale bumped into a window. That says a lot about the eeriness of this movie.Isn't that what you want to see while watching a movie like this? The increasing tension and the redeeming end in which the endangered characters kill that vicious animal. You sigh with relief as you see the dismembered carcass of the shark sink to the bottom of the ocean. And you feel sorry for the attacked victims. In this film, it's the other way around. I almost cheered the moment the most annoying character in the film saw the giant, razor-sharp teeth of the shark in close-up. In fact, I hoped that ""The Meg"" could somehow return to its natural habitat, after which mankind would finally realize not to break the rules of Mother Nature every time. And that final fight was like the battle between Achab and Moby-Dick.All in all, this wasn't really worth a visit to the cinema. I'm already glad they made a mistake at the candy stand and gave back too much cash, so the candy me and my wife bought was almost for free. The popcorn tasted twice as good during this popcorn film. And mind you, not because of the movie. It had nothing to do with that. In retrospect, ""The meg"" was a mega disappointment.",The Meg

Since Shakespeare once said that brevity is the soul of wit, I will try to keep this review short as well:The Meg has no wit. It is a standard horror flick that owes so much to the superior classic film, Jaws. This Chinese-American production, directed by Jon Turteltaub, offers some scares and gore, inconsistent visual effects that are far more animated than its rugged leading actor/action figure, Jason Statham, who grumbles his way throughout the movie, and a very formulaic plot in which only the dumb, villainous, or heroic will perish. Rest assured that no women, children, or cute dogs will be on this dinner menu with a standard screenplay by a trio of questionable writers, namely Dean Georgaris, Jon Hoeber, and Erich Hoeber.

LIKES: Animation: CGI companies can make just about anything these days, including a 75 foot shark with a ferocious appetite. The Meg has some awesome design in bringing the beast to life, capturing the grainy, rough texture of the hide and making its swims delightfully fluid. This shark moves beautifully in its hunt for humans. The Characters: Most of these movies fail to bring the full talent of actors out, often resorting to making the characters glamorized fish food that we root to actually be eaten (some exceptions of course). The Meg though, their cast has more to their mettle, recruiting a bunch of dynamic actors to portray scientists that have a little more to their skill set than looking good. With this team, I was able to actually invest into the human characters and once more root for the team to find a way to solve the problem. And while the acting is not Oscar worthy, the dialogue, writing and delivery have been grounded to be enjoyed and not scoffed at. The Story: Again, most of these films hold very little in terms of quality story, only designed to maximize the blood and kills. The Meg though, takes a step back to the storytelling roots and actually does a nice job of balancing the kills with a purpose for the carnage. From how the shark came into the modern world to side stories portraying character flaws, this film had surprising amounts of detail to actually give a reason to the movie. Don't freak out though, there are still plenty of superficial carnage scenes to tickle your fancy, but for those like me who like balance, this movie gets better props. In addition, there are some twists to help add some bite to adventure. The Pace; A movie like this can sometimes drag, especially if you hate these types of films and you were dragged in to going by friends. Again, the Meg succeeds in this journey of keeping the film moving, the adrenaline pumping, and the laughs/carnage keeping pace. The film has enough action and close shaves to keep you on your toes, which plays to the nature of this genre. The Nostalgia: The Meg does have a lot of individuality, yet it is also packed with countless references to the shark movies that came before. The movie has plenty to offer, and the shark movie fans should have no problem picking up the Easter eggs submerged in the Megalodon infested waters. Nice job adding this layer of fun guys. DISLIKES: Over the top moments: The whole movie is ridiculous, I understand that and will accept it, but even suspending reality goes only so far. A giant shark movie sometimes goes too far and hits those eye rolling moments that sort of diverge from the path of balance it was achieving. Some of the structural integrity inconsistencies and speed of our humans are a few examples, but hey that's a shark movie. Plot Holes: The movie did a nice job of putting a story on board, but the movie does have some gaps that even for the ridiculous tale shouldn't have been skipped. It goes with the opening scene more than anything and with it, sort of diverges from the explanation they gave, sort of undermining the semi-logical conclusion they had. Again, a small dislike, but a noticeable one that is a bit annoying to me. Predictable: Even worse than the holes and the ridiculous level, comes the predictable plot that this genre suffers from. The Meg has more obvious foreshadowing than the theme music of Jaws, and with it comes some suspense being tempered away. While secondary characters are kind of the group to bet on for surviving vs dying, the rest of the cast has their paths blazed from the start. You'll be able to predict most of everything, though a few twists managed to spice a few things up. I'm still looking for that Jaws like quality, but The Meg does get points for trying. The uneven character spacing: I love Deep Blue Sea, because the characters had narrow misses, epic survival strategies, and the gradual picking off of the groups. It allows for more suspense, pulling you into the game of cat and mouse, or in this case shark and human. The Meg started out this way, but then succumbed to munch fest and lost the structured plot to the demands of carnage. It's not the worst case I have seen, but it was disappointing to see that build up sort of fizzle out, though I must admit it did happen in the later part of the film so kudos. 
The VERDICT: 
 Let's be honest, The Meg is a ridiculous movie that many will agree is a pure popcorn eating flick. Surprisingly though, the movie has improved on its storytelling abilities, and finds a balance between the superficial and deeper aspects of the film. Still, the shark movie is very entertaining, with a good pace, suspenseful action, some well-timed laughs, and nostalgia to get you into all the adventures to come. Yet, the film still suffers from some of the stereotypical faults of this genre, which takes away from the strengths of the movie. If you are the fan of this genre, then please hit a local theater to check it out, but otherwise hold off until it swims into television/streaming waters. My scores: Action/Horror/Sci-Fi: 7.0

It's up to rescue diver Jonas Taylor (played Jason Statham) to save the day and of course narrowly avoid getting eaten. That's the rub of 2018's The Meg, a science fiction thriller that disregards B-movie fun and entertainingly dumb, summer fun. In truth, ""Meg"" may be big and loud but it's one hollow spectacle rifled with messy ideals. Somewhere author Peter Benchley is probably rolling in his grave and Steven Spielberg is royally shaking his head.So yeah, the title of The Meg refers to a Megalodon. It's an extinct species of shark that lived millions and millions of years ago. The Megalodon in ""Meg"" kills a few people but you never view any blood or carnage. You just see human casualties faintly disappear or kinda get swallowed up (hence the weak, PG-13 rating). I never thought I'd say this but watching The Meg made me yearn for something more like 2010's Piranha 3D. ""3D's"" no masterpiece but at least it confirms that people actually become fish food in the hands of nasty, tooth-like creatures. Anyway, The Meg gives us direction by John Turteltaub that contains choppy editing (no pun intended), unnecessarily infused humor, and an inconsistency in the avenue of storyboards (every pseudo, heart rendering sequence seems to randomly pop up or flow unevenly). Also, ""Meg"" saddles the audience with the odd casting choice of Jason Statham in the lead. After seeing ""Meg"", I realized that Statham is better off doing another Expendables or Transporter sequel. Yeah he may be decent in many butt-kicking action scenes. However, JayBird has never had much in the way of screen presence with the dude possessing about 1-2 facial expressions total (sorta like Dwayne Johnson if you know what I mean). In retrospect, The Meg feels like just another Jaws ripoff with updated special effects, less suspense, and a larger specimen of great white on the cocky prowl (yup, you're gonna need a much bigger boat). The characters that ""Meg's"" shark reeks havoc on are unappealing and ones you don't really want to root for to survive. As for the headlining shark itself, well it may be up to 60 feet in length but it has the attested personality of a gnat. Bottom line: This ""Meg"" is truly a bad ""egg"". My rating: 1 and a half stars.",The Meg
88,rannynm,An Entertaining Homage to Shark Flicks with Vibrant Special Effects,8,10 August 2018,"The Meg is a somewhat entertaining homage to old-era shark flicks. A frightful direction and vibrant special effects provide a serviceable summer-end movie. Fans of shark flicks may want to check it out.The movie follows a Shanghai-based, deep-sea team as they seek to postulate new discoveries among the underwater trenches. However, their discoveries go awry when a previously thought extinct Megalodon attacks their submersibles and threatens to roam the Shanghai seas. With time on the run, team leader Dr. Zhao (Winston Chao) recruits former rescue diver Jonas (Jason Statham). Unbeknownst to everyone, Jonas has previously encountered the same Megalodon and must now confront his fears to save those aboard.Jason Statham, as Jonas, is always a vibrant presence with his charm and smarm making gold of the cheesy script. He also excels in his underwater stunts, creating some nail-biting thrills. Bingbing Li, as Suyin, proves herself as a smart, yet impatient presence, who wants to prove herself. However, she does fall key to an unnecessary clichéd father-daughter subplot, but makes the best of what she is given. Winston Chao, as Dr. Zhang, greatly presents his fears and desperation for Suyin and the mission, in spite of the weak backing for the emotional stakes of the two. Rainn Wilson, as Jacks, heightens his stereotypical rich guy presence with well-timed remarks alike his in The Office. Shuya Sophia Cai, as Meiyang, is my favorite character in her banter with Statham and brave actions power her from just being a 8-year-old damsel in distress. She truly excels in her first, breakout role. Ruby Rose, Page Kennedy, and Cliff Curtis complete the rest of the pack, each giving a unique performance, even if the characters can be viewed as expendable at times.Jon Turteltaub's direction allows for brisk thrills taking inspiration from Jaws, but allowing for his own unique takes on the genre. My favorite scene is the final act, as it goes all in with the illogic of the shark conflicts allowing for a fun conclusion. The other flaws are the inconsistency of the tone and writing of the movie, which goes from serious to knowingly funny at times and the placement of the scenes feels off at times. The movie also suffers by detracting from the shark conflict and focusing on poorly written character situations. In fact, it takes a long amount of occasionally grueling time and development for the Megalodon to even show up.The movie's message is that being a hero can come with its fair share of compromises. I give this film 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, because of intense action, gore and some language.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

It really felt amazing to see what they could do with the shark in this.Jason Statham carries the obvious stigma of being invincible, but the rest of the story is pretty compelling as they're in imminent danger for about 90% of the movie.If you like sharks, shark movies, or are afraid of sharks, then give this one a watch.",The Meg

Set in China (filmed there as well as New Zealand) in the near future, this film gets its title from a best selling fiction book about a megadolon shark, a giant shark with the ability to eat things. Jason Statham is the hero who teams up with Ruby Rose as well as others in a race against time and to save a Chinese beach town from being taken over by the shark.

But the film was nothing more than a lazy Saturday night film that you could have watched at home and possibly done some texting without missing a thing. The performances are pretty average and the story is quite bland. Nothing too exciting other than a monster shark being unleashed that wants to destroy everything in its path. The CGI is the only redeemable feature of this film but so much of this was unbelievable especially with the close calls where the shark just missing Jason.

Tracked the making of this film back in 2015-16 where it was originally going to be directed by Cabin Fever director, Eli Roth. The film was also slated for 2017, but creative differences meant Eli got dropped. The fact he got dropped as director is sad because had been officially signed on as director, he most probably (knowing the directors style) would've directed a much better film than the 12+ version you see in cinemas. I know for a fact he would pushed the bounderies out further & took full advantage of the films gore, voilence & over all action/horror. The dialogue also could've been worked a bit to help also to secure a solid 15+. The film however wasn't all bad. In fact, it was pretty epic & bloody in certain areas given its water down age rating, 12+. The action & visuals were pretty outstanding too! Not fake CGI, but pretty realistic!The story-line was pretty decent too, for a film of its kind. But hey, I wasn't too fussed, I mean the actors played their parts well, Jason Statham especially as the lead role in this.But overall, pretty epic for what it is, though given others films like it (shark films), this film could've been better, more gorier, more voilent & simply more for mature audiences as this film isn't for kids younger than 10.

Basically while exploring the Marianas Trench, a gigantic shark, the Megaldon or some such is released. Previously to this a deep rescue submersible encounters it and the main guy, Jason Stratham is ignored. He gets called back to rescue others which is when this stupid movie really gets rolling. The effects are so-so changing from scene to scene. The best thing is when the little Yorkie who goes for a swim survives. This movie is a great video for how not to remain safe on any type of boat. No one wears a life vest, or any other survival gear. The story is barely above the worthless garbage shown on the SyFy channel. This is really just one stupid movie.

95,moviexclusive,"Jason Statham versus a 75-foot prehistoric shark - it's as simple, as cheesy, but as enjoyable as that",7,8 August 2018,"The Meg' is basically short for 'Jason Statham versus a 75-foot prehistoric shark', and if that doesn't sound like your idea of an exciting late-summer movie, then this slab of B-movie cheese is clearly not for you. Oh yes, the science-fiction horror novel by Steve Alten on which this movie is based was precisely meant to be that sort of pulpy entertainment, and director Jon Turteltaub ensures that his adaptation is balanced squarely between self-awareness and self-seriousness, even though it does start off being more of the latter before tipping into more of the former.So it goes that our introduction to Statham's deep-sea rescue diver Jonas Taylor is no laughing business: in the throes of his latest mission to save the crew of a nuclear submarine trapped at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, Jonas is forced to sacrifice two of his own men inside the submarine after it is purportedly attacked by a giant creature which crushes its hull. Jonas' account of the tragic event is disputed by another key member of his very own crew Dr Heller (Robert Taylor), and after being accused of suffering a psychological meltdown, he retreats to seclusion on a rustic island in Thailand.Five years later, Jonas is given the opportunity to get even with the creature when he is approached by an old friend Mac (Cliff Curtis) to lead an urgent operation to save his ex-wife Lori (Jessica McNamee) and her two other crew mates stranded underwater in a deep sea submersible names Origin off the Chinese coast. Mac and Lori are part of a larger team on a modern research facility called Mana One exploring if there is life beneath the depths of the ocean as we know it, and the first successful so-called 'insertion' (cue the geek joke delivered by Masi Oka and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) into the hydrothermal sphere at the bottom of the seabed brings the Origin face to face with the titular super shark previously thought to be extinct.At first, Jonas' history means he is greeted with scepticism by the team on board Mana One, including chief oceanographer Dr Zhang Minway (Winston Chao), his equally accomplished daughter Suyin (Li Bingbing) and no less than Jonas' former colleague Dr Heller himself. It goes without saying that Jonas will quickly prove that he wasn't crazy after all, but after having also rescued Suyin who had valiantly but foolhardily gone to try to rescue Lori on her own, the two divorcees will begin to sketch the contours of a romance through some rare character moments, many of which also wisely draw on the precocious charms of Suyin's eight-year-old daughter Meiying (Shuya Sophia Cai).It should come as no surprise that 'The Meg' is built on a number of elaborate action-driven set-pieces mostly executed by Mr Statham, but it is also worthwhile acknowledging that Turteltaub and his screenwriters (comprising of genre specialists Dean Georgaris and Jon and Erich Hoeber) do give the characters just enough texture to craft some memorable scenes within these set-pieces. Among the notable archetypes on display here are the self-absorbed financer Morris (Rainn Wilson), the tough-as-nails independent female type Jaxx (Ruby Rose), as well as the timid plus-sized African-American comic relief DJ (Page Kennedy); and without saying who lives, who dies or how either way, these characters in their respective ways inject verve into some of the gloriously over-the-top sequences.These sequences of course dictate the course of the narrative, which sees the megalodon emerge from its hidden depths by some Deus Ex Machina to travel hundreds of miles over open ocean to terrorise hundreds of summer-loving beachgoers at Sanya Bay. Each one of the three distinct settings forms the backdrop of a significant encounter with the megalodon, with the latter two especially allowing Statham to flex his physicality without being in any claustrophobic confine. More than simple logic, that explains why Statham has to swim within 100 metres of the shark in order to fire a GPS tracker at its dorsal fin, or dive below the surface to rescue Suyin trapped within a shark cage, or in the film's pièce de résistance escape from a damaged submersible just in time to spear the shark in its eye.Indeed, there's not a lot of common sense involved, though nothing so exaggerated as to qualify irrevocably as parody. The operative word here is fun, and on that account, 'The Meg' definitely scores. Statham carries each one of these outlandish scenes with a knowing wink, and his ability to deliver the intentionally corny one-liners is matchless. On his part, Turteltaub gleefully seizes every opportunity to emphasise the relative size of the competition between Statham and the Meg, and patiently waits till the climax to unleash all restraint and let the campiness overflow - there in Sanya Bay, you have young males ogling at the opposite sex on separate floating platforms before being forcibly rammed together by the marauding shark, a man in an inflatable bubble float trying to roll over his fellow swimmers before his bubble is literally burst by the shark, and a plump and pampered young boy holding a paddle pop getting his just desserts after defying his mother's caution not to go into the ocean.It probably won't escape you that the movie is one of the high-profile US-China co-productions this year, and while that is reflected in the locations and choice of co-stars, the pleasures here still seem more culturally attuned to Hollywood sensitivities. To its credit, 'The Meg' never comes off being sillier than it intentionally puts itself out to be, and boasts more than its fair share of entertaining man-versus-enormous-shark sequences. But hey, we thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was worth, and considering that the movie has been stuck in development for over a decade, we'd add that we couldn't have seen it any other way than 'Jason Statham versus a 75-foot prehistoric shark'.",The Meg

The characters aren't developed well and the shark failed to scare me the way I felt it should have. I give them credit for coming up with the idea to use a megalodon but there are a lot of shark movies out there. You really have to bring it if you want to impress. This wasn't terrible and I am glad I watched it but I am disappointed. Out of the shark movies out there, not one, in my opinion, has been been able to top Jaws but I would eventually like to see one that can. That means you've got to do some serious investing into the characters and bring a story that will be gripping. You've got to make sure the dialogue is on point and the animatronics, CGI, stunts and additional effects have got to be mind blowing. It needs to be frightening but a visually stunning movie to help keep the audience's eyes on the screen even when they want to look away. I know this movie is out there somewhere!

Looks like one of my dreams and hopes, something I always wanted to see, the extinct large monsters like dinosaurs, or Megalodon in this case, being brought back alive, or discovered already alive, even if just for excitement, to scare people, to enjoy something extraordinary. Different than most movies, and even than most shark movies. Unique. Science part looks convincing, creatures look real and scary, and all other graphics and actions look real enough, detailed enough, interesting enough. Also unique because in unusual place or nations. One of the most extreme movies similar to other extreme ones like Greenland (2020), Gamgi (2013), and Olympus Has Fallen (2013) and it's sequels. Actually to me at least this does not look too unreal but like real scientific discovery or possibility that could happen. Good to learn some new scientific terms and watch all people fighting with something much bigger than in most cliche movies. Beautiful characters and I could recognize main guy actor from other movies all of which are good. Good mix of different unique and funny characters.

104,saptesh786,New version of the Jaw !,7,2 March 2019,"Meg is a movie of a monster shark and a stupid rich man who wants invest his money at unseen underwater nature for commercial benefit.

In presentation, some scenes are really watchable on big screen. Tension and horror feeling at two or three times. But this is not sufficient to satisfy the movie watching. The story must have strong to stick you at your seat until last end. At one point we realised that the movie is finishing now but then in next few moments the story restarting again with appearance a second shark! Like stretching story unnecessarily long. These points will really disappointing you. At acting side Jason Statham is as always he is in such action movies, like plain face, a little anger hide on face and body is eager to make any unbelievable action. Ruby rose has a wasted role here with none of action whereas she played remarkable role in XXX Return of Xander cage and John Wick: Chapter 2. Why she doing such role? Bingbing Lee only looking good but not fitted in action scenes as her slim body, she is miscast. There is now a days a trend that TV series actors and actress are doing main roles in many Hollywood movies. Want of talents in Hollywood? Anyway, other casting is just okay.

Jason Statham is moody and dangerous central character, charged with saving the scientists from a Megalodon.

There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours rather than endure the film, but after you've watched it you probably won't watch it again for a while, if at all.

A megalodon! Jason Statham's newest vehicle just so happens to be this and it seemed like a great ""brain off"" stupid enjoyment type of film. While I do think it delivers on most of what it should have, I think it needed to embrace its stupidity a bit more and doesn't have that lasting campy re-watch factor or much of an impact for that matter.The film is about a group of scientists that discover that deep in the water lives a prehistoric shark (the megalodon) and the shark soon starts to attack humans in its sight. Jonas Taylor (Statham) is a rescue diver who most attempt to find the best way to kill the megalodon before it finds its way to other humans. That's basically it. Also, Dwight from The Office is in the film as well. Ruby Rose too.I think the effects for the film especially the shark were really bad at times. I understand that this is meant to be a B film but the film looked like a SyFy channel effort at times. There are moments of sheer stupidity in dialogue, plot points, and character action which make it fun. I do think more of it was needed though. The film spends a good portion of time trying to explain the megadolon, how it arrived, and how to take care of it scientifically. Less of that and more of stupid action please.Overall, you get what you pay for with The Meg. Its a cheesy summer blockbuster much in the vein of Piranha 3D. My main concern is that it fails to establish itself as something you would want to visit when you want to laugh at dumb things. Basically, The Meg needed to tone down trying to actually be comprehensible and go all out with the hammy nature, shark fun, and gory deaths. What you get shall suffice though.6/10",The Meg

110,RforFilm,"The Meg is an example of a big budgeted B-Movie. It does have good shark action, even if the first half is a slow burn",7,13 August 2018,"It ain't summer without the shark movies! Yep, every July, we are treated to shark week on a lot of television networks and a load of shark movies ready to go on Netflix. Aside from Jaws and The Shallows, it's hard to find other shark movies I find genuinely. If I do enjoy Sand Sharks, Sharknado, Octoshark V.S. Barracuda or Sharks Invade Venice, it's for the guilty pleasure factor of how ridiculous they are. Everyone has to notice just how many of these shark movies are made. Many of them have similar stories where the shark (or sharks) invades, a hero has to redeem him self personally by killing it and that's it. They have to be the easiest stories to write, and thus, probably have no problem being sold.Let's also talk about Jason Statham. He's one of the coolest and most iconic modern action heroes. He's also one of the few white guys in Hollywood who happens to be an expert in martial arts while having the muscle mass of a Stallone or Schwarzenegger. Even his movies like The Transporter, Crank, or Revolver make him into his own exploitation stereotype. Someone knew it was time to put him and a giant shark together in The Meg. A rescue diver Jonas (played by Jason Statham) retires after a mission to rescue scientists is a failure when he leaves early, with not everyone rescued. Cut to five years later when a large underwater research facility called the Mana One is on the brink of something big; the ability to traverse deeper then any submarine and submersible has gone. When a mission involving one of them goes wrong and breaks down, the head of research Dr. Zhang (played by Winston Chao) flies to Thailand to get Jonas. Though he declines at first, he agrees when he discovers his ex wife Lori (played by Jessica McNamee) was on there.The mission to get them out is successful, but not only do they find out that a giant shark called a megalodon was responsible for the submersible crashing, but that it has broken through the barrier and is out in the South China Sea. Jonas, along with a crew that includes Suyin Zhang (played by Li Bingbing), Mac Mackredies (played by Cliff Curtis) Jaxx Herd (played by Ruby Rose) and Mana One owner Jack Morris (played by Rainn Wilson), they set out to kill the shark before it hits a populated area. If you've seen the trailers for The Meg, then your going to get exactly what you've been promised; Jason Statham versus a giant shark. Director Jon Turteltaub seems to be aware of the abundance of bad shark movies and tries to make one of his own that's fun. Does he succeed? For the most part, I did have fun...but it takes some time to get there. In fact, the real shark action doesn't really come into play until halfway into the story. The first half tries to focus on the humans and each of their parts. I wouldn't have a problem with that if they were interesting, but many of them seem to be playing them selves. Jason Statham is Jason Statham, Ruby Rose is Ruby Rose and Rainn Wilson is Rainn Wilson. At the most, it's passable.Once the shark does come on screen, things do take off in a more fun manner where at least there isn't a government agency trying to stop them. Except with one of the characters with another motive, the goal is simple; kill the shark. Even with the PG-13, I definitely got what I wanted.The Meg is what you would call a big budgeted ""B-Movie"". It's a movie that's trying to have fun with itself without having to rely on too much story or character. To be fair, trying to recreate can be hard if your more used to typical Hollywood material. When it came to his previous work like National Treasure, Last Vegas, and Cool Runnings, Jon Turteltaub is more of a studio director. Visually, he knows how to shoot a B-Movie. He needed more work on the script to make that transition. It could have done without the character's dark past and predictable romance, but that's a nitpick.I'll give this seven megaladons out of ten. I can imagine this playing well over TV airings in the next ten years. I can even see myself watching this again if I was board one day with nothing else on. If shark movies are not your thing, then you can skip this. If you are a fan, love Jason Statham or simple thrillers, then this is something worth biting.

111,petra_ste,The Meh-g,5,22 December 2020,"I love monster movies. It's a sickness I have. I can't get enough of ferocious creatures treating fictional idiots as their all-you-can-eat buffet.Sadly, the Meg, while not exactly awful, is lacking in the writing department.Even a decent cast cannot save it. Statham is fine with his roguish, Bruce Willis-h presence. The delightful Bingbing Li is an interesting female co-protagonist. Rainn Wilson can be funny, Cliff Curtis solid...However, the characters are so uniformly vanilla, blandly noble and ready to deliver non-abrasive quips, they are incredibly boring - starting with the hero, whom the movie and the other characters spend an inordinate amount of time shilling. Even those who initially Wrongly Distrust Him™ are singing his praise before we are halfway through.You need variety, conflict, arcs. Remember blunt, aggressive sea wolf Quint giving his companions a hard time in Jaws? Alan Grant in Jurassic Park starting off as a child hater (and being stuck protecting two kids for most of the movie)? Ian Malcolm, the keen scientist with ""a deplorable excess of personality""? The well-sketched marines in Aliens and the tension between them and supercilious, unexperienced Gorman? The difference between gruff, blue-collar Parker and icy, smug Ash in Alien?Another mistake is the way the movie tries to escalate the tension. It works better if the situation gets more and more personal, like in Jaws, where the shark is initially a generic threat to Amity, then in the last act the leads are fighting for their lives on a sinking boat. In The Meg we start with the main characters being directly in danger in the first two acts, then the goal becomes stopping the giant shark before it attacks a beach full of swimmers. It's exactly backwards! We don't care about nameless people, they're just extras! We care about the main characters... or we would if they had been better written.5/10",The Meg

The filmmakers give Jason Statham a PTSD backstory that is forgotten about 2 minutes into the film. His nemesis/former crewmate (a forgettable Robert Taylor) hates Statham's character for about 5 minutes...the stalwart captain is...well stalwart and he is played by ""I always melt into the background"" Cliff Curtis. Rubie Rose is on-board as the ""young genius"" who's good looks and youth makes everyone underestimate her - even after she proves over and over again that she is young and a GENIUS. And then, there's good ol' Rain Wilson (Dwight from THE OFFICE) who's the megalomaniacal mega-billionaire who wants to capture (not kill) The Meg for profit.The problem with all these characters (and others like Masi Oka's homesick scientist) is that they are one-note but not SO one note that they are over-the-top caricatures. They're just boring and forgettable.As for the shark killings (the real reason that The Meg is intriguing), they are just as boring and forgettable as the characters. Most of them are homages to kills ni the Jaws series of films, so there is some fun in that, but none of them are truly unique and original or over-the-top enough.The blame, I think, probably goes to ""the suits"" at Warner Brothers or perhaps Gravity Pictures. There are 3 writers on this, so clearly the script kept getting sent back to the drawing board - and 19(!) producers attached. I heard that Eli Roth was attached at one point and he wanted to make it EXTREMELY graphic and bloody - but ""the suits"" wanted something they could market to a broader audience, so let him go and hired the always mediocre Jon Turtletaub (LAST VEGAS, THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE) to Direct and mediocrity reigns all over.If you want a ""so bad it's good"" mega-shark film and check out DEEP BLUE SEA (the Samuel L. Jackson speech in this film is worth the price of admission). And when you see THE MEG on whatever streaming platform you prefer and are prepared to watch it ""for a laugh"", save yourself the bother (and the boredom) and stream something else.Letter Grade: C (it is competently made)4 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Meg
113,Ruskington,I hate this,1,18 May 2020,"I hate this film. Like really hate it. Firstly, I hate Jason Statham, with his husky breathy voice and boringly perfect physique. I hate the trope dot com billionaire, for oh so many reasons. I hate the Asian woman with her perfect hair and make-up and criminally neglectful parenting. I hate her child, as much as this film wants me to love her cutesiness. I hate the token black guy who, obviously, is loud and dramatic at all times. I hate Statham's ex-wife, because of course she looks like that. I hate the Asian woman's dad with his soppy monologues and general pointlessness. And I particularly hate the punky goth woman or whatever the hell she is with her stupid Gen X hairdo, starter pack tattoos and unnecessary Botox.I hate every single second of the dialogue, more so than in any other film I've ever watched. I hate the 'romance' between Statham and Asian woman. I hate the complete triviality of violent death. I hate the lack of wind at sea. I hate the lack of hypothermia suffered by the cast. I hate the Chinese people at the beach. I even hate Pippin, purely because these cretinous writers wanted me to love him. But most of all, I hate the fact that I live on the same planet as people who actually enjoy this movie. I hate them.",The Meg
114,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Poor film,4,2 November 2018,"The way I would describe this film is an Aquatic version of Jurassic Park meets Sharknado, meets Jaws. It has very poor CGI graphics, very poor acting, laughable Chinese propaganda, cheesy lines and over the top grandiose setting (most of it virtual CGI).Some scene snippets are copied from Jaws (1973). Absolutely no chemistry between Jason Statham and BingBing Li. The dialog seems reminiscent of old lipsync'd chinese movies and that includes the over exaggerated hand gestures of the actors.Honestly, if it weren't for the US & UK actor names in this flick marquee, this film probably would have never seen a theatrical release in the US or Europe.",The Meg
115,markthomassintek,So honestly a very mixed bag.,6,12 August 2018,"REVIEW - THE MEGThis has been pushed since Christmas 2017 as the film to go and see, bigger and better than Jaws (apparently) and in some ways this film is indeed better and bigger than Jaws but unfortunately in quite a few areas it just isn't. I know I'm wrong to compare this film to Jaws but honestly what else has there been to compare it too?To be fair let's start with the negatives and end with the positives. Negatives -
The story is silly, 
It feels rushed, 
The predictable actions of the shark are unrealistic.Positives -
The action is top notch and in places does keep you on the edge of your seat, 
The effects are as you would expect are great.So honestly a very mixed bag. Doesn't have the same suspense as Jaws because far too much is squeezed in but still worth watch. Rating 6 out of 10",The Meg
116,jrarichards,"Scaling up ""Jaws"" doesn't necessary scale up the enjoyment, but OK...",7,7 June 2019,"At some level not too much is done wrong as Jon Turteltaub works to make a movie out of Steve Alten's book. There's a touch of (not-utterly-ludicrous) ocean ecology/marine biology in there and an environmental protection message or two too (shark-definning, plastic in the oceans, etc.). There's a Chinese-located, American billionaire-funded marine research station created for the movie that does everything it can to remind us out here in the real world how wonderful it might be for us to finally begin to explore the oceans from a well-equipped above-sea and undersea base. And cast-wise, we've got a woodenish ensemble whose wisecracking and best efforts at teamwork do actually grow on the watcher as the movie progresses. Jason Statham as lead-role Jonas Taylor looks a bit of a weak link, no matter what he does, but it's fun to catch the irresistible Mashi Oka again, along with the also-slightly-clownish characters of ""The Wall"" and ""DJ"". The more serious characters prove more problematical, with Bingbing Li and Winston Chao both plausible enough, but familiar-face Cliff Curtis looking a bit lost here. Australian Ruby Rose as the sassy Jaxx is quite pleasing in various senses, while child actress Shuya Sophia Cai proves gifted and charming enough in her role.Plots are then reasonably cohesive, settings at times lush (and Sanya Bay is quite fascinating to look at), with the result that Megalodon's failure to quite live up to expectations looks all the more surprising. A pretty rubbery-looking version of Carcharodon carcharias did not prevent ""Jaws"" (1975) from coming over as a fresh and ground-breaking and scary movie, yet 43 years later a far more realistic-looking bigger SFX cousin creates less tension. It's the way of the world, I guess, and maybe those new to such films will find ""The Meg"" more thrilling than I did.Ironically, the criticism levelled at ""Jaws"" that it alienated people against sharks does not look very likely to apply here (in this much more-eco film), despite the fact that a ""kill the b*****d"" mentality at times permeates ""The Meg"", just as it filled the movie with Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw all those years ago.",The Meg
117,abisio,Good entertainment and light horror that can be enjoyed by adults and kids,8,10 August 2018,"There are rumours that THE MEG was changed from a gory ""R"" movie to a more acceptable for wider audiences PG 13. 
Well; as much as I like a good gory horror movie; I cannot complain this time.
Turteltaub a director that never quite convinced me had crafted a very good entertainment; fill with very good suspense; a good doses of humor, tenderness and some spectacular marine scenes. Surprisingly for these type of movies; most of the main characters survive and the ecological message is brief and not boring. The FX are very well balanced in the movie. The editing has been perfectly made to compensate some low quality ones; but always the action scenes look amazing. In brief; brainless action packed entertainment that only wants to be fun.",The Meg
118,bob-the-movie-man,Fins ain't what they used to be,6,15 September 2018,"I feel like a bit of a traitor, since I was very scathing about this film's trailer when it came out. But - do you know - as a brainless piece of popcorn entertainment, I quite enjoyed it!Jason Statham plays our hero Jonas Taylor. (Jonas? Surely some sly joke?). Jonas is drinking his life away in Thailand after being traumatised by an underwater rescue mission in which he was 90% successful. (Yeah, I know.... perfectionists.... hate 'em!). But he is needed again, since his cute ex-wife Lori (Jessica McNamee) is stuck at the bottom of the sea being terrorised by a terrifying creature: no, not Spongebob Square Pants... the titular prehistoric shark.Lori is working at an undersea research station - Mana One - off the coast of China, funded by the annoyingly brash billionaire Morris (Rainn Wilson, from ""The Office""), who you just HOPE HOPE HOPE will get munched at some point! Running the station (in the most shameless Hollywood/Chinese market crossover since ""The Great Wall"") is Zhang (Winston Chao) assisted by his cute daughter Suyin (played by the gloriously named and very talented Bingbing Li) and his even cuter granddaughter Meiying (Sophia Cai). The race is on to use their brains and Taylor's brawn to stop the monster from reaching the seaside resort of Sanya Bay for lunch. The action is, of course, absurd with so many near misses for Jonas from gnashing teeth that he could be The Meg's registered dentist. There is a really nice dynamic though built up between Jonas, his potential cross-cultural love interest Suyin and young Meiying. Suyin is a classic TimesUp heroine for 2018, with an assertive attitude and not remotely giving an inch to Statham's hero.But it's young Sophia as Meying who really steals lines and steals hearts with a truly charming performance, and would get my 'man of the match' were it not for... research assistant Jaxx (Australian model, Ruby Rose). She has an absolutely extraordinary look in this film. Chiselled and tattooed, she literally looks like she has stepped out of a Final Fantasy video game... and acts well too: the complete package.As referenced above, the Hollywood/Chinese crossover is quite striking in this film, with the Chinese beach location looking like Amity Island on steroids! (Cue the overweight Chinese kid as the Jaws ""Alex"" replacement... who knew that they also have 'Zoom' ice lollies in China!) Unusually for a mainstream Western film, a significant number of lines in the film are in Chinese with English subtitles.In the league table of shark movies, it is far nearer to ""Deep Blue Sea"" than it is to ""Jaws"", the reigning league champion, and all are far in excess of the ridiculous ""Sharknado"". But compared to ""Deep Blue Sea"", and even compared to ""Jaws"" - now, astonishingly, 43 years old! - it's a curiously bloodless concoction, presumably to guarantee it's 12A certificate. I have seen far bloodier and more violent 12A's, and if anything I think director Jon Turteltaub (""National Treasure"") rather overdid the sanitisation. It's not going to win many gongs at the Oscars, but it is a slice of movie fun nonetheless.",The Meg
119,silvermistvio,Simple but it's still good.,6,2 September 2019,"""The Meg"" for me is a kind of different film to see. The reason why is it's all about shark. I don't usually watch shark films because I think shark films are full of cruel scenes. It's so bloody and I feel that it's so pitiful to see people are getting eaten. I know it's a movie, but still, it's not good to see especially when you're eating lunch, dinner or something like that. And also I consider watching films are for entertainment. So, I usually avoid watching films that have unpleasant scenes. That's why I love films with happy endings.Because I don't normally watch shark film, so, it's very difficult to write review on this kind of films. That being said, I watched this film not because it's a shark film, just because I found that Li Bingbing was in it, so, it made me watch the film.As the film went minutes by minutes, I found that it's not that bad. Although it has some bloody scenes, it's not that much, so, I could take it. The plot is so simple but it kind of turned out a good film to enjoy. The actors are good, so that the film turned out to be good. Especially, Li Bingbing. I really love her. Although her English accent is kind of weird, but I can understand. If I have to speak in English, I too will have an accent. English isn't our mother language, so, we have accents. Hence, we all are the same.It's so sad that Jonas and Suyin didn't end up together. I really want them to end up together. If they put that scene in the film, it'd be better.So, conclusion is that even though the plot is so simple and the film turned out to be simple, but it's a good film. I kind of enjoyed it.",The Meg
120,tonypeacock-1,Decent 'B' film from Statham for a change!,6,30 April 2020,"I was pleasantly surprised by yet another shark movie which judging by the advertising campaign was just another cheap Jaws rip-off.Yes, the film has elements of the greatest shark movie of them all Jaws, and Jaws 3. However it doesn't look cheap despite a cast of relative unknowns (except the main 'star' Jason Statham - more on him later).Basically the plot is based on a species of shark thought extinct in the dinosaur era the Carcharocles megalodon or just Megalodon a 20 meter or so beast that makes the Great White look like a goldfish! An Elon Musk type character has funded a big marine biology project in the South China Sea that looks like a North Sea oil rig. Researchers from the project explore trenches some five miles or so beneath the ocean thought to be the deepest ocean in the world. Apparently the ocean bed is in reality a layer of gas and beneath is an unexplored organic world with new unknown marine species. When the explorers get trapped after their vessel is hit by a mystery object step forward the 'legend' that is Jason Statham as Jonas Taylor a drunken psychological wreck who used to rescue submarines in similar circumstances.Now Jason Statham is limited in his acting abilities in my opinion. Be it the awful US accent that has become apparent in recent films of his! However he still gets roles and attracts box office.What follows is the rescue of the trapped explorers, a battle against one or two Megalodons and an evacuation of a packed Chinese beach that rivals Amity in Jaws! CGI is put to good use and is effective unlike some other shark films I have seen over the past decade.Good, easy on the mind shark bite entertainment. Without John Williams Jaws theme, dodgy shark effects and Stathams accent. Oh and the Yorkie does survive.",The Meg

The shark terrorises the crew as they attempt to battle it.A long time on the books project, this US-Chinese co-production seems to have a budget as big as the shark, but is still massively left in the shade by the vastly superior JAWS (1975), despite its tongue-in-cheek jokey dialogue. Nevertheless THE MEG is still superior to the dreadful spate of SHARKNADO type of low budget disasters. Naturally it is more than peppered with cliches and references to JAWS, implausible and over the top macho action and set pieces in what is otherwise just an expensive B movie.

The film director had to work with a mechanical shark that always broke down, frustrating him and his crew for days. He had to resort for a great amount of time to a hidden great white shark lurking underneath the surface to create the suspense ""Jaws"" is noted for.The producers of ""The Meg"" had no such such problems with mechanical sharks and pleasure boats entering into frame. Today's computers have taken all the ""fun"" out of making shark movies. But ""Meg"" promises to be a rollicking good time as far as witnessing carnage showing a mammoth beast unleashed from a deep layer of warm ocean water causing havoc above the surface. Volumes have been written on ""Meg,"" but the opinion of this reviewer is don't expect deep philosophical insights or memorable monologues of the USS Indianapolis in WW2. This pix is simply a feast for the eye--even though green screening the beast is so evident in many hair-raising scenes. Think of John Huston's ""Moby Dick"" and you've got strong parallels between the two. Just buckle up for a frothy ride and maybe you'll like the results.",The Meg
124,kjproulx,"Dumb, but Kind of Fun to Watch",5,13 August 2018,"Until films like Sharknado put a new spin on shark attack movies, Jaws was the best there was and ever will be. With the recent release of The Meg, I didn't have any hopes that it would come anywhere near the original, nor should anyone reading this, but if you're looking for a dumb movie to check out this summer, you can definitely do worse than The Meg. It's not exactly a good film by any means, but it's perfectly fine to turn your brain off every now and then in order to be excited by a film that has zero cleverness. Here's why I believe The Meg may impress you in terms of excitement, but only if you know what you're getting yourself into.Discovering that there is more to the ocean than just what people have seen (which is already ridiculous, to begin with), a team of divers go to the depths that nobody has in the past. Learning that there are larger-than-life creatures living down there, one of them escapes, in the form of a giant Megalodon shark. Attacking everything in its path as it tries to prey on the weak, this film becomes the dumb blockbuster you would hope it would be, but not soon enough.The cast is filled with talented actors/actresses, from Jason Statham to Li Bingbing, everyone delivers solid enough performances for this type of film. That being said, the unlikely pairing of young Shuya Sophia Cai and Jason Statham was easily the highlight of the movie in my eyes. Their fun chemistry throughout the course of the movie is what kept a smile on my face. The humanity is definitely present here, but you go into a movie like this to see awesome shark action, and although it's not as crazy as it could be with an R-rating, it still delivers some very cool sequences.Many viewers will be going to see this film in order to witness Statham going toe-to-toe with a giant shark and I can say with confidence that there are moments that will surely give you satisfaction. Sadly, the climax itself doesn't feel long enough in comparison with the very drawn-out build-up to that point. On top of the slow build-up, the characterization of everyone is very one-note and quite frankly, forgettable.From Rain Wilson to Cliff Curtis, even though they deliver solid performances, the characters throughout this film are incredibly predictable. The people you don't think will make it, don't, and vice versa. There isn't a single moment of real tension, because you can see everything coming from a mile away. The visual effects make up for the dumb characters and ridiculous premise, but it really isn't enough to warrant a recommendation in the end.The Meg is held up on a pedestal by the numerous talents throughout the cast and the action itself is awesome when it does come into the forefront, but it was too little, too late, at least for me. If you want to check out a fun action flick with Jason Statham fighting a shark, then I would absolutely recommend it for that, but if you're looking for another film as great as the original Jaws, I would look elsewhere. I would be lying if I said I didn't have a bit of fun watching this movie, but as a whole, it really does feel like a lazy attempt to sell a giant shark film to an audience. As a film this movie is terrible, but due to the fact that it knows exactly what it's trying to be, it's watchable. That's not really a recommendation, but if that sounds like something up your alley, I'd say give it a shot",The Meg
125,kuarinofu,Jesus Christ,4,1 December 2018,"Ok, to mention good things about this movie right away - Statham was mildly entertaining (and good looking for a 50 y.o.), the movie had good production value and some of the CGI was good. Not surprising much with such budget though.
This is where the good stuff ends.
This starts like a Jurassic Park movie, turns into straight up trash up to the second act and becomes a parody of a B-movie up to the third one.
The movie's structure is very repetitive and starts to get tedious up to the 3rd time it repeats itself: we get a random rescue scene (obviously shot after the movie and slapped into the beginning for some ""character development"", then we get to the real beginning of the movie which is passable, stuff goes wrong, Statham is called in to save what seems to be his ex-wife (even though she then disappears for like 80% of the movie and it really feels like she was made to be his wife in post-production to give him some motivation), he does his job, people suicide for no reason, they let the shark out and don't really do anything to fix the situation, get their asses kicked, people die of sheer stupidity, get their asses kicked again, people suicide for no reason again, some more stupidity deaths.
Then it turns into a disaster movie for the third act that feels completely disconnected from everything else. The Meg rampages through a beach, nobody really dies, for some reason they introduce some filler characters and a dog we should care about I guess. A couple of stunts later the Meg dies. The end.
Not even dialogue, but every spoken word in this movie is cringeworthy (with the exception of probably a couple of lines here and there between Statham and the Asian girl kid). Nobody is concerned with anything, everybody is just chilling in all situations and tend to behave and talk like teenagers (that is when they are not doing hero suicides). All the scenes besides Statham vs the Meg ones are boring and poorly acted (especially the Asian lady, she's horrible). Some of them aren't even competently shot or paced. Sometimes they start joking around in a middle of a shark chase or do something equally stupid.
At first I was just bursting out laughing each time they said or did something totally ridiculous. But it just kept getting worse, cringe at first, and then eye-rolling straight up to begging for it to end.
None of the characters were even remotely believable, they were horribly written and mostly cast for diversity purposes only. And this is sad cause they had some good actors there, like Cliff Curtis and Olafur Darri Olafsson. I was not expecting to get Oscar performances or deep characters in this kind of movie, but GIVE ME AT LEAST SOMETHING TO CARE ABOUT.
How can you fail a 130+ mil b-movie action made only to be over the top fun? I wanted to get entertained, but got tortured instead.",The Meg
126,Hayden-86055,Cliché with laughable dialogue,3,30 December 2020,"The Meg is a poor ripoff of Jaws, I enjoyed some of the scenes but the fact this film is (presumably) played as a serious horror is a bit much. There's no gore, or proper scares, they probably tried to lower the age rating to 12+ to reach a wider audience but the original Jaws was a 12 so why couldn't they have had a bit more gore and blood. Or at the very least have some suspense without showing all of the monster too quickly.Cinematography was alright in places but the locations were rather bland and I can't remember more than one or two memorable scenes.

He has a reputation for leaving some accident victims behind in order to save the bigger group.The film highpoints are some exciting action sequences, though these would have been a better if the film were a C15 or C18.

128,Darkside-Reviewer,Shut up Meg!,4,23 September 2020,"The Meg is just another laughably bad horror movie that takes the idea of a massive killer animal in this case a prehistoric shark known as the Megalodon and try to make the idea of it eating people scary by basically ripping off other more successful movies of it's kind like (Jaws) 1975 and (Deep Blue Sea) 1998.I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie going in but I thought to myself ""Hey the movie has Jason Statham in it so it can't be that bad right?"" I was very wrong. The dialogue is terribly written and uninteresting. The movie takes it sweet time getting to the action scenes and when it does eventually get to the action you know exactly what's going to happen before it happens. Every shark movie clique that exists is in this movie which wouldn't be so bad in a self aware movie or a parody but this movie takes itself so seriously as if it's a modern day (Jaws) when really it's actually worse than (Sharknado 2).The acting is truly awful throughout this movie not one actor looks interested in what's meant to be going on around them even Jason Statham looks like he's just on auto pilot mode in this movie.There isn't much violence or blood in this movie which is surprising as pretty much the only reason people went to see this movie is to see people get torn in half by a massive shark. A lot of the blood shown in this movie is CGI blood from either the shark itself or from other sea creatures that the shark eats like whales and fish chum. Only a few people actually get eaten by the shark and in most cases the shark just swallows them whole leaving no blood or body parts sometimes they don't even get the chance to scream the CGI just swallows them whole.The CGI isn't terrible the shark looks more believable than most modern day shark movies. The CGI blood however looks terrible and unrealistic.Interestingly the rights for this movie were originally sold back in 1997 after the book (The Meg) was released. Originally a movie based on the book was going to be made and released in 1998 but producers were worried about the movie having to compete with the other major shark movie due to be released that year (Deep Blue Sea) 1998 so the movie was pushed back and was ultimately axed until 2017 when The Meg was announced as officially in production. The funny thing is this movie is actually very similar to (Deep Blue Sea) and it actually takes a lot of inspiration from (Deep Blue Sea).I recommend watching The Meg if you have nothing better to watch and are just looking for something to pass the time with it's not worth owning on Blu Ray or UHD/4K at least in my opinion it's not.",The Meg
129,msbreviews,Rating: C-,4,26 August 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)A film involving a shark and starring Jason Statham? Well, if anyone goes into the theater with high expectations, then you haven't been to the movies since the 90s. Following 1975's Jaws, Hollywood has been trying to replicate the success of the most influential shark film of all-time ... Which only happens to be the only great shark movie since that time.When I am about to watch this kind of films, my approach is always the same: if the movie is able to acknowledge its absurd plot and its dumbness, then I am all open to enjoy some simple-minded fun. However, if the film starts to go over its head, wanting something with more emotional weight and meaningful storylines, that is where I get frustrated. If your movie is filled with stereotypical characters, a generic plot, and a bunch of incongruencies, at least own it.This is where The Meg fails to deliver. It does not know what it wants to be, the balance of tones is intolerable. Sometimes it tries to go for that dumb comedy with a lot of forced punchlines, but then it shifts, and Jon Turteltaub wants some character to cry over someone's death, literally a few minutes after another character makes a joke following yet another shark's meal. Turteltaub presents a really bad direction, regarding both story and cast.Not only was he unable to establish what his film was going for, but he also didn't support his actors and actresses with the best pieces of advice. There are so many awkward moments with a lot of unfunny lines, and it can't be all the script's fault. Of course, the writers did a poor job writing the main plot and the character's scripts, but Turteltaub must know how to smooth that stuff out.The story is as generic as you would expect. There is a monstrous shark that only kills non-protagonist characters because plot armor is something very relevant to the logic of a movie (not). Characters do stupid stuff that not even the dumbest person on Earth would do. Five minutes in and you can guess the entire story, and I mean details and everything. It is that obvious. Oh, and there is a romance. Almost forgot that incredibly developed subplot, uff!Honestly, there are so many plot devices and so much silliness that even if the film owned it, I don't know how much of it I could take. Primarily due to the not-that-amusing script. I genuinely got angry with the shark because it had just eaten someone in a specific situation and literally in the next attack, a character is in the exact same conditions, and yet the shark decides to simply not do anything. If you want to protect your most important characters, at least put them through different circumstances, ones that I can look at with my blind eyes and think ""you know what, maybe he/she could have actually survived that.""The casting is also pretty bad. I mean, Jason Statham is a badass as usual. He is always the one that carries these films and does not let them sink into the bottom of the ocean. It is evident that his character is the one that really matters since he is the only one receiving a compelling backstory, so naturally I care about him. Everyone else, not really. Bingbing Li (Suyin) is there for the forced romance, Rainn Wilson (Jack Morris) has the typical bigger-than-life personality of a billionaire, Sophia Shuya Cai is the adorable little girl, and everyone else is dispensable.My issue is that even if the scripts are erroneousap, the actors make them even worse. Apart from Wilson, Li and Cliff Curtis (Mac), who don't shine but don't exactly screw up, everyone else is horrible. Page Kennedy (DJ) is supposedly the funniest character since he has all the punchlines and jokes. I mean, literally, every line he says is a joke. Problem is most of them are terrible. Ruby Rose (Jaxx) is so awful, especially when she has to cry. It is so poorly performed that a child could notice it is fake as hell. There are so many bad performances that I am surprised Statham didn't get caught by this wave.Nevertheless, Statham and the Megalodon save this film from an even worse review. I am genuinely surprised at how freaking awesome the shark looks. Not only I was not expecting it looking so great, but the action scenes are also mostly pretty cool (having in mind the irrational part). The underwater scenes are very well-filmed, there was never an overly dark background, and the editing is seamless.There are some clear influences from Jaws, mainly when it comes to the suspenseful moments. Even if the first two acts are sloppy, the last act is great fun, and it has a lot of fantastic shots of the giant shark. Entertainment-wise, it matters most how a movie ends than how it starts, so The Meg has that aspect going for it. Unfortunately, it doesn't succeed, and it definitely does not belong to the enormous (haha) list of ""good shark films.""All in all, you don't really have to shut down your brain to actually enjoy this movie. The Meg follows pretty much every single thing you would expect from it, but it has a fantastic lead from the badass Jason Statham and a beautiful-looking colossal shark, which provides some chilling action scenes. Sadly, these two are the only good things about this flick with a generic plot, stereotypical characters, illogical moments and a bad casting. If you planned on seeing it, go for it.

135,MrDHWong,A satisfactory B-movie that never bores its audience,6,15 November 2018,"The Meg is an action thriller movie based on the book ""Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror"" by Steve Alten. Starring Jason Statham and directed by Jon Turteltaub (Cool Runnings, National Treasure), it is a satisfactory B-movie that never bores its audience.Five years after surviving an attack from what he claimed to be a giant prehistoric shark, Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) is recruited by a group of scientists to help rescue some of their trapped members from a sunken submarine. Upon discovering them at the bottom of the ocean, Jonas realises his claims were correct, as a 75 foot Megalodon shark, previously thought to be extinct, was responsible for the unfortunate fate of the scientists in their submersible.Fast paced and self aware, The Meg is fun popcorn entertainment that rarely wanes in its enjoyment factor. The plot is of course incredibly farfetched and silly but it does manage to elevate itself above the usual killer shark shlock like the Sharknado films and Deep Blue Sea. Thankfully, the film's main characters are given some decent development so that they are not simply chum for the shark to eat. Jason Statham once again plays himself - the tough British action hero, and naturally that's where most of the film's fun comes from. One noticeable gripe I had with this film was that it seems to have been tailored to meet the demands of Chinese audiences, likely to bring in a bigger box office draw. There were times where the film was emphasising Chinese settings that had little to no bearing on the plot. This became distracting at times and could have been edited out without changing too much of the film's narrative flow. Overall, The Meg is still a reasonable time passer if killer shark movies are one's guilty pleasure.I rate it 6/10",The Meg
136,cardsrock,Can't decide what kind of film it wants to be,5,17 August 2018,"I went into this film with pretty low expectations, but hoping for a cheesy, fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Unfortunately, The Meg tried to tow the line between cheesy fun and a self-serious tone. The characters are very one-dimensional and the only one who seems to be having any fun and knows what kind of movie he's in is Rainn Wilson. I like Jason Statham, but he just isn't given enough of the crazy stunts and moments that would make this movie more fun. While there is fun to be had here, it's few and far between serious drama moments that just feel out of place in a film like this. It's not a terrible film, however it misses the mark as a truly fun summer blockbuster.",The Meg
137,CANpatbuck3664,A Compentent Entry in the Genre but The Meg Needed a Sharper Edge,7,11 August 2018,"I went to see The Meg with a friend more because of how excited he was about it. The marketing for the movie reminded me of Deep Blue Sea and while I do enjoy that movie for its campy glory, I didn't need to see a lesser version in the theatre. But after seeing the first part of the movie, I was surprised that it was put together competently. The first thing that caught my eye was the CGI and that it was consistently good throughout. The movie obviously boasted a big budget and I'm happy to say it was put to good use. The long shots of the open water, the plant life, the underwater research station and the environment were all passable and I didn't see anything that was less than impressive.I'll have some further comments about the nature of the action later but what they decided to include in the movie also did the trick. The sharks are animated appropriately, and they are at least threatening throughout the run time. It helps that you have an experienced action movie star like Jason Statham in the lead to add a little bit of credibility at the forefront, but I think the Meg cleared the bar they set for themselves. The movie definitely makes you nervous but they balance it with a few well-placed moments of levity. I'm going to also add a small disclaimer for safety, if you need complete realism from your action, this is not one of those movies so take heed of that going into the theatre.What I have to say about the cast is a bit of a mixed bag. Jason Statham was the right guy to lead this movie. Jonas Taylor is a very Statham character and Jason is one of the best in the business at this type of movie (action/thriller that borders being campy). Jason's guilty of coasting a bit on his natural charisma, but he's a more than capable lead for The Meg. Bingbing Li is decent as Suyin, her dialogue is a little forced with her accent and her part seesaws into being cliche but she does what she can with what she's given. I also thought they made a good choice deciding to cast Rainn Wilson as Morris, he would be an all too easy to peg character if they had gone with more traditional casting. But he shines through with his ability to be funny and at least brings in some doubt to who Morris is with his performance. They brought in some recognizable actors to fill in the supporting cast including: Cliff Curtis, Ruby Rose, Masi Oka and Page Kennedy. There isn't a bad performance among them, but they also aren't given much screen time. I would describe them as suffering from their characters being underdeveloped. I also like Robert Taylor normally, but his character was so annoying that I couldn't enjoy his acting choices.The trailer for The Meg advertised a movie that could have been the right kind of crazy. While the movie isn't devoid of tension and there are moments where you're afraid for the characters, this movie was too content to play in the shallow end instead of venturing out into deeper into the violent nature of the premise. I understand the studio's decision to keep it in PG-13 territory, its a safer investment and it will reach a larger audience. But that decision also prevents The Meg from living up to its true potential. This is supposed to be a prehistoric shark that is bigger and more violent than anything living in the ocean today and considering the subject matter, it comes off tame compared to other R rated shark movies. I don't need to see something on the level of the Piranha franchise, but this is too safe. I was disappointed that Eli Roth was considered to direct but dropped out, not because I'm a huge fan of his (I'm more down the middle on his output) but a filmmaker of his style would have pushed the envelope to make this movie memorable.I have a few minor complaints about other parts of The Meg. Despite both Jason Statham and Bingbing Li turning in decent performances, they have very little romantic chemistry and their budding relationship feels forced. The movie is obviously focused on playing toward the international market and they aren't exactly subtle about it. Some of the dialogue is corny and there were a few character decisions that were uneven (they couldn't seem to decide how big of a jerk they wanted to make Morris, there are scenes where he's laid-back or compassionate and then others where he's a gigantic tool). Also, while the ending finally had that dose of unbelievable action that I had been hoping for, it was too little too late for me.A common closing thought for some of my reviews is that if you saw something you liked in the marketing, you'll probably like the movie. The Meg might be the exception to the rule. My friend left the theatre disappointed with the movie because he wanted something off-the-wall bonkers from this premise (which didn't happen). I went in with low expectations and walked away pleasantly surprised even if I can't highly recommend the Meg to everyone. If you want to see a shark movie with a decent cast, some capably filmed action and a few scenes that will scare you without going overboard, The Meg might be for you. If you're expecting an exploitation movie or a campy thriller, you're going to be disappointed.",The Meg
138,nicholls_les,Well I enjoyed it,9,13 December 2018,"I sometimes wonder what people expect from this sort of film. Reading all the negative reviews would make anyone think this is an awful movie but in my opinion it is a good film.
The original Jaws had ham acting, poor dialogue and rubbish special effects. The only thing it had was a great soundtrack, yet it is considered a classic.
This movie has brilliant special effects and plenty of suspense. I didn't watch it expecting a classic drama or something to provoke deep thought, I watched it to be entertained and I was.
Jason Statham is good in the main role and shows he does not have to be a martial arts fighter in every movie he does.
Bingbing Li was very good but the young actress, Shuya Sophia Cai playing her daughter stole every scene she was in.

139,Beejerman,CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10),7,4 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...Firstly, this is no ""Jaws"", although there are certain similarities between the two. It seems like anytime a new shark thriller comes out, everyone is quick to jump on the ""compare it to Jaws bandwagon"", which has become overdone and overkill. Yeah, we get it. Both movies are about renegade sharks who kill people. Let's move on, shall we?All the ""Jaws"" comparisons aside, this movie is your classic retelling of the ""we disturbed a creature from the depths and now he's loose and wreaking havoc"" tale. When a submersible is sent down into the Mariana Trench for exploration purposes, they reach an area that has never before been discovered. While exploring, the submersible is attacked by a large, unknown creature rendering it helpless on the ocean floor. Enter Jonas Taylor (played by Jason Statham) who witnessed a submarine attacked and destroyed by a similar creature five years earlier. In their efforts to save the submersible, this creature is allowed to break free and surface, leaving a trail of dead bodies in it's wake.I enjoyed this movie. I felt the creature was indeed very ominous, deadly and a formidable opponent. The cinematography was good, the pacing was good, the creature effects were well made, and the acting decent. If you want a fun creature feature with explosive results, this is one you would enjoy. I would watch this one again and probably enjoy it just as much, and is a recommend.",The Meg

142,jwwalrath-227-85487,The Meg is fun if lightweight,8,15 August 2018,"Don't expect a more serious film like Jaws, The Abyss, or the original book. This is a popcorn film. It's directed by Joh Tuteltaub who directed National Treasure and The Sorcerer's Apprentice and has a similar feel. There are also some script issues. (Rainn Wilson's rich boss has some good lines but either the writer or actor seemed to have trouble with making him feel consistent. Page Kennedy appears to be straight man only to suddenly become the comical relief two-thirds in.) Still, although this is a lightweight film, its appeal.The characters are likable and mostly understandable, and the actors all seem to be having a nice time. Special credit should be given to Shuya Sophia Cai who is remarkably good for a child actress.Besides the film has a giant shark, and it is hard not to entertain with it. Although PG-13, I felt the violence was done pretty effectively under the restraints. There are a few pretty tense and eye-catching moments here. The final shark fight is completely unbelievable, but man is it fun to watch in how over-the-top it is. Overall, the film isn't deep but a lot of fun.",The Meg
143,davidgee,Jurassic Jaws,6,30 August 2018,"As the poster suggests, this is basically a mash-up of JAWS and PIRANHA. Filmed in the seas off China with a largely Chinese cast, it delivers what monster movie fans expect: an escalating series of disposable extras being disposed of. Jason and the scientists are in constant peril, but we sort of know who will make it to the end of the movie - and who won't. Jason flashes his pecs in a shower scene, which for some fans is already worth the price of admission.21st century CGI delivers a much better shark than Stephen Spielberg was able to muster in 1975. But JAWS had a screenplay which was original back then (from Peter Benchley's best-selling novel) but has gone stale with repetition. Despite its recycled script, THE MEG has terrific pace and some seriously jumpy moments. Yes, it's hoary old hokum, but it's hugely enjoyable.",The Meg

150,PyroSikTh,Jason Statham vs Giant Shark is all you need to know.,6,14 August 2018,"Jason Statham vs Giant Shark. That description is all you need to know. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.All right, all right, I'll spell it out for you in a full review. You deserve it. The Meg is about a group of scientists who find a deeper part of the ocean than ever before, beneath a cloudy layer of cold water that keeps it obscured and cut off from the rest of the ocean. Once beyond the threshold they find a whole world teeming with exotic underwater wildlife, including a Megalodon that attacks them unseen and strands the group of scientists without a paddle. Enter Jason Statham, expert underwater rescuer, also ex-husband of one of those trapped in the submarine (I know). Unfortunately the rescue opens up a temporary opening in the cloudy layer of water that lets the Megalodon through. From then on it's a group of scientists plus Jason Statham vs a giant shark on the open water.I mean, it's not a particularly deep or complicated plot. It's simplistic and to the point, and every plot point is made to give us an unending slew of giant shark on tiny humans action. For all intents and purposes it's a cheesy shark movie, and it makes no attempt to make you believe otherwise. The Meg knows exactly what it is. I mean it's directed by Jon Turteltaub, with special effects by Adrian de Wet, and ends with the word ""Fin"" in big letters. If you go in expecting the next Jaws you'll be disappointed (and rightly so, did you not watch the trailers?!).Of course the film's strongest point is Jason Statham vs a giant shark, and it makes sure to make the most of that premise, to the point where Statham's character is basically a superhero. Yes he does get into a one-on-one, mano-a-mano fight with this thing, and he wins (obviously). He willingly gets into the water without any protection, knowing full-well the shark is there, and manages to outswim it. None of these are criticisms, mind you. This is all awesome, and exactly what I paid to see. The film is super fun to watch, with action and suspense left, right, and centre. It has its predictable moments (they catch it halfway through the movie and OH MY GOD of course there's a second one) and its groaning moments (characters are literally unable to stay on boats; I actually chuckled out loud the third or fourth time someone fell in), but this just adds to that level of B-movie fun it's going for.Tied into the B-movie level of fun and simplistic plot - that's quite obviously aiming to reignite nostalgia for 90s blockbusters - is the absolutely terrible dialogue. Oh god it's so cringey. Lines such as ""That living fossil ate my friend"" and ""Chew on this you ugly bastard"" are delivered with as much tongue-in-cheek seriousness as you'd expect. The acting talent on display doesn't much help either. I mean Jason Statham is Jason Statham. It's the only character he can do, but he does it well. Li Bingbing thankfully gets more to do in a Hollywood movie than her or her fellow Chinese actresses have enjoyed recently (looking at you Kong and X-Men), but it's still only a surface-level deep character. Ruby Rose is terrible as always, Page Kennedy is stereotypical black man, and Rainn Wilson is great, but completely pointless. In fact the best actor in the whole thing was probably 10-year old Sophia Cai as the little girl on the station.The visual effects (supervised by Adrian de Wet, I'd like to point out again) are pretty good all things considered. The Megalodon is a truly frightening beast, and while you never get to see its full mass on display (even when it leaps out of the water, the camera angle means you only ever really see it's massive jaws), its sheer size is never understated. The underwater wildlife also looks great, as unrealistic as it would be to see so many different creatures all compacted together. I mean you can see a family of humpback whales from the underwater station swimming next to schools of fish and a handful of manta rays. Beautiful, but never happens.The Meg is pure entertainment, unashamedly made for the Chinese market. It's simple, to the point, and we get to see Jason Statham stab a giant shark in the eye. What more could you ask for? Objectively though, it's a pretty terrible movie. Acting is terrible, dialogue is terrible, the story is predictable and repetitive. If it wasn't for Jason Statham vs a giant shark, I would not have enjoyed this movie at all. Fortunately I did. A lot. The Meg absolutely requires going in with the right expectations and not expecting the Citizen Kane of shark movies. I give it a thoroughly enjoyable 6/10. Would watch another one.",The Meg
151,jordan2240,"Not bad, but not on par with Jaws",6,17 August 2018,"I found some of the special effects in the film entertaining, but overall, I didn't think it was very suspenseful, and there were no real surprises. Some of the scenes were basically lifted directly from 'Jaws,' or were at least very similar (perhaps on purpose). I'm not sure what I expected exactly, but I found myself starting to doze off in the second half of the film. I think I would have enjoyed it far more had the original vision with an R-rating been allowed. A film like this needs a high gore-factor to avoid being just another shark movie. As is, this could basically be on network television, though I applaud the missing 'f-word,' which is way overused in 'entertainment' (not that I'm a prude, but I find it rarely adds anything positive to the dialog). The romance aspect seemed rather forced and was unnecessary, though I would have been ok with the implication of a romance starting as the film ended.So basically, not a bad movie, but something just seemed lacking. I thought it was the sort of film one would have to see on the big screen to really enjoy, but after seeing it, I don't think you'd lose much seeing it on your basic home television.",The Meg

And it's everything you expect. The previews are great but there really isn't much past them. In fact, this movie is too PG-13 for a movie about killer sharks. Also, it's like many movies these days that are catering to the new Chinese movie market, which is fine and most people probably aren't even aware of this. The young girl is adorable. The effects are ok. There are a few laughs but ultimately it doesn't matter who the actors are because the sharks should take centre stage, and they don't seem to get enough screen time, at least not for my liking.

159,ethanbresnett,Not as awful as I thought it would be... but still pretty bad,4,17 March 2020,"The Meg never really promised much other than some mild entertainment, and it failed to deliver even this for the most part.A large part of this was due to the characters. Lets face it, the majority of monster/disaster movies have terrible characters with limited development, who are propped up by clichés and stereotypes. The Meg takes this a step further with some of the most uninteresting and two dimensional characters I've seen. Statham really isn't great in this film as the typical hardman who comes out of retirement for one last dive. The wider cast are all wildly unforgettable and cliched. If you manage to get emotionally invested in any of these characters then I'd consider that an achievement.The plot was incredibly two dimensional - oh here's a shark, lets kill it (with this in mind though I can only admire Spielberg for somehow spinning Jaws into a good film). That's all there is to it. I know that most monster movies can be boiled down to a simple plot such as this, but even within this flimsy concept there seemed to be such little effort put into making a logical film. None of the decisions they took made sense and it makes for slightly frustrating viewing. The script is also painful at times. I felt like I'd heard all of these lines (or at least the sentiment behind them) a million times before. There was nothing original here, and the script enhanced all of the character stereotypes that drag this film down.I was also a little disappointed with the effects. They weren't awful, but weren't great either. Considering the film was focused solely on the Meg you'd have thought that the effects would be spot on.If you like monster films and films of this ilk you'll probably get some entertainment out of The Meg, but if you actually look for plot, good acting and an engaging script then look again as the Meg won't deliver.",The Meg

164,akcenat,$130 million budget fim that is disguised as a big budget blockbuster but feels as TV movie which fails in almost every department,5,3 May 2020,"""The Meg"" is based on Steve Alten's novel (of Deep Terror) that was first published in 1997. As a movie it is unremarkable and only a bit fun. Actually, it's even less entertaining comparing to the Alten's summer trashy book as director doesn't quite achieve the execution. Movie feels like a missed opportunity because director doesn't deliver on anything that he promises (action/thriller/horror). The action scenes are very basic and predictable. Basically, movie doesn't push the envelope nearly as far as you will probably expecting. Not to mention it's dripping trite subplots and underdeveloped (and mostly irritating) characters. It's almost laughable as to how dumb most of these characters are, especially it's hard not to think as Li Bingbing's character makes some really questionable decisions given the fact that she is a single parent and the movie leans into that fact pretty heavily. Ultimately, ""The Meg"" sounds like it has all of the ingredients to make for an awesome shark movie, including Jason Statham (and wide international cast) plus a budget that actually means this big shark can be brought to life proper, yet the movie fails in almost every department, except CGI.Rating: 5+ (Average)",The Meg

166,stevenrotherforth,The Meg in 4DX. Probably the most fun I've ever had at the cinema.,9,11 August 2018,"The MegForget Star Wars or the Avengers or even Rocky Balboa and Ethan Hunt. For me The Meg is the movie I've been most excited about in 2018.
""Why?"" you may ask.
Well about twenty years ago I was in my local bookstore when a certain paperback caught my attention. A blue cover with a luminescent white shark. 
The name Meg in bold letters.
I was intrigued. My brain tried to piece the two things together.
An odd name to call a shark I thought. So after reading the synopsis I was hooked. I love sharks, whales and dinosaurs, practically anything with huge teeth and the ability to swallow you whole.
I read the entire book in a matter of days and was totally bowled over by Steve Altens novel.
It was hugely entertaining with some fantastic action set pieces that would look fantastic on the big screen. 
Within the first few pages a T-Rex gets devoured by a Meg. How cool is that?
Come on make the movie for Pete's sake!!!
Something on the cover had me excited. 
""Soon to be a major motion picture!""
What a movie Altens story would make.
Time went by and still no Megalodon movie.
I've waited patiently, sat through countless crappy imitations and rip offs but there's been no attempt to put Altens work on the big screen.Fast forward to 2018 and finally The Meg has surfaced.
""About bloody time!""
Sure like many other Meg-heads out there I've had my concerns.
Especially after reading that the movie is only loosely based on Steve Altens exciting novel.
But then again the movie Jaws was only loosely based on Peter Benchley's novel and we all know how that turned out.So was the movie adaptation of The Meg a success?
Well as a faithful adaptation of the novel the answer is no! This is my only real gripe with the movie.
But as a piece of fun throw away cinema it's an absolute yes!
Jon Turteltaub's movie is a fast paced thrill ride from start to finish with just enough inspiration taken from the novel to keep Meg-heads like me invested. As I mentioned, a more faithful adaptation would have been welcome and I believe critics would have been much kinder if the source material was followed more closely.
However this movie is accessible to all as the gore and violence has been toned down. 
Perhaps The Meg would have been even better with an R rating but I understand that the studio needs to make as much money as possible.
With a budget of $130 million I can see why the studio executives have played it safe.
This is a huge amount of money to throw at a giant prehistoric shark B movie.
I had my doubts with the casting of Jason Statham too in the lead role as Navy submersible pilot Jonas Taylor. 
Back in the 90's when I expected this movie to be released I always envisioned Nicholas Cage in the role. Don't ask me why, every Meg-Head will have their preferred choice but I have to say that Statham was absolutely fantastic. 
He really is the 80's action star stuck in the year 2018. 
Statham's interaction with the little girl played by Shuya Sophia Cai was adorable and then the next minute he's off being the uber cool hero. 
Jason Statham has elevated his status to best action star in the world today with his turn in The Meg.
I also enjoyed the rest of the cast and the comedic interplay between them all helped lift the tension.
I must admit I was hugely disappointed that we didn't get to see the Meg chow down on that T Rex! If we get a sequel please Warner Bros you must include this. Every Meg-Head around the globe will explode into a puddle of excitement.But what about the true star of the show?The CGI effects are superb and the Meg looks very real.
The choice not to have her luminescent was the right one.
I know that it goes against the book and I along with many a Meg-head frowned upon the decision at first, but I now believe Meg would have looked unnatural with her white glow.
In the movie she has a wonderful prehistoric texture to her hide.
This makes her look gnarly and ancient. Only the odd scene, particularly her introductory one looked a little fake.
The CGI wizards have managed to capture her natural movements.
The underwater scene when she is chasing Jonas as he's being reeled back to the boat looked very realistic.
As did the scene when the Meg swims underneath a unsuspecting paddle boarder.It's obvious to see where most of the budget went but still other elements of production have not suffered.
Cinematography is wonderful. The Meg goes from dark and murky to eye popping colourful.
The opening Submarine rescue sequence sets a particular tone before the colour palette changes depending on the environment.
Set design and props are also spectacular.
The underwater lab named Mana One is very futuristic and looks very cool.
The Abyss Gliders are also awesome.
Think of a space ship from Star Wars crossed with a Stingray.Harry Gregson-Williams's score was good in all the right places.
Sometimes uplifting other times downright thrilling.
That's perhaps the biggest compliment I can give The Meg.
It is truly thrilling. I was lucky enough to watch the movie in 4DX. The motion seats made me believe I was on the ocean. The water spray, wind and scent teleported me into the movie.
With every violent action on screen my chair would spasm and shake adding a whole new level of immersion.
I urge you to see The Meg in 3D 4DX. With the added dimension and the 4DX you will start to think you're going to get eaten.All in all The Meg was excellent and I sat through the entire movie with a huge childlike grin on my face. Really I don't understand the negative reviews.
Sure The Meg is silly and riddled with scientific inaccuracies but surely you must be obviously aware of this before sitting down to watch.Jaws may still be the daddy of all shark movies but The Meg is definitely the daddy of all sharks (sorry mother of all sharks).
If you want to have fun at the cinema this for me is definitely the highlight of the summer and I hope it makes a squillion dollars!
That way we may get to see the Meg chow down some more.",The Meg

169,maxglen,It's a popcorn flick and it does it's job but don't expect much else...,5,1 March 2021,"After putting off watching this for quite awhile, I decided to check it out as it was on Netflix and I'm quite the avid fan of the odd shark flick and I don't regret my time spent watching it, but I also don't feel like I've gained anything. The Meg knows what it is, a ridiculous, over the top, big budget movie about an extinct shark back from the depths and it rarely takes itself too seriously, which is good because when the movie takes a turn for the serious it begins to feel like it's losing its self awareness. The comedy isn't amazing but it's not the absolute worst I've seen, it's just kind of there. The VFX are probably why you would decide to watch this movie and the question is, do they deliver? Well, yes and no. Sometimes the effects can be quite stunning, particularly in the first 3rd of the movie, this also happens to be the most focused portion of the film. The effects begin to look worse when the shark is under the gaze of sunlight, highlighting it's imperfections but it still looks alright for the most part and has some pretty cool scenes. The 2nd act onwards gets a little messy and it only really continues this trajectory. The effects seem to be substantially worse in the final 3rd for some reason, I can think of many reasons why but I would only be theorising which would be counterproductive so... moving on. The soundtrack is decent, not astounding but has its highlights, it's notably more enjoyable at it's most subtle, building tension. The acting is pretty damn subpar but it's Jason Statham and Ruby Rose, what do you expect? At the end of the day this is a relatively mediocre movie but it's a shark movie which we don't get many of, at least not with this kind of budget and for that reason, I respect The Meg and has a decent time but if you aren't a fan of the bloodthirsty, doll eyed menaces of the sea that are movie sharks, you won't get much from this. For the average person, probably a 4/10 but for the shark movie fan, I've gotta throw a couple extra points up.",The Meg

For me, being underwater for the most part added to some of the action, but lacked a little in storyline and drama",The Meg
171,Magow-Intermean,The Meg Review,8,22 March 2019,"When a deep sea research team discovers the existence of a megalodon - a 70-foot, supposedly extinct shark - they face a desperate race against time to stop it from eating everything. It may not shock you to hear this, but The Meg - a movie that apparently exists just so people can make jokes about Jason Statham punching a giant shark - is a bad film. What's important, though, is to discern the level of intent from director Jon Turteltaub and his team. Have they genuinely stunk the joint out despite their best efforts? Or are they trying to have their cake and eat it too by making a knowingly awful film, a so-bad-it's-good, ready-made cult classic? In short, are they in on the joke? Worryingly, apart from a couple of moments - one involving a very small dog and a very big fish, and the very last shot - the answer seems to be ""no"". If Turteltaub had gone all-in on making this an oversized, toothy takedown of shark movies, The Meg could have been a winner. As it is, he's made a film about a shark as big as a football pitch that still somehow commits the cardinal sin of being boring. It's merely a compendium of leaden action sequences and terrible dialogue that could have been elevated to kitsch (""That living fossil ate my friend!"") had it been delivered by actors who were up to the task. Sadly, it's not. While Rainn Wilson at least seems to be having fun, as the billionaire benefactor behind the project, he's the only one. Most of the cast, from Cliff Curtis to Li Bingbing, are saddled with roles that can barely be described as archetypes. Not even The Stath, the patron saint of pulp, growling his way through proceedings as rescue diving ace Jonas Taylor like he's playing some weird combo of Quint, Brody and Hooper, makes much of a dent. Speaking of Jaws, Turteltaub knows that comparisons are inevitable and so wisely, one shark cage moment aside, largely gives Spielberg's classic a swerve. Rightly so, as it's not fit to splash around in the same water. The shark movie to which this owes the biggest debt, right down to certain character types and the odd death scene, is Renny Harlin's schlockbuster Deep Blue Sea. But that was a knowingly awful film that effortlessly nailed the effortlessly entertaining edge-of-insanity tone. Instead, The Meg trails lazily in its wake, constantly reminding you - just as Skyscraper did with The Towering Inferno and Die Hard - that there are better films of its ilk that you could be watching instead. Turteltaub and his writers at least try to keep things moving at a fair old lick, shifting the action from a claustrophobic base to the open sea and throwing in telegraphed twists every now and again just to keep things vaguely interesting. But the effects rarely rise above Sharknado level, and there's a struggle to have the human characters interact with their huge co-star in a meaningful way. Does that mean that Jason Statham doesn't punch a giant shark? We wouldn't dream of spoiling it, but let's just say if The Meg's giant tongue had been lodged in its gargantuan cheek a touch more, this could have been the summer's greatest guilty pleasure. Instead, it's further proof you can't make a silk purse out of a shark's fin.",The Meg
172,ericrnolan,"A very short review of ""The Meg"" (2018)",6,3 September 2019,"""The Meg"" (2018) is an easy movie in which to find flaws. They're many, they're egregious, and they're consistently front and center. The biggest flaw for me is its truly terrible script; it's like the screenwriters weren't even trying here. (At one point we see a character simply grunt a response to another during an exchange, as though the screenwriters were too disinterested to write a line of dialogue.) The movie's other weaknesses include the occasionally spotty CGI and some head-scratching science.With all of that said, however, I still had fun with ""The Meg."" (The title refers to a prehistoric shark called megalodon, which our protagonists inadvertently release from a newly discovered deep-sea trench.) I'd rate it a 6 out of 10 because it was a fun enough summertime monster movie. It's clunky stuff, but it's passably enjoyable lowbrow entertainment for fans of creature features.I like Jason Statham too. (This is the first film I've seen him in since 2004's ""Cellular."") He certainly isn't a bad actor, even if his lines in this film should have had him inwardly cringing. He's got presence and charisma.I'm not sure I would actually recommend ""The Meg,"" but I didn't hate it.",The Meg
173,Mike_Devine,When you're actually rooting for the shark...,2,24 August 2019,"How do you make a shark movie that makes all other shark movies seem like they're taking place in a kiddie pool? Well, by resurrecting a 2.5 million-year extinct species and trying to kill it, of course. Enter 'The Meg,' a flashy, splashy summer blockbuster that follows the story of a retired deep diver (Jason Statham) who is called on for a final rescue mission only to find something much more sinister lurking in the depths.So yeah, 'The Meg' is every ridiculous renegade creature movie you've ever seen and rolled your eyes at. There's really not much to say here - the plot is predictable with a capital ""P,"" the connection between Statham and Bingbing Li, who is the lead researcher's daughter, is paper-thin and the typical comic relief-cast is just embarrassing. Of course, nothing is expected to be accurate or somehow connected to reality in 'The Meg,' but it doesn't need to be as horrible as it is. And forget the giant shark...the only bright spot is Rainn Wilson, who takes a departure from his past roles as a billionaire playboy who is of course fixated on his funds above all else.'The Meg' is a prehistoric disaster that never should have been unearthed.",The Meg

The plot at times is contrived and it feels like there's a heavy repetition of the same action sequence and as you might expect it's not all that captivating but for something that's only 1 hour 50 ish it's a perfectly fine watch that actually succeeds any and every expectation I had, in all not too bad, give it a watch if you've got the free time",The Meg
176,scottshak_111,A Stale Shark Tale,6,27 August 2018,"The Meg movie is yet another stale Shark movie that's not up to the mark. While it tries to bite on ""how big this time the shark is"" factor, it fails to leverage it properly. Jon Turteltaub's creation is an instant fail when he decides to speed up every attack the shark does to hide a proper closeup. It's like packaging cheap thrills inside every moment to look out for. Unfortunately, that paints a very unrealistic picture. Rushing in of the shark is so sudden and deliberate that you are always prepared for it. Owing to that the flick fails to deliver real tension. The horror you feel doesn't feel justified.Somewhere Jon fails to leverage a monster in the sea and I don't know how good Steve Alten (the writer of a series of Meg novels) is, but to bring a gargantuan shark from the deepest trench of the ocean and not to cash in on its sensational size and the horror that emanates naturally, feel like a dud shot, a missed opportunity. It is not visually appealing either. The cinematography is just meh!There was so much poetry in 2015's In the Heart of the Sea that it makes Meg feel like its written in a farcical universe. You pay attention to the screenplay of The Meg and you realize how witless it is. There is nothing of value for perceptive minds to chew on. Then you turn your attention towards its humour. Entertaining movies have at least that for the rescue. Unfortunately, it is not that funny either, even though one of its characters suddenly goes for it as the movie swims to the finish line.Characters in The MegThe Meg movie's characters cannot be taken seriously. The protagonist Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) is like a superhero in the vanguard who doesn't miss any chance to encounter the behemoth even though he narrowly escapes almost every onslaught. He is a man with a mouth which eventually ends up drooling for Suyin (Bingbing Li) and vice versa. The chemistry they bring to the table is just pathetic. Suyin feels like a paper thin Barbie doll incapable of eliciting emotions. While Jonas seems like as if he is trying too hard.The child actress Meiying's (Shuya Sophia Cai) presence is barely for the contrast she puts up against the mammoth sized fish. Then she is there just to fix her mommy up with any potential hubby material guy. There was a lot we could have done with her given what a liability she was but instead they end up turning her into a pimp.Some of the characters in The Meg movie are just there without a purpose. Wink at Ruby Rose as Jaxx. It's almost like the casting peeps said:""Hey! You look cool. You are in.""Many are dispensable while many dispensable characters end up surviving. Jonas has an ex-wife Lori (Jessica McNamee) and you can't pinpoint why she is there in the movie in the first place. Oh right! Just to stay as bait to Meg, so that Jonas says yes to the mission?Cliff Curtis has so much potential I don't know why he signs up for movies where he is always sidelined as a supporting actor.The Theme of The Meg MovieWhen you talk about the plot of the movie, it can be dissected into two halves where the first part focuses on a limited world, the one curious about the things that are underneath a thermocline in the form of a research station called Mana One. The second part capers a bit on the outside where the real action is driven.

I know this movie wasn't that great, but it certainly was enjoyable to watch; I mean, Jason Statham fighting a 70 feet shark, who wouldn't want to watch that? If you really think about it, The Meg was a pretty good shark movie compared to other shark movies, like Sharknado.Story: 6/10The story was obviously silly, but in a way, it was kind of smart. The story was that the megalodon(s) lived in a ecosystem under the Mariana Trench that was hidden from a cloud of gas. You might be saying: ""Can't the Megalodon go through the gas cloud?"", well, the hidden ecosystem is just warm enough to sustain the megalodon and other organisms, and if the megalodon went through the gas cloud, it would freeze to death, due to the depth; I know it sounds dumb, but it's kinda believable. The megalodon(s) escaped trough a heat pocket, but what I don't understand is how did two megalodons be at the right place, at the right time to go through the heat pocket together, but I guess you have to forget about that part. There was two megalodons, as I said before, but they didn't make the megalodons team up or fight against each other, they just surprised us that there was two megalodons while the first one was dead. The pacing was slow at the beginning, but once it started to pick up, it never started to slow back down. Overall, the story was silly, but interesting, and it did take a while for the movie to pick up the pace.Characters: 6/10I liked the casting choice, and all the actors were on point, but Bingbing Li's acting was awkward at some points. I loved the casting choice for Morris (Played by: Rainn Wilson), and I liked how they made his character a rich good guy, which is unheard of in movies nowadays. There was a love interest between Jonas (Jason Statham) and Suyin (Bingbing Li), but there was no kissing, which was a good move, because that would've been really unfitting for the movie. Meiying (Little Girl) was a surprisingly a good character, as she brought some comedy into the movie, and Shuya Sophia Cai did a great job with the acting. The supporting characters were pretty insignificant, and they were there for only the comedy. Most of the supporting cast members were just stereotypes, like Jaxx, the strange emo girl, and DJ, the reasonable black guy. Overall, the acting was good, the main characters were decent, but the supporting characters were below average.Action: 8/10The Meg is so enjoyable because of the action, and that's one of the best parts about the movie. I love the graphics style and the color palette, being very colorful and bright. This is a big budget movie, so you'd expect good CGI. The action does get a little repetitive, like how everyone falls off the boat several times in the movie, and the megalodons were always looping around, but besides that, the action was great. The Meg does a good job at playing with our expectations; at certain times, I was like, ""The shark is going to jump out and kill him"", and the camera work does a good job to make us think that, so respect to the director. Overall, The Meg has a lot of fun action scenes, and the graphics style is amazing, but the action gets repetitive at times.Overall, The Meg is a very enjoyable movie. I'm not going to give The Meg a 10/10 for knowing that it's stupid and that's the point of the movie, but this movie does have some issue, and I won't disregard that. But everyone knew the whole point of the movie and took it reasonably, and not giving it really high scores. The Meg was a fun silly summer flick, that's a good movie to watch with friends. I recommend The Meg to anyone that likes to enjoy cheesy movies, and not take it too seriously.",The Meg

180,shanayneigh,Fails on two fronts,3,16 June 2019,"My expectations surely weren't soaring other than I looked forward to seeing some dumb fun. But The Meg seemingly can't decide whether it wants to be cheesy over the top schlock or serious drama, as a result it fails miserably at both.Although the movie surely is ridiculous it never manages to reach that ""so bad it's good"" territory, unlike, say, Piranha 3D (2010) which excelled at it.And the drama fails on every level, from the dialogue to the acting which is cringeworthy, especially from the Chinese actors who seem to be struggling with every line, and Ruby Rose who just seem to be struggling with the concept of acting. I think there was supposed to be a love story between Statham and Bingbing, but it's difficult to tell since they have the chemistry of a wet sock.Speaking of Cina, Hollywood pandering (or groveling rather) to a repressive dictatorship (go there and you'll see what i mean) leaves a bad taste. But as long as someone is willing to pony up the dough Hollywood will bend over backwards with an eagerness to please, which is why we will never see a high budget Hollywood movie about the Tianmen massacre, just like we will never see a Hollywood movie about the Nakba or the oppression and wanton slaughter of Palestinians by the occupying regime. I doubt that a studio would make a movie like Red Corner (1997) today.",The Meg
181,gavinp9,"Average Statham-saves-the-day film, with shark.",5,11 August 2018,"From the director of 'Cool Runnings', 'Phenomenon' and 'Last Vegas' (diverse filmography, Turteltaub!) comes 'The Meg', a film about a really big shark. So big (25m!), in fact, that it's a prehistoric Megalodon. It's pretty much the same premise as 'Piranha' - which begs the question - why did this film require three writers?!? Needless to say, there's not much plot, other than Jonas (Statham) trying to save people from sunken submersibles, that keep getting attacked by the ""Meg"".Now, for such a ridiculous idea, it's played quite earnestly throughout, especially with romantic interest Suyin (Li), her Dad (Chao), Jonas' friend Mac (Curtis), and to a lesser degree, Morris (Wilson), the billionaire who's bankrolling the oilrig-turned-marine-science-lab. Definitely could've done with more tongue-in-cheek-ness - although Suyin's daughter Meiying (Cai) steals all her scenes. Ruby Rose & Page Kennedy are mostly wasted. Main gripe - needed more deaths! If you're watching a film about a giant shark (which doesn't appear for first 30min), you want to see 20+ people getting eaten. Not sure it even cracks 10... All that being said, there's a few jumps, some laughs and it definitely doesn't overstay it's welcome. Not as kitchy as it could've been, but certainly no 'Jaws' or 'Deep Blue Sea'.",The Meg
182,thebricks,"Honestly, not bad, just a few flaws",8,12 August 2018,"The movie never takes itself seriously, so if you come in expecting Oscar level work, pop your balloon. It really was a decent watch, aside from a few flaws and nagging questions.Performance wise, Jason Statham is Jason Statham. He never goes above and beyond, he just delivers his usual performance. Which isn't bad, since one can imagine if he didn't take the role, the Rock would have, and TBH, it probably would have been a better choice than Skyscraper, but at least Statham is more likable onscreen than the Rock. Rainn Wilson is ok, but unbelievable as a billionaire, but once again, he delivers exactly the performance you expect. The weak link had to be Bingbing Li. Terrible actress, can't stand the ones from Mainland China, they cannot act. I mean, she is not the best China has to offer, I'm sure of it. She reminds me of a lot of Hollywood legacy actresses like Laura Dern and Gwyneth Paltrow who are only in the business through their parents or connections and cannot act. The little girl saves the entire movie, she had the best part of all, shockingly.The special effects and cinematography are average, nothing groundbreaking. It's serviceable. The dialogue was great, the plot was so-so. This team goes from researchers who happen upon a giant shark during an exploration mission to trying to take this thing on themselves, which is a tad ridiculous. Why would any government ignore them? They're researchers with a billionaire on board and another prominent Chinese man in charge, forgot exactly who he was, but their call would have been taken seriously. The notion they would try to take on this shark by themselves is insane, they would have sent word out to the military in person along with video and pictures.

First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Meg. So here we have a film about a shark, but not just any shark, we're talking about a Megladon, only the biggest shark that ever lived. Trouble is it lived thousands of years ago and isn't supposed to be around now, only someone neglected to tell the shark. In The Meg we have a film of two halves, firstly is the science stuff, the people who are investigating on behalf of the population of the world, boldly going further in their search for answers. The second half of the film is your classic shark chasing man movie, which even in these days of much improved special effects never quite gave us that feeling we had when the citizens of Amity Island were being terroized by a great white. Having said that this film was very watchable. We were given a good cast of characters that interacted well. Jason Statham played the brooding hero, combine that with your money making obnoxious billionaire, throw in a cute 8 year old and a Yorkshire terrier and you get a fair couple of hours entertainment. There were a couple of moments that made me jump but the rating is only a 12A so it was never going to live up to the promise of a gory shark attack film.",The Meg
185,gustheaffen,"Laughable CGI, predictable story, long and boring",2,22 April 2019,"First off CGI has really ruined movies. The original Jaws was far more scary and had better special effects. Sometimes the shark was HUGE, sometimes it wasn't that much bigger than other objects. It isn't scary to see a monster that looks fake. The bigger issue was there was no original story here. And Stratham always is in the same movie - he is washed up and drinking, someone appeals to him and pulls him into an emergency situation to save the day. In this case 4 times. Nothing original, movie went on way too long. If you catch it for free and have nothing better to do with 2 hours and want to see Stratham's abs by all means watch the movie.",The Meg

the movie was beautiful and definitely a movie that should be watched in the cinema when you are out of sight and if you buy it as a dvd and watch it on TV you will not like it frankly i think you will not like it.okay I have to admit until the last time I watched without being bored but I enjoyed it very much but when the movie was over I thought about how the TV would be.The subject was a little weak, only the effects and the shark chasing the people were nice.

187,ginocox-206-336968,"Familiar, but satisfying",7,24 September 2018,"The Meg (2018) is much better than I expected, based on the reviews I'd seen. To be certain, it doesn't deserve any awards for originality. Jason Statham plays much the same character he played in Safe (2012), which isn't much different than many of his other roles. Much of the film seems familiar, but different and evocative of Ice Cube in 22 Jump Street extolling Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum to deliver the same thing as before. Although the settings, dramatic beats, tropes and characters seem familiar but different, the execution and delivery is satisfying. The movie takes great pains to be politically correct and socially relevant, to the point of seeming distracting at times. Rather than 28-year-old former Hong Kong Playboy model Qi Shu displaying her well-toned legs at every opportunity in Transporter (2002), Statham's love interest is age-appropriate, feminist-approved 45-year-old Bingbang Li, who displays her intellect, independence and maternal concern for her daughter. The cast is ethnically diverse and the minority players are given significant lines. There are even a couple of messages about ecology. Many recent films have failed because they put diversity, inclusion and political correctitude ahead of compelling drama. The political content and efforts to appease are a distraction which rob the movie of a couple of points on the ten-point scale, but the action scenes are well executed, the special effects (except for some water-soluble tattoos) are credible within the film's cosmos of reality, the performances are good. The film isn't cerebral or cathartic, but it delivers vicarious thrills, touches of humor and a few heart-warming moments.",The Meg

It's fun, pretty light hearted and has enough action to keep you going (would have liked more). There is very little gore in this movie for what it is I am not a fan of gore but I did want to see people getting devoured (isn't that the point of these movies). You don't really see people getting eaten so much as you see one minute they are there the next they are not.Still it's always nice to see the smoldering Jason Statham doing what he do!

In the original JAWS the head floats out and I couldn't get into the tub for month without looking around. In this film, someone holds up a detached arm and I take a bite of popcorn. Also, there are several OH NO HE DIDN'T moments in this film. When he grabs hold of the propeller housing to pull himself through the water. When he jumps in to swim up to a shark the size of a Greyhound bus with a spear-gun. When the shark thinks like a person. When the people do things none of us would do, like jump on a dead, floating shark to get a tooth. But overall, there was some humor and Jason takes his shirt off for the ladies.

It's fantastical in every way. Shot beautifully, interspersed with cheesy dialogue and basically the most stereotypical characters you could possibly imagine. Written for 13-year-old and I'm sure enjoyed by all of them.
I didn't dislike it. I like every actor and they did a good job of delivering a pretty cheesy dialogue believably. I've seen it more than once, and I'd see it again. There's nothing wring with this movie. It might be missing some blood and guts for some people.",The Meg

197,elliotte2,Big Budget Sharknado,4,30 September 2018,"Wow....where do I start without spoilers.
1.CGI was used to often and as expected, was off. In one scene the mouth is big enough to take down a whale, in another scene the mouth was not too much bigger than Jaws(which was 25ft not 75ft like Meg). In some scenes the CGI was just a par above Sharknado. Deep Blue or Shallow Water did much much better effects with a portion of the budget. It is sad that a movie made 43 years ago has a more realistic shark.2. Acting, Statham plays the EXACT same role and emotions whether it is Transporter, Crank or Two Stocked Barrels. You get what you get. BingBing Li went to Kristen Stewart/Kneau Reaves school of acting, had the same face at beginning of movie, when she is talking technical jargon or when daughter in danger or almost dying....no change or ability to show emotions. 3. Director: I will avoid this director. When people have someone close to them killed by a prehistoric shark, they do not make stupid one-liners two scenes later which actually is only an hour after the death. Just because it was probably two weeks between the scenes in filming, director and actors have to remember that someone just died and I should be showing anger or sadness not making a one-liner about someone's hair. Next point, no one ever really seemed scared regardless of situation.4. Writing: A shark taking down 50ft whales and yachts would not notice, care, or see a human. No one reports or posts on social media that they saw a prehistoric shark? No one calls for backup? No one says 'let's get off the water? How do people mostly with phd's not know basics of science? Writing/screenplay just all over the place.In end, I watched a big-budget Sharknado.",The Meg
198,darkreignn,Remarkably underwhelming,5,10 March 2021,"""The Meg"" misses more than it hits. With a completely ridiculous premise that seems sent from the heavens to guarantee an entertaining viewing experience, the film plants itself firmly with its lead performance by Jason Statham, but doesn't have enough of the mayhem, carnage, or action that you'd expect from a film about a giant, prehistoric shark.""The Meg"" starts slowly, with an opening 45 minutes of what can only be described as setup - it is an agonizing buildup that isn't necessarily boring, but doesn't add anything fresh to the monster movie genre. You have Jason Statham in the lead, who is always charismatic and irresistibly watchable, and luckily, he does make the first half of the film somewhat palatable, what with his many daring rescues and antihero persona. However, what the movie has in personality it lacks in entertainment.The majority of the first half of the movie consists of people sitting in rooms and talking about the giant shark that's on the loose. And let's be honest: No one wants to see that. If you're watching ""The Meg,"" you want to actually see the big shark in action! And this movie doesn't really deliver that. Sure, there are some set-pieces with the shark that are somewhat fun, but everything feels generic and neutered. This is a movie that is trying to be goofy fun, but lacks any over the top sequences that could really take it over the edge and deliver that camp to the audience. To be perfectly honest, I can barely remember any notable action scenes. Also, the shark stays hidden for most of the film, no doubt due to its relatively small budget, which also does the movie no favors.""The Meg"" is small scale in almost every way, which deprives the shark from doing anything remotely interesting. When the final 15 minutes or so finally happen, you do get some of the stuff you expected, which is to say, you see the shark on the loose in populated areas. But before that, the shark is only terrorizing a small cast of characters, which leads to equally small set-pieces, giving the film an overall cheap feeling.Honestly, I wasn't a fan of this film, which is a shame because I am a fan of Jason Statham. All I wanted to see was an insane movie about a man being forced to fight head-to-head with a big shark, and the movie barely even delivers on that premise. You can probably have some fun with this movie if you saw open your head and leave your brain far away from the screen, but for me, ""The Meg"" dished up a lack of thrills that you'd expect from this kind of monster movie. This fish is definitely under-cooked!",The Meg

A research expedition into deeper levels of the ocean finds that ol' Meg is still alive. Megsy then decides to move away from these deeper ocean depths and invade the shallower depths of the sea which the expedition came from in search of human chow.This film contains the worst CGI since Escape From LA which just reinforces to me that this was made to make money and for no other reason. John Carpenter's film at least had the excuse of being made when CGI as we know it was in it's infancy.The CGI in The Meg was so bad that a scene that should have contained a huge jump scare looked so fake and artificial just before said scare that you just knew something was going to happen. And it did. And zero forks were given.This film also contains some of the worst most stereotypical and generic characters that I've ever seen- the cutesy little girl (far too irritating for her own good and deserves to become shark fodder), the edgy female scientist (tattoos, Lara Croft hair, probably a muff diver), the comedic black character (he makes Jovial Jemima look restrained. Time to send back your NAACP membership card, Page Kennedy).Rainn Wilson has a face for radio, not for film. ''Why has he been cast in such a role?'' I thought whilst watching this cinematic abortion. Then it hit me. His brash billionaire character who is in part responsible for bringing The Meg into our waters seems to be based on Elon Musk- someone else with a face for radio and a personality just as rancid.Jason Statham is a great action hero. That is until he opens his mouth and undoes all of his good work. I have a theory- the more dialogue Statham has to deliver in a film, the worse the film is.We get the obligatory scene of Jason just out of the shower and only wearing a towel. So what. A Google search for such fare is cheaper and more painfree than watching this movie.There are also some of the most awkward 'comedy' moments that I've ever seen. Lines that aren't funny and have never been funny being delivered completely ineptly.The film also changes gear and intent about two thirds of the way through. From being a suspense filled horror film (which it utterly fails at) the film then thinks it can master the 'Sharknado' sub-genre of 'oh so camp, tongue in cheek' horror movies (it can't even master this- some feat).The Meg feels like a really anaemic, formulaic and boring straight to video movie from the early 90's that has had millions thrown at it and given a theatrical release.

204,FelipeCarrillo,"A would-be underwater ""Jurassic World"" that revitalizes the US-China film deal",6,14 November 2018,"Diving into the deep sea, Warner Bros. and Gravity Pictures release their latest Hollywood's big seasonal blockbuster. A prehistoric monster that is madly swallowing millions dollars because of three keystones: the first, of course, is the commercial hook a gigantic shark means in any cinema in any country around the world; the second, the ""great cultural diversification"" among the crew and cast in, from afar, an American-bodied mega-production, still, however, according to the box office results, it was enough for Chinese audiences to reward it with a boffo gross; and finally, Jason Statham, who claims his action-hero crown after kicking hundreds of asses as ""Deckard Shaw"" from longtime ""Fast & Furious"" film series and ""Rick Ford"" from Paul Feig's ""Spy,"" two fabulous scowling characters that makes him an unfailing A-list movie star in the States. Pulling the gimmicks together wisely and promoting them worldwide freshly and genuinely, there was no doubt they were being cooking a powerful smash hit up, satisfying the less stringent moviegoer's guilty pleasures via an unapologetically over-the-top American blockbuster that never attempts to go above and beyond what it really is: a thoroughgoing popcorn finisher for the most flamboyant, unprejudiced film season of the year, B-movie entertainment of overwhelming visual magnitudes by dint of magnanimous visual effects, with charismatic enough characters to make up for the screenwriting inconsistency and dizzyingly clumsy narrative growing exponentially as the movie runs. Go and buy your ticket, then your snacks, lay back and relax, shut your brain off and get in the malevolent jaws of this B-movie giant-shark crowd-pleaser floating above Michael Bay's film style.Erich Hoeber, Jon Hoeber and Dean Georgaris, adapting freely ""Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror,"" the first of a sci-fi novel series from American writer Steve Alten, pen a script devoid of any iota of soundness. With an artificially effective opening, the material is moderately convincing for non-connoisseurs, of course, until sanity fades and Hollywood spectacle take its place. This film is simply a big-budget 2 hour-long action/adventure exercise that wants you to have a blast, only that.In ""The Meg,"" the situations are absurd and ludicrous, tightening storytelling to a minimum; so, the first minutes in, hands up! The fun has started. It becomes pointless to analyze the script of a brainless big-budget film of this kind, where overly ambitious entertainment comes first. Picking up some defending animal and environmental welfare messages along this chaotic amalgam, it also deals with one moral dilemma put on the main character and a few underdeveloped political questions that come up to only be devoured by rogue waves. By and large, it's little more than an inanely gaiety, senselessly thrilling survival ride.Strategic business or not, it severely differs from the adventure found on the pages written by the New York Times Bestselling author, swapping blood-filled attacks and raw scenarios for lighter sequences and humorous deaths which are as frustrating as amusing. Posters and official trailer as evidence to say much of the story takes place far away from shore, a matter commercial advertisements kept hidden at all cost and shattered the hopes of many for a giant-sized ""Piranha 3-D,"" for an in-your-face big-budget splatterfest. The provocative savagery betokened from opening sequence takes place just in the last quarter of its running length, savagery quickly transmuting gracefulness. The long-gestating screen adaptation works out quite well this way; however, it once again exposes the growing studio tendency to attract a broader mass of viewers via ""unjust misleading advertising;"" just to be clear, this isn't as serious as ""Crimson Peak,"" ""Spring Breakers"" or ""Suicide Squad"" marketing cases, because they only embraced the movie's fun and self-effacing tone, counterbalancing it with bold action and horror elements and putting them into the trailer. This time, despite drowning many fans who dreamed of an R-rated version, it shocked box office analysts. They're going to swim even quicker; get ready for a new franchise.Statham's Jonas Taylor has an offbeat hero design for today's action genre, as they try to put on the usual layers of rudeness and heartlessness a few drops of morality and psychology that provide an insufficient yet favorable substance all over this delightful mess. There is no shortage of the habitual heroism that allows him to get minimally hurt from impossible feats; even so, the most unbelievable feature about this character is, just like his last two best roles, the ability to get rid of the prototype for a few seconds. In sum, Taylor is light years away from Ethan Hunt, but he could neither be sitting next to The Rock's Mitch Buchannon. Moreover, Jason Statham handles the movie excellently. The actor has been known for carrying his projects off, thus, his presence alone makes the viewer keep interested and invested if you even know who is going to die. Classic over-the-top action moments, hilarious one-liners and gratuitous shirtless scenes making up a fantastic popcorn film are also there.This is a calculatedly produced, sold piece of entertainment and China also gets a good slice, it's called Bingbing Li. Suyin, a single mother who doesn't hesitate to do the unthinkable to save the lives of his crew, is the utter blend between warrior and damsel in distress, she portrays a self-contained woman with gusto and infuses just the right amount of romance and melodrama. Matching powerful female empowerment and diversity growing in all the American filmmaking fields, it's good to see two titles starring foreign actors topping the box office charts in the US and China (""Crazy Asians Rich"" and ""The Meg"") and a couple of others with dissimilar dividends ( ""A Simple Favor,"" ""Searching"" and ""Mile 22""). These kinds of co-productions are the first steps that open new ways for audiences willing to expand their modern cinematic bias, a plan about to take off.Here there is only one ""antagonist"" - from the prey-predator point of view, - however, the script toys with a kind of villain, an object more than a subject of little value for the plot, he's the perfect target to say witless jokes and catching the movie's cause-and-effect morality. Rainn Wilson holds the character up over an hour, a business-hungry billionaire whose funding has built the oceanic research station called Mana One; his helicopter arrival, wearing Nike Air shoes, speaks volumes. His character is just the guy who gets what gives, an insignificant addition that could have gone unnoticed if it hadn't been for Wilson's endeavor.There is no denying Warner deftly crafts its pictures. This sumptuous C.G.I. fanfare could be the finest you'll see in a movie theater from a killer big fish blockbuster. Grant Major's production design is gargantuan, concordant with its gigantic budget ($130 million), creating a visual magnificence that propels and defends its nature: big, dumb action film.""Changeling"" Oscar-nominated cinematographer Tom Stern, who also worked in Clint Eastwood's Academy Award-winning ""American Sniper,"" provides truly gorgeous frames for modern Hollywood scene, of course, the portentous 100-tonne prehistoric shark is useful to get this freshness. On the face of it, perhaps ""The Meg"" typifies American summer blockbuster, but even so, Stern gives it a special push, an arresting digital will. The ocean, imposing and immeasurable, is quite reserved along the first act, focusing on introducing the ultra-modern underwater research facility where much of the story takes place fluently; however, accompanied by a couple of huge surprises, this is the perfect insinuation for a new franchise; just to be clear, this shark isn't the only creature down there. Finishing the second act and halfway the third, the sharp teeth see the light of day, i.e., we finally got what we're waiting for, and, such a tremendous ride!. The whole art department does a fantastic job, especially the editing and art department, because without them in the equation, all of those millions would never have fallen so quickly into Warner Bros's jaw.The Herculean set-pieces are compelled by Harry Gregson-Williams' soundtrack, mixing environmental and suspenseful compositions that are assembled with popular hits and '80s-'90s classics such as the Thai version of ""Hey Mickey"" by Toni Basil or ""Beyond the Sea"" by Bobby Darin, which endows it that nonchalant feeling, that PG-13 the executives have decided to embrace.Unfortunately, the cinematic suspense is fair to middling, keeping in mind this vital ingredient must be handled masterfully in a film about, you know, a Megalodon. Setting aside Steven Spielberg's mandatory, unavoidable reference, it demonstrates careless tension building in the very first glance of the monster, the deaths aren't entirely imaginative and the encounters are far from memorable. This doesn't mean there is no iota of tension, there is, especially in the first act of the film, but Statham's heroism and Bingbing Li's bravery manage to save this key role.
""The Meg"" by Jon Turteltaub is a late-summer playfully over-the-top blast. We're not witnessing this year's revolutionary event movie, we're in front of a dumb actioner that brings US-China co-production deals back up- something Matt Damon's ""The Great Wall"" couldn't achieve -due to its unbelievable profitability and shocking- for good -mixed response from the critics. Seriously, Turteltaub's Statham vs big fish storytelling doesn't need a closer look, save your strength. This is pure popcorn entertainment and it's one of this year's finest. Take the bait, turn off your brain and let this monumental profit-driven shark open wide its jaws and try, just try, devour you for nearly two hours.",The Meg
205,bastos,Transporter vs Superjaws,3,27 October 2020,"That could've been the title for this movie! If it was you'd have your expectations lowered and might enjoy the movie a little more. As it is, a supposed blockbuster adapted from a novel, it just leaves too much to be desired. I have very few good things to say about this movie, other than the usual excuses for bad summer flicks, like it's entertaining but forgettable, it's no Citizen Kane, etc... What's unforgivable in these kind of movies is bad execution, and boy is this movie badly executed. From a bad screenplay to a not so happy casting to bad cgi, you name it, it's there. This is just a bit better than an Asylum production with 100x the budget. Everything is so cheesy that it starts just being annoying, like the scarred but noble hero, the conveniently single female marine specialist, the over the top millionaire who finances the whole thing, and whoever had the idea to put a little girl in the middle of it all should just stop writing for film. I was only looking for a mindless entertaining popcorn flick and came out bored and very disappointed with what I had seen.",The Meg

I would have enjoyed the film more if I wasn't lulled into a false sense of hope after casting aside all of it going in.

If you're expectations aren't too high, you can certainly enjoy this film.",The Meg
208,kevinxirau,A tale of deep sea terror.,7,18 August 2018,"There is little doubt that one of the most terrifying creatures that ever lived on Earth was the Megalodon, an enormous, whale-eating shark whose name literally means ""big tooth"". Steve Alten knew this very well when he wrote his acclaimed series ""The Meg"", though it surprisingly took a while for the prehistoric sea monster to make it to the big screen. In this tale of deep sea terror, Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) is called to rescue a team of scientists from the same creature he encountered years before only for the situation to escalate as the Megalodon sets its sights on a nearby population. In a world of shark films that take things to ridiculous extremes (i.e. Mega Shark vs, Sharktopus, and Sharknado), it's refreshing to see a brand new shark movie that takes a more serious turn. The cinematography and effects are sufficiently executed in showing just how gigantic and frightening the Megalodon is when on the prowl; it certainly unnerved me a little (though not nearly as much as my mother, who was hilariously jumping and screaming. LOL!). There's also a good amount of scientific explanations of how this could all happen, allowing for a sense of reality to an otherwise standard monster movie plot. I'm proud to say the cast holds up nicely. All the characters, Statham included, are well-acted, have believable chemistry, and just downright likable, which makes the perils they're in and any deaths all the more effective. While the film is largely serious and tense, there are some sprinkles of humor that for the most part got a chuckle out of me, serviceably lightening things up, and there's a romantic subplot that I found cute and charming. Another nice touch was the film dabbling into social commentary, particularly man's strained relationship with the ocean, which is much appreciated.In short, the Meg is a film guaranteed to bring both thrills and chills. I highly recommend watching it on the big screen if only to make the scale of the shark feel more impactful. I heard there are some differences between it and the novel, so if you're a purist I don't know how you will react to this. As for me, definitely one of the best shark movies out there. Just don't blame me if you find yourself too scared to go into the ocean after watching this.",The Meg
209,tfminfl,264. The Meg,3,16 August 2018,"One of those movies that the trailers tell you one thing, and the movie is completely different, ok, maybe not completely, but... The trailer shows what looks to be a humor filled campy big budget shark attack blood fest. I was expecting maybe a Deep Blue Sea meets Sharknado, the reality is, dead on arrival jokes, a cast lacking any chemistry whatsoever, horrific CGI sharks, bad science, and worst of all... a bad child actor!!! The story is extremely formulaic relying on pretty much all shark attack/ocean based movies, no surprises, and pretty frakking boring. Do you still wanna know the story, ok... The deepest spot of the ocean, isnt the deepest spot after all, and with a billionaires money (Rainn Wilson killed the spirit of Dwight K. Shrute with this performance) a group of totally unprepared scientists poke around too far, and you never guess what happens, they get attacked by a giant extinct shark called a megalodon, and get trapped down there, and they need the help of an expendable transporter diver to get em out, but the dumbasses also let the shark out. Most of the film they just spend chasing the shark around, once in awhile having a bad CGI encounter with a fish. And the ending...ugh... so bad.

210,dormesher-21565,A fun Popcorn Flick but nothing special,7,7 July 2021,The Meg. A fun turn your brain of kind of movie a Pure Popcorn flick that is alot of fun to watch.A predictable story and generic characters that are serviceable make this a fun movie but nothing that special in my opinion.The effects are awesome and the design of The Meg is really well done in my opinion and the action is solid and serviceable for the story but can be a little over the top sometimes especially the fight scene with The Meg at the end.The story is OK but nothing special like i said its just a Popcorn flick and the story is really predictable and there are some predictable twists like there being a second Shark halfway through.There is some really nice shots in the movie with the Shark which keeps the movie fun to watch.Jason Statham is good in the movie like he is in most action movies but he has some over the top moments but he does well in this film.However I have seen him in better movies in my opinion.Now there are some main issues that i have like some characters are a little over the top especially the Businessman and there is a love story between the two main characters that in my opinion kinda comes out of nowhere and doesn't add anything to the story for me.But besides the predictable story and the over top characters this is a fun movie and a blast to watch.This movie is literally the definition of a Popcorn Flick.Just turn your brain of and have fun with the movie.Verdict 7/10 a fun movie but has a predictable story and over the top moments.But the CGI is good and the movie is alot of fun it's a great Popcorn Flick and a turn your brain of kind of movie in my opinion nothing special but alot of fun to watch.,The Meg

As good as it is seeing Sanya Bay and being brought closer to the part of mankind living in Asia.The plot is predictable? Yes it is. The characters are less deep than the ocean? You bet. But this is, as Howard Dietz said, Entertainment. And both the fish and the movie are as stupid as they are great.",The Meg
214,Jared_Andrews,Mostly a Mega-Disappointment,5,13 August 2018,"There's a scene during The Meg when I expected a character to say, ""you're gonna need a bigger boat."" Sadly, no one does. So, in a story that's so clearly reminiscent of Jaws, an opportunity for a moment of self-aware fun is wasted. It's emblematic of the entire movie - all the pieces are in place for something entertaining to occur, but the payoff never comes. The Meg has all the ingredients needed for a summer blockbuster and then some. It features a megalodon, a 90-foot-long prehistoric mega-shark that also happens to be one of the most perfectly named animals ever, Jason Statham, one of the marquee action movie stars of our time, and Rainn Wilson, who gave us one of the funniest television characters of the past 20 years: Dwight Schrute on The Office.Take my money now. As Renee Zellweger says in Jerry Maguire, ""you had me at mega-shark."" Boasting this embarrassment of riches, the movie practically screams FUN. With all these assets at their disposal, it's easy to envision filmmakers bringing to life this concept's illustrious potential on the big screen. There could be actors hamming it up in a stupendously silly summer epic flooded with ridiculous one-liners and ""are they really doing this?"" moments. It could be glorious.There's just one problem: that's not what this movie is. Rather than lean into the absurdity and have a little fun, The Meg tries to sell a story about a tortured man of the sea who is now seeking revenge on the animal that attacked him (no, Herman Melville did not receive a screenwriting credit). The story is not affecting enough to elicit any noteworthy emotional responses, it's not smart enough to be scientifically sound and it's not over-the-top enough to reach a level of pure popcorn entertainment. Everything comes up short. Instead of a towering tidal wave, it brings only a gentle rolling tide.
 
Jason Statham plays the revenge-seeking seaman named Captain Ahab, erm, I mean, Jonas Taylor. After he was called crazy for believing that a giant unseen animal attacked his underwater vessel, he's summoned back into action by billionaire doofus, Morris (Wilson), who funds a deep-sea research facility. Morris needs Jonas to save his team of researchers, who are currently stranded at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, where they hoped to discover hidden marine life.The megalodon, or as his friends call him, the meg, eventually emerges from the depths and wreaks havoc on the facility and all sorts of fancy exploration vehicles because, apparently, megalodons love the taste of metal. The meg later swaggers his way over to Sanya Bay in China, where he can capture local swimmers and the film's producers can capture the foreign movie-viewing market. It takes 90 minutes of unnecessary scientific exposition to reach an enjoyable stretch. The plot revolves around a 90-foot prehistoric shark reappearing in 2018 - there's no reason to attempt to make any of this seem plausible. In addition to the superfluous fake science scenes, there's an insufferable amount of undeserved emotionality. Again, this story should focus on the giant shark, not half-hearted romances and pseudo-dramatic deaths. The eye-roll-worthy sentimentality clashes with the adjacent raucous action and silly jokes (yes, there are some of those, just not nearly enough). Weepy drama has no place here. This should be a zero-tears movie.It's hard to tell exactly what the filmmakers were going for; the goal should have been so obvious, but there's clearly uncertainty, which explains why the tone is so uneven. The result is a mixed bag with too much emphasis on the wrong elements. It's not quite a mega-disappointment, but it's definitely a missed opportunity.",The Meg
215,freaky_dave,Nothing special but quite fun to watch.,7,10 August 2018,"I went in watching the Meg, knowing that it was not the next Jaws. Even the director of this movie said as much. He said, and I will paraphrase, Jaws is still the best movie involving sharks, but he just wanted to make a movie that was fun and had Jason Statham kicking the shark's a$$. He did not disappoint. This was a fun movie. It had a few jump scares as well. Maybe it could've had more jump scares, but I enjoyed the movie for what it was.

219,totalovrdose,Brainless Fun!,8,10 August 2018,"The Meg is a B Grade action horror film with A Grade effects and an amazing ensemble, and though it only borrows loosely from its source material, it still makes for a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Jonas Taylor (the seemingly indestructible Jason Statham), is a former deep-sea diving expert, though his past, which was explored in depth during the novel, is only briefly alluded to for the sake of storytelling. When a submersible is lost in an unexplored region of the ocean, Taylor is the one man, according to his friend, Mac (Cliff Curtis), to bring the crew, including Taylor's ex-wife, Lori (Jessica McNamee), back safely, though you would be forgiven for having no idea they'd been married. Mac's plan however receives strong criticism from Doctor Heller (Robert Taylor), and Suyin (the beautifully ageless Li Bingbing).Suyin's father, Zhang (Winston Chao), the man behind the operation, has much interest in the ocean, though the reasons for this are only marginally explored. Moreover, though Steve Alten, in his novel, described a massive prehistoric world, what we do see in the film seems disappointingly small, despite being unbelievably gorgeous. Miss Li brings a lot of passion and conviction to her character, the confident yet vulnerable Suyin, her emotional range making for some touching scenes. Her daughter, Meiying (Sophia Cai), is equally sweet, though their relationship deserved more screen time. The always amazing Mr Curtis on the other hand is occasionally forgotten, and there are moments when he isn't seen at all. Other characters, including tycoon Morris (Rainn Wilson) is the stereotypical arrogant millionaire, with a total disregard for human decency, while Jaxx (Ruby Rose) is the largely forgettable designer of the station, whose role needed a lot more fleshing out. It is DJ (Page Kennedy) however, who has the most insulting role of all, as the typically hysterical black man. His antics, not to mention the innuendo and crude gags that accompany a lot of the script, are meant to offer comic relief, though for the most part, is unbelievable and unnecessary drivel.Of course, the film is not called 'Meg' just for the sake of it. It does take some time before we see the great big beast, but it is certainly worth the wait, an unforeseen event (unlike the one in the novel) inadvertently releasing the giant shark into the waters of the twenty first century. Trouble naturally ensues, the station the team occupies (which we never do see enough of) coming under attack. Despite the title, it would have been so much more engrossing to see more of the tyrannical monster, and though this is a creature feature, the occasional violence is kept to a minimal.Despite its predictability and basic narrative (if you've seen Shark Attack 3: Megalodon, this is similar), Meg is thoroughly enjoyable, brainless fun. There is a lot that goes unexplained, and you could spend a lot of time poking holes in the plot, that frenetically speeds along. That being said, there are some excellent jump scares, and Jason Statham has a LOT of fun as the stone-faced hero, the end result being a crescendo of excitement and unending suspense. 
If you want something thought provoking, you won't find it here; if you want to be thrust into an adventure, captained by Statham and Bingbing, this is the ship you should board at once!",The Meg
220,Padreviews,Follows the money,5,19 August 2018,Right from the start it was clear this was a chinese financed film and there's nothing bad about that the movie business is afterall a business - so if you throw in the right ingredients you'll get a summer hit . It was a film of three acts and only the first one was informative believable and enjoyable after that it fell short . The shame is that JAWS ( 1976 ) sets the benchmark for aquatic monster movies and nothing has come close since - it had the ingredients it just wasn't cooked right and will leave you feeling a bit cheated it could have been a lot better but you never really got a chance to feel anything for any of characters except possibly the daughter - everyone else was quite one dimensional - without giving away spoilers with this type of film you're supposed to care about whether characters live or die and you just didn't not cause you're unfeeling but because the film didn't make you care .

He does rescue her, along with this girl's Chinese mother, and then his ex wife is forgotten about the rest of the movie and focuses on this love thing between Jason Statham and the Chinese woman.And why wouldn't she love him? He plunges into the water to save her from a giant shark without any repercussions because, well, he's Jason Statham. In fact, you can even say this movie is Jaws with Jason Statham catering more to the Chinese audiences.The Meg is pretty much just a big, dumb shark movie and nothing more.

Lake Placid: Legacy? Not so much. I enjoyed this film. It was suspenseful. It was exciting. There legitimately were scenes that made me jump out of my seat and yell, ""Oh Crap!""....and that doesn't happen often when I watch films but it happened often enough in The Meg that it made me enjoy the thrill of it all. Jason Statham plays exactly who you think he plays: the angry loner who becomes a hero beyond all odds....just like he does in all his movies, but hes charismatic enough that you don't care that he's being typecast yet again. For me the stand out performance was that of Rainn Wilson....you just have to see the film to know what I'm talking about. As far as the shark goes: they made a CGI shark that is probably 5x the size of a humpback whale. It could bite a luxury yacht in half. It's not perfect, but it's real enough that it strikes fear and gives you goosebumps when you see it charging towards the cast. It's strength lies in the fear and sensationalism of sharks in popular culture. Fear of being attacked by these giant underwater eating machines is high at the top of most people's phobias. Throw in a shark the size of a nuclear sub and you're bound to scare the pants off of anyone. The verdict: Don't take this film too seriously; rather enjoy it for what it is while you suspend your disbelief because this is a fantastic deep sea scare-fest that you won't want to miss.",The Meg

The shark also doesn't really seem to be the main point of the film, its more the interactions of the crew.

And as light-hearted entertainment goes, it more than does the job. You could do a lot worse for a 2-hour shutdown of the brain.",The Meg
234,mattfrancis-03963,"Better than 1/10, ignore the pleb.s",4,20 January 2021,"Ah dear me Jason Jason, you have to feel sorry for him he tried to make an effort to save this movie but knew the movie would drown. Let's be honest people, The Meg is a terrible film.
Yes there's the creepy scare factor and it's tense, yes CGI did a great job at making things look real and also the Meg shark was a more interesting shark than jaws, but apart from that this movie is lame, implausible, cheesy and dumb.
The inclusion of inappropriate humour, characters you want to choke to death, daft dialogue and an illogical first act, this movie unsurprisingly scored more sins than other movies of this type.
I am sure the creators spent more time on the special effects than developing then script and organising the plot. The problem was the use of humour didn't work it just took away any built up tension and engagement. I have to add the opening twenty minutes is visually good with the innovative tech and crew, the budget they had on full display, but with terrible editing and cutting. There wasn't much on the background of the characters other than Statham and the use the researchers barely knew much also didn't send for any help. This really sucked and the whole plot at defeating a shark, with a lack of development and research, really sucked also.
Some of the acting in this is 1/10. I think the chinese, New Zealanders or whoever messed up this entire movie especially the beach scene where they're all floating in the water with rings like it's compulsory and then told it's safe after thirty people have got eaten, just woeful and succeeds in taking the realism and genuine efforts away from the film.
When your making a film like this with this kind of budget everyone should have been including Jason way more committed. This should done way better not rushed just carefully planned. It's not all about what pleases your eyes. Not when how sexy Jason is or they hot girl with the tattoos. What gets in the way of the film being enjoyable and entertaining is not that it's going to be compared to other films of the same genre, but how all of the above from the dialogue to the ridiculousness.",The Meg

The movie though an ok attempt .... is quite a bit distorted compared to the novel which would otherwise would have been a block buster.

237,torrascotia,An entertaining family friendly even-bigger-jaws-movie.,6,15 August 2018,"There seems to be a fair amount of hate directed towards this movie but if you understand what this movie is and what it isn't then it delivers exactly what it intends to do in spades.
What this is not is a serious and realistic horror movie in the vein of Jaws. What it is however is a tongue in cheek family friendly cgi shark movie full of action.
The plot is quite straightforward. A deep water exploration team is investigating the ocean floor as they believe there are even greater depths than there first appears. 
The exploration team are attacked by something unknown and Jason Statham who may have been attacked by the same creature in the past, is encouraged to come out of retirement to come to their rescue. The scene where he is talked back out of retirement and the ensuing cliches is all you need to know about the tone of the movie. Jason Statham knowingly smirks delivering a few of his lines so there is no doubt this isnt to be taken seriously.
This is a very self aware movie that plays for laughs and sends itself up with dialogue which shows that everyone knows how silly the premise is. 
The remainder of the movie is a cat and mouse game between The Meg and the crew once the shark has left its natural habitat and escaped into open waters. 
There are some great action scenes and there is not much dead space between them, its not a boring movie. 
The cast do well with the script and there is a balance between Asian and American actors as this was a joint production. 
The movie is similar to the Sharknado cannon albeit more realistic and with far better production values. 
There are a few good jump scares but there is very little to genuinely scare anyone, very little gore but there are a few deaths along the way.",The Meg
238,Condemned-Soul,Jason Statham vs. Megalodon,7,17 August 2018,"Jason Statham stars in this genre hybrid of science fiction, action, and horror, which is the perfect vehicle for someone of Statham's calibre. He commands the screen with his usual gruff charm, performing typically heroic feats that is expected based on his filmography history and stunt performer tendencies, while stepping above his lesser-known stars as they amiably contribute in his shadow. 'The Meg' delivers the cheese in bite-sized chunks, never threatening to engulf the film in waves of B-movie nostalgia and never hindering sequences that step over the plausibility line; and therefore not hurting the experience. The film's budget and rating mean the megalodon never dares to run amok through an understandable fear of falling foul of box office expectations and younger audiences' stomachs. Jon Turteltaub oversees proceedings with a measured eye, instilling enough suspense within a series of fun set-pieces to offset any deficiencies in character drama.It's been a long time coming to see a believable 75-foot prehistoric shark on film outside of documentary recreations or low-budget shockers generating cheap versions or enlarging stock footage, and so 'The Meg' - with its reported £150 million budget - earns crowd awes at the sheer size of the monster in this film: a shark sporting a jaw size that could swallow you whole, and teeth as large as your hand. The director perfectly captures fleeting glimpses in the early stages to keep audiences eagerly awaiting the moment its full size is visible, and then once it is completely revealed, the cinematography is expertly done to show the appropriate scale of the beast. Whether it's a large fin protruding from the water, an overhead shot showing it swimming underneath oblivious holidaymakers at the beach, or snapping away ferociously at the star with a fantastic angle on its overall mass against a human, the visual effects are top quality.Overall, 'The Meg' is worth watching. It is nothing memorable that necessarily warrants repeat viewings, but its simple story lays the foundations for many taut shark attacks, close shaves, and near escapes for the cast. The music score is effective, the visual effects are strong, and the B-movie thrills are confidently assembled. There's some science to back up the reasons of the supposedly extinct shark's sudden re-emergence into history books, but the main draw of this sci-fi horror is basic and compelling: How will action star Jason Statham defeat a megalodon? That alone is worth the price of admission. 7.5/10",The Meg

243,FilmBuff0409,Wow,2,26 March 2019,"I can't begin to describe how bad this movie was. Just by the trailer or even the name I expected a bad movie, but not this bad. It was painfully predictable and boring. The dialogue was laughable and the special effects were just as bad. I was pre-disposed to not like this movie since Jason Statham plays nearly the same character in all his movies. Now for the science aspect of this movie. Now I know this is targeted more for kids and the general population who don't know any better outside what they've learned from Hollywood about sharks, but for me I just couldn't get past it. For example, the characters in the movie were shocked that there was more than one Megalodon. Obviously there was, these people are supposed to be smarter than average scientists, they should have known better. If this animal was supposed to have gone extinct more than 2 million years ago, but is not, then that means it is reproducing. Sharks need a mate to reproduce therefore there is obviously a population of these animals. And there wouldn't be just one roaming around for two million years, there would be many many generations of them in the ocean. And for the typical sharks are monsters idea, again I understand that this was more a kids movie for cheap entertainment than a science documentary, but sharks do not seek revenge, they will not actively hunt and track people sitting in a boat for days on end. It has better things to do. Guaranteed the sharks does not have an appetite for helicopter debris or shipwrecks, it would be out hunting it's natural prey, which is NOT humans, no matter what the species. Humans never have been and never will be on the natural food chain for sharks.Overall I think anybody with a touch of common sense will find this movie boring and very poorly done.",The Meg
244,timeblank,The Meg is Forgettable,4,12 August 2018,"Another Jaws movie. But let's say the Shark is bigger! Jason Statham is a great. Their he comes to the rescue few people but technically he has to make a decision of sacrificing a few people or risk death. But his decision didn't make a few people happy. Which is somewhat of a reality when people blame each other. But is that the plot? What happened with the Shark? The Shark basically bangs the subs and the boats. However what I find annoying is some of the characters say wow, as something beautiful is happening. The confusing part is the picture is not very colorful or eye popping. It's dark and nothing is there.The last act wasn't very interesting but had funny scenes. As the Shark goes through the beach filled with Chinese people, I don't see the purpose why the scene is important. It doesn't go nowhere with the plot. Killing sharks is so lame. Jason Statham is badass on how he kills it.The music with Mickey your so fine in Chinese version. That music was cringy. The Meg is good entertainment.

I respect all the actors, the directors, the crew and everybody who works in this field, as everybody of them tries to do the best they can. Sometimes it's an Oscar, mostly it's not, so what? I watch the movies without expecting anything, this is the reason why I can enjoy ""the Meg"" or ""Skyscraper""... I'm sorry for those who watch a movie with a lot of expectations and then angrily they write useless reviews on IMDB giving only a very low score... 1 out of 10... are you kidding me? Those are people who are not able to live their lives, they are just always angry, disappointed for everything and they think that it's always the others' fault if they live a bad life or a life that they don't like. I'm so curious to know how good as actors they are when they say... bad acting, that actor should change profession, he/she shouldn't work... I bet that nobody of you is an actor, nor a director and probably never you acted and nor you shot a movie... otherwise reading your review, I could think that you are so brilliant, important and famous that almost every director thinking to shoot a movie, they immediately would call you offering you the main role in their movies... obviously, no way, not even they know you exist! I don't think that Tom Cruise would have been writing reviews here. Poor guys... so envious of the others' success.

246,haydenluz,The Meg,3,13 April 2020,"The Meg, directed by Jon Turteltaub, was based off of Steve Alten's novel, titled The Meg. Turteltaub did a good job knowing his place, not going over the top, trying to compete with titles like Jaws. They had a high budget of one hundred & thirty million dollars, and did the bare minimum utilizating the money. Everything was decently balanced during the first act, but once the second act hit, they overstuffed the narrative with over the top, forceful action, that really took me out of the movie, almost completely.The general consumer, looking for a basic, fast paced, summer time shark movie, with a well known action based actor, would most likely enjoy this movie. Other than that, it's just an unoriginal, coperate cash grab, that had more than a few miss steps. The main issue I had with this film, it should've been rated R. The Meg definitely would've benefited from being more gory & a little more vulgar with their dialogue.The characters and acting pretty much sucked all around. Jason Statham basically plays himself, and that is usually good enough. The romance part to his character they tried to add was so pointless, and beyond unnecessary. Rainn Wilson is supposed to be the comedic relief of the movie, and for the most part, his dialogue was pretty cringey, and not that funny. As for the other NINE supporting characters, they were all super forgettable.
Overall, I'm a huge sucker for any type of shark movie, so I didn't completely hate this movie. This scheme is so overused, that you can never expect a masterpiece anymore, and for that reason, I'd say avoid this flick, unless you're like me, and love shark movies.",The Meg

Sure it's not great, but there are some tense action sequences and the majority of characters are interesting. It's not even overly silly (well, until the third act), and while it's sometimes tongue in cheek with its references and humour, it keeps a consistent tone throughout that allows for chuckles and suspense. The cast are all entertaining, too. Saying that, it is very generic stuff that's quickly forgettable and the fact that Jason Statham is just Jason Statham sort of takes away from some of the believability. While there's not a lot to sink your teeth into, at least your jaws won't break from boredom. 6/10.",The Meg

The little girl was adorable and added to the charm/humor of the story. Of course, it's very predictable but had some unexpected scenes, some humor and lighthearted moments, a decent enough plot, and Yes, a fair amount of cringe-worthy, stupid moments and plot holes as well.

251,themovieparadise,The Meg Doesn't Know if it's The Shallows or Sharknado,5,13 August 2018,"Ever since Jaws came out in 1975, the movie-going audience has had a fascination with sharks. Every time a shark movie comes out, it seems like people flock to go see it. I don't know if people are collectively hoping each film will be as good as Jaws, or if people are just drawn to sharks, but there seems to be worldwide anticipation every time a new shark movie is coming out. Nowadays, there are really only two kinds of shark movies that are made. You have the serious thrillers like The Shallows, and then you have the absurdly ridiculous ones such as the Sharknado films. And when the trailers for The Meg came out, a lot of people thought it would be almost in the vein of a Sharknado movie. I personally thought it looked more like it was going to be just plain dumb instead of being dumb fun, but I know a lot of anticipation surrounded this film. So I went and saw it, and I didn't like it but I also didn't hate it. The problem with The Meg is that it doesn't know which of these two types of shark movies it wants to be. Sometimes it wants to just be big zany fun, and then sometimes it tries to be uber serious with narrative building and character development.

The Meg is a perfect example of what would happen if a Megalodon was still alive today in our time. Throughout most of the movie, the film is extremly intense from start to finish special the scene when chaos ensues as the Megalodon attacks.Rainn Wilson feels like he trying to be the comic relief of the film, which some of the jokes or one-liner did kind of fall flat at times but a really good performance as the Millionaire that owns the research base. Page Kennedy was pretty funny at times throughout the movie, great performance, Ruby Rose as well great performance, Masi Oka more of a cameo as he role in the film is pretty short but with his character he a brave man.pretty much all-round performance from everyone, including Bingbing Li who looks absolutely gorgeous in this film, playing a marine biologist and shark expert who held her own through this film, also with the child star Shuya Sophia Cai playing Suyin (Bingbing Li) daughter, who performance through the film was just incredible with a cuteness level that makes you laugh at certain scenes.The visual effect is amazing showing the intense scene that keeps the audience of the edge of there seat, as there are moments that this movie pushed that 12A to the limit, it the perfect balance of comedy and scares throughout the whole movie.What great is the fact the second half of the film doesn't base itself of the human side of things with the character which is great, because it doesn't just feel like it a Statham film. The first half the film focus on character development which a establish the main character as the story progress, in the second have the blend balance from a focus on character become the team focus on taking down the shark.This is great because it's, not your typical film that focuses on the character through the film, it does focus on the Megalodon, which gives this film its edge. Another thing I noticed which is attention to detail is the shark behaviour which they got perfect in this film, as you notice with a great white documentary you notice that great white will come close to check you out, they suddenly disappear into the darkness. What you not aware of is their sneak attack to catch you off guard, this was put perfectly in the megalodon behaviour as a shark in this film. science in marine biology is perfectly used as well to make it more believable, which works for the story plot as well. There were a few Jaws references and one Finding Nemo reference which was kind of amusing in a intense scene, the pace is perfect for this type of movie.After watching this film, it should get a sequel, Personally, they should do a Jaws reboot because this film shows a perfect base to lead from, in showing just how amazing this film truly is.This is a film I highly recommended Watching on the big screen, as it a must seen, great casting, great performance and one hell of an intense ride through the whole film.

The characters were constantly annoying and somewhat abhorrent especially the token black guy which was especially bad. A lot of the humor fell pretty flat most of the time but Statham remained a constant decent protagonist. When the shark is sparingly shown the CGI was very well done and it looks fantastic, but for once again being the main spectacle we barely get to see him it seems like. Instead we see many different useless scenes and attempts at tone shifts into more emotional aspects of the ridiculous characters . Also the violence and brutality was definitely toned down for this PG-13 cut and I think this movie would've benefited vastly from the original R-rated cut that was turned down by the studios. The finale worked solidly and was decently satisfying but overall this was at best a good yet utterly ridiculous short film that doesn't really separate itself from anything That's come before. The production value was very solid but for 150 million I would hope it would be. I definitely enjoyed the mana one underwater station lighting and design as well as some vast colorful underwater set pieces.

Certain scenes and character moments feel like they are in the wrong places, there is almost zero understanding of the characters, and the screenplay is so lousy that the entire first scene of the movie is rendered completely illogical by the end of the first act. There are too many examples of moments feeling like they are in the wrong place, so here's just one. A character that had problems with Jason Statham earlier in the movie sacrifices himself to save a crew member. This death feels like it is this character's redemption for what he did to Statham, but this character already got his redemption when Statham forgave him at the beginning of the second act.The biggest offender of the zero understanding of the characters comes from Rainn Wilson's character. It seems at times like he is supposed to be a secondary human villain, like the mayor from ""Jaws,"" yet while his worst behavior is indeed reckless and stupid, it never falls to any level of badness. The best example of how monumental the problems with the film's writing is, however, how the first act contradicts the first scene. In the first scene, Statham rescues a bunch of Navy officers from a downed submarine that was attacked by a megalodon. The first act of the movie, however, establishes that the shark lives at the lowest point of the ocean and is kept there by a freezing cold underwater current, yet this shark somehow managed to be where this sub was to attack it and then not be seen by anyone for five years? Bad writing.",The Meg
269,hfreinoso,Actually liked it,8,28 October 2018,There were some mistakes with the film. And the film should have been rated R and have more blood and gore. However it was actually enjoyable. To watch this film was really fun and cool. It is a good shark film. 8/10,The Meg
270,garethvk,"The Best Excuse To Stay Out Of The Water Since ""JAWS""",8,8 August 2018,"The long journey to bring ""The Meg"" to the big screen is finally over as Author Steve Alten's classic book series has arrived.The film stars Jason Statham as Jonas Taylor, an expert in underwater rescues who has to makes a very difficult choice when a rescue goes bad after suffering a very unexpected encounter mid-rescue.Five years later Jonas is out of the rescue game as he has been labeled as unreliable and prone to PTSD so he drinks his time away in Thailand working on local boats.200 miles off the coasts of China is an advanced research lab which is the pet project of a Billionaire named Morris (Rainn Wilson), who arrives in time to witness an attempt by the crew to go deeper than ever thought possible by going through a layer that was previously believed to be the ocean floor. The experiment works and the crew is amazed by their new discoveries until something violently attacks their ship leaving them stranded on the bottom of the ocean.With a limited amount of air and time ticking away, Jonas is recruited despite his numerous refusals as not only is one of the stranded people his ex; but the last transmission sent by the sub mentions how Jonas had been right all along when he had years early claimed they were not alone during the rescue attempt gone bad.Jonas is teamed with a spirited member of the team named Suyin (Bingbing Li), who has taken a sub down ahead of Jonas as she was not willing to wait for outside help to arrive. She locates her comrades and is attacked by a massive shark long thought extinct.The harrowing rescue goes off but again Jonas is faced with a no-win situation and is blamed by a former colleague for the issues.While Morris is eager to exploit the new find for the huge financial opportunity it presents, their plans change when the creature emerges from its contained area and threatens a level of carnage on the seas the likes of which society and the ecosystem are very unprepared for.What follows is a frantic and often intense series of engagements as Jonas and the crew must battle the massive and deadly creature and find a way to survive.
The film has some very solid effects and the intensity at times had people in the press screening partially covering their eyes during some of the more harrowing moments.The cast is solid and work well with one another as the film does what it can to keep some of the characters from being little more than generic victims for the Meg.The movie does differ from the book in terms of being set off China versus California but this was largely due to the joint-production with Chinese owned Gravity Pictures. The film is also much less gory than the book as Director Jon Turteltaub was mandated to deliver a PG-13 film by the studio to improve the odds of returning on the $150.00 million invested in the film. The dialogue is also a bit stilted and formulaic in parts but action films are not known for their complex plots or advanced dialogue and I attributed this largely to the challenges of a blended cast; many of whom do not speak English as their primary language.Despite a delay from its planned 2017 release date, ""The Meg"" is a solid and fun action-thriller that gives audiences one of the best excuses not to go swimming since ""Jaws"". While there have been numerous Shark films over the years, ""The Meg"" deftly weaves good sets and production values with a top-notch cast and lavish visuals to bring the film to life.With several other books in the series already available, I hope we see the next film surface in a few years as I cannot wait to see what comes next

275,margulanabutrlov,The Meg Review,9,22 March 2019,"When a deep sea research team discovers the existence of a megalodon - a 70-foot, supposedly extinct shark - they face a desperate race against time to stop it from eating everything.
It may not shock you to hear this, but The Meg - a movie that apparently exists just so people can make jokes about Jason Statham punching a giant shark - is a bad film.
What's important, though, is to discern the level of intent from director Jon Turteltaub and his team. Have they genuinely stunk the joint out despite their best efforts? Or are they trying to have their cake and eat it too by making a knowingly awful film, a so-bad-it's-good, ready-made cult classic? In short, are they in on the joke?
Worryingly, apart from a couple of moments - one involving a very small dog and a very big fish, and the very last shot - the answer seems to be ""no"". If Turteltaub had gone all-in on making this an oversized, toothy takedown of shark movies, The Meg could have been a winner. As it is, he's made a film about a shark as big as a football pitch that still somehow commits the cardinal sin of being boring. It's merely a compendium of leaden action sequences and terrible dialogue that could have been elevated to kitsch (""That living fossil ate my friend!"") had it been delivered by actors who were up to the task. Sadly, it's not. While Rainn Wilson at least seems to be having fun, as the billionaire benefactor behind the project, he's the only one. Most of the cast, from Cliff Curtis to Li Bingbing, are saddled with roles that can barely be described as archetypes. Not even The Stath, the patron saint of pulp, growling his way through proceedings as rescue diving ace Jonas Taylor like he's playing some weird combo of Quint, Brody and Hooper, makes much of a dent.
Speaking of Jaws, Turteltaub knows that comparisons are inevitable and so wisely, one shark cage moment aside, largely gives Spielberg's classic a swerve. Rightly so, as it's not fit to splash around in the same water. The shark movie to which this owes the biggest debt, right down to certain character types and the odd death scene, is Renny Harlin's schlockbuster Deep Blue Sea. But that was a knowingly awful film that effortlessly nailed the effortlessly entertaining edge-of-insanity tone. Instead, The Meg trails lazily in its wake, constantly reminding you - just as Skyscraper did with The Towering Inferno and Die Hard - that there are better films of its ilk that you could be watching instead.
Turteltaub and his writers at least try to keep things moving at a fair old lick, shifting the action from a claustrophobic base to the open sea and throwing in telegraphed twists every now and again just to keep things vaguely interesting. But the effects rarely rise above Sharknado level, and there's a struggle to have the human characters interact with their huge co-star in a meaningful way. Does that mean that Jason Statham doesn't punch a giant shark? We wouldn't dream of spoiling it, but let's just say if The Meg's giant tongue had been lodged in its gargantuan cheek a touch more, this could have been the summer's greatest guilty pleasure. Instead, it's further proof you can't make a silk purse out of a shark's fin.",The Meg
276,El-Ak,Bad predictable entertaining shark movie!,5,20 November 2018,"The Meg is no doubt entertaining in the presence of ""The Meg"" itself but the story outside it is weak. The action scenes aren't convincing with the characters especially the protagonists escaping and the visual effects were sometimes quite unbearable but was quite well done for The Meg excluding some attacking and engaging scenes. The story is very predicted in almost everything and the music written for the film is not much original and not powerful at all. The direction for the film is really not bad but weak along with the screenplay as most shark films focusing on the shark and leaving the story it's involved in. The movie lacked it's reality in the scenes and the ending which was the worst for me. And how in the hell is there a 25-27 meters shark that in most of the plots for the attacking scenes is withdrawn from one place to another by sound or light even when it's this close to it's pray!!! Now that was very unbearable and not even possible. The scenes when it would appear is very ordinary and predictable and looked like it's a group of a gigantic shark scenes linked together by a thread as a story with ordinary characters and one with a serious face along with a director trying to put it all together in it's order trying to convince us with it by saying ""Here is the most powerful and gigantic shark we can't defeat and here is it's weakness points that can't exist in it"". The story is not moving,thrilling but still entertaining. 4.5/10 for the entertainment and only The Meg's visual effects.",The Meg

Anyway, what a waste of time this was. Practically everything is wrong with this movie, starting with the script, the laughably stupid dialogues, the mediocre effects and the hilarious cast. Not a single character anyone would care about. Rainn Wilson the billionnaire? Ruby Rose? (""What are you doing here?"" ""I designed this."" Yes, sure). Give me a break. Even Henry Gregson Williams screwed up with a lame and completely forgettable score. Others commented on the pandering to the Chinese Market. Hope this is not becoming a trend.

283,leftistcritic,Worst movie ever,1,14 January 2019,"This has be one of the worst movies I have seen since that horrible one called ""The Shallows."" This is like a dumbed down version of Jaws - yikes! The black guy (DJ, played by Page Kennedy) is a stereotype, the fat Chinese kid is dumb and almost gets eaten by the shark, and there is an annoying rich guy, Morris (played by Rainn Wilson). Luckily he gets eaten, which was actually my favorite part of the movie because he is an utter snob and a horrible person who deserved to die.There is a reason I rated this film 1 star out of 10. There are the typical Hollyweird themes of love and intrigue, along with horror. But this is the most silly horror film, if you can call it that, that I've probably ever seen. You could praise the acting of
Jason Statham as Jonas Taylor but I still don't think that would save the film from the depths of horribleness. Not at all.So please, do not watch this movie in a thousand years. You will regret the time you spent watching this piece of trash.",The Meg
284,thisseatofmars,Jason Statham has to fight a giant shark and it's so much fun.,8,22 August 2018,"This is an excellent movie and the best time at the cinema I've had in a long time. I'm not alone in that, either: ask the rest of the people in the cinema who shrieked at the sight of the shark, laughed at the humour, and gasped at the impressive stunts. Why don't they make movies like this anymore? Most of the time now when I go to the movies I'm getting preached to. The only two white men in Spiderman: Homecoming was the villain and a racist teacher, and no one likes teachers (unlike racists on the other hand, haha, that was a joke, have to explain that in today's PC society). Anyway, The Meg is a movie that gives us what we want: an entertaining story. Jason Statham plays a very capable and brave hero named, no joke, Jonah. (I guess Jonah didn't get along with whales *and* sharks.) Jonah and a diverse (but not too tokenly so) group of scientists have to team up to kill a 30 meter-long shark, and the whole show is glorious. You'll see wonderful machines, beautiful oceans, and beautifully scary nightmare sharks. The action is impressive. Jonah repeatedly impresses the team (and us, the audience) with not just acts of heroism, but *insanely* brave acts of heroism. There's a scene where the shark capsizes a boat and both Jonah and Suyin, the love interest, hang from a railing; Suyin falls into the water and Jonah, without even blinking, jumps right in after her. If there was a gigantic shark churning in the brine beneath me, I may be tempted to stay clinging to the rail like a wet cat no matter how nice the love interest's hair looked that day. (But I'm just speculating, I don't know that for sure.)The actress playing Suyin is charming and the chemistry between her and Statham is natural and real. Suyin is a single mother, and the movie ends with almost a cliche: Jonah and Suyin get together, with Jonah becoming not only a husband but a father to Suyin's child. So, the family unit is restored. There's nothing preachy about this: people (moviegoers) like this because it's real. Jonah shows again and again throughout the film that he's a dependable hero: the film's conclusion grants us strong resolution as we know that Jonah will be a dependable father as well.The supporting cast is strong as well. Rainn Wilson plays an eccentric billionaire, Winston Chao and his silver goatee play a wise scientist, and Ruby Rose plays a severely angular-looking woman covered in gross tattoos. On a side note, Rose recently garnered controversy for saying that poverty is sexist. I agree: the homeless are overwhelmingly male. By the way, Ruby Rose's salary is currently between $150,000 and $200,000 per film, and her net worth as of 2018 is estimated to be $2 million. (What's that nonsensical catchphrase Rick from Rick and Morty says all of the time? ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub?"") Anyway, go and see this movie. It's fun and what a Hollywood blockbuster is meant to be. Cinemas in the west right now are dying, and entertainment ""experts"" try to blame services like Netflix, but this is not the case: Hollywood, keep making movies like The Meg and we may just see people willing to return to cinemas. Honestly, it's not too late. We just want to be entertained.",The Meg

288,WooderIce64,Not Particularly Memorable,5,3 April 2020,"The Meg is the definition of ""popcorn movie."" It's got a giant shark, of course, it's got a big-name action star (Jason Statham), and it's got the big action scenes and special effects to match. The plot is something rather familiar; a giant shark thought to have been extinct emerges from the depths of the ocean and causes mass destruction. The trouble is that it doesn't do anything to stand out from the ocean of other blockbusters out there, but at least it's better than the thousands of Jaws rip-offs out there. In that respect, it's good enough to be memorable but also not bad enough to be memorable. However, it has a simple, predictable plot, but it has good visual effects and good action scenes. The shark particularly and all the high-tech facilities in the movie look good. That's all a movie like this needs. But for that matter, why not just watch Jaws?The thing that this movie will likely best be known for is the fact that it was the most successful movie thus far to be a co-production between an American studio and a Chinese studio. With the amount of movies Hollywood blockbusters have been making over there lately, that's something that could very well become a trend as studios try to tap into both of the world's two largest markets.",The Meg

With the help of Jonas played by Jason Statham, he must rescue the scientists from the deep waters as well as kill the megalodon before it reaches the shore.I went into this movie blindly and I found I was...a bit divisive towards it. There are good qualities as well as bad, obviously. One thing I liked about it was that it was on the more silly side. Yes, this movie was pretty campy and B-grade, (despite the multi-million dollar budget) but they know it and embrace it. The look of the sharks tend to resemble the ones from Jaws, which seems to be a stylistic choice, and I like it. I found the characters surprisingly entertaining and likable. Jason Statham, for example plays a fearful man who has a habit of leaving at the wrong time. I also really liked the chemistry between the characters.Of course, I do have my problems with this movie, given its rating. The movie seems to divide itself in two parts, which I found to be a bit lazy through a writing perspective. I know I sound like I'm nitpicking, but I can only say this without spoiling it. Another problem I have is towards the third act. I don't like how there's a large chunk of time that's focused on small, minor characters. It just feels like that's a bit of a time-water for the most part. I do understand that they want to give side characters some time in the spotlight, but they really do spend too much time on them in the long-run.Despite my criticisms, I still had a mostly good time watching it, and I feel like shark movie enthusiasts would too.6/10",The Meg

I was finally able to get that with The Meg, I didn't feel as though I wasted my money going to see it. I don't like when people post spoilers so I won't do that but if you are one of the types that loved the original Jaws movies and are not obsessed with only ""gore-fest"" type stuff then definitely give this one a chance! True that it is not over the top bloody, why is that such an important factor these days?? I am honestly surprised at all the negative reviews from people. I'm not sure what they were expecting and I know that there was a bit that had to be cut from the movie but it was definitely still a fun watch. One that I was able to take my kids to see. My daughter especially is obsessed with shark movies so we have seen them all... Every single one (and we have seen more than a few extremely bad ones i.e. sand sharks and ice sharks and more than I care to name) that have come out since and including the Jaws movies. This was a fun way to end summer vacation for all of us... Maybe my expectations were just lower due to all of the shark movies I have had to watch for my daughters sake over the past few years but I believe that also gives me a good perspective and an open mind.

VERY Disappointing,4,10 August 2018,"When I saw the trailer, I just thought they were going to rip off Jaws, and while they technically didn't for the most part, it was still pretty bad. I liked a few parts but most of it was pretty bad. First of all, the attempts at humor were laughable, but not in a good way. Nearly every joke was just plain old stupid and made my roll my eyes. Everyone else was laughing, so maybe its just me, but then again I heard them all saying ""this is really scary"" so I have a feeling I wasn't in the smartest or seasoned theater group. While some of the action scenes were passable but many were just so terribly filmed and choreographed it didn't catch the eye or even sometimes not allowing you to have a sense of whats actually going on. That sucks because the action was the only reason I went. The film even mentions 2 battleships, which honestly would have been awesome but the finale they chose was just kind of lame, was hoping for a Piranha 3D beach sequence, but what I got just made me say.... meh.... It was also MUCH longer that it needed to be. A very long intro combined with several false endings, meaning you think its over but its not.

300,Mccadoo,Wasn't expecting much...got even less than that,3,7 June 2019,"I took this movie for what it is, a mindless popcorn movie in which you check your brain at the door and escape into an action flick for a couple of hours. So going in my expectations weren't all that high.Turns out even that was overly optimistic. As has already been said here many times, this movie was just a small cut above one of those cheesy SyFy movies on cable. A very small cut above. Considering it's budget that's pretty pathetic.There was no real plot to speak of, the storyline jumped all over the place and it seemed that the director kept changing his mind about this being a comedy or an action movie. Maybe that's why it failed miserably at both.The characters were totally unlikable and unsympathetic. I honestly didn't care if they all died, with some I was hoping it would be soon. And they were just caricatures of people you've seen in a dozen other movies in the past; the token black guy who was supposed to be comic relief and wasn't. The concerned and sensitive boss who just wanted everyone to be ok. The evil rich industrialist who we were all supposed to hate because Hollywood really hates rich industrialists even though they're all rich too. And of course you have to have the angry, edgy man-hating female scientist, what would a modern action movie be without her? Btw; for the actress portraying this character, whose name escapes me at the moment; if you find it necessary to cover yourself with that many tattoos in an attempt to express yourself then you may want to thing about taking a communications course, or even a writing course because you're seriously lacking in some psychological aspect that allows we humans to communicate and express ourselves...without turning our bodies into a billboard. And another thing; for God's sake eat a pizza, or a cheeseburger, or something!The acting in this movie was horrible, the three Asian actors turned in some of the worst acting performances I can remember seeing, anywhere. The little Asian girl was such a terrible actor that I couldn't believe the lead didn't turn around to the director during his scene with her and demand they get someone who could you know...actually act! God she was awful, they all were.Finally, I think this movie should get the prize for characters doing the most abysmally stupid things possible. Time after time one of them did something that no intelligent person would even consider. Gee, there's a giant shark in the water somewhere around here, so why don't I just tread water here in the ocean after falling off the boat and chat with my friends. I mean, what could possibly go wrong?? People off the street wouldn't do the stupid stuff these people did, repeatedly, and these dolts were supposed to be trained scientists.

Yes, to me it does. Like most film adaptions of books, certain changes are made. The Meg is no different. To me though, I would rather see a different take for a film adaption of a novel, instead of trying to make it faithful 100%. If I wanted a 100% faithful adaption, I would just reread the book.Some people complain it went too far from the source material. Well, so did Jurassic Park and Jaws. Both were not faithful to the novels, and yet were giant blockbusters. And the same goes for The Meg. I think everyone involved in the film did an amazing job, and its great to finally see a great shark film on the cinema screens.If you love the movie, then make sure to read the entire MEG series of novels starting with MEG, THE TRENCH, MEG - PRIMAL WATERS, MEG - HELL'S AQUARIUM, MEG - NIGHSTALKERS and MEG -GENERATIONS by Steve Alten",The Meg
326,rustonreviews,"Big, cheesy fun.",6,13 August 2018,"Loosely based on the 1997 novel Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror by Steve Atlen, The Meg pits rescue diver Jonas Taylor (Stathem) against a Megalodon; a prehistoric species of shark long believed to be extinct. When a deep sea dive into the Marianas Trench goes awry, Taylor is called in to rescue the stranded crew, which just so happens to include his ex-wife. Reluctant at first, (as a result of a rescue mission five years prior in which two men were left to die) Taylor soon discovers a Megalodon to be responsible for the attack on the submersible. Originally attached to direct the film was horror maestro Eli Roth, who dropped out of the project due to creative differences. Roth, best known for his schlock horror flick Hostel (2005), is a filmmaker notorious for depicting hyper violence on screen, and yet The Meg features barely any gore at all. Instead, victims of the Megalodon are comedically swallowed whole; a far cry from Quint's brutal demise in Jaws (1975) or any of the ridiculously gruesome deaths in B movie excellence Deep Blue Sea (1999). Whereas The Meg doesn't have the riotous gore of Deep Blue Sea or the heightened suspense of Jaws, it proudly sits more comfortably within the league of low budget shark movies you'd find on the Syfy channel, except with a much larger budget backing it and an A list star front and centre. Statham is, as always, a likable screen presence and the supporting cast are all completely serviceable, but not particularly memorable. The Meg knows exactly what it is, and it doesn't try to be anything different. It's certainly cheesy, but it's without a doubt a lot of super-sized fun. There are five installments in Atlens Meg series, (including a prequel novella) meaning there is plenty of source material to provide the basis for a film franchise in the same vein as the ever hilarious Sharknado series (2013-2018), which concludes this year with its hotly anticipated sixth installment. Although there isn't anything new to be found within The Meg, it is still an enjoyable watch.",The Meg
327,MplusA92,Wait !! This is not a comedy movie ?!,5,19 November 2018,"We usually watch this kind of movies to enjoy the light story, the impressive visual effects and the action which is present between the man and the creature fights.This could be a good movie if some elements which made the experience worse would be absent, like the rush that you will feel from the first scenes, the different proportion of shark sizes, which showed the 70 foot creature small in some angles and huge in others, also the regular size sharks looked tiny and the characters dealt with them as pets, while other movies build their own plot on those regular size sharks.The background of each character is introduced very briefly, but the main problem that the dialogue is kinda funny and cartoonish. You will notice weird reactions in abnormal situations, for example: when they survive a shark attack and jump to the boat, they start to laugh to each other and celebrate as the shark is dead, but it's still in the water and can attack them again, and by the way this happened a lot.Most probably this happened due to the chinese touch on the movie, who tend to show cuteness in very intense situations.The plot is simple but has many layers, once you think they are safe, a bigger problem happens, and this is a good thing. They also did every complication could happen in a Shark movie, even if some of them is copied from other movies.""Jason Statham"" is the main character who always has solid face with least amount of reactions and a smile or two to the female star, all other characters did their roles well, but you may notice similarities between this cast and the cast of ""Titanic"", it's obvious when you see the man who controls the robot in ""Titanic"" and the guy in the submarine, is it a chance ? May be.The visual effects are acceptable here, we didn't have a chance to see the outer shape of the marine station properly, also the meg didn't look scary because we didn't see enough details of it.The main problem with the script that everything is expected, starting from the winning sides, till the dying characters which are a lot here, that the living ones didn't react to their deaths by even one tear.Finally, it's an average shark disaster movie, it can be enjoyable if you ignored the little details and looked to the whole movie as one piece.

341,Scarefish,The Smeg,1,18 August 2018,"The Meg is the embodiment of everything wrong with the average shark flick, and yet it manages to sink lower than the bottom of the deepest, bluest sea. Horrible one-dimensional characters, unimaginative cinematography, and a story so surface level it's an insult to the ground floor are only a few of the problems this bottom-feeding film has. This film is incredibly lazy and relies entirely on special effects to carry its paper-thin plot and horrifically uninteresting characters through a mind-numbing two hours.One fundamental flaw that one will notice immediately is the tone, as it's nothing like the trailer advertises. The trailer makes the film seem a lot more wink-wink than it actually is, but there's hardly an ounce of fun to be had in the film aside from a stupid gag with a dog, akin to a certain laughable scene from Independence Day. Most of the film is played straight for the most part, and it's not nearly as over-the-top as a shark movie needs to be nowadays. I mean seriously, you either have to go big or go home, so either go the stupid schlockfest route like Sharknado, or go for more of a serious Jaws approach. The movie is somewhere in the middle and rather than feeling unique it feels like an ungodly chimera that needs to be taken out of its misery. There are many scenes that drag on far too long with people talking and nothing really happening, and since the movie isn't very serious there is never any suspense throughout it.There's also the issue of the violence being toned down by the studio. Jon Turteltaub apparently had to cut many gory moments out of the movie to secure a PG-13 rating for marketing purposes, to which even he was disappointed. What results is a very mild-mannered shark flick that constantly feels like it pulls its punches. Though I'm sure this film toed the lines of the PG-13 rating, it doesn't feel like it, as there's not much to be invested in and the result is low-impact violence that isn't worth its weight in beans.There's a bunch of characters in the movie and none of them have any depth besides trying to be a certain basic template for just about anyone to relate to. The diversity hire aspect is also apparent to an excessive extent here, with some hilariously ironic stereotyping to boot, such as nerdy Asians and a black man who can't swim. There's a clear goal here of getting into China's wallets with some mild marketing to less-profitable minority groups that's only thinly veiled by dumb, likely polarizing humor, given how easily offended radical liberals, i.e. the target demographic, tend to be at immature humor nowadays.I felt the sound design was awful. I was bored out of my mind during what was intended to be the thrilling climax of the film, and it instead felt like a Coldplay music video. The music was not suspenseful or memorable, and dipped between the grating noise and soothing ambience on a whim with a motley crew of instruments all tossed together in a quantity over quality sort of fashion. There are moments in which the music sounds fine, and other moments in which it sounds completely lacking in confidence and desperate to be more grandiose than it truly is. The score wasn't even the problem though, as I found myself crippled with the cringe of the movie being book-ended with a Thai version of ""Hey Mickey"" just out of nowhere. It left me with an empty feeling inside, of which I would need weeks of counseling to reverse. The applause from the audience rang out like explosions in my brain, leaving me scared and disoriented. The CGI blood on the screen gave me a temporary case of PTSD.The name is also incredibly stupid. I get that the book is called 'Meg,' but that's even worse. The Meg that immediately comes to just about anyone's mind is Meg Griffin from Family Guy, and I don't think I need to explain further why that's an issue. Megalodon is also an incredible title, and is in fact what Mastodon used as a song title one time, and it didn't make people cringe, so that's probably a better route to take.The Meg isn't stupid enough to be entertaining, nor is it self-aware enough to be charming, and it most certainly isn't shot well enough to be exciting. This is a terrible shark film, and it's not like I'm too harsh on the genre either. I'd recommend Deep Blue Sea and Sharknado for dumb fun, and Jaws for a more serious horror film. This movie is basically all the worst elements of the countless shark films that came before it. It barely attempts to cover up its flaws, and as a result just feels like a clear bait-and-switch meant to keep audiences in their seats long enough that they can't get a refund.",The Meg

346,jmhammerstein-980-842586,Watching paint dry or grass grow is better,1,30 March 2021,This movie is absolutely atrocious. This might be the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of truly awful ones. There is nothing in this movie that comes anywhere close to remotely good. The makers of this should be ashamed for doing this to the audience. They should be brought up on criminal charges or at least be fired and never allowed to work in the entertainment industry again. All copies of this movie should be destroyed.,The Meg
347,joshfedderson,Makes Jaws look like a Pushover,8,12 August 2018,"I feel the producers made this movie to see if they could beat Jaws at size and scares, and I have to admit they did a good job on that. The story is about a research team, as they have the technology to go deeper into the ocean and study life there, as they do so the team runs into an prehistoric shark called Megolodon a creature thought to have been extinct 2.8 million years ago. Things go wrong, and all hell breaks loose, but one man is determined to stop and kill the beast. The Meg is a fun movie and I liked the fact they brought in a prehistoric beast into the picture, think Jaws, but three times as big. The fact that this was an actual creature that lived millions of years ago makes it even more believable and fun. The stars of the show are Jason Stratum who plays the main character and the hero. I didn't recognize any other character, except the one dude who is from ""The Office"" who plays the millionaire funding the whole research program. All in all The Meg was very entertaining except the reason I give it an 8 is because I felt the deaths in the story were to quick and and some parts were predictable, I also think Jason was trying to hard to be the hero, I mean he acted like more of a super hero then just a regular man, and I found it cool but I felt he overdid it on the heroic part. The film had lots of good scares and was fun, it's a good movie to take a date too or a friend. 8/10 for The Meg",The Meg

349,Kristamw,The Meg is Awesome,10,11 August 2018,"Steve Alten's story is incredibly displayed on the screen! A lover of the Jaws franchise, I immensely enjoyed this action-packed thriller. Jon Turteltaub's work is right up there with Spielberg's in the way of three important elements:
 
1. Excitement
2. Nervous tension
3. Humor
 
Three research scientists are stranded in a submarine in the deep--below 11 meters. Jason Statham (Jonas) is approached for his expertise in rescue missions, and because he is only one in three who have attempted and survived one at that depth; five years earlier, Jonas saved all but one passenger on his ship in a similar situation. Now, Jonas is busy living and drinking the life in Thailand, and living with survivor's guilt, so he is reluctant to have any part of this assignment.
 
Until he learns that this mission involves his ex-wife. Until he hears the cries of the three scientists.
 
The Meg doesn't hesitate to propel us into action sequences right from the start. The rush of adventure is high and heart-stomping. One of my favorite scenes is the moment we get our first close-up of the prehistoric shark. Little girl Meiying ( Sophia Cai ) is playing in the underground facility when the shark pulls itself all the way up to the glass--you get a full picture of its face, and the magnitude of it is captivating!
 
There are plenty of moments with the Meg, something I appreciate, both up close moments--you know, the expected jump scares--as well as distant shots of its fin fishtailing (yes, I said it) through the ocean in swiftly nearing proximity to a large cast of characters.
 
To offset some of the intense moments, we get wordplay between several of the characters, creating fun endearing moments that build on the dynamics of multiple relationships.
 
Bonus: Meiying is super precious and wonderful to watch in her interactions with her mom and Jonas, eliciting lots of smiles and tender laughter.",The Meg

Indeed, everything is predictable, so just go with the flow and enjoy the special effects, the comical situations, that stupid guy Statham who's stiffness is a joke ""an sich"".

352,MichaelNontonMulu,A Jason Statham VS Giant Prehistoric Shark Movie,7,9 August 2018,"This movie was actually pretty good in term of scaring people out of the sea. Yes the movie premise especially the second half was a bit similar to the 1975 Jaws movie, but the special effects here were obviously a lot better now. Now from the angle of a movie where the shark was the main focus, this one did not disappoint in term of scaring us especially during the scenes where Megalodon was chasing its victim(s). It certainly made my wife and some of the audience screamed most of the time whenever it appeared. Problem was the movie was rated PG-13 which made it felt a bit lighter than I would have expected for a shark attacks movie.The movie felt a bit light to my opinion as it was not entirely scaring or thrilling us nonstop. Throughout the 113 minutes duration, some of the time the movie gave us occasional brief funny moment. I believe it was the aim of director Jon Turteltaub to make the movie not too dark or heavy. Every now and then there would be some light humor that quite cheered us. But it did make the appearance of Megalodon felt not frequently enough to my opinion.The movie also had quite a large cast in the supporting roles such but the one person who stood out from the rest was to my opinion the young newcomer Shuya Sophia as Meiying (Suyin's daughter). I personally thought she stole the show with her adorable comments and actions as a smart 8 year old girl. Seeing this movie in a large studio with Dolby Atmos sound system was very satisfying as it gave the terror felt more so with the very huge shark on screen. Plus of course the sound effects were also very good. The movie did not have any mid or post end credit scene, unless you just want to enjoy listening to the song ""Mickey"". Overall this was a movie purely for fun. It was to give us some kind of nice adventure with very big shark chasing human. It was not as completely scary and suspenseful from beginning till the end like Jaws or a survival movie with great acting like The Shallows. It was a summer movie with good special effects and something that would give you fun for almost 2 hours, though it might have probably been a lot enjoyable had the Megalodon was given larger screen time to scare us more. But anyway, if you are looking for something like this, want to see Statham fight a giant prehistoric shark and do not mind the so-so plot, then you surely could enjoy this movie. However, be warned that if you prefer your movies to be very logical or you want a very nonstop action, then this might not fully satisfy you.

I was expecting lots of changes, there's rarely ever a movie based from a book that does the book justice. This, however, is about 1% or less of the book. I could have been ok with that if it worked.

358,AverageJoesDriveInPodcast,A fun theater-going experience!,7,12 August 2018,"I will be upfront with anyone who hasn't watched this yet. Mindset-wise if you go in thinking more along the lines of Deep Blue Sea rather than JAWS you'll probably have a good time. If you want serious, deep storylines and Oscar-caliber performances you probably should avoid it because this isn't it. Also on that note, why the hell would you go see this movie in the first place if you want that?This movie is just stupid fun with tons of funny moments. The comedy aspect of it actually caught me off guard. I expected a few funny moments here and there like most films of this ilk, but this is just straight up funny throughout. There are plenty of grandiose action sequences. A character you just flat out hate because he's such an atypical ass-hat and some beautiful CGI. The film itself is very well shot and I even had a hard time telling whether the FXs were practical or CGI in spots. They blended stuff together well. I thought the acting was solid for what this film is. It's about what I expected. Like anything, there were a few things here and there that could have been better. But, none of those things were enough to hinder my enjoyment of it. I personally would have liked to see it be a tad bit gorier. I think that might have pushed this up a notch especially with the type of story this. On the other hand, that's more of a preference than an actual hindrance type thing. This was exactly what I wanted out of a Summer Blockbuster style film. It's a fun theater-going experience. It's the type of movie you want to see on the big screen with a great sound system. What I would consider a perfect popcorn flick.My Rating: 7/10",The Meg
359,bobbyf,"Good Summer Fun, but that's all.",6,24 January 2019,"Let's face it: no one lining up to see a movie called ""The Meg"" that is a blatant ""Jaws"" -inspired ripoff is expecting an award-worthy film. I mean, no knock on Jason Statham, but can you really expect a critically-acclaimed film with him attached as the star? So, I'm not entirely sure what people were expecting. The ultra-low reviews are uncalled for. This is a fun film with lots of humor, jump scares, etc. and it leaves you with that same pit-in-the-stomach fear (endless, bottomless black sea that can hide anything until it's upon you) that most films of this genre do. The acting here is adequate. I think the producers were smart to include Asian cast members to appeal to the Asian market. They are all excellent and bring an almost ""Godzilla"" - like element to the film. The CGI and special effects are decent enough. That technology has come a long way and you've got to be particularly knit-picky to even notice it. The story is a little lacking, but apparently sone of it was made-up on the fly. In the end, you get a half-decent Jason Statham movie about a big-a** shark. I watched it with my son, and in spite of our shared apprehension, we enjoyed it. We laughed, we jumped; there was one point my son pulled his legs up on the couch... Worth the watch if you're into the concept. Just don't expect too much.",The Meg

It is not a ""wauw"" movie, but it is worth seeing is you haven't already - good mix between Deep Blue Sea and Jaws.The last 20 minutes is a little bit of a knock off between an underwater Star Wars hunt and Pearl Harbor.... Jason Statham in a tiny underwater boat with missiles having a huge fight with an insane big shark - but a knife in it, rides along and killing it by a sharp thing in the eye.....

362,Maz-hell,The expensive son of Jaws... That has brain damage.,5,22 August 2018,"Lets talk about shark movies. Most of them are terrible. This one is no exception.With a budget around 20 times bigger than Jaws the ideas are 20 times lower and I can almost hear you saying ""But this is not jaws..."" Yeah, it isn't. It has many scenes trying to homage the movie. The scene at the beach was almost a retelling of the beach scene in jaws. The boat capturing the shark was also another homage, the photo aside the megalodon, the destruction of the first boat even has similar lines, the rich asshat almost is as the mayor of the movie in the ""we cant go slow. We found something valuable"". So if they don't want to be considered a retelling, well, you should not try to imitate it.The first half of the movie tries to be original. Some guys that we never find out which credentials they hold are investigating about a theory that the bottom of the ocean is not the bottom. Turns out they are right but it is full of life we considered extinct and by accident they release the megalodon, which apparently can survive in colder waters and in lower pressures it uses to. Convenient.The second half of the movie is a retelling of the original jaws but high tec and low brain. Don't believe me? A hardened, usually drunk badass try to shoot at a shark using a boat, while no one important dies, saves a beach full of people, makes the shark into bits and is almost left stranded in the middle of the ocean.The dialog is fine at most. Extremely cliché most of the time. I could predict it more than 10 times. Your movie should not be this predictable.The acting is fine. Except the little girl, which by the way was there for absolutely no reason except try to add drama. The emotive scenes are completely not earned. No one cared about the fat guy, or the japanese guy, or the main actress' dad or the doctor until they died and then nobody cared anyways. They sweep that in less than a minute.Most subplots were absolutely unnecesary. More unfortunately they are not abandoned: the little girl has no dad subplot, the ex's subplot, the whales subplot, the rich guy is an ass subplot, the love subplot... none of them went anywhere except into cliche land.I will give them points.

I actually didn't want the movie to end.

Trying to be each of them at certain points led to the movies downfall. They didn't really know what lane they were trying to go down. It is almost like they wanted to make a serious action movie, but after filming they didn't like what they saw, so they added Rainn Wilson to bring the comedy.
 The biggest downfall of the film that no director or actors could possibly try to overcome is having Jon and Erich Hoeber as writers. Two of my least favorite writers in Hollywood, who brought to us another eerily similar movie, Battleship. From start to finish the lines were as cheesy as you can get, the plot was as predictable as ever, and it almost just went for a rip-off of jaws. 
 The rest of the team tried their best to pull it back together, but just couldn't do it. This was a movie written for a Chinese audience. Lots of CG action scenes, explosions, Chinese actors, and still somehow an Asian setting for a movie that takes place in the ocean. This movie could have been a lot better had they established a single solid mood. 
 The director was a plus to the film at points as well, with a lot of creative shots and well paced scenes. His downfall was his ability to create tension and to throw in an abnormally large number of jump scenes into a fun movie.

First I want to address the Chinese influence in the room. If you like sub-par, nonsensical movies where China and Chinese things are shoehorned in as hard and as often as possible for no real reason, then this just might be the movie for you! If you want to watch several Chinese ""actors"" who cant act (Bingbing Li and Shuya Cai... God if you got used to seeing good child actors like those in Stranger Things are you in for a treat seeing this kid ""act"") in an unimpressive ""spectacle flick"" then this movie might be for you! If you're a teen or sub-teen who thinks flicks like Paranormal Activity are good, then check this bad boy out! If you're all of China, well you've probably already watched this.For real though, if you have a pulse and are not in a medically induced coma, dont waste precious brain cells on this! The Meg is an extraordinarily predictable, laughably bad (but not so bad its good) effects driven garbage movie with a pointless plot. It is the typical ""Chinese funding movie"" where you can clearly see the influence the investors had in regards to the movie. There really isnt a plot, which would have been fine if there was some character development but there is no character development either. Even the special effects were VERY meh and 2008 video game cut-scene feeling. The ""best"" thing about this movie was Jason Statham, but he had little to work with and even his acting felt... disappointed. I wouldnt say hes phoning it in, but he DEFINITELY is not giving his all. All of the other actors, including Rainn Wilson, were pretty awful. Unfortunately there are several long shot attempts for us to empathize or care about characters but when their acting is worse than a 1st grade play its hard to take seriously. And Bingbing Li... we get it, you're a pretty face who probably did a LOT to get into the position you are now but you're not a good Chinese actor and you're a tremendously terrible actor in every western film that your bf paid for you to star as. Surprisingly Shuya Cai was even worse than Bingbing, but she at least has the excuse of age on her side. There is really only one thing going on in this film: Who is the Meg gonna kill? These kills are telegraphed that these people are going to die a mile away with crappy lines that are supposed to be foreshadowing but are HORRIBLE. Then comes the main star of the show, the Meg. It acts completely unrealistically as a natural predator. You know they just wanted it to act like a movie murderer, but they have it do so many stupid things that are out of character for an apex predator of the seas. It ignores abundant food sources, stays at or near the top of the ocean, and instead of going deep into the ocean and away from shore, somehow this super shark just KNOWS that there is a nearby Chinese beach brimming, and I mean BRIMMING, with swimmers several miles away. While that sounds like a good place for a super shark to go have a nom, there are vastly better, more plentiful fish in the sea than Chinese people on a beach. How and why it makes a bee line to that beach is a mystery of bad writing. The way they 'take care' of the Meg at the end of the flick is probably one of the dumbest, lamest, so unlikely of a scenario that I let out a huge laugh. This has got to be the worst ending in a mainstream movie I've seen since I cant remember when! The whole thing was over China-fied that it almost felt like one long advertisement for China. That wouldnt have mattered if they made it part of the script for some reason but no, its Chinese for the sake of being Chinese so Chinese audiences can go OOOO CHINESE!3/10 for Statham and... well I couldnt really think of anything else. I was going to drop it to a 2 but I guess the effects bring it to a 3. However bad you might think it is, trust me its MUCH worse than that! IF!!!! you want a super dumb turn off your brain and watch pretty colors on the screen, then see if you can get through this sludge. Everyone else STAY AWAY!!!!!The worst part is that if the Chinese investors actually let filmmakers do their thing, I' sure someone could have made this unique or interesting... but its just not.",The Meg

I thought it was a good film ok it not Oscar worthy but you just leave your brain at the door and away you go.. 9/10.,The Meg
391,robertandrews-63249,Better than some would have you believe,7,11 August 2018,"I dont know why people have such a hard time accepting a movie for what it is. When one goes to see a film such as meg, with ol' Jason in it, one shouldn't be expecting an oscar worthy film. It's meant to be fun and loud and energetic. It was all those things, especially if you see it on a huge screen like I did. Look, the acting wasnt perfect but it wasnt was enough to throw the film, the story was good for what it was and characters played well together. It's like a modern armature jaws. I got what I expected and am happy with that result. It was fun and I would say go see it, or wait till it's on netflix but see it none the less. I do agree with pippin...see it for pippin if for nothin else.",The Meg

Jason is wonderful and pulls off his part but everyone else is kind of dull. The dialogue is cheesy as hell but what do you expect in these type of movies.,The Meg
393,SeanDTheFilmMaker,Just a super fun summer flick!!!!,8,5 February 2019,"Great humor. Fun cast. Nothing too heavy or graphic. Just something you can take the whole family to and have a good time. Again fun light hearted humor that just kept ya smiling through the whole thing. We need movies like This fromntine to tine that dont try to go over board or over the top in twists and turns and convoluted plot schemes in a desperate attempt to be edgy. This is just plain good old fashion movie fun. Wish i saw it in theaters. But definitively going to buy.
DO NOT CONFUSE WITH SHARKNADO. THANK YOU",The Meg
394,PeterWorthers,"Oh Jason Statham, who can't you save?",5,19 August 2018,"Seriously, we all owe Jason Statham a ton of gratitude. Hes saved us from so many evil/strange situations over the years that he should get the key to the entire planet. THIS time he saves us from a really really big shark called a Megalodon (or Meg if you're nasty) 
All hell breaks loose as usual, there's drama, suspense, comedy and even a little hints at romance (wink, wink) And the cast put together for this thrilling adventure work well together. The special effects are spot on and the Meg itself almost made never want to go near any water ever again. However, the plot is kind of lame (past the whole billions and billions year old super shark that just appears out of nowhere) and you find yourself asking questions that never get answered. This is a big summer action flick, plain and simple, you will not leave the theater with a greater grasp on life or the answer to all the worlds problems. You WILL walk away for this about $30 lighter.The action keeps coming and coming and coming and coming so much that one problem hasn't even finished and they are on to another. At times it seems like the writers went, ""Ok, so this is a Jaws movie, but it's NOT Jaws and we have to make people know that. So let's bombard them with so much action that they wont have time to realize what is really going on but still throw in Jaws Easter eggs just to make people think of Jaws when in fact they are not watching Jaws. Now, who's up for lunch?""But there were a few things that bothered me and if you would, please humor me for a few moments:1-Suyin works with her father on the station, OK i get that, undersea charting the uncharted and preforming experiments billions of miles underwater, BUT YOU BROUGHT YOUR 10 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER TOO? Does she not need to go to school? Or not be around BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF TECHNOLOGY? Mother of the year here.2-Speaking of Suyin, her acting along with her daughters acting was terrible. It either seemed they were being dubbed over later in english or that they would read their lines and then pretend to act real quick before they forgot.3-I understand they are in tense situations, but every time a character cried on screen it was the most unwatchable forced acting I have ever seen. My 7 year old fake cries way better then these actresses.4-Again with Suyin, she decides to go under to rescue her friends, takes so long talking to her daughter and what not, that NO ONE thought to stop her, or disable her craft so she couldn't leave or anything?5-So they are trapped under sea and THE ONLY person on the planet that can save them is Statham? You know what he did, what he went through, that hes is not in any condition to mount a rescue, that even the doctor on board things hes a certified wack job, yet you STILL bring him on board then expect him to snap right out of it and be a superman again. You guys must have been really desperate.6-Who the hell created these crafts they use? Were these on loan from SeaQuest DSV? Is a Jedi missing his cruiser? Man, Aqua Man is gonna be pissed when he sees his ride is gone.7-They are billions of miles under water in a trench of mystery and they STILL have a clear signal and video feed? I'm on the surface and STILL have to wait for Netflix to buffer half the time. Forget finding fish, let's get them to work on the Internet and Wi-Fi coverage above sea level.8-Ok just a few seconds ago Jason you just barely escaped the Meg coming after you to eat you then Syuin gets her cage trapped in the Megs mouth and you throw yourself into the water with no gear, no weapons and no plan. Don't do that, haven't you seen Jaws?9-Multi Billionaire Douche claims he has taken full responsibility of the situation and made sure everyone is notified that needs to be and are surprised to find out he lied about it all. Seriously? Just a while earlier he was telling them how this was a great scientific discovery and it would make them rich and blah, blah, blah. Name ONE time the self centered rich guy actually learned a lesson in the end..I'll wait.....no I won't.10-Syuin again. Now I'm all for strong female characters. Great, kick some ass! But every time she tried to help or save the day in any capacity she would cause three more problems and once again turn into the damsel in distress. I'll inject the poison, now i'm caught, now the Meg has me, Now the Meg is trying to eat me, now I'm trapped, now i broke my mask, now im passing out. How does that show a strong independent woman that can take care of herself as well as take names?11-Then after everything that happened on the station they STILL take the kid onto the boat for the final ""We're going to finish this and kill it now"" sequence? SO you could have very well killed you daughter and yourself and since you dad just died pretty much end you bloodline right there?12-I did get a kick out of the humpback whales at the beginning. One was named Gracie and then Rainn Wilson meets the station doctor and makes ANOTHER Star Trek reference. (I see what you did there Meg and I approve) But I digress.Like I said, the Meg is definitely a Bang Bang boom shoot em up kill kill summer action movie. It's not going to win any awards and you probably won't be adding this to your Blu Ray collection, but it is a good movie to see if you want to get out of the summer heat. Just please for the love of God, don't go into the water...",The Meg
395,yeolit,Try to hard to impress,6,30 September 2018,"The initial part of this movie was quite exciting, though a bit clichéd. A good man deeply misunderstood was blamed for making a tough decision, ends up being the only person to be turned to when there is a crisis. The plot started off well eniugh, but obviously a lot of happenings were forced, there is obvious plot armour, very obvious use of Chinese in this film and some subcultures mixed in (the kid and Pippin for example, which seems to frown upon spoiling children and focus on pets over humans).And of course, the main plot line has been used before but to avoid spoilers, let's say the presentation could have been much better. The way this Movie works is setting the foundation ( which is solid), before delving into tons of jump scares and irrelevant small details (the kid and the dog for example), which diverges the attention of the plot.To be honest, having tension is nice but if it is too much, the plot line will break (pun intended). Comedy was very well placed at the beginning but later there was virtually no comedy.Strong start, okay middle, weak finish. And by that I mean very weak, say a 2/10 finish.",The Meg

Overall, the acting was brilliant and enjoyed the film. The storyline was great and rather advanced but there wasn't that many moments where you were like ""I've never seen anything like this before"". Quite a few of the characters didn't explain their back story completely so when they were stuck in a situation you don't feel for them as there weren't enough character moments for the majority of the cast. Though there were some who you did feel for because of the way they acted and advanced on the characters back story.

It's a much more liar movie than the original, here we have a ""Mega Shark"", a King Kong of the waters. A movie with great cinematography that enchants. I recommend.The filmmaker is the American Jon Turteltaub, who directed among others, The Legend of the Lost Treasure (2004 and 2007) and (2007), Phenomenon (1996). The protagonist is the well-known English actor, Jason Stathan, who has done among others, Adrenalina (2006), Fast & Furious 7 (2015) and Spy Who Knew Less (2015).",The Meg
400,Shadowboy_25cm,No revelation. Solid high-budget mainstream no-brainer shark movie,6,30 August 2021,"Don't expect a realistic shark movie here and no revelation in the cinematic shark sector.The megalodon and its evolution had to be adapted for ""cinematic"" purposes, so the story remains brisk and entertaining. Because that's what the film is: brisk and entertaining. A no-brainer with some interesting twists that suggest the literary source(s). In addition, a lot of references (sometimes subtle, sometimes with the sledgehammer) to ""Jaws"" & Co and finished is the entertaining shark blockbuster.Unfortunately, somewhat anemic due to the targeted PG13 mainstream target group. That's a minus.There would have been more in it, but the producers / makers did not want that. Nevertheless, the film knows how to grab you here and there with its style.Jason Statham is Jason Statham and shows that he is a great swimmer. The other actors do a solid job and the girl is great.In keeping with the budget, the camera is virtuosic and visually the film mostly knows how to please.The score is typical of underwater shark movies. Few surprises here.The movie made me smile and laugh a few times. That's a plus.The story makes some twists and combines some of the novels into one movie. Maybe a little too much aiming for effect and less for storytelling and suspense.An entertaining strip with some funny ideas, a lot of high-tech and sci-fi action.

401,snake-96615,More entertaining than I thought it would be!!,8,12 August 2018,"Ignore the silly haters who have lost all reasoning and perception when watching movies nowadays! The trailer does not do this movie justice. Excellent CGI got the most part, especially the shark. A serious tone, likable characters ( especially the little girl ) that you actually want to see survive and great pacing make this a great giant monster thriller in a year full of great ones. Only Pacific Rim faltered. Added bonus are two jaw dropping scenes when the shark jumps out of the water. Do not miss. I also recommend the 5 books in the series which are all equally excellent!!",The Meg
402,jessup-86446,Exactly what the trailer promised,8,26 June 2020,"Great cinema this is not, but it accomplishes what it is meant to do.
The acting was good, even from the little girl, who manages to skirt the line between too cute and too cringy with minimal corniness. Rainn Wilson could have been given a bit more in terms of comedic moments, and they could have done away with some of the extra characters, but that's just me quibbling.
CGI was good, though that is a staple these days, my toes curled in certain places from things eating/being eaten.
Plot was predictable, but they got a couple good jump scares out of me, so there was that.
Gotta give props to them for not putting any of the three female models in bikinis to sell tickets; you see more of Jason Statham's rockin bod then you do theirs. (That dude is in his fifties?!)

404,gabrielmorenocorredor,THE MEG is a MEGA Film,10,16 August 2018,"The Meg is with a fast paced in the 2 and 3 parts of the movie which I freaking loved. The beginning is fill with a little bit of point of story of the main character Jason Statham which probably has been with the Meg since the beginning, and tells very good way years later and why he needs to kill the Shark. The Movie does a really great job at for one being based one ridiculous Shark movie genre and makes fun of that its ridiculous. The story is good and entertaining. I like Sharks and how they're cold blooded creatures and that they are supposed to be protected, but I went to this movie with my parents and they thought it was going to be like JAWS and I told them these movies are based on the ridiculous Shark movies, anyway I like the action of this film and hope they make a second one. The next part contains a minor spoiler the part which I loved is that the MEG kill Shark poachers True one they deserve it, to be eaten so basically its KARMA don't kill a shark unless you want to be eaten by one, and the animal/human mild gore.

408,Anttell,You're gonna need a bigger boat,6,9 September 2018,"I quite enjoyed The Meg. It's a U.S./chinese co-production that felt like a breath of fresh air in it's approach as it's closer to old B monster movies than most contemporary films in the subgenre. Obviously it's a big budget film and it doesn't belong to the department of silly movies with the likes of Piranha 3DD, but it isn't Jaws or Jurassic Park either (while obviously having taken notes from them).It's dumb in-the-water, out-of-the-water fun. I read a Jason Statham interview recently where he said that it was fun for once to be in a movie where he isn't running with a gun in his hand. I really liked Statham in this one as it felt like we got more out of him than usually, there's some genuine sweetness to his character here.The film has fared well at box-offices, you could probably even call it a surprise hit. For me, this is the kind of film I need to be in a certain free spirited mood to enjoy. I can't get myself to award it more than three stars out of five but I'd say that the movie does go to the recommendable territory. Dumb shark filled goodness.",The Meg
409,TYContact1,"A solid B movie with large production sets and cliche characters, dialogues and plot, compensated by fast food efficiency and likeable cast.",7,7 September 2018,"The Meg knows and delivers what audience want: simple story, thrill rides under sea, and a kick-ass action hero surrounded by likeable crew.The introduction to characters and research storyline is concise - the movie knows it's fast food - nobody waits in a restaurant 1/2 hour for a fast food burger. About 10 minutes into the movie, we are acquainted with the menacing creature. The action scenes build up quite well to showcase increasing destructive power of the Meg, albeit with some predictable deaths and corny character interactions. The cast is likeable, so the movie does not really drag or lose tension, except the beach attack moments, which feels too derivative from the iconic JAWS, without the suspense, but with lots of over-reacting extras screaming, scrambling. In those scenes, the Meg seems to have run out of art production budget and/or the director took a lunch break. The beach wide crisis feels messy, and lack focus. Fortunately, the scene was brief, and viewers are quickly directed to the main crew's storyline, and soon treated with the final grand slam between our hero and the Meg.The Meg is an engaging, fun 2-hour trip at the theatre.",The Meg
410,lennybuttz,I liked it.,8,12 August 2018,"It was pretty much what I expected, we've seen this story before but I think it was well told this time and had some twists. I like Jason, I liked all of the actors in the movie and thought they did a fine job. Listen, I've been watching summer disaster movies since the 70s, it's part of summer. We had that movie with Dwayne Johnson which was terrible, at least this had decent acting and a way better script. It's also much more visually exciting than Dwight's move. Even though a good part of the movie is filmed underwater we had great visuals. My one big disappointed was that Jason wasn't shirtless enough and I wish it would have been a bit more gory. It was plenty exciting and the ending wasn't disappointing even though it was predictable. For the type of movie it is, it's good but it does make me appreciate Jaws more but we can't have that same experience of Jaws again audiences have become too jaded. It's fun, exciting, thrilling. Just enjoy it and don't overthink it. It's a good excuse to escape the heat, have some candy, popcorn and sody pop and enjoy.",The Meg

413,LegendsofHorror,Movie Review: THE MEG (2018),8,6 November 2018,"It was when JAWS first hit the big screen in 1975 when people everywhere became more aware and to be honest afraid of sharks, and since then the fear has increased a thousand fold. That has been both a blessing and a curse, mainly a blessing for Hollywood a curse for the latter. Since 1975, there have been over hundreds of horror films about sharks and shark attacks, 80 percent of them were let's be honest quite terrible but the ones that did stick with us, affected us. Many of us in different ways, that being said THE MEG is no different except that this is the first time EVER that we have ever had a chance to see a Megalodon shark so up close in your face without any repercussions.The film starts off with a underwater rescue lead by Jonas Taylor (played by Jason Statham) which ultimately goes awry with the help of a unseen beast which causes the deaths of two military sub officers. We then cut to 5 years later Shanghai and we are introduced to the main cast which consists of: Bingbing Li (Resident Evil: Retribution), Cliff Curtis (Fear the Walking Dead), Ruby Rose (John Wick 2, Orange is the New Black), Robert Taylor (KONG: Skull Island) & adorable newcomer Shuya Sophia Cai who in my opinion steals the show all are lead by Hollywood funnyman (Rain Wilson) who plays Mr. Morris, the CEO of a underwater thinktank who are attempting to break a hydrothermal cloud on the ocean floor which is believed to carry more and unseen ocean life that has yet to be seen by human eyes. This expedition via sea rover is a success but once again reawakens the beast from the depths that attacked the military submarine only 5 years before. The beast not only once again destroys the underwater sea rover and releases the 75 foot Prehistoric beast from the oceanic depths and wreaks havoc on the entire seacoast of Japan.Once we are introduced to our main characters, the film slows down quite a bit which is reminiscence of JAWS in that aspect as we see that beast but not as often, exactly like we did in the 1975 film. This also gives time for us as a audience to understand and feel for some of the characters in the film and not just have them on screen as cannon fodder as most films in this day and age do, so when they do die...their deaths mean something whether for the good or for the bad.As I said before, after the opening sequence the film slows its burn down until about over midway up until the finale of the film. This is where THE MEG finally rears its ugly head and Japan gets a taste of AMITY BEACH love - MEG STYLE.Obviously, this is another Statham action themed feature but its a fun romp. The action sequences featuring THE MEG are awesome to watch. In my opinion where the film really shines is the underwater scenes, they are beautifully shot no matter what format you watch it in. The visual effects in this film are fun to see and really the only way you'll ever see a Carcharodon Megalodon on the big screen after all.For those that love shark films, now I will say this, it won't scare you in fact I don't think its meant to. It comes off more as a fun in your face popcorn flick. This film reminds me of a combination of ""JAWS"" & ""DEEP BLUE SEA"" but with a damn BIGGER shark and much more fun.For those who didn't get a chance to see it in 3D will even get a BIGGER BETTER experience of Shark fun as it will be available on 4K, 3D, and Bluray on November 13, 2018.",The Meg
414,ue-53660,Absolutely terrible,1,18 February 2021,"This terrible and cheap movie is so bad it is impossible to watch it all to the end.

My 1/10 is for the ok looking sets, although over-designed, fake and out of place( it's not supposed to be a NY penthouse apartment?).",The Meg
415,rolandjordaan2,The Meg - Spoiler Free Review,7,14 September 2018,"I'm going to be honest, when I first heard the announcement of the film 'The Meg' and that it will be starring Jason Statham, I thought it was a joke, when I finally became convinced that this movie was real, I expected it to be a direct to Sci-Fy original that would make a great double feature with 'Sharknado 6', again I was proven wrong. So the movie finally arrived in theatres, and although I wasn't completely dreading it, I just didn't have very high hopes...I mean it's Jason Statham facing off against a giant, prehistoric shark, who can possibly take that seriously? Well...and I can't believe I'm actually going to type this sentence, but: this movie kinda rocks, sure it's still Jason Statham facing off against a giant, prehistoric shark, but it you're expecting something along the levels of 'Two Headed Shark Attack' you might be pleasantly surprised. Although the movie does have a good sense of humour, it never once makes fun of it's own plot and with just some suspension-of-disbelief, the science behind the discovery of this creature isn't completely unjustifiable either. Jason Statham carries the movie perfectly as lead character Jason Taylor, bringing a true likeability to the character and even offering depth to him in the appropriate moments. The side characters are all ridiculously likeable as well; I'm not going to emphasis too many specifics here, but there isn't a single character here who you desperately want to see killed off. Even some of the more villainous characters show strong moments of redemption and we feel sad when some of them are eaten. The only other character I do want to specifically mention is young Sophia Cai, playing the part of Suyin's daughter, Meiying. This little girl does the unthinkable: she is a child actor in a sci-fi/horror movie - one who actually has a hell of a lot of screen time - who never once gets annoying, you actually want this little girl to make it out alive, and I don't think I've ever seen that in this kind of movie. The action here is very intense as well, and even though you can kinda figure out for yourself who's going to die and who isn't, it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat with some great special effects, choreography and even some effective jump scares...yeah, I watched 'The Nun', 'The First Purge' and 'The Meg' back-to-back and it's THE MEG who finally made me flinch. Overall, I loved this movie, I loved the acting, I liked the story and most importantly: it kept my interest throughout it's almost 2 hour running time. It's a movie that surpassed my expectations and that I totally recommend seeing in theatres, and please do, because there are six more novels in 'The Meg' series and I now totally want to see those books made into films as well.",The Meg

417,fatelovesthefearless,Great for a monster movie,7,15 June 2019,"I think a lot of these negative reviews are from people who aren't necessarily fans of monster or shark movies. Because for me they are a guilty pleasure and this movie is one of the better high quality ones. It's not going to be for everyone but for it's intended audience it's fun and entertaining! I've seen almost all shark movies made with the exception of some of the really low budget ones and this one was pretty good. I loved that it was a huge shark, there are some twists and I thought the acting was good. I'd say it's on par with deep blue sea. 7/10",The Meg

419,pinemaples,Prehistoric Fun,8,21 August 2018,"I've heard that there was a lot of corporate meddling in the making of The Meg, that it was originally intended to be a lot more R-rated. Be that as it may, I enjoyed the final released version and the fact that it felt like your generic ""Hypershark vs Croctopus"" with an actual cast and budget. It had a feeling of pure fun around it and never took itself too seriously. Hearing Jason Statham sing Dory's ""Just Keep Swimming"" song from Finding Nemo is something I never knew I wanted. Bingbing Li is both awesome and adorable, as was Sophia Cai as her daughter. It was interesting seeing Ruby Rose in the role of a scientist for once, with Cliff Curtis and Rainn Wilson rounding out the surprisingly great cast. There were, unfortunately, some low points with a bit of a cringe factor (take a drink every time someone says the word ""prehistoric""), and the ending felt a bit anti-climactic. I'm sorry that some of the crew were frustrated with the way their movie turned out, but with that said, The Meg was just as enjoyable for me as the trailer led me to believe.",The Meg

421,GoldenBlunderbuss,A big dumb film about a big dumb shark,6,21 August 2018,"An underwater research crew find a previously undiscovered area of the Marianas Trench and unleash the prehistoric megalodon shark on the modern world.This isn't a film to be taken seriously. This isn't a film to sit and analyse. This isn't a film to give any amount of time to review properly. Instead, it's to be enjoyed as the dumb monster movie without the added weight of all that nonsense Oscars-stuff like character arcs and plot it wants to be. Since this film has been in development since 1996, maybe it's feeling like my granddad and is just too damn old to care anymore.Since this is a Chinese co-production (one of the six (no, seriously, six!) production companies is based in China), the film attempts to woo the ever-growing market - the main female character is played by the Asian film-award winning Li Bingbing and the shark goes on the climactic hunt at Sanya Bay. That's not to say it's a bad thing, but this film seemed to do it so well compared to other recent attempts to get a big Hollywood-like Chinese film industry off the ground (The Great Wall comes to mind).If you start watching it expecting it to be (or think it wants to be) the next Jaws, Deep Blue Sea or Sharknado, you're going to be bitterly disappointed. When all is said and done, The Meg is a refreshingly unpretentious and polished B-movie offering good campy fun to those who seek that and only that.Best Quote: ""I CAN'T SWIM!

423,ultimatenexus,Decent Popcorn Fare and Nothing More.,5,20 August 2018,"It's Jason Statham versus Megalodon, so my standards weren't all that high to begin with.I'm unfamiliar with the original novel source material, so I can't judge its merits as a film adaptation, but as a film, The Meg is underwhelming and incredibly stupid, but still in its own way, fun.Jonas Taylor, played by Jason Statham, is a disgraced deep sea rescue diver who, after the opening scene, escapes to Thailand to drink for a while. Strangely enough, the last Statham film I'd seen in theatres, Mechanic Resurrection, also had him running to Thailand after the opening scene. Funny coincidence. Anyway, after an exploration through the bottom of the Mariana's Trench goes awry, Taylor is pulled right back in to rescue the explorers, and winds up becoming the ace in the hole for the scientists and explorers of the underwater research facility,'Mana One' when the Meg gets out and becomes the new terror of the sea.Despite some fun sequences and some decent visuals (especially underwater), The Meg is a half-baked end to the summer blockbuster season. I think part of the problem is its PG-13 rating. This could have been the Piranha 3D of shark films, especially where the beach sequence is concerned (which could have one-upped the Spring Break massacre scene in the Piranha remake if only the creators and the financiers behind The Meg were willing to go all the way).Alas, what we got was a relatively tame film in the veins of Jurassic World with a moderate body count and some of the dumbest, most hilariously idiotic helicopter pilots I've witnessed onscreen in quite a long time. It also has a middle-of-the-runtime twist that feels implausible and weak that I won't spoil for you, but you'll know it when you see it, because it only reinforces the implausibility of what had already gone on, and stretches it well into unbelievable territory.No matter.

If you saw the tailer, you know what to expect. The visuals were stunning, the creature affects were cool, storyline felt thrilling and realistic, and the characters were tolerable to some extent. You could definitely tell the producers jazzed up the cast to me more likable for an audience. They were ok. I didn't read the books. Whenever I do, the film adaption never meets my expectations. From what little I actually heard, even I knew Jason Statham was the wrong actor for the lead. I'm sure most of us film fanatics take movies less seriously when he's a cast member. To be honest though, he wasn't as irritable as I assumed he would be. Like he didn't diminish the movie. The Meg is a good summer monster movie. It's not an Oscar winner but its entertaining.

And in some parts it was/is. Hell, I was and I am even okay with the cast. But I am totally sure the studio prevented it from all it could have been with its theatrical cut, that just plays it safe and makes the ""Movie Meg"" just a movie that you won't remember after a few days.And that is a shame and a waisted opportunity!I still give it 8 stars because I liked the cast, the music, the effects (they are not half as bad as some here are stating) and yes: I was entertained enough to like it. But I was all set to LOVE it, and that did not happen.Rough cuts and jumps and way to less of a thrill but more of a loud action vehicle.

The few times they show the shark, it's impressive, you're just left wanting more.

Come on guys.It was funny (at times), great special effects, quite gory in fact. The main character Jonas (Jason Statham), I do have to say I was not that impressed with though, and was wondering if they could have done better, having said that I think the writers should have given him a stronger back story as it just was a bit weak.

The idea was interesting, special effects are good and actors are not that bad like people are hating here. Everything is very under exploited, though. It could have been much, much better. Probably the studio wanted some PG movie and cut out all the good parts. But it's watchable on TV on a rainy Saturday afternoon like I'm doing right now. If you want a seriously bad movie you should try the other megalodon movie that came out at about the same time as this one.
One point to highlight is: why does everyone hate Chinese things? The main researcher is Chinese and he speaks in Chinese to his daughter who's also working in the platform, and everyone seems to hate that?? I found it refreshing to have a different female lead, and I'm not Chinese (not from the US either). She is not white, not an English native, chemistry with Statham is quite good, she's actually closer to his age than most dumb twenty something chicks that do nothing in his other movies, she is a single mom oceanographer for God's sake, and everyone hates her??

The best thing about the movie was the lighthearted insistence on the female Asian slant in the casting and the background. Its about time, the female Asian lead guarantees that you will have to stay with this thing until its done, possibly again and again. Long after you get tired of everything else about the movie, and you will, you won't get tired of the beautiful Asian women scattered throughout, even singing an Asian version of ""Hey, Mickey"" at the end, which might be the next most compelling thing about the whole picture.""Jaws"" cannot be equaled. The picture understands this, and does not waste time trying. Worth the time just to watch how impossible it is for another killer shark movie to even approach the Spielberg miracle from 1975.

It's geared towards the chinese market, just like the last two Pacific Rim movies were, so of course the story takes place there. Yes, we get american/western actors, like a loud, opinionated token black guy with one-liner catch phrases and bad jokes, and a butch looking woman covered in tattoos with the likely affectionate feelings for the same sex, but can't connect with anyone at all because she's too tough and anti-social, and of course the tough american guy hero who ends up with the frail and emotionally fragile asian scientist single mom working for her father.The cast is pretty stellar as a whole, but unfortunately for them, the script is a joke. The puns are terrible, the CGI is about as convincing to watch as Deep Blue Sea, and with that in mind, this is nearly an exact knock off of that movie... only I'd rather watch that one instead. Shark(s) kill about half the main cast, via major plotholes and big ""wtf"" moments, and if you have any idea how sharks hunt, and why, you'll instantly hate this movie. They turn the ocean into Jurassic World with two T-rexes running around basically.I get that it was meant to be stupid fun, and appease a larger audience that isn't overly concerned with things like story, and plot, but they probably could've done better.

Nothing. The closest part you get is the one in the trailer when the girl turns around and the shark bites the glass. Everything else is fast and blurry. And the acting is even worse than I expected.

Meg has been in production for over 20 years and although the film doesn't really feel like it's worth that long of a wait, it feels like the producers threw up their hands and just decided to make a goofy action movie. In that regard, Meg is actually a lot of fun! It feels very fast paced and goes very fast in general. All the Meg is about is Jason Statham fighting a giant shark, which is very awesome. Jason Statham is very very good in this role, probably the best he's ever been. Statham really is the star of the movie and not the giant shark, but he's so badass and awesome in this movie that I really didn't mind if he had more focus than the shark. Although the film is mostly fun and doesn't take itself seriously, some moments are quite thrilling and exciting, and many deaths were genuinely unexpected and shocking. The special effects are also very good and it helps a lot when the shark and other CGI effects all look close to real life. I think if I had one minor complaint, it would be that the film has too many differences to the novel, so much so that it probably could've had nothing to do with the book and be completely fine. One thing about the novel is that it's EXTREMELY gory and violent, in fact it's one of the most bloody and disgusting books I've ever read. The megalodon in the novel goes on an absolute killing spree with guts and intestines everywhere, and seeing a PG-13 version of Meg without the gore is kinda off putting. It would be like watching a PG-13 Deadpool; on it's own it might be okay but it'll be very weird for fans who know the violence and dark style of the original source material. It is kinda a bummer to wait 20 years for a Meg movie and only for it to be a lighthearted action film instead of the brooding disgusting horror the book was, BUT on its own as a movie, Meg is pretty entertaining and definitely worth a watch in IMAX or 3D! Just don't have the novel in mind because you might be disappointed.",The Meg
469,rightkeith,The beach scene saved this from being a 1,3,9 April 2019,"I have to admit I smiled at the beach scene towards the end. Other than that, this movie brought me no joy, no surprises, and no entertainment. It took me about 4 nights watching 30 minutes at a time to get through it. The premise was fine, you know what you're getting into with this type of movie. It was more the dialogue and screenplay that showed a lack of interest from those creating this movie.",The Meg
470,TheAlmightyFinger,Moronic meddling in The Meg,5,31 October 2018,"It is no secret that both the star, Jason Statham, and the director, Jon Turteltaub, were disappointed in the final product that was ""The Meg"".The positives are, that the acting is adequate and the CG effects are quite acceptable. Most of the secondary characters are likable (even the slightly amoral financier has his funny moments). The Chinese influence did not bug me at all. The 'baddie' is, of course, a 30 meter shark, that played its role as best it could, under the weight of script and editing revisions. But really, the 1-star and 10-star reviews have one thing in common: exaggeration. The film is reasonably entertaining and the pacing is okay.It is, however, apparent that the potential of this film was corrupted. Why?The studio decided to 'dumb down' the film and make it appropriate for teenagers. They interfered in the director's vision by trying to spoon-feed audiences and make a mild popcorn flick out of a potential blockbuster. The original concept was darker, funnier, and MORE INTELLIGENT.This film is one of the many examples where the choice of what to retain and what to leave out, has sunk the ship. The brainless executives involved in the post-production, should be fed to the sharks!I mostly skipped the corny (and unnecessary) 10-minute prologue of the film and visualized the film starting at a later point. It is easy to do and worked like a charm. The ham-handed information that was conveyed in the prologue was not necessary at all. The plot was perfectly understandable without it. It heightened the suspense and delayed the inevitable introduction of the monster, which increased the impact.Surprisingly, I read that both the star and the director had similar views.As it is, it is worth a watch. It would help if you lower your expectations.",The Meg

472,mannuskyhigh,Given almost everything in the Trailers,1,20 October 2018,"Ok..this movie is a big blunder. Not just a blunder but a fake ad campaign to bring you in theaters in bait of a good shark movie. But let we warn you, if you have followed all the trailers of this film vigorously, you are in for a major disappointment in the theater. Of course ! If you are a Jason Statham fan, there are couple of cheesy action scenes to entertain you but what about those who would come for the shark.First things first, there is no horror, no chills, no excitement or even thrill to begin with. There's not even a single scene in the film where you would jump with excitement and cheer for what's going on. Some reviewers and fans are really funny, comparing this film with Jaws. Comeon ! I'm unlucky enough to born in 1985 and in a foreign country who could not get a chance to experience the terror of Jaws on big screen celluloid. I am just hoping and praying if the film can release here in my country but that looks tough.Coming to The Meg, it's not even a patch. 10 Years people will forget this film pretty sure even if its sequels would continue to drop by. In comparison, The shallows and 47 meters down with low budgets have enough chills and scares against this giant budget fish film.The biggest mistake/drawback/weakness that made me really mad that the makers have dropped every damn shark scene in all the trailers/tv spots/ promos. Like I said earlier, If you have followed them all, you'll find there are hardly any new shark scenes in the film except the climax may be or here and there. But everything is in the trailer, so if this is it, why should I pay a good sum of bucks to watch the same thing on celluloid. I can wait for the digital release.I think the film has now exhausted its run of course if anyone of you planning to go to watch it. Better save your money. A DVD is much preferred in this case.",The Meg

Seems to not have had much of a build-up of suspense, which is one of the things that made great shark movies, such as Jaws and The Shallows, go down as good flicks over all. I even found Deep Blue Sea to be somewhat unpredictable for it's time, but very entertaining. The Meg doesn't compare - the script is simply not as fun, entertaining, or suspenseful at all.The acting wasn't so great either, even Jason Statham gave a wooden performance.

There are some decent comedic moments as well as some fine visual effects, but that being said, it's gotta be the highest budget 'B-movie' I've ever seen. Because ultimately that's what it feels like, with very cheesy/poor acting, even for Statham's standards. There's no notable directing, cinematography or soundtrack, the plot is predictable, and so overall it's a very mediocre viewing experience. As a horror the jump scares are far too predictable and lack any real impact, which is an area they could have focused better on, something which decent soundtrack would have helped with. The romance element felt unnecessary and too under developed, which could easily have been cut out of the movie. So ultimately it's just a few laughs thrown in with some eye candy, which I find relatively disappointing considering this kind of budget could have been used to create a real decent thriller like Jaws. I feel like cinema should just be far better than this, like since when did the standards drop so low?",The Meg

485,chris_robbo_23,Violence is subdued to lower the age rating unfortunately.,4,6 September 2018,I do believe the studio made the conscious decision to dampen the horror that should come with a big shark movie in order to get as many people in the cinema as possible. In my opinion it should be called Statham vs the big shark because it's as silly as that.Not enough people die and the main characters really don't face a lot of danger. It's a sell out movie made to make money. I gave it a 4 simply due to some fairly good action scenes and realistic shark scenes.Could have been much more..,The Meg
486,yogsottoth,Terrible,3,15 August 2018,"Went in with low, low expectations and still was surprised to see how bad it actually was.1- First of all, what were you thinking with that shark design? Meg is supposed to be all white. A beautiful albino with a sharp point nose and big mouth like a great white. That brown wrinkly abomination with a tiger shark nose and small mouth and barely any teeth is supposed to be cool? Why wouldn't you work with the guys who did The Shallows? I see a lot people here who say cgi wasn't bad and it makes my blood boil. This was horrible, horrible cgi and you have to be blind to not see that. 2-The script if you can call it that is terrible although you have an amazing book to base it on. Two megs came out right after one another because the explosion created a tunnel ha? Your little simulation doesn't make it more realistic. The original idea would been beautiful to watch but with the VFX teams you got there I'm almost thankful they didn't attempt it.3- Meg is supposed go after whales, not heavy machinery and lights and ships and anything metal. Are you crazy? She comes out, eats two whales and literally minutes later has sunk three boats? Just relax! Build up suspense, have you ever watched a shark movie before? Who is this guy they picked to direct this? How does he sleep at night knowing he ruined this amazing opportunity to bring the MEGALODON to life? If you don't know jack about horror movies or suspense or sharks or scaring people or making decent movies or directing basically, just don't. Where do they get the courage to take on these projects?4- The dialogue was unbearable to watch. Even Statham's cool accent and delivery doesn't improve it one bit. The ""jokes"" were so bad man... Like so bad. Unnecessary amount of cringeworthy jokes... And the Chinese actors? Trying to act? What was that little girl's purpose? 5- That last scene with the hundreds of sharks racing towards the Meg to eat it... That is what this movie is. Not an ounce of realism, care, or respect to the material. Not an iota of knowledge of sharks or shark behavior. Just a bunch of people who wants to make money off of showing people low quality cgi sharks. I can't believe Steve Alten endorsed this. This is what we'd been waiting for all these years? This? Shame on everyone who was involved in this joke of a movie.",The Meg
487,mariarammstein,Serious Sharknado Vibes,1,1 July 2020,"When you root for the shark, it's not a good sign.
Jason Statham used to be a pretty decent actor in his early filming career. I get action movies are a pretty good paycheck, but why so effortless ?
From interviews you'll learn neither Statham, nor the director are happy with the end-result. Rainn Wilson and Cliff Curtis are pretty respectable actors, and even they can't get this movie going.
After 45 minutes the ""action"" starts and it gets slightly more entertaining, if you don't mind the predictability, and the happy go lucky atmosphere when one after another character dies off.
To make a long story even longer consider this: nearly two hours of your life you'll never get back.

It was just so cliché, you had the forced love story, the human villain, a black guy who's only job was to utter comical one-liners.Another thing that really hurt this movie was them going with a PG13 rating, which put a limit on the amount of gore they could show. There was a scene where the shark made it's way to a very crowded beach, but instead of an all out slaughter like in Piranha 3D, the shark just swam around and swallowed up a couple people.And let's talk about that ending, shall we? This shark was suppose to be the largest, most powerful living creature on planet earth, and Statham kills it by stabbing it to death. Like really?",The Meg

My estimate, Writing $100. 6th grade ESL students could write better lines (They could probably write a better review also, you might say). Acting, well the supporting cast were mostly terrible, whatever they were paid was too much, but I believe the minimum wage for a movie is $10,000. 20 supporting actors or speaking parts = $200,000. Who knows what Jason earns per movie, $5 million? Director $1 million? of course there must have been a large crew working on the movie. Say 100 crew at an average of $50,000 that's another 5 million. Action scenes, there are a couple of short action scenes and a lot of talking. Therefore there must have been loads to spend on special effects, as you would expect from such a movie. Well the effects are also pretty shoddy. The bare least you would expect is that the special effects be good for the money spent on this movie, unfortunately not. Stupid story and badly written. Mostly terrible supporting actors. A lead actor who doesn't have to do very much, apart from raise his eyebrows now and again. Fake looking CGI.

However, The Meg may be a shark movie, but it actually had me into it, especially with the somewhat funny dialogue. Another thing I liked about this movie is that during the beach scene, they paid homage to Jaws, but the way some of the civilians were killed were pretty creative. Another thing about this movie I liked is the shark isn't killed in a typical fashion, where it dies in an explosion. Instead, Jonas, Jason Statham's character, uses his glider, and makes a large laceration, and uses a dart, stabs its eye, and drives it further in.

Overall I enjoyed it, in a guilty pleasure sort of way. The action is over-the-top and Jason Statham does a good job as the lead. Perfect mindless summer movie fun right there. But there were several things about this movie I wasn't fond of: 
****Very Minor SPOILER BELOW****-Inconsistent CGI shark. Some scenes it looks great, in others the CGI is pretty terrible. -The sharks behavior is ridiculous. Worse than that shark in Jaws 4 that swam from New England to the Caribbean because it wanted revenge. Here the Meg sticks around our characters for no reason at all WHEN IT LITERALLY HAS THE ENTIRE OCEAN TO SWIM IN. At times they made it seem like a regular shark (attracted to movement or lights) but other times it was just portrayed as a psycho killing machine. Wouldn't a 75 foot shark just go find and eat some whales? Instead of going after like one puny human at a time? Hell at one point the shark goes after a little dog. It would be like if a lion went around eating ants, it's an inefficient food source that takes way to much energy for too little return. -The forced romance between Jason Statham and the Chinese scientist was weak. Their banter was annoying instead of cute. And the little girl scenes served no purpose at all. -This movie does what many movies are doing these days: Chinese pandering. The chinese scientist speak fluent english but at times switches to what I think is mandarin to talk to her father or daughter (both of whom also speak english fluently.) I know China is a huge market but do they really need to try to shoehorn in extra chinese stuff to make it more appealing to that market? This movie is not as bad as say The Cloverfield Paradox or Skyscraper, but still, it was annoying. If I was a chinese moviegoer I would be offended by such obvious pandering. -Too many fake outs where you think the shark has eaten someone or something only to find it just missed them and the camera angle the movie used was just misleading. This is a cheap trick, I consider it about as lame as jump scares.-Rainn Wilson (who I generally like) plays a weird billionaire guy who kind of seemed like the answer to the question ""What if Dwight Schrute became a billionaire?"" His action in this movie show him to be one of the dumbest characters in any movie ever. After he leaves the research station to pursue the shark, the sequence that follows is more like a shark hunt feature one of the 3 stooges. It was so dumb.-None of the character show fear or shock. No matter how crazy or traumatic things are they still engage in ""witty"" banter and jokes. (Please note the quote indicate that the banter and jokes are not actually witty.)Wow, so I've got this huge list of complaints and I'm still awarding a 6? Yes because the movie was stupid, yet fun. Like if sharknado had a good budget and decent actors. Recommended to: Moviegoers able to switch off their brains and people who are just naturally dumb.Not recommended to: People that can't overlook illogical behavior and marine biologists who know things about sharks.",The Meg

Even if you take this movie for what it is, it's objectively bad, very bad.The CGI is uninspired and laughable. I was at least expecting a few epic shots or scenes like in the recent Kaiju movies but no. All the CGI looks like CGI.
Or you could at least expect a scary or epic soundtrack to build up the tension, but no, it's empty.If it's not a comedy, not a scary movie and not a gory movie, what was that supposed to be? They make a few jokes to release the tension like in a Marvel movie, but there's no tension at all, so the jokes just flop and are just embarrassing

I guess they blew all the money on the casting.

505,esweet-154-191260,A summer popcorn blockbuster that fires on all the cylinders!,7,12 August 2018,"Saw The Meg on a Friday night and, having bought reserved seating tickets for the IMAX version online, there looked to be only a handful of audience thirty minutes before curtain. By the time the show started the theatre was packed with people of all walks and ages. I had set the bar low based upon previews. I figured all the best gags would have been spoiled in the trailers and we would enjoy a couple surprise kitsch lines whiling away the hour and fifty three minutes. I was wrong. This movie actually has you on the edge of your seat right from the start. Opening scenes establish Stathoms background and the dangers of the deep. This isn't academy award fodder but the culmination of years of fun blockbuster style entertainment. It is directed by Jon Turtletaub who's last theatre work was Last Vegas 2013 and Sorcerers Apprentice 2010 then National Treasure series the latest one over ten years ago in 2007. This is better. He has us rooting for the good guys early on and when their in peril your paying attention. Riann Wilson of The Office plays an interesting character along with solid popcorn performances by Bingbing Li, Cliff Curtis and Winston Chao (Bingbing characters father) an actor who I think we will see a lot more of in North American box office. On that note, the now in her early thirties Ruby Rose whom I only began to notice in the John Wick movies is striking on screen. She does her assigned job here handling decent lines, I hope she will continue to evolve beyond the exotic character appearances to take on more demanding roles. I think she could hold an audience as a lead with a little 'less is more Steve McQueen' polish. The film pays homage to Jaws several times with familiar names, scenes and dialogue if you pay attention. Rainn was interviewed on late night tv and said everyone's goal was to make the second best shark movie of all time, and they did just that. These sorts of movies are what they are and this one's worth a theatre big screen if you can.",The Meg

510,lawrencestevens-58369,Entertaining but nothing memorable,7,20 August 2018,"I enjoyed this movie but it is quite forgettable. It purposefully plays on the shark movie cliches, and it works. Jason statham is good and has enough character although quite generic for statham (tough badass). However the other characters weren't anything substantial or that likeable, also the romance they tried to push didn't really work for me. The little girl was great and her and stathams characters bits were highlights. I would of enjoyed more shark vs civilian action and it to be more violent, and would of benefited greatly from an 18/R rating. Overall this is a simple popcorn flick that will entertain you for the run time but be forgotten the next week. I didn't expect much so I wasn't disappointed",The Meg
511,cmills-98693,"Terror surfaces, in the form of an awful movie.",2,28 July 2019,"The Meg is disappointing in almost every sense, and as someone who's favourite genre of horror is probably shark/creature features I was probably someone who was disappointed most of all.The Meg is without any of the terror, charm or tension that made Altens novel great. I understand that the eternal argument about wether film adaptions of novels are good or bad will never be won, but this movie has scored a pretty sizeable point for the 'novels' side of the debate. Steve Alten wrote a novel that was never supposed to win any prizes for scientific authenticity but made a good job of at least convincingly making a rational argument for how a massive prehistoric shark could be alive at the bottom of the ocean. The Meg 2018 seems to half ass almost every aspect that made the book enjoyable. The sharks appearance is too fast, meaning that there's no real tension. The gore that made the novel so punchy is to tame in this I'm surprised it even broke the 12 rating let alone 15. Jonas portrayed by Jason Statham is charismatic, but lacking in proper backstory and motivation. Rainn Wilson is good as the billionaire overlord who decides he wants the shark as a extra large wall ornament, but again his character seems to have no real motivation other than just 'cause shark'.Many of the auxiliary characters from the novel are either cut, or made so pointless they may as well have been and while yes, the novel has far more time than the movie, what little time the movie has it squanders on pointless sequences that almost beg you to become connected with the very 2d characters.There are exactly three good moments in this movie:1) The sequence where the sub is first attacked by The Meg after entering the trench as the visuals are fantastic and at this point the tension is pretty decent, although still hardly enough to get you leaning forward in your chair.2) The first person scene with Jonas (Statham) floating in open water bobbing above and below the surface of the water and the shark is circling him.3) The 'Meg hunt' with Rainn Wilson clinging to a dead whale.Apart from these three moments, The Meg 2018 is an utter flop. It's not funny enough to be a horror/comedy, it's not tense enough to be an out-and-out jaws esc thriller, and it's not punchy and gory enough to be a fast paced horror. It's mediocre in every aspect, and hardly worth a viewing beyond morbid curiosity.",The Meg
512,twittkamp,A self aware shark movie.,9,11 August 2018,"I give this a 9/10 because it knows what it is and plays to its strenghts. There's no distracting B plot, no romance (well, a bit maybe), nothing of that sort. But there's still enough backstory, introduction to the characters and even a bit of conflict with a good resolution for the movie to feel satisfying. Apart from all that, it's a shark movie. Very good effects, somewhat predictable and perfect for talassophobia nightmares. My only regret is that I didn't watch it in 3D if that is even available (didn't check). Would recommend!",The Meg

What do you expect from shark thrillers? The Meg gave it all and more. Right combination between story, acting, action and CGI. This movie gives a serious tone, unlike Blue Deep Sea.
I appreciate where the characters in this film are feeling sad by the death of their partner who died. That is new in this genre genre.

The haters accuse every positive review as being faked by studio trolls or even people who worked on the movie. That's either uber arrogant or uber stupid... or both. I say to them: get over it - to each their own. Personally, I enjoyed The Meg - it wasn't great but neither was it terrible. I'm also amazed at how many people complained that it was ""a romance"" - where the heck did they get that notion? Sure, there was an attraction between Jonas and Suyin - but romance? Nope. They didn't even hug each other... not once. What kinda romance is that? And maybe I watched some 'other-world' version, but I didn't hear a single ""one-liner"" after any death in the movie. If many of these reviews are to be believed, there's a ""one-liner"" after EVERY SINGLE DEATH in the movie. There wasn't a single ""one-liner"" in the movie I watched. Who knows? Maybe haters switch their brains off as soon as they decide to start hating and they don't actually see or hear anymore of what's on screen but just listen to their own hate-filled inner-monologue and think it was the movie.

I watched it twice and got quite a chuckle out of the ""Jaws"" take-aways, and was glad they changed the ending of those in favor of the intended victims. Pippin was just too cute to get eaten, the kid who insisted on going out on the raft was, admittedly, very annoying but that's no reason to knock him off, and I wonder how many people out there got the reference to the three yellow barrels being replaced with the three anchored piers? Jason Statham was great as Jonas and I giggled when he was chasing the shark with the spear singing ""just keep swimming, just keep swimming."" Go into this movie with an open mind and get prepared to see an animal that we should all be thankful is extinct.

Screenplay by a tubeworm.,5,24 June 2020,"The Meg provided exactly what I wanted at the time: a monster movie with spectacular effects and good action sequences, intelligence and originality optional. The writers clearly took the ""optional"" part very seriously: The film is one long cliché, comprising a whole lot of little clichés---from the overall plot to the ninth-grade-level dialogue, right down to the movements and gestures of the actors. The main ""surprise"" can be seen coming hundreds of fathoms away, and the two people you'll most want to be eaten, aren't.

529,RoadSideAssistance,Boring And Extremely Forgettable,2,21 September 2018,"When I saw the advertisement I THOUGHT I knew what I was getting into. People uncover prehistoric 'monster' and let's have FUN. Jason Statham led the cast so you knew there'd be action and good pacing, right?The film starts out with Statham acting as a rescue diver where he saves people in a sub near the Marianas trench but loses his rescue team when he pulls out because something attacks the sub so now everyone blames him (why? The rescued sub exploded right when he released the rescue - whatever). Fast forward to... the future! and a research team near the same trench want to explore it. Long story short, they dive down further than ever, find a meg which attacks the sub with Statham's ex wife, so he returns to rescue her, they release the Meg and stuff happens.The main problem is this film had no idea what it wanted to be. Was it a drama, an adventure, a comedy/satire, or an action movie? Film starts out adventure as the team has a lab exploring the deep.... FOR SCIENCE! Then quickly goes drama with a romance between Statham/ex wife/female researcher, letting his past demons die, and a 'it's our responsibility to blah blah!!!' speeches. Shoe horn in STRANGE comedy and dialogue given the dire situation and the fact it's a scientific team. And the action is... messy. A lot of the shots lack any scale or perspective, CGI is a step up from SyFy Original but average at best, the action is hard to follow and fails to capitalize on any fun moments (see further down), and pacing is ruined because of the crap elements above. All in all, it's BORING.This film is nearly 113 (!!!) minutes long and had not one thing going for it. Jaws was thriller/drama, Deep Blue Sea was adventure/action, Piranha was comedy/action. All 3 films did their piece relatively well if not perfect in some aspects. The Meg has ZERO clue what it's trying to do and just fails on every aspect.The effects/action seems to be a major selling point since the budget is high and it's backed by a major studio not to mention what was advertised, but what a let down... This film had some OKAY CGI but pretty average by today's standards. My biggest issue, you have a HUGE shark... ZOOM THE CAMERA OUT and show massive scale/perspective! All we really got most of the time were close overhead shots, a fin in the distance, or a close up mouth/head shot. Why are you using POV shots and ""JUMP! A SHARK FACE NOM!"" shots? The shark actions itself were kind of laughable. I half expected the shark to burst out of the water and scream, ""NOM NOM Mr. Martin (Transporter)!"" since it seemingly had a grudge for this crew. Two action scenes that would've been fun: 1) Shark attacks 3 boats early on but only the aftermath is shown - SHOW IT! and 2) have the shark EAT a bunch of people on the beach! It should've just mowed through a ton of people like gold fish eating pellets but instead it forgets it has a huge mouth... or something. COME ON! That's the fun I wanted, but no... back to the drama and a stupid dog whimpering when it sees a fin... ugh. And of course the last bit. This film was CRINGE for dialogue and PC Hollywood could not be more in your face. For example (and this is just ONE of many), after people are dead and another Meg is on the loose, a bald character asks the girl with an attitude and short hair, ""What happened to your hair?"" She replies: ""What happened to yours!"" What? That's what you're going to ask in this situation? Oh har har there's that comedy, folks. Or after people have died and the owner is trying to give a speech about rescue, one guy goes, ""DAMN RIGHT!"" What? I mean it wasn't funny bad, it was just bad. Most of the lines were clunky, over the top cheesy, or COMPLETELY out of place like the above MOSTLY due to:PC Hollywood! My God Hollywood, enough... stop with your agenda, 1) I learned how to use a submarine stopping whaling boats and fired a torpedo at one, 2) Meg attacks a boat and a comment about killing sharks for fin soup is made, ""Least the Meg got even"" is said 3) Solemn lead scientist says, ""All humans know how to do is kill"" when after the Meg, 4) Evil white billionaire investor is EVIL and only cares about money, 5) ""You're racist!"" says the black character when the investor makes fun of his lack of swimming since oh I dunno, he's an underwater researcher? and 6) The dog in the advertisement OF COURSE LIVES at the end after the shark visibly implied devours it. Of course everyone smiles and claps! OMG can't upset PETA and animal lovers! That was just a few of the moments I can remember while my palm covered my face.Overall pretty terrible film. Nothing funny, boring action, no interesting or thought provoking moments. Story/pacing was bad, characters/dialogue/PC Hollywood was cringe, CGI/sound was OKAY but not amazing by any means.

What do you expect when Statham is fighting a prehistoric fish with nothing but a harpoon and his fearful voice. Yeah, he's saving his ex-wife from the bottom of the ocean but right after that he's ignoring her. 
Story is predictable even to a child, actors are far from convincing and acting is pretty flat, no developed characters but obviously spectacular CGI for a $150 million budget movie. 
There are lots of things I didn't get though. That whatever-called company invests billions of dollars to search what's underneath the Mariana Trench, they find a prehistoric fish undiscovered by humans for some million of years, they wake up the fish and then kill it. But why? Statham's character feels almost like a superhero as he stabs the meg in the eye with a tiny harpoon and scratches its belly with that glass-toy submersible. Well, hard to believe. 
The pressure down there at more than 11.000m underwater is life-supporting lots of tiny colored fish and coral and whatsoever joyful marine life. Well again, Cousteau and Cameron and many other scientists would have had a different opinion. Anyway, when I left the cinema I had the feeling I just saw another weak summer ""blockbuster"" made only for the sake of the box-office and the profit. 5/10 from me. Disappointing.",The Meg

541,BB02,How to turn a super fun novel into the most generic movie possible,4,24 July 2021,"I read the book back in the 90s when it first came out - and it said on the back of the book that this will be soon a major motion picture. Well, it took a bit longer than expected. And now I have to say that it wasn't worth the wait at all.The book is a lot more fun to read than Crichton's Jurassic Park and is in itself a perfect 90s blockbuster, full of awesome scenes and thrilling moments. Sadly, almost none of it has found it's way into the movie. Instead they changed everything beside the basic story and a few of the main characters, which were also more fun in the book.Overall they seemed to have made changes simply to make changes without any sense or inspiration. They didn't added any new ideas, concepts or anything original at all. The goal seemed to have been: This will be a shark movie for the audience of a Jason-Statham-Film, so let's make it as dumb as we can.What could have been a rival to the Jurassic Park franchise ends up as nothing than a B-Movie with bigger names and better effects. The absolutely stupid script has any trace of logic removed and showcases a team of scientists and specialists constantly acting like absolute idiots. You get all the cliches, horrible dialogue, unfunny jokes, foreseeable jump scares and stereotypical characters that you could have seen in any other random shark film of your choosing. The only difference is that this shark is bigger.Statham does a great job as usual in the hero role. The rest of the cast is great, but has little to do except constantly falling off boats, like this is one of the Jaws sequels.

You could make a half-decent drinking game of every time someone fell off a boat. The movie clearly was meant to pander to eastern audiences and you can see that in some of the decisions made at various parts in the film. It did have some pretty good action sequences and some pretty brutal deaths that you would expect of a movie starring a giant shark. That being said there wasn't a lot of character development. Actually, no, there was none at all. Pretty one-dimensional on that front, and it seems like some characters had more to their story, but it must have been cut for time.Overall I'd watch it again if it came on TV or Netflix.

The film promises stupid funny moments. The final result, however, is less satisfying than it should have been. Of course, I did not expect the film to be any good in the first place. If you expect Oscar-nominated performances, this film is not for you. That is not what I mean. The problem with 'The Meg', despite its colossal CGI effects, is that I never thought it would be as outright boring and painful to watch as it can be at times. The film exhibits so many clichés per minute that any intended tension or thrills lack any sort of surprise or excitement. With its poorly developed character and inept screenplay, this film is neither sufficiently good nor sufficiently bad. Although sufficiently stupid to be a fun ride, it is curiously not sufficiently stupid to be hilarious. 'The Meg' as a whole proves that a film can try to be so bad that it's good and yet fail.Grade: 3.1 / 10",The Meg

About in the middle of the movie the first shark was dead and they hanged it on their boat. Then the second shark comes in eats the dead one.

577,michielodb,Meh,6,20 August 2018,"So I went to this movie with hardly any anticipation. Let's face it, nearly every shark movie since Jaws has been a downer. Given there are enjoyable ones, but there are way too many onces who have failed miserably, so why go and see one now? Well the fact that they've chosen a Megalodon this time instead of an ordinary Great White was pretty interesting I thought, and Jason Statham is always an entertaining watch so I went to see it anyways...leaving the theatre I was still underwhelmed.I was promised a fun and entertaining shark movie that knows what it is and has fun with it, so I was prepared for that. I didn't expect any oscar winning performances, I didn't expect a masterclass thrill ride, I just wanted to have some fun. Yet still they managed to dissapoint me.The best thing about this movie is Jason Statham by far, he's a likable presence and is great in being a badass. Sure he plays pretty much the same character over and over but he's entertaining in these roles so I don't mind. The CGI is fine, I wouldn't say that it's mindblowing but neither was it terrible. The first act did have an alright build-up, they don't show the shark for a while to build up some anticipation which I was all for!That's pretty all the positive news I can give. This movie, although not trying to be good, has some serious problems. All the characters are extremely hollow, don't expect some great character development, litteraly everyone on screen (except for Jason) is just someone to be eaten. The acting is fine overall however there's one actrice who was really bad at times, but for the rest it was alright. The events that happen in the movie can be seen coming at you from miles away, a lot of clichés are used guys and however I can accept some of them...the things that happen in the finale where just too much for me and I almost started rooting for the shark as a result. My biggest complaint however was the lack of ""fun"". This movie really tries to be serious and emotional at times, but because we care so little for the characters, it fails miserably. When one character gives a speech right before dying (yes we have that of course), this person suddenly starts apologizing for things that happened in the past, but this was never even brought up in the movie, so why bring it up now when it litteraly means nothing to us? It's moments like this that just sink this movie way too deep.Is it a terrible movie? No.
Is it a masterpiece like Jaws? NO.
Did I have as much fun with it as I had with Sharknado? No, and that's pretty sad.It's definitely not a must-see.
I give it a 6/10.",The Meg

The only cool part was the actual sharks but since that's all done these days through CGI it really doesn't earn the movie many rating points.

The movie has a decent story line it's pretty solid because I don't know what other story they could put to do battle with a Meg. Is it far fetched at time? Sure but you know what? It's a movie not a ""lets see how realistic we can make it."" Could it really happen with some of the effect and stunt Statham does? Perhaps but not likely. The acting is solid and no complaints there. Effects? Awesome and had some nice visuals. But if your wondering if you should sit down and watch it I say yes I was actually a little more surprised and thought it was better than I thought. Its is almost like a modern day Jaws. I basically came on here to say it did not ""suck"" like some say.

600,MovieWatcher2021,Saved by Jason and Bing Bing,6,27 June 2020,"When a movie is produced by China, everyone knows that certain expectations need to be lowered, for example, the movie will not show corruption of authority, but will show corruption of capitalism; the movie will not have blood too much, it will have the good side of the country. When these expectations are cleared away, then the movie becomes much more enjoyable.Story: The story is simple, but very convoluted. There is no relation to the initial incident and the mega shark later. The story lines are full of stereotypes. For example, the movie has only one black actor, and the role talks a lot and also scared by everything easy, and the role is also someone more suitable to serve rather than lead (think about butler and not Shaft!). This is in alignment with the general opinion of that country.Cinematic: Nice! Movie is well filmed, actions are all well choreographed, and sequences are well defined. Color is amazing! Every aspect of the cinematic is well done.Actors: That's the only good thing about this movie, except the cinematic, Jason & Bing Bing saved the movie. Jason showed is common acting, as a man of action. While, Bing Bing's acting was very measured and well done, she's avoided common things that many actress in that do to please the men. Of course, she could not have sex in that movie, the country folks wouldn't like it, but they hinted it.

610,werlingjakob,"""The Meg"" Doesn't Really Provide the Thrills, But Still Makes for a Good Dumb Over-the-Top Action B-Movie",5,24 August 2018,"Lately I just feel like we have been getting a lot of shark thriller movies, but instead of the good Jaws types, we've been getting the stupid Sharknado types instead. Last year when 47 Meters Down came out, it did sort of bad with the critics, but it was a surprise success at the box office, now we've got The Meg. And though I am pleased to report that The Meg was able to be over-the-top without going over-over-the-top like Sharknado apparently did, it still had a couple of problems. Though I'm not saying that I regret seeing it. First off, the story was both good and bad: One of its main problems were its reliance on plot gimmicks. Such as all of the suspense sequences started by a person falling out of a boat while the shark is near, or the fact that a decent amount of the characters who died in the movie died by falling off of a boat and getting eaten by the shark. Other plot gimmicks include the one in which the main characters think they have killed the shark, but really have not. As predicted, this movie is also very cheesy- but that is probably because it just has to be. Other flaws with The Meg's plot and story include its really bad attempts at humor and jokes, occasional questionable depictions of race, and somewhat bad writing. Though to The Meg's merit, the story and plot of The Meg are both gleefully over the top, feature strong female characters, and some decent character development. As for the acting, it was all pretty forgettable. But Jason Statham's performance was very good and screen-commanding. I also liked how the women in the movie didn't take a backseat to the men like in most action movies, the actress Bingbing Li demonstrated this fact through her character the most. Like other movies like it, The Meg has both good cinematography, special effects, visuals, and music- actually, scratch that, the music was okay but forgettable (except for that song they played at the end credits). The cinematography particularly stands out because it really does give you a sense of the scope. Particularly the difference between human and Megalodon. The action sequences in the movie were very good, stylish, and over-the-top. But still somewhat noisy and not really as suspenseful as they set out to be. Sure, there were a couple good moments of suspense, but then again, the key word is couple. Also, special note on the character development that Jason Statham's character goes through: I actually thought it was sort of good for a B-movie. All that being said, I think that The Meg is a decent over-the-top action B-movie featuring a good main performance, but is full of lots of plot gimmicks, bad humor, and lack of suspense which keeps the film from being what it wanted to be. Though if you are in the mood for a dumb, cool, over-the-top action movie- I would recommend you see it.",The Meg
611,ullasharma-95619,Piranha 3D was Better!,3,12 August 2018,"Absolutely horrifyingly bad. While expected a 'shark' movie to have its own drawbacks - did not expect a movie full of drawbacks. The director takes audience for fools and attempts to mock them with twisted - improper story telling and warped sense of realism. Here is a few of s***shows : 
1) Oh , so there seems to be a new 'depth' to Mariana Trench? Let's go there ourself even if we have a robot that can. 
2) inescapable layer of hydrogen sulfied allowed escape of 2 super large sharks 
3) the sharks have lived literally in darkness since they are born - and can see perfectly well and have well developed eyes!
4) they have no natural predators , but still there are only 2 of them!
5) a crew of 3 stuck in Bottom of Mariana Trench? Let's call 1 guy for help. And he goes alone. 
6) small subs go to the depths of Mariana Trench! (Why didn't they go in small individual ones in first place)
7) the meg keeps changing in size. It seems elastic!
8) oh we have 2 most dangerous predators in Water? Let's NOT call the military 
9) there is a huge a** research base with like 10 people to Manage it. 
10) random Chinese phrases and shanghai skyline (why??) 
11) there is a dangerous predator in water? Let's swim towards it even if we have a boat. In other words , this movie is a disaster. It seriously has the potential to END the career for Jason Statham. His raspy speaking at most inappropriate times definitely didn't work. Definitely avoidable.",The Meg
612,mariob-47307,Good ...almost great,9,23 August 2018,Now being as good as jaws...hard to do being better than sharknado ( despite how funny it is) not difficult... that being said the meg is actually a pretty good movie it's enjoyable there are some moments where you do get jumpy. scientifically un accurate but that's to be expected. all in all not a bad movie good action same plot twist that you would see you in any kind of a horror movie like that and if you actually think about it kind of doable one thing that I realized in life is that everyone believes that we know everything already it shows you different and what happens when you take nature for granted.

615,Gpanther67,Has its moments but not a great shark movie.,6,17 August 2018,"Since I consider ""Jaws"" my favorite film of all-time, I guess I am a sucker for shark movies. If you have followed the track record of these types of films you will probably realize that there isn't many that are very good. I would say after ""Jaws"" there are only three that are even worth a look and no ""Sharknado"" isn't one of them. In 1999, I read a novel about a megalodon shark called ""Meg"" and while the book was just ok, I was excited that on the cover it said ""Soon to be a major motion picture"". I thought a movie about a 100-foot shark might have some potential, but to my disappointment ""Meg"" turned out to be one of those films projects that never seemed to get off the ground and many of the straight to video movies about megalodons were horrible and laughable. Now in 2018, it has finally been adapted and is called ""The Meg"", but which group will it fall with? The shark movies that are good but still nowhere near ""Jaws"" or the ones that are about as entertaining as fish chum. Action star Jason Statham stars as Jonas Taylor, a rescue diver who had a tragic incident while saving scientist in a damaged sub. He is forced to leave two of his friends and co-rescuers when his vessel is attacked and he realizes that if he goes back, he and the 11 men saved would parish. Taylor claims a giant creature attacked them but nobody believes him and thinks he was suffering from delusions caused by pressure sickness. Years later a research team with a high-tech facility are charting a new trench in the ocean that might be one of the deepest parts of the ocean. When the first sub is attacked and damaged, a rescue mission is started and some team members feel like Taylor is the best man for the job despite his going in seclusion in Thailand. When they inform him that his ex-wife is one of the people in the sub he agrees and during the rescue his theory is proven correct as the researchers discover an actual megalodon shark alive and dangerous. Taylor is able to save the sub but their breach of the deep trench opens a gateway for the shark to come up to the surface and wreak havoc above. ""The Meg"" is pure popcorn entertainment, so you really have to take it with a level of understanding that it won't blow you away with a deep story, original plot twist or unique characters. The truth is we have seen them all in other shark movies and other popcorn flicks as well. The one different aspect is this shark is huge... monstrous even and the actions scenes with it are not bad but not jaw dropping. The movie is something I wish I could tell you is so much more but in fact it is pretty run of the mill for a creature feature or action film. Statham is a solid action star but he isn't the most charismatic in film either. He handles his role about as well as you would like him to but doesn't add any dimension that will make his character or the movie extra special like a great leading man can do. Most of the characters in the film are your typical types that popcorn films supply. They are either dropping jokes to make the audience chuckle or they are there to invoke some emotion either good or bad. Most especially stereotypical is Rainn Wilson who plays the research teams financier and supplies most of the films one-liners and even turns out to be a bit of a snit. The two cast members I enjoyed the most was onscreen mother and daughter played by Li Bingbing & Shuya Sophia Cai. They are the most enjoyable characters and bring a good amount of personality when they are on the screen. The CGI effects aren't bad and there are some scenes that are very well done, so I'll say it's a good enough reason to give this film a try. There is also a couple of witty nods to ""Jaws"" that will please fans. The worse thing about the film is its atrocious and even down right stupid ending. I won't spoil it but if the guys with Myth Busters hated the fact that it is actually impossible to blow up an air tank (see ""Jaws""), they will howl with laughter with what does the megalodon in. It really is a hard pill to swallow. So after 19 years of waiting, I won't say that I was disappointed with this film but I know its not going to go down as one of my favorite shark movies. It has some moments but overall it is just your typical summer popcorn flick with enough entertainment value to enjoy it but not call it a must see. I suppose my final grade is a bit too kind because it is a shark movie, but I just really have a soft spot for them thanks to ""Jaws"".",The Meg
616,dcrocetti,no more CGI!!!,4,18 October 2021,"I think the main problem with these shark films is primarily bad CGI and then the rest like bad acting/direction have killed this genre.It also explains why movies like ""Open Water"" has been always controversial and most have been B movie quality.

633,kvang145,"A proper helpful review that doesn't say, ""ignore the hater""",7,19 September 2018,"""The Meg (2018)"". It has a nice tune to its name. From it you can guess it'll be about open water with the huge fish... yes fish. The movie carries the same simplicity of the title into the creature. Instead of the awe inspiring myth of a monster's name, you get a giant oversized fish. Although the movie has a category of ""Horror"" attached to it, the movie felt very short on scary. There are no terrorizing scenes or surprises in the movie. Better yet, there are no dramatic scream/death. Back to the fish vs monster; everyone, especially the main character, Jason Statham, are not afraid of the creature. Although there is a simple explanation, (the meg is defined as a huge shark, people know what a shark is, how it behaves, and human have firepower, what's to fear), everyone accepts death and reality, so move on?This brings to a good feature though. The character felt very realistic. Ever seen a horror movie where people say, ""lets split up, so the monster can't get us,"" or so, well this movie has the exact opposite. Each action the people fighting against the Meg are simple and straight forward. Although some actions have little thought into the process, the movie carried the simple tune of, ""we're taking responsibility"" and ""look forward"". Hell YES! Love this.Enough of the long oversights, here are some quick ratings on the movie:CGI is not horrible. The use of buffering was good, they did real good work on the MEG, but less attempts on the smaller sharks, which looks really dumb.Visual lighting is horrible. Some movies you say, man it's too dark I can't see anything. Well this one, it's so bright it's unreal. You can see everything, which lessen the thriller of things. Finally concept. Good character decision making, but fast movie pace lead little time for caring or knowing each character.The movie receives a 7/10, pretty good and worth to see once. The movie is tuned very low for the younger audiences, so they'll have a blast! Oh yeah, it's an action movie. Stab stab, punch, boom! If you see it as a horror film, it'll be 4.5/10",The Meg

638,papadeltazulu,The Mug,1,8 August 2018,"This should have a been a great film from a decent series of books. But for one thing, the casting of the film is way off, not one character comes off as convincing here. Jason Statham is as wooden and one dimensional as he always is, which is fine in an over the top silly action flick like Crank, but in a film adaptation of a book that's fairly scientific and straight laced, he just ruins it. There's no suspense, very few thrills and a MASSIVE over reliance on awful one liners that just get chucked at the screen at the most improper times. Seriously, there's a one liner thrown in seconds after every death, it so inappropriate and mis guided. Even in an out and out comedy, the jokes used in this film would fail to get a laugh, they're awful.The special effects are great and there are a couple of set pieces that are quite cool but take those out and all you're left with is another terrible Asylum movie. I'm only surprised there wasn't a giant 12 headed crocodile or a robotic Meg turning up for the finale.If you enjoy dross like Mega shark vs Crocasaurus or 5 headed shark attack, you'll probably enjoy this but for those of us looking for something a little more serious and competently made like Jaws or The Reef, avoid it like a disease.",The Meg

In The Meg, a group of researchers build an underwater laboratory, researching deep sea wildlife to the extent that no one ever has. While conducting their research, they stir what is believed to be dead for millions of years, a megalodon. With 'The Meg' awakened, the team of scientist turned hunters, led by Jason Bateman, track down what they believed to be one megalodon. After killing one, they realize there is a much larger one, which they track down off the coast of a beach and eventually kill. 
While the film grew my discomfort and fear of the ocean by making me think of what can survive at the depths of our ocean. What scared me more that the ocean in the film was the script, as lacked megalodon screen time and was filled with unbelievably blatantly obvious plot points that can be seen from a mile way, or should I say nautical mile. It fit well into a genre filled with cheese one-liners and CGI that would make you cry of laughter instead of fear.

I'm not saying it has to be like Sharknado, but it would have benefited with more cheese and insane action. I liked Jason Statham as Jonas, even though he's a generic action hero. Bingbing Li is terrible though, she has no emotion in her lines and is extremely flat. She was included to pander to the Chinese and Asian market.The CGI is really good, and the action is exciting, so I would recommend you to watch this, the story is shallow but expected. It just could have been so much better if it didn't take itself so seriously.

654,starcrowq3,Could have been Jaws for a new generation.,5,17 November 2018,"Im a fan of Steve Altens books which this movie is based on. I went to the cinema almost knowing what to expect, but still hoping for it not to be true. But the only things this movie has incommon with the books is it's name, character names and small bits and pieces of the first books story. And that's all to be honest. This movie by it's name and what it's based on could have been a real cult classic if done right. It should have been aimed to be a modern Jaws like horror, action, thriller mix. Instead it seems like the studio chickened out to be frank, and went the opposite direction which made it feel flat, uninspired and more of a comedy.
The source material is so great, because it has great characters and scary situations that's stuff of nightmares. Here they are sadly missing all of it! Like the main characters struggles from being at the top to hit rock bottom and then come back out of life crisis in dozens to be our hero. Not our perfect hero, but a tough almost at the brink of a breakdown hero. His way of making icecold decisions when life is at stake to rise up from the grave is so sadly missing here it's sad. Also his partner Mac's story is like written for an actor to aim for an Oscar award much like the Quint character in Jaws. if nailed to the teeth that is. In the movie these characters feels like Disney versions. And oboy they do all kind of stupid decisions, which makes it feel so rushed it's unbelievable and pure stupid. In the books everybody working around the MEG is on top of their respected line of duty. Here they feel like they wanted to be sharkfood. And when somebody dies we just move on as nothing has happened, could work if we the audience could feel the desperation of the characters needing to rush on without looking back untill it's over. But here we really don't feel anything both toward the victims or their friends. Because they are soulless !
And let's talk about the main story, the MEG here without spoilers. Here it's so over done so it never ever gets scary! In the book it feels like it balance between thriller suspence to pure gore. It's both haunting and nervwrecking. But in the movie you feel nothing at all, nothing at all! And that's just silly in my opinion. Jaws from 1975 feels even today scarier then this. Even if you see it as an popcorn action adventure movie it's just not enjoyable. As a Steve Alten fan, it doesnt matter if im glad for Steve that this was made finaly, when the finished product is so far from his work.
Sometimes it's better to let it be if not done correctly in my honest opinion. Pushing something just to be made, is just not good. And i hope he feels the same honestly, so he get them to not do the same mistake for his other books.
Did the PG rating end up being too important? Well then you didnt believe in the source material to begin with!
So to some good points instead. I liked the look of the first 30mins of the movie. The underwater lab looked pretty good aswell as some of the under water scenes. The shark looked great in some scenes but really bad in others. I didnt mind that the MEG didnt follow the look as in the books. But then again it wouldent have made it worse if it did, as it has it's purpose both scientific aswell as making it's whereabouts known iconic. So maybe a missed oppertunity again?
All in all this movie is lacking alot of suspence and get's pretty boring because of it. It never builds up a momentum enough for anything exciting or scary through out the movie. Jason Statham does what he can, but feels cheesy at times but he does it okeyish. The others are so over the top or one-dimensional it feels like bad acting, meanwhile it could have just been bad directing or writing?

659,b2280545,The Meg,7,18 August 2018,"Shark thriller movies were first critically recognized after the release of the 1975 masterpiece Jaws. Since then the genre has become a Hollywood favorite among audiences of cinema. Some honorable mentions are The Shallows and 47 Meters Down. While films like these may not be legendary by Hollywood standards (Jaws being the exception), they certainly make for great times at the movies. That being said, films like these are looked down upon for often being impractical in their presentation. If people are expecting to find realism in a film about unusually large sharks menacingly perusing helpless swimmers and sailors on boats they can easily turn over, they are looking for it in the wrong kind of film. This movie is visually stunning. Megalodon himself is larger than life to the point where he can't fit in the entire projection screen. It's direction and cinematography deserve recognition for the results are jaw dropping, or in Megalodon's case jaw crunching. Like all shark thrillers, this film's suspenseful entertainment value is primarily what it has going for it. Where it unfortunately lacks in introducing a cast of strong characters, it succeeds with providing audiences with enough jump scares and terrifying action sequences to satisfy their expectations. To repeat, any audience viewers hoping to find realism in The Meg's story, action, character decisions or the resolution for that matter, look for it somewhere else. Realism will never exist in creature horror films. Go watch The Meg with a positive state of mind, shut the brain off, enjoy what good it has to offer and remember what all the people involved in the project intended for it to be from the beginning which is a fun, exciting man vs. prehistoric beast flick that may leave beach visitors and boat travelers hesitant about going back out into the ocean again.",The Meg
660,carolynvargas,Wrong choice of aesthetics and genre make this film just okay.,6,23 December 2018,"The problem with The Meg is that it takes itself seriously. Had the director planned a more tongue in cheek approach maybe the film would have fared much better. This is an unremarkable monster movie with cardboard characters and better-than-average special effects. Director Jon Turteltaub (National Treasure) crafts a few impressive sequences- the one shown in the trailer with the little girl staring at the shark being the best but most of the film is a paint-by-numbers affair. The story is as disposable as the unromantic romance between Statham's Jonas and Li Bingbing's Suyin. (The Meg is loosely based on the first novel in a series by author Steve Alten. Not much of the book remains, however - the movie is an almost entirely separate entity.) Give it a one time watch at home.",The Meg

But I must disagree with the low score.It's the movie I've been waiting for since Deep Blue Sea, but 2 notches up on silliness. The story is wild and incoherent, but it's a romp. Most characters are a bit out there, but hey, aren't we all in real live?The Meg itself? I really liked this beast. It looked very real to me and has a cool ""design"". Not ""over-CGIed"", very organic, reminded me of the first Jurassic Park. There are many memorable moments (some even made it into my dreams next night :-))All in all, I had Fun and it felt like the movie became what it wanted to be. Something that I cannot say about many movies these days. Rainn Wilson as corporate weasel alone is worth the price of the admission.

667,edwardgamper-0-128609,The ultimate movie to dual-screen to,6,29 March 2019,"This movie is basically a rip off of Deep Blue Sea - a fixed underwater marine base is attacked by a huge mutant shark.Unlike Deep Blue Sea, the marine base isn't the main set piece for action scenes, instead the Meg goes for a series of boat and submersible set pieces. For this reason, much of the action is a mess of underwater CGI with unclear action and lots of cages, submersibles and boats flying around, above and below.With more Hollywood movies being Chinese funded, we are now seeing Chinese locations and actors shoehorned into plots. And for a film like The Meg, it's fine for exotic locations and makes little difference being mainly water based, but it chucked in some appalling actors whose English was weak and generally just seemed a bit random casting-wise.Statham is phoning it in with a hilarious quasi-american accent and takes ages to show up after the opening scene. But when he eventually gets going, he's fun, charismatic, and yes, he takes his top off lots.The supporting cast are all fairly meh, with maybe Ruby Rose being one of the stand out supporting actors, if only for her supremely 90s hair that gives the whole movie a very vintage B Movie vibe.With John Turteltaub directing I had higher hopes for this movie as I love the National Treasure Films. But it does have it's plus sides. For one, the score is Harry Gregson Williams, whose soundtrack elevates this film massively.There are actually a couple of good action sequences and fun moments. The humour doesn't always land, but the Meg is definitely not taking itself seriously and is obviously referencing those 90s B Movies like Deep Blue Sea and Deep Rising, rather than thinking it's making the next Jaws.The biggest problem with the film is it's reluctance to kill off people. When there's quite a large ensemble of largely disposable and forgettable supporting actors, surprisingly few people die. And it's obviously dialled down the gore to appeal to kids.And that's the problem - this film could have been awesome if it had embraced the 80s / 90s B Movie violence and focused on cool kills and crazy violent set pieces. But instead it opts for people leaping on and off boats and nearly being grabbed by the outlandishly massive shark. It's heavy on CG and feels like a wasted opportunity for practical effects.At 2 hours long this film is best enjoyed on the tv at home dual-screening with snacks.Its not the 3 star disaster most are saying, nor is it 8 star awesome. It's just 6 star yeah that'll pass two hours and is just OK.",The Meg

692,ricemuscle,Disappointed,5,10 August 2018,"I want to start this I saying I love the book series, well at least the first few. I read all five books that were out at the time in 5 days total. I was so excited for this movie. When I saw Jason Statham was cast as Jonas Taylor I was immediately bummed out. I like Jason Statham but we all know the type of movies he's in and I was really hoping that they would go more the route of Jaws and not the route of Piranha 3D. Make a really good film with great actors that just happened to have a shark. Then I saw the trailer and was even more disappointed. The tone of the movie was all Goofy. Even with all that I still was very excited and I dropped my expectations and just went into it expecting a type of action Blockbuster sequel quality movie. I have not been this disappointed in a long time. I'm not one of those people that's going to give a movie a one or a two when clearly a movie of this caliber is not that bad and that should be reserved for straight to Syfy 1 million dollar budget crapfests. Dont.listen to people who give it a one. Thats just false. However holy crap was this a huge let down. The CGI was actually pretty good in some parts and then other parts it wasn't at all. The film started off pretty good and there were quite a few changes in the characters in the story from the book which is expected. But once the shark got to the service it just went downhill. Statham actually wasn't that bad although I maintain my position that he was not the right guy for Jonas Taylor. Li Bingbing was absolutely atrocious. I haven't seen her in any other movies so it could have just been The eay it was written but her dialogue was horrible and it just seemed like she was acting which a movie shouldn't be like that. I love Rainn Wilson but again I didn't enjoy him in this movie. I thought the little girl was completely useless and I don't know why that character was even added. The actress was fine but the character itself was just ridiculous. Page had a couple parts where he was really good but his scenes were just silly. I really wanted to like this movie but the comedy just too much. I'm a firm believer and I've said this before and I'll say it every time that death should not be funny in movies like this. It's okay to have comedy in these movies if you have to but if someone is in a scenario where they're going to die or potentially going to die don't make it funny. My biggest issue with the movie is the fact that they were constantly in life or death situations and never seemed scared. There's a 70 foot shark that just flipped your boat over and you're on the turned over Hull and you're making jokes and you don't seem like you're in trouble at all. Without giving away spoilers there's somewhat of a Chase and they just act like it's no big deal. Even if you were going to go the route of over-the-top ridiculous action movie there's absolutely zero reason why the characters shouldn't be absolutely terrified. I wasn't a big fan of the end and although there were some funny parts and there where some really cool scenes I just in no way thought this movie was good. It doesn't take a lot to please me normally. I love dumbed down movies from time to time but this was just stupid and in no way believable and I just can't express how disappointed I am. I would really really really really was looking forward to this and even set my expectations lower than I wanted them to be and still came out shaking my head. I honestly think I shook my head through the entire movie and threw my hands in the air as if to say what the hell. I'm not going to tell people not to see it because I love the books and I love the author and I want to see the movie do well anyway. Maybe a sequel will be better but doubtful

To produce a movie into looking great on the screen - well, we know that that is possible today also with pretty limited resources, so that is really no reason to watch a movie nowadays.

698,getjono,A bit silly,3,14 July 2019,"The most surprising part of the movie, apart from the plot holes and questionable acting was more the fact the Movie makers didnt seem to actually know where the Mariana Trench is located, described in one trailer as the ""China Sea"" (wherever that is?) The trench is actually in the Western Pacific Ocean.After discovery of the Meg, billionaire Jack Morris announces he has notified Indonesia, China and Thailand - no mention of Japan, nor USA (who actually administer the Mariana Islands where it sits) and later stated China was sending two destroyersI can understand Indonesia, but what is the relevance of China, or even further away, Thailand?
The story however climaxes with a scene setting on a beach in Sanya, China, (some 3,800 klm away) so I am unsure if this movie was perhaps made for the Chinese market but it would certainly explain the relevant exclusions. (or signal a growth of Chinas 9 dash line)Not sastified with displaying their lack of knowlege in geography the film makers also elected to share that physics were also a weaker point.In one scene we had a dead 40 ton megalodon hanging by a 4 tonne hydralic crane arm above the deck of 90 foot boat. Apart from this impossible lifting task the boat still appears to be stable and still sitting on its waterline, despite this incredible top heavy additional displacement.All of this was after the movie went to great lengths to explain how it was possible for these prehistoric creatures to use thermal vents to escape the near freezing waters between their 13,000 metre deep aquarium and the surface.Yes fantasy sci-fi calls for things that make little sense..... And this movie is full of those!",The Meg
699,judeknicks,"Average, and not much fun",6,6 September 2018,"Every summer, there seems to be a new shark movie that is released just as folks are heading out to the beach. Maybe they're made to scare people off, or maybe it's based on the fact that these movies make a lot of money. The Meg is by far the most high-profile, effects driven shark movie since Jaws. No, the terribly awful Sharknado films do not count, and they are made for TV. Going back to this film, the previews marketed the film as a fun time and exhilarating ride. However, even though I can say that the movie was not terrible, it definitely wasn't much fun, and that is the major disappointment.As always, let us begin with the aspects of the film that were good. First off, we have Jason Statham as the lead role, which is an opportunity that he makes the most of. His character, Jonas Taylor, is a former rescue diver haunted by an incident in the past that resulted in the lives of two scientists. Living a quiet life in Thailand, he is recruited by Mana One, an ocean research facility, to rescue trapped members in a submarine that have been attacked by an unknown creature. His character develops as the movie progresses, going from a loner who wants to live a quiet life to a leader who places the lives of his crew mates above his own. Along with Statham, I also felt that Dwight K. Schrute (I mean Rainn Wilson) was entertaining as Dwight K. Schrute being a billionaire and fighting a prehistoric shark. Of course, the most important aspect of an action movie is the action, in which the film di not fail to deliver entirely. The effects were realistic CGI, which is an achievement considering that computerizing a 75 foot-long shark to fight props and submarines is a hard feat. We can thank the Chinese production companies that spent the money to make this film when a Hollywood-based probably wouldn't do so. However, even though the action sequences are intense, there are much fewer scenes than I would've preferred to see.This leads to the main weakness for this film: the lack of action sequences and fun. I care about quality more than anything, but when a film is marketed as a fun, action-packed adventure, that is the expectation that you go into the theater with. Unfortunately with The Meg, there is a lot more talking present. It ruins the pace of the film because the action will be interrupted multiple times by dialogue that, while relevant, is misplaced with the pacing. Also, the lead actress, Li Bingbing, did quite poorly when speaking English lines that it was distracting. When she spoke Mandarin, the scenes were well acted. It may be strange, but the same thing happens in Bollywood films. Since english is not the first and primary language for these actors, it is hard to speak and act it out properly in a movie.I went into the theater expecting to have a good time, but a good time is not exactly what happened. It wasn't a bad film because there was a clear objective for the characters as part of the plot and it wasn't cheesy. However, it wasn't fun or action-packed, which was seemingly the goal that the movie had in order to attract audiences. It certainly has, with over $460 million made across the globe at the moment. However, it definitely isn't worth viewing in theaters. I say, it may be worth your $2 renting it on Redbox, but only if you want to see Jason Statham and Dwight take on sharks.Rating wise, I would bestow this film 6 stars out of 10.

I know that isn't saying much, but I thought it should be said. The acting is alright - not amazing and not terrible, but alright. If you like Jason Statham, then you'll like him in this, and if you don't then the Meg probably won't change your mind. The effects look pretty good - I've seen better, and I've seen worse.

And that is how anyone should approach this movie.There are a good number of upsides to this movie. Firstly, I generally like Jason Statham (and of course, Cliff Curtis), he certainly adds some weight to movies due to his intensity. Secondly, there's a mix of cute and dark humour thrown in for fun. Thirdly, the CGI mostly looks fantastic and realistic, especially the silhouette of the Mega ominously swimming underneath people. Lastly, I like the fact that the climax is great and layered, so it's not boring or ho-hum.This movie was a pleasant surprise, and I'd fully recommend if you know how to relax and enjoy!",The Meg

The deaths aren't graphic enough for gore fans and aren't creative enough compared to most creature features.If you want to see a big shark splash about and eat a few folks, it's fine.

I've read reviews where they just tear this thing apart, saying how unscientific and inaccurate this film is. 
This is a film where you leave your baggage at the door on your way in. 
Don't take it seriously and just enjoy the ride. 
The special effects are actually very good, and it builds tension. There's also a few jump scares that had me jumping from my seat. 
I actually like to think that perhaps the Megolodon still swims the deepest parts of our ocean. This movie brings it to the surface in a fabulous way!
I call it 'popcorn rntertainment' because that's exactly what it is. 
Accept it for what it is, and I guarantee you'll have as much fun as I did. 
I'll be heading back to see it again.

It totally embraces that it's a cheesy shark movie and that's it's greatest strength. My biggest flaw though would probably be that it doesn't really do anything new with this huge shark and it isn't wild enough. It doesn't feel like this massive shark is acually there, and it ends up feeling like Jason Stratum is going against a regular old shark.

And there will be the ""Jurassic Park Effect"" as well - ( ""Megalodon"" ) further conning people into seeing this in Theaters and wasting their money and time. And then we can all laugh our way to the Bank.""Not kidding.The special effects are ok - giving it a 1 out of 10 rating.

728,adamafrixal,The Meg (2018) : Giant Bite Chunk of Story You will Enjoy,8,17 October 2018,"If you like Jaws, you will like the Meg that is my honest opinion. The Meg got a lot of to offer for you starting from Multi racial representation casts, simple and easy to understand plot and action, Mini Submarine, Big Underwater Aquarium, Deep Water Exploration, JASON STATHAM as main character, and most importantly A 25 FEET DEEP SEA GIANT MEGALODON. I really enjoy this movie and would rate it 7 or 8 out of 10 because I like shark.
The story starts during first exploration in the deep sea, Jonas Taylor played by Jason Statham encountered giant shark during his rescue mission and cause him to leave some people to die to save other from the shark. However, his statement about big shark was deemed unbelievable and people scorn him, thus making him quit his rescue job and live by himself in Thailand.
 
The story then follows a team of ocean researcher that explore deep sea. The researcher team consist some diversity it has black people, Asian, and of course white people. This was expected since it was a china-american movie. The acting is somewhat mediocre, and was nothing noteworthy. But I still like how Jason statham managed to stay badass in all situation even when facing the great giant shark.
Oh yeah if you have kids and children they will be amazed and awed when the Megalodon showed up. It was so much fun seeing their reaction about the giant shark. However, for adult even though the film is enjoyable the conclusion is so unnatural and seems forced as I think the giant died in unsatisfactory manner.
But even with all its flaw the meg stays an enjoyable ride with a lot of waves and thrill accompanied by shark. I recommended this movie for you that enjoy jaws or monster movie alike, or even like ocean.",The Meg

I think this film knowingly marketed itself as a bigger, badder, jaws. This would be an insult to the masterpiece. With the exception of the SFX, which are surprisingly good this is such a poor film that doesn't even play by its own rules (shark can't detect Jason statham swimming right up to it, but can find and eat a dog ?!) the actors seem as though they're half assing it, it's not even cheese good and the plot is all the place.

Nothing new or ground breaking. All the same cliches and characters you find in movies like this but it is done well enough to be watchable. Jason Statham is okay at doin* the same thing he always does.

734,TronkyLizard,Can fun be heartless? ....no.,3,18 August 2018,"I get what its going for, everyone does. What really ruined it for me was the heartlessness of it. Ill try to explain.The movie just has no vision or point; Its ""fun"" but if you only understood the word technically. Its weird cause theres scenes and moments that DID have a genuine feeling or idea that didnt feel like it was put together by an alien.Tone/mood moves around from lighthearted to dark an grotesque at random uneven intervals, weird shifts that cemented a feeling that, well, these people dont know what they're doing. Aparently there was a lot of studio interference, so that could explain stuff. But aside from that part, something else that really bugged me was that the megalodon stops acting like a giant predator fish. Theres a whole segment in the middle where it has a chance to do crazy damage! But instead the shark just. Stops.It basically starts acting like a normal shark movie and it feels like forced suspense. Things that logically would've happened already just, wont happen, cause, the script said so.It happens in silly pop corn fluff, i get it, suspension of disbelief is really necessary in this kind of movie. All this negative stuff just keeps piling up, and this is stuff thats in the heart of the experience, i cant ignore it. Characters are fine on their own. Some even have some really nice scenes, but overall, they arent given a lot to do, so a lot of characters deaths dont really resonate. And the ones that were suppoused to be satisfying felt tasteless or like nothing at all.Technically its good, its competent, its an expensive hollywood film that everythi g by the numbers well. Anything less than this would just be ridiculous. Im just dissapointed. This could have been really good fun, I wanted it to be fun. But it was just an artificial and boring mess.",The Meg

So then the whole movie as you expected becomes hunting the thing down and killing it because leaving it out there would be very bad. Then...get ready for it, its not one but TWO megalodons out there. I mean it was interesting because no one was prepared for a giant ass shark, maybe a great white but not a giant prehistoric killing machine.

Rain Wilson's character was an astounding addition to the cast giving us laughs, hate, and awe to his part. For those of you who read this please know I didn't have high hopes going in to see this.

Of course, the movie falls to stereotyping frequently and most of the time, the plot is just plain ridiculous. But that is all to be expected of a movie like this.

However this is one of those films that won't languish in anyones minds much longer after leaving the auditorium. This film has a number of problems that begin at script level. The characters are cliched caricatures: theres the idiot billionaire, the disillouised scientist and of course the emotionally damaged hero. There are attempts to overcome these faults with ill placed comedy in attempt to create a chemistry between the actors but this fails. Even on a technical level the film flodders as some of SFX shots particularly of the shark's head look very poor. There are a couple of fairly tense sequences, such as a night time helicopter attack or when Statham has to swim up the shark to attach a tracker that are very welcome and help improve matters slightly. I also like the ending which involves the shark attacking a beach load of bathers but this is not as grizzly as it should have been due to the safe confines of a 12A certificate.

766,jetbatt94,"I don't get the ""Neg"" on The Meg?!?!?",9,4 December 2018,"I'm not an aspiring film critic like some these Yahoos that have 1-starred this movie. So as an ordinary, average, person who likes movies I give it a 9-star for originality. Not having read the book (which is always better, duh!), I like the story of the unexplored deep and seperate eco-system. It's just plausible enough to be believed, as far as movie making goes. And at least it didn't have an underlying ""We're killing the planet"" undertone.
I also like seeing Jason Stratham play a different type of role where he saving folks instead of killing everyone. Although I did think his name was a little cheesy- Jonas as opposed to Jonah? Not too shuttle. He does a great acting job here, but I still find his accent a little thick and difficult to understand.
The ""monster"" was done exceptionally well enough that I wasn't thinking CG in the back of my mind. When I think Megaladon- it's hard to grasp a scale, but I think this movie got it spot on.
And as far as endings go, just when you think it's over, it ain't. I was expecting cheesy, but it wasn't predictable with the ""gotcha"" endings to which everyone's accustomed.
I like shark movies. I like suspense and action movies. And I like to be entertained. The Meg satisfies all my criteria and then some. So can we just get back to suspending reality and belief enough to enjoy a fantastic movie, and quit nit-picking it like some overpaid uninteresting highbrow movie critic???",The Meg
767,wwodka,To Compare this to Sharknado is an Insult to Sharknado,1,26 September 2018,"This was horrible. Movie is all over the place and can't figure out which way to go. Meanwhile they just forget about the blonde the entire movie until she is forced to play cards at the end with the little girl (she's apparently his ex wife) the shark also apparently has selective killing like I have selective hearing. To not eat any person in what is obviously a studio pool and literally pop the bubble is a joke. Page tries acting like LL Cool J when he was in Deep Blue Sea while they try ripping off Samuel L Jackson's character from that same movie by having a ""millionaire"" come in. All it was missing was Thomas Jane standing in front of the glass as the shark took a bite at the glass and poof you have Deep Blue Sea reloaded. It tries to blow up the shark like jaws (yawn) and then tries to jump scare you like 47 meters down. I was actually waiting for Idris Elba to come out and talk about the breach (Pacific Rim). Also, how is it, the shark instantly picks up on the sound of the doctor splashing yet the next scene she can swim all the way over to the convienent life rafts? Also, lets not give any explanation to the fact that the shark hanging on the boat even got there In the first place. If it wasnt the meg then how is it the same size as meg. In all a terrible movie with horrible acting, worse dialogue in a movie ever, I don't think it even realizes its a shark movie (no gore, one character doesn't even die by the hands of the shark).

No. But it had some good action scenes; good characters (the little girl was a scene stealer lol); and is generally a worth while movie. So where does it fit in within the shark movies? Obviously 'Jaws' is the king. Second I would put 'The Shallows'. Now it gets interesting. I can't think of the name of that shark movie with Samuel L Jackson but I enjoyed it. You also had 'Jaws 2' but I think I'd put 'The Meg' in third place. Don't listen to the haters with too high expectations. Enjoy it for what it is: a fun summer movie,The Meg
770,alvardecampos,Painfully horrible,1,11 November 2018,"This was an unbelievably and probably consciously dumb movie. But I guess what bothers me most is that having read Steve Alten's book when it was published many years ago, I eagerly expected the movie adaptation; for which there was always talk, as the book was made in a DanBrownian, I'm-ready-for-movie, style. Now mind you, the book was not a literary masterpiece; it was a mediocre but entertaining and even slightly informative book, and mediocre books can make really fine movies under a clever director and cast. I don't know where to start from: The complete deviation (more like abusing) of the simple but decent plot of the book. The university professor-diver of the book turned badass macho man in the movie; even the most standing feature of the book plot, which is what the name of the protagonist hints to (JONAS), was completely left out in the movie and changed to a completely ridiculous alternative suitable to Expendables; which makes me wonder, why on earth didn't the director change the protagonist's name from Jonas to, well, Tucker or Jack? In order to be faithful to the book? (audience laughs). The fact that the movie tries to be scary and funny, without of course accomplishing any of these. It somewhat reminded me of Sharknado, but Sharknado was at least honest in its trash substance. The complete inaccuracy of the film (a 100-feet shark swims casually below swimmers in shallow waters and no one notices anything, no vortex created, nothing, guess it's a ninja shark).
In any case, don't make the mistake of seeing that movie and losing about 20 IQ units, you'll need some time to get them back. I do recommend the book Meg, though, even though it has some scientific inaccuracies, but compared to the film it's ""mustard"", as Jason Staham said in a movie that didn't have him appear as mentally incapacitated.",The Meg

Filmed in multiple locations above the water below the water. The colors in the sound are pretty fantastic. The acting was fine.

780,DeltonP,"Loved original Jaws and Piranha, and I really liked The Meg too!",7,11 August 2018,"I love suspenseful, disturbing, scary, bloody and gory horror films. After reading the first three ""Meg"" novels and part of the fourth, this movie which is based on the Steve Alten's books could have been all of that and more. I won't waste time worrying about what isn't in The Meg because it's better than I expected.The movie is very ""toned-down"" as many would-be critics will tell you, and I don't recall any profanity in it. That will disappoint a lot of moviegoers, but I found it refreshing. If I want to watch a GREAT shark flick, I'll pull up Jaws from my digital movie locker - or The Shallows, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Joe Dante's Piranha, The Blob (either one), Deep Blue Sea, Deep Rising, Humanoids from the Deep or one of my other 300 or so creature feature favorites when I'm in the mood for them. The Meg makes the cut and is satisfying in its own way. So what if it could have been rated PG in our world of Mortal Kombat and God of War. I still would've wanted to see it and would have liked it just as much - for the whole new world discovered in the ocean's depths and the beasties that dwell within it (much more impressive than those in the most recent Jurassic Park film, imo). And also for Jason Statham, Rainn Wilson, Cliff Curtis, Robert Taylor (Longmire!) and all of the Asian characters / actors (I liked all of them); and for the light moments and enough peril and suspense to thrill ten-year-olds who'll be seeing it (around the same age I was when I went to see Jaws).The one thing I really wished Warner Bros. and Gravity Pictures had included in their film is the way the first megalodon in Alten's ""Meg"" is transported from her world to ours. (I thought it was done much, much better in the book and would've earned an even higher score from this viewer.) Even so, I'll probably watch The Meg again as soon as I finish ""Hell's Aquarium"" (the fourth Meg novel). With luck it will still be in theaters.",The Meg

784,benc1-1,Missed Opportunity,6,22 August 2018,"So I was really excited about this movie when I saw the first trailer. That trailer and the rest of the marketing set this up to be an over the top campy fun b-movie with a bigger budget. And I believe that it was going to be at one point, but from what Jason Statham himself has said, the studio cut it back and tried to make it more accessible.So once again a big studio plays it safe and makes a perfectly acceptable movie when it could've been something better. This movie plays out pretty much how you expect it to. There are a few moments that show hints of the more campy version in some of the action sequences, but it never quite reaches the heights it could have. And this movie relies too heavily on character and plot stuff when it really doesn't need to. I just want some crazy giant shark action and that's it. Everything else around it is unnecessary.It's not all bad though. The action sequences were really entertaining. Jason Statham is badass as always and he's fun to watch. Rainn Wilson brings more of the humor and fun whenever he's there. So overall this is an entertaining movie but didn't live up to the one all the marketing pointed to. If you like dumb shark movies then this is for you. If you were expecting something more campy and subversive like I was, then you'll be slightly disappointed.",The Meg

Riddled with cliches, rip offs, and homages it delivers something unique in that it understands completely that it's not a serious film. Jon Turteltaub realizes that he directs a mediocre film at best and takes it and makes it something extraordinary. With plot holes, inconsistencies and poor editing the Meg brings something different to the table, it knows that it's just another bad monster movie but it takes that idea and turns it on its head. By understanding what viewers are expecting from something so dismal this film makes every moment special. Using meta humor and one-liners the cast of The Meg really brings this adventure to life. Now this is not a believable tale at all, there's no sense of plot or direction.

Jon turtletaub gives the franchise a serious interpretation that it deserves. The story is well written ,screenplay and editing is done precisely to give some good scares . Acting seems to have taken a back seat with most Asian actors not taking up the mantle of good acting rather unbalanced and 1d . Jason Statham has done an convincing job of playing the protagonist. Rainn Wilson brings in some humour (although its tough place to bring humour). I watched this movie with low expectations but was truly surprised how good it turned out to be. there are characters connecting together,love,hatred,sacrifice and of course some shark aggression.

The science was plausible unlike so many other shark movies. They didn't make the shark unrealistically large, that was the size of Megalodon. They even backup the claim of the strongest jaws with the photos of the an actual megalodon jaw bone where you can see the massive thickness of it. Give it the benefit of the doubt, or ""suspension of disbelief"" as it's called. There was a lot of good science shown without narrative, like the use of whale sounds to attract the shark.I liked the Morris character but he was not the typical villain. Jonas was the stereotypical hero wrongfully disgraced, but it works. Suyin is beautiful and I enjoyed the chinese aspects of it very much.I sense a lot of anti China xenophobia in the negative reviews. I love science fiction because it's about the unusual, and other cultures are a big part of that. I don't care that is partially driven by marketing to a huge chinese audience. Movies are big business, pretty much all the great movies are crass money grabs that happened to create good movies. If seeing the Chinese influence in the modern world upsets you, don't watch the movie and prepare to not watch a lot of movies.Bingbing li as Suylin is excellent and what do you know, she has a Chinese accent when speaking English and it's wonderful.

If you want to spend your money or time any better, then by all means: go do something else!! I find this movie not even being entertaining enough for a rainy Sunday afternoon. Apparently this movie is (loosely?) based on a book and I can probably assume that the book is less worse. There is no suspense and the plot is very predictable. It is actually so predictable that you can tell what is going to happen and who is going to make it from the get go. The acting is mediocre at best with the exception of Statham who is (almost as) good as always and essentially is doing all the heavy lifting in the movie.",The Meg
817,andrewjhall-25217,Not very good,1,8 June 2021,"This film is terrible not at the 'independence Day' , 'Greenland' level of ridiculousness. Which are almost surreal in their awfulness - but with those 2 they're so bad they're unintentionally laugh out loud funny. By being not quite as monstrously bad as the other two this isn't even funny.When I saw the dog in this I immediately thought of Will Smith and his dog in Independence Day But thought surely they're not going to have the same outcome which of course they did. Was this some private in joke tip of the hat to one of Independence Day's nadir's of laughability - it almost felt like it.The 'Meg' book was definitely a hundred times better and I'm not usually even that into plotty thriller type novels.Use the two hours you could put aside for watching this film for something else Or just look at the short clip of the megaladon leaping out of the sea and sinking their boat as that's about the only minute worth watching.",The Meg

You would imagine that in 2018, writers and directors would research better and come up with a better screenplay than what your average 8 year olds could come up with. Well, you would be wrong, because here we are, on the movie page of The Meg.If you want to watch a good Shark attack movie? Watch Jaws. You want to watch a ridiculously cheesy Shark attack movie? Watch Deep Blue Sea. You want to see a topless Jason Statham? Google ""Topless Jason Statham"". You are a Rainn Wilson fan and cant have enough of him? Rewatch The Office. Ruby Rose?

822,admtech69,Statham has literally Jumped the Shark.,1,10 August 2018,"Jason Statham, arguably a worthy successor of Daniel Craig as the next James Bond, has taken an odd misstep in ""The Meg"". I can only assume there were many, many zeroes more than ""007"" involved in influencing his decision to take a role in this picture. A deep-sea submersible is under threat by a massive Megaladon Shark, long thought to be extinct, now lies at the bottom of the deepest trench in the Pacific with its crew trapped inside. With time running out, Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) is recruited to save the crew. As the movie progresses, we find out that Taylor had encountered the Shark long before and is a practitioner of the long lost art of Shark Punching. I wanted to like Jon Turteltaub's movie but The Meg is bad, but only rarely in the fun way. Maybe it would be better if they went full Camp, as in the Sharknado Franchise?Statham seems itching for some of his usual classic James Bond-style British Ass-kickery for which he is known, most of which is not on display. 
Rainn Wilson plays shifty billionaire who's financed a deep-sea exploration project. This is a Chinese production, taking place off the coast of Shanghai. Chinese star Li Bingbing has been enlisted to support Statham, her charismatic quality shining through a roughed-in character.The most important cast member, though, is of course the titular Massive Meg, a CGI creation who appears early and often.There are a few chuckle-worthy sight gags and the third act climax, involving a bunch of panicked beachgoers, which evokes Jaws in a knowing tribute, provides some legitimate thrills. Shark fans are likely to be interested, but be warned: It's clumsy and slow and lacks genuine scares.",The Meg

Even the story is half plausible. About half way through it starts getting weird. More and more Chinese references, and the film ends in China. WHAT? Must have Chinese backing, I thought. And sure enough. This is a thinly veiled attempt to portray China as a 'normal' place instead of the totalitarian nightmarish dictatorship it really is. Gross. I don't understand why Statham agreed to do this. Money I guess.

If you are, like I was, hoping to see a great action horror movie with a giant shark destroying all in its path, well my friends, you are going to be greatly disappointed. Even Jason Statham couldn't save this pile of garbage from sinking to the depths of oblivion. It was a battle to actually sit through the entire thing. I don't think I enjoyed anything about it, from dialogue and jokes aimed at children, to Statham receiving relationship advice from an 8 year old girl in a subplot that was so incredibly cringeworthy and unnecessary to the plot I was completely embarrassed to continue looking. Along with moments of cgi that belong on the Syfy channel and a scene basically ripped directly from Jaws, It continued to get worse. The thing that annoys me with these particular films, especially when adapted from books, is that the premise and source material are there for the taking and time and time again we are given these crap movies that are nothing more than a waste of time. I understand it was never going to win any academy awards, but at least create something that I can enjoy from the word go. The Meg has now entered the list of my most hated movies of 2018.",The Meg

830,Parkinson-sasquatch-189,50/50 is the best I can say,5,18 August 2018,"There were many redeeming qualities that gave this movie an aura of adrenaline junky's delight. Unfortunately, there were just as many condemning qualities, counteracting the wow-factor exuded by the surprisingly solid CGI. All in all, I will say the best part of the movie was the CGI. By far not the greatest I have ever seen, but still great enough to make the movie worth seeing for the sole purpose of the scene in which Jason Statham rides the Meg out of the water using a knife as a handle and stabbing the massive beast in the eye with a harpoon. 
On the other hand, however, the acting in most cases was horrendous. Cheesy dialogue perpetuated by clunky, one-demensional dribble; all of this punctuated by possibly the worst performance of the year (aside from the cast of Slender Man), in Bingbing Li. I hate to harp on it but she ruined ABSOLUTELY EVERY SCENE INCLUDING HER.

832,gordonlukas62,What Did You Expect?,3,12 August 2018,"I don't think I've ever been in a more apathetic audience for a new release movie than this. During the entire screening, no one seemed invested in the movie. No one seemed to care, because the movie didn't care. This is the epitome of brain dead entertainment. It's bizarrely written, with poor delivery by mostly every actor except Statham. The pandering to the Chinese film market is as apparent as any Michael Bay Transformers movie. There are so many stupid lines in this film, whether they're supposed to be badass (""When it's man versus meg, it's slaughter), hafl-assed social commentary (""They kill the sharks, just so they can have a bowl of soup""), or expositional dumping. None of the characters except from Statham make any sense. Rainn Wilson's billionaire character has funded this incredibly expensive underwater research facility, yet has no idea what they're studying at the start of the movie. Characters come and go, each one more forgettable than the last. There's a significant amount of stereotypes for ""comedic effect"" and a plethora of cheap product placement (closeups on Rainn Wilson's Nike shoes at the beginning of the film, and a really awkward scene based around Coca-Cola). While it sounds like I'm bashing this terrible movie, it is actually a lot of fun. The Meg is the type of movie you watch when you're bored and literally have nothing else to do. It's a tension-less, bloodless shark movie that's been sanitized to high hell to fit a PG-13 rating, and has some of the stupidest crap I've ever seen in a mainstream blockbuster, but there's a certain enjoyment to be had in it. It's like eating a bag of Funyuns. You know you're eating junk, but it just kind of tastes good.",The Meg

Suspense? hardly any, forced jokes? a few, not good at all however im afraid, the main protagonist Meg? hardly gets any decent screen time, the characters, are all as empty and devoid of a background as you can have them be, so creating an emotional connection between the viewer and them is IMPOSSIBRU, i didnt care for nobody, not even Meg, in the end, i was like whatever...The movie is in its most just plain boring, seriously, i wish they had took another way with this lowsy script, but there are hardly any redeeming qualities to this movie, i still gave it a 5 because, although the movie is close to awful of just how boring it is, it is still a shark movie (1 point), a megalodon shark movie (1point), has Jason (1point) and the other two were give as professional courtesy, cause i hate to see movies getting ratings below 5 specially when they could have been great.Anyway, there are much better offers out there some even recent and DECENT, such as the Shallows, or even the not so highly rated 47mts down, which btw despite all its flaws, beats this movie in every aspect, suspense, claustrophobic feelings, the sharks themselves, seriously a lot better, tighter script, solid performances, nice character development.The best i can tell u guys, is AVOID SEEING IT IN THE CINEMA, you are most definitely regret the money you spend.

The shark looks pretty good and the way they end it was clever. A lot underwater vehicle scenes, probably too much really. Definitely needed more gore and less whale guts/brains or whatever that was. I suppose they wanted a movie everyone could see but seriously not one moment of suffering or fighting it off, no one really even gets dragged around by the shark. It's all just CHOMP gone, CHOMP gone. That doesn't really instill the fear that a giant shark is murdering everyone and must be stopped ASAP. I liked because the jump scares were good and we saw it in an imax. It was better than the shallows but I liked it too.

849,jcosully,A good summer movie,4,22 October 2018,"I read the original book, by Steve Alten, and it is way different than this. The book was about a publicly humiliated scientist who was trying to prove a prieviously thought extinct 'megladon' is real. It eventually turns out that it is, and he is the only one who knows who to defeat it. The book focuses on the grief and shame of being called out by the public, marriages that are falling apart, and losing your friends. The movie has some of those elements in it, but it does not focus on those whatsoever. Instead, it becomes a monster movie. It is ridiculous, but not on sharknado levels. It also doesn't try to be Jaws, by any means, so it's kind of stuck in between being a stupid and funny shark flick, and a series character compelled thriller. The special effects are good enough to not distract, and the scenery is vibrant and colorful. The plot is very thin, but the action makes up for it, filling in the gaps. My main problems with The Meg were its focus on the shark and not the characters, and how far away it strays from the source material. At least it has Dwight in it.",The Meg

I'm not sure that I would necessarily call this a thriller or a scary movie. It was actually a completely different concept. It opens with a sneak peak to what you might be facing. And it looks like it might be a repeat on the shark movies. Then it goes completely somewhere new.
The storyline isn't really anything I've seen before. The actors were mostly people we've seen in other movies. Good actors with plenty of class and professionalism, not just cheap copies. Plenty of good tasteful humor. Everyone doesn't have to get ripped to shreds and die to call it entertainment.
I'll leave it there to keep from giving too much away. But I did not go see it in theaters because I was tired of the same old shark movies, especially since I saw Jaws when it came out.

868,Applejack75,Enjoyable Pap,7,13 October 2018,"6.5 rounded up for 1 star internet rage raters. Sick of idiots shouting ""BOTS!"" anytime reviews don't agree with their extreme opinions on something. These people are paranoid narcissists. They should not be given access to the internet.But I digress...The movie was a summer blockbuster through-and-through, and it was quite enjoyable just taken as-is. It's easy to see wasted potential/missed opportunity, but it is what it is. A summer movie made for teens, and enjoyable as that (despite my being older, I can still remember what it was like to be one 😉).The acting was fine. No Oscars in the future for The Meg, but there's charisma to spare with this cast. 
The effects didn't make me cringe like almost every other shark movie out there. It doesn't feel like they over do it with the shark, but also doesn't seem like they make excuses not to show it to save money on the production. When you do see it, it looks good, ominous, and believable. 
There's plenty of armrest gripping tension in many scenes to keep you engaged, though not much in the way of payoff when someone does eat it (or gets eaten, as the case may be). There's little depth beyond the trench they're exploring, but is anyone expecting that here? I would hope not. 
Some of the humor is definitely forced (the hair joke... He knows EXACTLY what happened to her hair, but the question tees up her comeback so.... You'll know it when you see it. SMH), but for the most part it's digestible and serves it's purpose as a palate cleanser between the tense momentsI think that all-in-all the movie succeeds at being exactly what it set out to be, and while it did have some potential to be something more, I have the feeling that they would've failed if they went for it. It would've taken some exceptional talent to realize it, and no-offense, that talent wasn't on board for this film.I would recommend this when you're looking for something light and fun.

Oh yeah, to all the people comparing this to Jaws: STOP! Not every shark movie needs to be compared to Jaws. There will never be another Jaws, and if there were, it wouldn't be about a shark. Jaws was special because it was a first for its type and a masterpiece by one of the greatest directors of all time, made all the more amazing by having to work creatively around technical problems that no one predicted and then released in just the right era and perfect time of year. A confluence of factors that is just not going to happen twice, even if they try to force it.""Alien"" is more like Jaws than you should expect any shark movie made since or in the future to be.",The Meg

As the movie progresses and we continue to watch absurdity after absurdity we just care less and less about characters.

The helicopter crashes were so predictable, the arrogant rich guy dies , the good looking women all survive, the good old heroic sacrifices , this has it all.

Numerous books later his fans remain. But hopefully not because of the film version of his novel. Spielberg's shark opus will never be topped simply because he created great characters and a tense plot that makes it one of the greatest horror films of all time. All of which this film lacks. But they happily stole many of the Jaws scenes from the beach attack to the boat destruction. The only thing they left out was the line, ""We need a bigger boat"". Between the death and destruction are the comedic lines that sound rediculous and truly out of place. 
I suppose if you're looking for light summer action then this is your film. The perfect ""Creature double feature"" type of film. Where Jaws made you want to stay clear of the beaches, Meg is silly fluff. 
The acting is fair at best and Statham puts on his usual show of bravado and heroism. I'm sure it will make money and it is close to family fare. But beware! The kids will love it, but parents might want to sit this one out.

Hell, he'd know what I mean). You don't even have to watch the trailer to know what you're in for - just look at the poster and decide if you might be morally offended by the sometimes dodgy acting.Movie summery: Perfect stoner movie. I watched this sober, but still came out feeling a little stoned. Nevertheless, I will be returning online better prepared. In one review I read ""extremely unconvincing""! And ""storyline"" and so on and ""CGI"" and so on and ""want money back"" yada yada barf... The reviews are pretty depressing to scan over, actually. You have to assume - or hope - it's kids in that ""nah - would never happen like that"" phase. Pics or didn't happen memes. That mindset is kinda like when you hit about age 4, and realise The Wile E. Coyote would begin plummeting toward Earth * long before realising* he's already ran off the cliff edge.

Don't get into the whole acting/cinematography spiel after you've seen that poster and willingly payed to see it.

It wanted to be in the same market as Jaws, Deep Blue Sea, The Shallows, and Deep Blue Sea for obvious reasons, but it lacked a vital denominator that connects the others - suspense. They are a type of horror film that really keeps us on our toes and gets us worried about the characters, not knowing how things will ultimately pan out in the end. This wasn't horror, thrilling, or suspenseful, it was an action movie starring Jason Statham. The characters were forgettable, two-dimensional, and even though they were constantly in peril, you never really believe it because you don't really care about who they were.The whole ""this is the biggest shark in the history of shark movies"" thing is mostly a gimmick, and they completely rely on that gimmick for any success it actually finds. Yes, the graphics were rather decent, but this happens to be the most forgettable shark I've ever seen in a movie like this. The size is memorable, that's it. As for Statham, he was so underutilized because this isn't his type of movie, action, or character. It was fine for what it was, but it literally anyone could've played that role.

Already unbelievable, if you're saying the gas barricade was enough to protect the shark from freezing temperatures, that's perfect. However, then you say there was a rupture allowing the warm water, and the meg, to swim through. Then you follow with it closing back up immediately though, so did this shark learn how to evolve and change its body temperature within 10 minutes of eating its first ever human?? Then, OF COURSE, the woman scientist pleads for non-lethal options before killing this beast, that has already killed someone and is proving powerful enough to kill them.

931,bacondar-58965,I've been waiting 21 years for this movie and it was worth it,10,18 August 2018,"I'm a little confused by the hating but have come to realize there are just people who want to hate on something so they stand out in the crowd. Meh, what ev's. I read this book when it first came out in 1997 and have read eagerly all the sequels that followed it. Many times they announce that it was soon to be a major motion picture, or a made for tv movie and so on and every time it fell apart. When I first heard early this year that this was happening I didn't believe it til I saw the first trailer and bounced in my seat in the theater when I saw it finally. People go to these movies thinking it will be something so spiritually uplifting that it will change your life. This and other movies are simply what they are meant to be, a block buster to entertain you and for you to enjoy, nothing more. When you see Transformers, what you are getting is giant space robots kicking other space robots asses. Nothing more. When you go see a shark movie like this, you are getting a shark movie that hopefully will entertain you and you will walk out going that was fun. Was this a full on take of the book? not quite. Was it fairly close, mostly. The actors were fun and the movie was more than enjoyable. Yes there has been some griping recently from actors and the makers saying they wanted to go for a bloodier version but realized in order to be accessible to the masses, they had to tone it down to be PG. When you want to appeal to a broad audience to make money, then you have to unfortunately make some choices. They did and it worked for them as it made more money in it's opening weekend by double than what they predicted. It's fairly hard to make me jump during a movie and this had a couple scenes that made me flinch in surprise so BRAVO for that. I enjoyed it and thought it was a fun summer flick and actually enjoyed the characters and their interactions. I've heard some griping about the Asian actors being put into it to appeal to that demographic, before you say things like that read the source material. That's who they were in the books as well as it does take place in that part of the world. So go with an open mind and expect a fun roller coaster of a ride and know that that's what you will get. This will not be the movie that changes your life, but will make it more fun for a couple hours.",The Meg
932,mechmudd,Fun summer popcorn flick,7,12 September 2018,"This movie isn't a great feat of cinematic genius. It hits the same beats as a Fast and Furious or Transformers movie, but if you want some good action, a good monster, and a who cares romance sub plot this is for you.",The Meg

936,tobysillett,Exactly what you were expecting,3,10 May 2019,"It is what it is. The best actor was the megalodon. When she wasn't on the screen, every other scene dragged.

The less lines the better.But no one was expecting Jaws, so should be relatively satisfied.",The Meg
937,wiscohiker,"Pure entertainment, just what I hoped for.",10,26 November 2018,"When I watch an adventure movie, especially a disaster or shark movie, my criteria are pretty basic. They need good actors (check), editing that keeps the pace moving (check), special effects that don't make me laugh (check), and writing that doesn't get in the way of enjoying the adrenaline rushes (check). So I would never come into this expecting a masterpiece.I also like to give each movie a clean slate. The temptation to compare this movie to Jaws is an obvious one. It did seam like the writing in movies back then was in general more sophisticated, and assumed more intelligence from the audience. I did notice that difference in this case, but I frankly did not care. I liked the characters, and the actors depiction of them, and I'm not going to expect them to put in some wise cranky old guy to add depth to the movie. It just didn't need that. Again, my goals were to be wildly entertained and scared to the point where I involuntarily drew my feet up onto the couch to avoid getting ""bitten"" (yes that happened).Although the ploy to entice Chinese audiences was obvious, I loved all the actors, so I didn't care about that. If they want to movie to take place over there, fine, it didn't effect the movie at all.So for me, this had just the right amount of action, character connection, and fright. It completely entertained me. Not every movie I watch is required to make me think afterward, and especially not a shark movie. I loved watching this so much. it ranks 10 as a shark movie. Now if this level of writing was attempting to be something more sophisticated the rating would be lower. But it was not trying to be something like that. It fully hits the expectation for it's genre.",The Meg

952,delaneyolexa,It was ok,5,12 August 2018,"This movie gets an automatic 3 stars just for being centered around a shark. The other two come from the spattering of decent jump scares and the daughter of Suyin's unpredictable comments. However, that still leaves fifty percent of the stars missing. Those 5 leftover stars were trashed as soon as Rainn Wilson strutted out in his repulsive, hipster outfit, seemingly attempting to turn a 52 year old actor that wasn't fit for this type of movie into a younger billionaire meant for comic relief. Then add on the rest of the subpar acting, predictable moments, pointless romance, 30 minute bore-fest about a cloud that they used to think was the bottom of the ocean (some background just isn't necessary), and lengthy runtime, and you've got a subtraction of five stars. This film wasn't decent enough to be grouped with ""The Shallows"", but it wasn't bad enough to be put with the ""Sharknado"" franchise. People find enjoyment in both of those movies for different reasons. ""The Shallows"" offers a fantastic one-woman performance keeping you on your toes the whole time. The camera work was amazing and the acting, even better. The ""Sharknado"" movies are just so poorly made and executed they're laughable. As I said, each movie is liked for a different reason, but, nonetheless, they're appreciated by many. ""The Meg"" sits right in the center of this scale of shark movies, which makes it subject to mediocracy. That's the worst category a movie can fall in, but that's where ""The Meg"" stands. I hate to see another shark movie go to waste, but this was almost as big of a let-down to shark lovers as ""Shark Week 2017"", when Michael Phelps didn't actually race the great white shark head on in the ocean. My five stars is generous, but I'm willing to give them for the Megalodon.",The Meg

The one liners that is supposed to make the audience laugh failed miserable and most of the time cringe worthy. The CGI is Sci-fi channel worthy at best. In addition, soon as I see a Chinese production company at its opening, I already had a bad feeling.

I don't mind dumb movies with some entertainment factor to kill some time after work. But even under this premise, I was let down terribly by this atrocity of a movie. The beginning is actually not that bad until the first real appearance of the Meg and then the whole movie goes downhill at an unprecedented speed. It is hard to say, which of the following factors, contributing to the ""quality"" of this movie, is the most prominent one, so You can switch it around as You seem fit:The fact, that aside from the shark, Jason Statham is by far the best actor in this mess and seemingly the only one trying to look like he/she is speaking freely , when having any speaking lines, says a lot about the cast. There is also absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters.The movie literally has no idea, when it should be suspenseful, funny, dramatic or anything and ultimately manages to be nothing of it at all. Basically all potentially suspenseful scenes are burned by unhumourus jokes or scenes, the attempt of romance or drama included is totally misplaced and just feels like they are trying to stretch the length of the movie with just whatever content. The few attempts to have some character development feel just forced and in the attempt just lead to that I was just cheering for the shark to kill everyone off.Why do all action movies these days have to become a one-liner festival? If You want to know, how to do this in a proper way, do it like for example in movies like ""Aliens"", otherwise just leave it, as it just gets really annoying.The movie basically rubs it every minute into the face of the viewer, that for commercial reasons it wants to cater to the Chinese market.",The Meg

To compare with other creature-features of 2018 so far, it is better than Rampage and FAR BETTER than Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in terms of entertainment value and action scenes (which is essentially what you should be there for).

There is clearly a Chinese element to this film, after all it has been bank rolled by them, but it doesn't detract from the movie.

The one redeeming feature this movie has is the amount of frights you get, however even the way these are contrived is repetitive- they're in the boat, they're knocked out the boat.All in all this movie is a shocker and I have no idea how people are scoring it any higher than 3/10.",The Meg

Jason Statham was hired to play his usual sociopathic irreverent action hero, which I like,... to a stress point: It's like they gave him insistent electroshocks to make him do that. Some of the actors could have been replaced by animatronics. Overall a little fun to watch, close to OK if it's an excuse to chug down some ice cream but if you have seen Jaws, making a comparison will be unavoidable and you'll miss that tension.

The script is nothing new but that could have gone very right had there been any other redeeming quality to this movie... First of all it's the poor acting, combined with the lack of any film effect and the frames per second we've come to be used to in a movie, makes everything seem contrived, cheaply contrived at that. Or should i say the higher frame count simply is less forgiving of the acting. Then there's the characters who are utterly stereotypical and they would be fine if the movie were a parody and not trying to be a serious thrill. There's also the ""science"" which is quite nonsensical. That too could have potentially saved the movie by making the scenario seem the slightest bit plausible. There are a few tense moments that's true, which are helped a bit by the special effects we've come to expect in the age of computer generated graphics but those aren't quite enough to classify this as more than a B movie one watches when there's nothing else.",The Meg

The biggest problem in my book, is how they used the shark. Why do people go see shark movies, or dinosaur movies, or giant crocodile movies? To watch horrible people get eaten. Not baby whales, not faceless extras, but the kind of people you love to hate. No one would remember Dennis Nedry's Death in Jurassic Park if he'd simply died because the car crashed. So why did The Meg have such a high body count of people who died in explosions instead of by shark Bite? Sure, you could say ""they're at such low depths! They couldn't be directly killed by the shark!"" To which I reply ""Come on. It's a giant shark movie. They could find a way.""
The second issue was the obvious pandering to the Chinese market. Diversity is a great thing. There are loads of highly talented Asian actors who deserve more recognition in America, and it's awesome that Hollywood is finally giving them a chance to be in leading roles. Unfortunately, The Meg was not a sterling showcase. Instead, you come away with the distinct impression the producers had no faith in it performing well domestically, so decided to make it as easy as possible to sell in the foreign market.

990,alistarinthehood,What do you expect?,5,20 May 2019,"Listen, we weren't really expecting this to make a whole load of sense were we? I mean a shark that is extinct comes back? I found it interesting at the beginning because it felt unique, it felt it was gonna be different. When the latter half came, it felt as if deja vu. Don't get me wrong it isn't a bad movie, I just feel that because at the beginning it seemed interesting that when things started to be like a generic shark movie people didn't resound well thus bad scores. Honestly I might be a bit harsh here, I just wasn't satisfied with the ending, but it isn't a bad movie. It's pretty average, but if you are into shark movies, you will like it more than someone looking for some action.",The Meg
991,surajkartha_31,Why?,6,20 September 2018,"The movie that resembles close to what The Meg is all about is The Jaws. But don't get me wrong, this movie is nowhere close to The Jaws.There's a reason why The Jaws got 8 on IMDB (at the time of writing this review). And that's purely to do with magical film-making and a job well done by actors as well as the rest of the crew. The Jaws has everything a film-maker needs to learn about building on the concept, developing and utilizing the movie characters properly and tapping the right nerves of the viewer. This is why I was deeply saddened after watching The Meg. Because we aren't living in an era where ""the obvious"" can't be spotted. This is an era of an audience whose expectations have soared high in the recent years. And this is where The Meg fails. The concept is good, undoubtedly. But just imagine for a moment. What if you didn't know what exactly the movie was all about, what if the title didn't reveal much and what if you just couldn't see the reason for explorers of the sea disappearing in the movie (think ""A Quiet Place"" which is a 2018 movie). Now that would've been a movie worth watching. But well, The Meg doesn't utilize the potential thrilling/suspense aspect of the story and reveals the sea monster too soon. Now if that weren't enough, what disturbed me the most were the portions where you don't see any shock on part of characters who witnessed their colleague or a friend die in the movie. I mean, death in itself is devastating and knowing that someone you know was with you moments back before they died, that's bound to be shocking for any normal human being. But the movie miserably fails to capture these emotions. And most of the actors too didn't do justice to their roles. Special mention to Bingbing Li and Page Kennedy who played Suyin and DJ in the movie. Bingbing Li is in her 40s and she looks amazing for her age. But as an actor, I just couldn't connect with her character Suyin. Because, the intensity with which she spoke throughout the movie, it was as though she was fighting or having an argument with someone. And as for Page Kennedy who played DJ? Well, the expression-less face just did it for me.So a 6/10 solely for the special effects and well, being a Jason Statham fan, I just can't give it 5 which is what it actually deserved. The Meg is a one time watch movie that had the potential of being an amazing cinematic experience.",The Meg

997,jonathan_myersstu,The Meg Review,8,25 September 2018,"I saw this opening day.That was a thing I did.Hey, don't judge me. I like shark movies, The Meg was out, I didn't have anything to do, so I decided to go see it.So The Meg is the inevitable non-Sharknado shark movie that comes out every summer (because there's also a Sharknado movie that comes out every year). This trend brought us an absolute masterpiece of this genre, The Shallows, 2 years ago. Last year, it also brought us 47 Meters Down, an unintentionally hilarious movie ( I'll let you decide if that's a good thing or not. It's on Netflix if you're interested). Whereas The Shallows was a very gritty film and 47 Meters Down at least tried to be one, I could tell that The Meg was going to be intentionally silly. I mean, it's about a Megalodon! If you have the intentions of watching a thought-provoking masterpiece, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. But let's be honest: no one in their right mind would think that THIS would be that type of movie. I just thought it would be a fun, somewhat tense, and somewhat enjoyably stupid shark thriller. And it certainly delivered. The Meg takes its ridiculous premise and just runs.... no, not runs..... swims with it.In terms of intensity, it was relatively mild compared to The Shallows. But The Shallows has a level of intensity that many shark movies only dream of replicating. The Meg has its fair share nerve-racking scenes and some pretty effective jumpscares, however. The effects are top notch, which is especially good considering this film came from the studio who brought us Justice League. I can definitely say I felt much more suspense watching The Meg than I did watching 47 Meters Down, even though the latter was a more serious movie. However, this is certainly the most lighthearted movie in this genre that I've seen. It actually might be more of an action comedy rather than a thriller. One of the things I really like about this film is the self-awareness it has. It knows what it is and what it's trying to be: simply a fun movie about a ginormous shark. And it is fun, yet without losing its thrills. It can be hilarious at one point and thrilling at another.The cast was pretty good. I know I say this a lot, but they really seemed to enjoy filming this movie. My personal favorite was the little girl, who was unbelievably cute and funny. I also thought Dwight Schrute was pretty funny as a billionaire (that's right, he plays a billionaire. I'm as confused as you are). However, there were some character development issues, as expected with this type of movie. It's scattershot in which characters are developed and which ones aren't. Jason Statham's character probably had the most character development, which is good considering that he's the main character. However, some of the side characters had it and others were quite literally (for lack of a better term) shark chum. Like seriously, some of the characters were just there to get eaten by the shark. This is something that even The Shallows struggled with. Or if you're tired of me referencing that movie, Jaws struggled with it too. Like seriously, what do you know about that girl who dies at the beginning? Or the guy in the pond? Nothing right? This movie also has that problem, but it honestly isn't a big issue considering what type of movie it is.In all honesty, I don't really have too much to say about it. I did notice that the critics are split 50/50 about it. And to that, I say this: don't expect it to be a masterpiece. Unless you're determined to find its faults rather than the enjoyable parts of this movie, you should be able to have fun watching this movie. Just take it for what it is and enjoy.The Meg gave me exactly what I wanted: a goofy movie about a huge freaking shark.",The Meg
998,ameyvalian,Little guilty pleasure! Easily forgotten!,5,21 November 2018,"First of all, if you watch this movie with ""JAWS"" as a reference, get ready....you'll need a LOT of painkillers for your migrane! This movie IS NOT Jaws! to begin with I already had a strange feeling when I saw that it was rated 8+ when I got it from my cable provider. An 8+ movie about a giant Megalodon eating people...... yeah sure! With my wife we made a bet at the very beginning to see which character would not make it to the end, and guess what! we both won with perfect score! This little flick was a pure ""cliché"" galore, oneliner fest with maybe 2 or 3 jump scares that we saw coming from a mile away! Never the less, I actually had fun watching it. some well placed jokes, none of the characters were actually hatefully annoying (but not memorables either). If you want a movie perfect to enjoy some pop-corn (or Gummy Bears as I did), switch your brain OFF for a couple of hours and have some very simple and mindless fun, give it a go!.......if you are expecting ""The Green Mile"", yeeeah.... no! Watch something else! In general the CGI was ok, expect some parts that feeled rushed, and veeeeeeeeeeery little blood! almost nothing!

I saw it twice in theatres & have watched it many more times at home. The entire family has gotten a lot of enjoyment out of The Meg. I am impatiently awaiting the 4K release with deleted scenes and hopefully a gag reel. Ruby Rose was impressive. Stathom and Wilson were on pointy with their performances. It's a movie about an enormous prehistoric shark that ascends from the ocean's floor to wreak havoc on anyone it comes in contact with. How could that not make for a fun time at the movies?

1013,wangxyun,New Level of American-Chinese Cooperation Film,8,8 August 2018,"I have high expectations for this film and I have to say that it is beyond expectations. Acquainted friends know that I am a swimming enthusiast, I am crazy about water, so I will not miss this underwater adventured movie.First to say the visual effect, one of the highlights of this film. It can be seen that the crew is working hard, and the underwater world is really eye-attracking. As I was several lucky movie-goers who was able to see premiere, I cannot choose the seat and 3rd Raw is rather dizzy for CMAX screen.
Since China and America are co productions, Chinese actors must be indispensable. In recent years, many Chinese actors have been involved in Hollywood movies. They are being used as tools to make box-office, only to play some unimportant supportung roles. But this time, Li Bingbing didn't let the audience down, at least not let me down. From the lines, the pronunciation is absolutely well trained, although still sounds like Chinese people speak English, it is fluent and very natural, better than not young and light people. In addition, it is reported that she is very afraid of water, but in the underwater shots she performed confident and calm and her swimming skill seems quite professional.When it comes to actors, I'd like to comment on Jason Statham alone, and I've always thought that an action actor can only fight but not actually acting. But Jason Statham completely subverted my previous understanding. The upper body of strong muscle can be fully compared with Olivier Giroud and other athletes. While young Statham was professional diving member of British team, yet it was a little bit pity that he didn't do a difficult diving posture in this film. Perhaps, we lost a perfect diver. Fortunately, we are able to see his beautiful underwater acting.This film contained twists and turns plot, there are laughers and there are screams of the audience as well. Adults need to be carefully considered whether to take children or not.In a word, it is a masterpiece of Sino US co production. It is beyond expectation and worth watching in an IMAX screen.",The Meg

1020,hoovytube,No reason to exist.,2,24 August 2018,"I like writing reviews so I guess that throwing the additional 2 cents won't hurt.
This movie succeeds when it's unself-aware and unintentionally funny, for example the overdone cliches that are clearly from an old draft of the script like: attractive goth chick that says exposition, black dude being the comedic relief, character dying and saying dialogue to the protagonist, speaking computer informing us about danger, characters breaking character and the list goes on. From the positives: some of the music was good and didn't sound like stock music, the creature interactions were seamless and some characters not being one dimensional.
Of course the screenplay is dated, barely any scenes bring tension, the acting is sub par, the shark cgi laughable, but i truly don't need that much from a creature movie. Being objective, this isn't the worst movie of all time, hell I believe that this isn't the worst movie of 2018 since the competition is huge, but the biggest crime such a movie can do is being so bland that you get bored and don't even have enough energy to constantly laugh about the mistakes of the filmmakers. This movie would benefit from being more self aware, sticking our protagonists in a place where the escape is hard, well written character-driven comedy and most importantly going over the top as it is a movie where a 75 meter shark kills people.

In the movie, Jonas slashes the Meg across the belly and lets hundreds of sharks devour it.'I saw this in 'Screen X' a new to the UK screen type with two screens on the left and right wall of the screen, This in no way enhances the film, in fact i'd go so far as to say maybe use this once for the novelty aspect but then never again - the screens could have been used FAR better and maybe used to show underwater life float past you, this wasn't done and the screens come on/off periodically rather than staying on throughout the film so they also give away that there is an important scene coming up, i also foresee that those screens will become VERY noticeably grime ridden as they become older unless they're cleaned specifically & in truth cant see that occurring.Overall Statham Statham's very well and cant fault him but as a film this just underwhelms so badly given the hype it generated3.5/10 but can't give half stars",The Meg

It was a good 90 mins of entertainment.",The Meg
1039,cometomepafomae,Amazing acting!,10,4 June 2021,"This film was unique and fun in its own way, to start it all off we've got to give credit to the actors/actressesBrilliant acting from Jason Statham (the main star)
The way he portrayed his part and acted it out was incredible so very well done to him.Another one from Li BingBing. A very good well done to you. The way you showed everyone that your the tough one. Even though I may be a girl that doesn't stop me doing what I love and diving with Megalodons.Another big congrats to Page Kennedy. The way you showed your emotion was marvellous. Even though you were scared, you acted it out so well and we are all proud for that.And obviously to everyone else that had a part in this film.Brilliant film overall and we are all looking forward to the meg sequel.",The Meg
1040,g-chenfan,Good fun monster flick,8,24 January 2019,"If you are into monster flicks, this is for you! I say this because going into one of these movies, you are not expecting to have a deep intricate story line with lots of character development or tense drama that will leave you thinking about the movies days after. You go in, expecting that some of the content will be a bit stereo typical and predictable borderline cheesy, with similar characters/situations that you are familiar with and a complete escapism mindset into a make believe world. This movie does not try to make itself to be believable in that sense that its trying to hit science right on the nose nor does it try to make you believe that the possibly that a Megalodon could still exist (or is it!?! lol). Suspend your disbelief and just enjoy this fun ride. You may even find yourself rooting for the shark! Don't trust some of these ridiculous (and spiteful) reviews about how bad this movie is or how terrible the actors/actresses are. I'm pretty sure they went into it picking apart all that the movie didn't do right or whatever reason they need to just openly bash and hate on this movie.",The Meg

The acting, the CGI, the plot, everything was awful. My 12-year-old and 8-year-old sons were ""bored"". You see the shark in the movie just about as many times you see it in the trailer and the CGI is so fake I felt as though my eyes couldn't keep up with it. The actors including Rain Wilson were B actor quality, the addition of the tough hot chick was forced and pointless and nothing more than a generic version of a 1990's Angelina Jolie. I am not sure how it gained the 6.1 score, but what I watched was awful and unwatchable. I wouldn't even suggest it for a corny kitschy good time. If you are looking for that watch Sharknado.",The Meg

What is essentially a SYFY original with house name celebrities, The Meg offers campy mayhem in the best way possible. Jason Statham also gives one of his funniest performances while taking on this gigantic shark (and drinking problem). The two complaints I had was the PG-13 rating (I want gore!)and the CGI (at times) took me out of the story and had wish they used practical effects. However, the CGI worked 80 percent of the time.

1049,FusionX8,Jason Statham Movie - I enjoyed it,10,30 November 2020,"I honestly really enjoyed this movie. At one point, it was anticlimactic but then a twist which renewed it's self.If you have seen other Jason Statham Movies, then you know what to expect. This is a bit different than his other roles - there is no fighting military or marital arts style.The movie has some cute moments, sad moments and a lot of suspense, beautiful graphics, dark comedy. There are a few moments of 'why would you do that?' or 'that's not how that works' but it is an enjoyable flick and I will watch it again.This is a break up from other shark attack movies, or movies like this. There are some characters (one in particular) that don't fit. There are even some stereotypical concepts from other movies incorporated that were a bit rushed. (Trying to stay away from spoilers)Character development was rushed and we get our typical back story of the hero's journey which makes up just about all movies and books, stories of overcoming odds.
1. Ordinary world
2. Call to adventure
3. Refusal of the call
4. Meeting with the mentor
5. Crossing the first threshold
6. Tests, allies and enemies
7. Approach to the inmost cave
8. The ordeal
9. Reward
10. The road back
11. The resurrection
12. Return with the elixirBut that just moved us faster to the suspense which is more of what this movie is about. Lot's of movies spend a lot of time on character development and when they finally paint the full picture of character they have to rush the plot or make it a 2hr+ movie.This was an enjoyable flick I will watch again and again.
I would give this movie a 7 out of 10 because there are only a 100-200 or so movies I have, or would re-watch (I own around 2204 movies/Shows). -- but I feel this movie has been rated harshly and therefore I give it a 10.",The Meg

It's so Cheesy! All the cliches are there, and the acting is worse than anything this year! Every character wants to be a hero and as fast as one does he/she is forgotten, all smiles and laughter after every death..

I inferred ""Jaws redone bigger."" I got Jaws homages and blatant (intended) scenes that sent be back to that movie.
I saw no hint of bloody horror. They delivered action and some good suspense.I loved it.

1072,aunni5,Fun movie that you will enjoy if you keep your critics cap aside for 2 hours!,5,25 September 2018,"Non spoiler review: So the elephant in the room: Meg is a fun and easy to watch movie which has much borrowed much from original jaws movie and has added all the nonsense that script can. There's is nowhere to go with the script it was all expected. And yeah it's a chinese sci-fi movie in which hollywood actors has appeared.As a Jason Statham fan i enjoyed the movie as he was fitting for the macho character he is expected to portrait. Killing a meg with a fishing spear, that only he can do. lol. Beacuse of the charm and macho effect that Jason brings in he can even kill godzilla or king kong and i will accept it. There are only few actors who can portrait such heroic act like Keanu with his pencil and Bruce Willis with a revolver in his hand. All the characters where pure cliche. And acting was poor as well. A billionaire played by Rainn who starts a billion dollar project only looking for profit. A kid who knows everything about a modern submarine. A female lead actress who instantly find a crush over the hero. Man it felt, the animated Meg acted and had expressions better than Li bingbing. Director wasted no time in bringing the monsters from underneath as it was all seen and executed decades before in Jaws movie. There was no way to better the Jaws effect. You get lots of screen time with the meg that was actually cool to watch.Only suspense scene that i felt in this movie was when Rainn and his crew kills a whale instead of meg and what follows next was something new.So its more of a Jason statham movie than meg as he was there at each and every moment where meg appeared. Hope meg's brother doesn't come back to get revenge on Statham in the next movie. lol.P.S. @DC sack Mamoa and give statham the roll of Aquaman.",The Meg

1079,kellymkr,Half good Half terrible,3,4 November 2019,"Okay, so there are little things that really irk me with this movie. Whilst the cinematography is fantastic, some of the casting is okay and then there are so many scenes that do not make sense and are really annoying.
I.e. when the large guy is exiting through the hatch and yelling at Toshi to hurry, meanwhile he's going through the hatch as slow as humanly possible because someones gotta die right! Yippee. Then when Toshi closes the hatch he sounds so bored when he yells 'Toshi no...' honestly could they not have re-shot this and asked him to emote better. I get the impression they just didn't care and focused on how cool the shark would look meanwhile thinking the audience is too stupid to notice anyway and judging by some of the reviews they're right.Second is the acting of Bingbing Li as Suyin. English is obviously her second language and I'm sure she is a fantastic actress when speaking in her native language. However she cannot act to save herself in this film. She delivers every line so monotone. She has no emotion and constantly sounds like she's just reading straight from the script. Seriously, just watch this and listen to every line she delivers. She uses the exact same tone, exact some emotionless downright boring dialogue. How any of her lines got into the film is beyond me. It would be better if she didn't speak at all or just wasn't in the film.
When she's in the sub at the start trying to rescue the trapped people and says 'no, i can help you save the crew' and 'it's crushing me' these are two lines that should have been delivered with some semblance of emotion. I can't help but think that she couldn't do both.. get the english lines right and emote. She was probably focusing on just speaking the words right and couldn't focus on her acting skills. That, or she just doesn't know how to act.
Terrible casting. I can think of many other asian actresses who would have been much better suited to this role. I mean the girl who plays her daughter is a better actress than her, tenfold.Lastly the script is just ghastly. ""Jonas was right!!"" and then Bingbing saying 'there is something down here' like oh really!!??? you literally went down there to rescue people because of the thing that's down there. You don't need to reiterate that like this is new and surprising information (delivered with zero emotion by the way) the pacing is just painful. Stretching things out to a ridiculous degree just to create tension and thrills. Example 'firing magnetic hook, 3..2..1"" like was that countdown really necessary. Just fire it. Or when the lights won't turn off on her sub and it's like 20 seconds until they do. How stupid?? You would think a freaking high tech sub like that would have an emergency shutdown or something. But no they needed to add these ridiculous parts in order to place the female character in danger to be saved by the hero guy. This movie was too predictable and while I do enjoy watching it, I watch it a comedy and not a drama. 3/10.

1106,liattjosephmitchell,Enjoyable Watch,6,21 August 2018,The Meg was pleasantly surprising in terms of clear story which was well executed for the most part and engaged the viewer into the realms of possibility.. that this shark could still possibly be out there.The acting was woeful and the script was uninspiring.. however the fabric of the story kept the viewer interested.The shark itself seemed to be under powered at times.. and over powered in other moments.. however the suspense created from interesting camera shots worked it's magic.. although it will lack for those who desire serious bloodshed.Overall I would recommend this film to lovers of Sc-Fi rather than those of sharks.,The Meg

The premise was interesting even if as usual they played lose with physics, so what a shame that they ballsed it up. It wasn't darkly humourous enough and lacked some of those 'We're gonna need a bigger boat!' moments. The shocks weren't really shocking as the director signposts each (a sin that so many horror films are guilty of). There wasn't enough blood and even the joke aimed at shark fishermen came out like a damp squib.Will I add this to my cheap shark film collection?

Besides, Deep Blue Sea is one of my favorite movies. Although different, the similarities between the two movies are inescapable.1.) You have the Sea-Based Laboratory, 2.) the eclectic crew, 3.) the rich visitor, 4.) the no-nonsense tough guy, 5.) the funny black guy, and 6.) amazing, unyielding sharks. However, instead of trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's, this group of scientists is searching for other scientific breakthroughs.The backstory is different, there are more rescues and last second saves; and in this picture, instead of large, genetically enhanced Mako sharks- the star of this movie is the massive, thought to be extinct- Megalodon.Aside from the shark itself, no new ground was broken here. It's like a mixture of Jaws (shark size) and Deep Blue Sea (story), with a bit of Jurassic Park (scientific meddling and humor) with a spritz of The Fast and The Furious (Heroic maneuvers and saves) mixed in.It's worth a watch.

The film is what you think it is going to be , Jason Statham vs a Megaldon Shark - although this sounds like an absolutely must watch it is surprisingly hurried and rushed , poor acting , thin plots and an even thinner sub plot of the romance between Jason Statham and the leading actress , I wouldn't want to spoil the film for anyone so I recommend going to see it if you are somewhat interested in sharks, myths, action and Jason Statham. 6/10 , could of been so much better if it had a little bit more TLC.",The Meg

1130,Chrisjh2210,Decent action adventure with a big ass shark!,8,13 August 2018,"Big giant shark, fun, tongue in cheek action. What's not to like? The sad fact is nowadays every person goes into a shark movie expecting Jaws or certainly a movie to rival jaws. You cannot beat perfection and The Meg doesn't try to. It delivers exactly what it sets out to do & knows what it is. Jason Statham is a lot better than I expected in the lead role and supported by a decent cast. Yes several of them are only there to deliver quips and one liners but it's still done well. 
 Loosely based on the book Meg: A Novel Of Deep Terror by Steve Alten (if you haven't read the book series I'd suggest doing so, they are excellent). Yes it's not the same as the book but movies seldom are. If you want a good action adventure with a very big well done CGi shark then Meg is definitely worth a watch!",The Meg
1131,christianatkins-1,"Better than Jurrasic World, Meg Breathes new life into the Shark genre!",9,8 August 2018,"Just saw the movie with my 10 year old for a sneak peak and it didn't disappoint. Having read the books in 10th grade Marine Biology 20 years ago, my expectations were guarded as I knew it would stray from the science to focus on the laughs and action, and I had been anticipating a movie more in line with Piranha then Jaws, but I am pleased to report my daughter and I left with smiles on our faces and anxious to see it again, hopefully in 3D next. It's fast pace storyline makes the two hour run time fly bye, and the movie is one of the few to find the perfect balance between comedy and scares. The latter half of the movie even throws a few Jaws references in for good measure appeasing the nostalgic fans. It doesn't waste too much time into delving into silly sub-plots trying to be more than it is with political undertones like the recent Jurrasic series have but keeps a dynamic enough cast to appeal to just about anyone. 
 The movie doesnt try to hide what it is, but rather embraces the absurdity of the premise and goes full throttle to becoming the summers most satisfying, if not most surprising, big scale movies in recent memory. Lots of toungue in cheek humor for the fan boys and great special effects, only thing Id wish they did was not hold back on the gore as much, though considering the nature of the target audience this can be forgiven. Hopefully sequels don't follow the overboard campiness of other surprise hits like Piranha 3D or settle for low budget fodder like Sharknado, the story line leaves a lot of room for exploration of the mythos and source material. Meg leaves the audience wanting to chomp back for more, hopefully its not a long wait for the sequel!",The Meg

I'd suggest it for a drinking game everyone you recognise another movie but people would die.One thing that was kind of funny I have never seen a movie create so many reasons to have so many people repeatedly ""accidentally"" fall out of boats as the shark turns up; you would think the shark was magnetic.",The Meg
1135,ellenlsharman,So much fun if you take it at face value,8,30 July 2021,"A really fun film with an environmental message, feminist single mum, and lots of action. I don't know why it has been given so many bad reviews, I think it was darkly comic and a pretty stimulating watch. It's not meant to be an Oscar winner and given its inherently silly nature as a film about a giant shark, I don't think this film could have been any better. It's no cinematic masterpiece, but it's a really great watch nevertheless. I think it's actually way better than Jaws in that people are shown to have brought it upon themselves by messing with nature rather than some macho hero story where sharks must be destroyed by a bunch of men in a boat. In a very saturated genre, it brings something new to the table and holds its own, unlike many other shark films that seem like a waste of energy. I enjoyed it so much that I re-watched it with my family, who whilst understandably sceptical at first, really enjoyed it too. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to a friend as a fun lightweight watch, which is all a film like this can hope to achieve. I would say ignore the bad reviews and give it a go, it's really entertaining so long as you are not looking for an art house masterpiece.",The Meg

In my humble opinion, a heavier lean in to the finite details found in science fiction often, and a darker spin on character development - where the characters are not simply dramatic for the sake of noise, but rather, allowing the absence of drama to fill a dark chasm of its own suspense, would have greatly benefited the outcomes in this film.",The Meg

1142,nicoarciniegas,"Less ""Jaws"" & More ""Deep Blue Sea""",5,30 August 2018,"I'm not sure what I expected going into ""The Meg,"" considering that the movie's star is Jason Statham and the plot is preposterously far-fetched. However, the movie still managed to exceed even my greatest expectations for campiness. ""The Meg,"" as my review title suggests, is much less in the vein of Spielberg's classic thriller and more like recent productions such as ""Deep Blue Sea"" or even ""Sharknado."" Most of the movie's half-hearted attempts at suspense are obvious long before they come and the plot is filled with common, popcorn movie tropes like profit-hungry villainy personified by Rainn Wilson. The movie's actors were decent for the most part, actually but the characters have such ""shallow"" backgrounds that you find yourself straining to care for their survival. Spoiler alert: Some characters WILL get eaten by the Meg. In truth, I have rarely wasted time with Statham movies in the past. This is not because I have any particular animus against Statham, but because I almost always know what to expect from his wasted talents. This movie was no exception. Statham, ever the action hero, played the role with aplumb by injecting the role with typical grit and energy. Nevertheless, watching him play out a character we've seen on the screen countless times previously is exhausting, and even more so when forced to watch him repeatedly chased by a massive CGI monster that only grows more adept at successfully eating its victims. There is a plot ""twist"" (if you can call it that), which I won't ruin but it comes so late and with such little payoff that once again, I found myself yawning after the reveal.I started out watching this movie with an open-mind but was chuckling in disbelief and wondering why I didn't wait for this movie to hit Redbox, by the time the credits rolled.

1145,damonrieter,Decent underwater thriller with some bite,5,21 February 2021,"Firstly I went into this film with VERY low expectations, however it wasn't completely terrible...
We all remember when we first watched Jaws and how amazing that film has stood the test of time, we also remember Deep Blue Sea and how that was almost a comedy, The Meg sits between these in my eyes.It all centers around a gigantic Shark otherwise known as a Megaladon terrorising and underwater lab while the billionaire funding it is on a visit to congratulate the staff on their success. A pretty girl and 2 colleagues get ambushed in a smaller vessel by the shark and someone makes the decision to call in Mr Statham to save the day which he duly delivers, however, thats just the start.2 hours later the film is concluded and a few things impressed me, firstly I didn't see the twist coming and I liked it even if it wasn't particularly believable, some of the tongue in cheek lines are delivered well and some of the suspense was captured well, but, Stathams abysmal American accent coupled by some truly shocking acting from those around him made this film laughable in places, to this day I still don't know why no director has walked up to Statham and told him to stop the voice and they'll change the writing as it would be easier than listening to his attempts amusing as they may be.The Meg is a good fun action romp with many holes and flaws but, isn't unwatchable and you may even surprise yourself and actually enjoy this Holywood B movie.",The Meg

It really felt amazing to see what they could do with the shark in this.Jason Statham carries the obvious stigma of being invincible, but the rest of the story is pretty compelling as they're in imminent danger for about 90% of the movie.If you like sharks, shark movies, or are afraid of sharks, then give this one a watch.",The Meg

Things the movie and the book have in common: They both have a big shark (megalodon). The both have ""Meg"" in the title. The main character in both is named Jonas Taylor. I guess they changed the Asian scientist and his daughter from Japanese to Chinese to attract Chinese viewer since China is a bigger market than Japan. This is so common in movies these days the Chinese must be tired of such blatant pandering because they didn't turn out to see this film. The book is so much better and intelligent compared to this dumbed down action flick. I read the book and its sequels in the early 2000s and loved them but when I heard they were turning them into movies I was very worried. Worried that they would do exactly what they did. I am guessing that they will be no longer making the sequel since the movie fell flat. If you are just looking for a movie to keep you entertained for 2 hours than this might be for you. If you are looking for something that challenges you mentally and has realistic science in it as well as action then read the book.",The Meg

This movie has got plenty of teeth but doesn't follow the novel really except for the character names. The shark definitely looks more realistic then the one in jaws but you can't blame Mr Spielberg for that, after all the special effects weren't really up to par back then.

1165,dseann-105-396156,So disappointing,2,10 August 2018,This movie was pretty bad. You'd think a group of scientists (or whatever they were supposed to be) would show a little bit of anxiety or fear from a giant shark chasing them around the ocean. Nope. Not this group. They just cracked stupid jokes to each other and tried to make sarcastic remarks that missed the mark every time. One character lost her father and was smiling and making dumb jokes a minute later. So dumb.,The Meg

Or the girl who has to sit non-conventional in a chair to appear edgier? Or the forever unsupervised child who's always goes where she doesn't belong?! This movie barely beats out tha craptastic Piranha 3D. Acting is garbage, despite two great actors from two great TV shows. (Longmire and Heroes) Someome owed someone a big favor or they were about to be bankrupt and agreed to poop out this pile of nonsense. There is no consistency. There's a scene where the crew establishes that the meg is hostile towards boats, but never attacks theirs! Cuz they're being quiet? It's not a T-Rex. And why wasn't this promoted during shark week? Ruby Rose was slightly better in John Wick 2, simply because she had no speaking parts. Jason Statham, I'm sorry. But dang you look good in that unnecessary towel scene. Magic Mike 3! The British invasion! I went in with low expectations, and still came out ticked off.",The Meg

I give it one star only for the occasional wise, but still very cheesy lines (about how mankind destroys the nature) and messages (how people from different countries and backgrounds can fall in love and work together as a team).
Apart from that it's completely lame, unrealistic and boring garbage, not only from a science perspective. Those $130M should have been invested into shark preservation and protection, as well as education of people about the importance of sharks four our ecosystem and how mankind is cruelly killing hundreds of millions of them every year. For this I would have given 10 stars and standing ovations.

1171,gautamania270,"An Entertaining flick which is worth more than 4-5 stars, even 6 !",7,12 August 2018,"Before I write the review I'd like to clarify that this is the first time I have decided to write a review and only because a false impression is being created that this movie is a total waste of time with many people here doing injustice to the film with their ratings.
I watched the movie last night and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had gone to watch the film after reading the reviews here and for once even I had decided to drop the plan and save my money for an another film after seeing 2 stars in a row.Most people here have taken it out on this film because they probably set the ""Jaws"" or ""Jurassic Park"" as the benchmark here. I haven't watched Jaws and the only movie that I was expecting this film to do better than or atleast be at par with is ""Deep Blue Sea"". I have watched deep blue sea around 4 times now and I love that film. When I saw the rating of that film which is 5.8, I decided to watch this film and this further reinforced my belief that ratings many a times betray our individual liking of a movie.Most people are complaining about the misplaced humour in this film but even that didn't turn me off, the reason being that story of the film is engaging,there are no dull moments and shark scenes are on the money and amount of Gore has nothing to do with the thrill the Gigantic Shark(s) in the movie managed to create. I do admit that this film could have been better if the characters were shown gripped with fear and the chaos that could have emerged if the underwater establishment was shown falling apart, but despite all its flaws and for what its worth, it most definitely is a one time watch.

In fact, do not watch the trailer at all, cause that way you are gonna want to go see the movie, which is a totally irrational decition, coming from a person who sat 1h and 53 min in a dark room with a big screen in front of him and wanted to kill himself, cause believe me, it was genuine torture. I better run 5 km without stopping than seeing this joke over and over at the internet. It is not a blockbuster and it is not worth the attention of 64 million people or more, that payed to see it.

We have three boys. We would let them watch it and we are pretty protective of what they watch. It would be a fun family night. I do not understand why everything thinks that all movies have to be some deep social commentary. Why cannot they just be fun? A break from reality? This movie fit that mold.

The story was as good as discovering a prehistoric shark could get. There was a poor attempt at pointing out than man discovers nature then destroys it but this is half way through the huge shark literally killing everything it finds. The shark is constantly hungry or angry and attack's everything all the time but I'm not complaining because every viewer should know what they sign up for before seeing it.

So either the nuclear sub could dive about 10700 meters more then usual nuclear subs can. Because the meg was trapped in that thermo layer and the nuclear sub fell into that layer. Or the Meg was released from that themro layer much earlier and was so kind to return to there,just to be discovered by the billion dollar research project.Billion dollar research project: Why would anyone waste some 1.5 bllion just for research and later complain that a multimillion dollar rover and sub was lost.

Nobody in the history of cinema has ever done a good shark movie aside from Steven Spielberg, and this high budget thriller is no exception. I thought it would be a fun summer movie to see with my girlfriend, but nope. Don't waste your time, and rewatch Jaws.There were far too many jumpscares, to the point where the movie relied on it. The lead actor for Jonas was your stereotypical big, tough action hero, with a tragic back story. He's stoic, gets the girl, and speaks in mostly one liners, with his deep raspy voice. Nothing new, boring. There was too much humour to take it seriously. The only thing that scared you were the jump scares because it had no psychological value like Jaws. Jaws show the shark only a couple time the whole movie and it kept people out of the water, because it got into people's heads. This film had millions of dollars in CGI and didn't have the same effect. One reason is due to the humour, it's hard to tell if this film is satire at times because it sure feels like it.

Overall the movie is good. I can tell the actress is trying, but honestly the actings the entire time were not natural, looks fake. The dead sharks look fake too. I like the story, at least it has a clear ending. It was a funny movie, it should falls under action/comedy, not thriller/horror. It bother me a little bit the wedding part and the dog. How did the dog survive and the bride whine sounds ... ehhh? Many people died in the movie, but seems like no one really cares, not really strong emotion. The movie storyline seems to missing something, the action is not at the peaking level that can make audience thrill about it.

The Meg is one of those movies you can take your kids too, there are no 'f-words"", sex scenes, or anything else that is rude, it's just plain escapist fun for the next 90 minutes or so.
I don't understand why some people have to be 'so serious"" and pan this movie.
We have a great mix of action, scary moments that make you jump out of your seat and some comedy with great one liners.
Jason Statham is perfect for the role as the deep sea rescue expert who was drummed out of the military for not saving everyone in a rescue gone wrong because he confronted ""The Meg"" , a giant prehistoric shark and then things went south, as nobody believed him...now 5 years latter ""The Meg"" is back to bite everyone in the ass and eat them, and he is vindicated as in ""I told you so"" and becomes the reluctant hero to save the day.
Yes it's cheesy, funny and far fetched but it's great fun, my wife and I enjoyed it along with our friends in a movie night out, well worth the ticket.
It's beautifully photographed, the CGI effects are very good and it presents great on the big screen.

Of course, no one believes Jonas saw this rubbery shark, including a certain Dr. Heller who survived the mission.
Jonas' career, along with his marriage, ends after a dishonourable discharge.We are moved on five years, and a billionaire called Jack Morris has set up an underwater research facility off the coast of China called 'Mana 1'.

After managing to penetrate a cloud of hydrogen in the depths of the trench, they run into unforeseen difficulties and soon become aware that there is something very large lurking in the depths around them.

This is agreed by all on ''Mana '1, apart from Dr Heller who survived the original mission with Jonas. He thinks Jonas is traumatised and has lost the plot and would be a liability. After deliberation it is decided that Dr. Zhang, along with one of his colleagues, should go to see Jonas and ask for his help.

1297,annahirviranta,Pure trash,1,4 August 2019,First of all I have nothing positive to say about the director and the writer of the movie that wrote the part of killing an innocent cute beautiful and marvelous whale. It was just a young creature who had it's whole life infront of it and they just decided to take it away. This trash movie with these bad actors (apart from the whale) and sick minded script writers is unwatchable and I DO NOT recommend anyone watching this ever. I have spoken. #savethewhales,The Meg
1298,jacklangham-50910,The Meg 2018 review,3,7 August 2019,"With many rushed action scenes and an all round script that doesn't entirely suit the specific genre, The Meg isn't something that you would associate with an all time classic. Although this could be seen as a light hearted film with comedic aspects from the brilliant Rainn Wilson and comedian and rapper Page Kennedy which sometimes make you forget about the poor action sequences, this film isn't something that I would recommend. Action movie legend Jason Statham doesn't really seem bothered about this casting and you can really tell he was just after another paycheck to get him through the year with an American accent which ,in my opinion, is one of the worst I have ever heard . His reputation wont be tarnished by this movie but he was walking on thin ice after the cinematic release. A over advertised movie which clearly did not make as much as Director Jon Turteltaub and his crew though it would. Unfortunately Jon if you want to make a classic underwater horror movie, you're gonna need a bigger shark.",The Meg

1300,jenniferfischera,Why Can't A Shark Movie Actually Be Creepy And Interesting?!,1,22 July 2021,"Sometimes, when they try too hard to make a shark thriller cheesy, they end up with a dull and terrible film. The human characters are not only boring, they just didn't care to entertain the audience. There was more emotion in the actors from 1981's ""Piranha II: The Spawning"". And when the people are unappealing, it's a guarantee the starring ""monster"" shark will be beyond silly: there's absolutely nothing realistic, let alone scary, about the creature. This forgettable film is like a very low budget TV flick from the 70s or early 80s, (think ""Grizzly"" from 1976) I don't consider it an underrated classic, and I don't believe it will be, if (hopefully) people's tastes improve 20 or 30 years down the line. ""Meg"" is so awful, head shaking and eye rolling, it can't even be thought of as in the ""so bad its good"" category. I don't understand why CGI looks worse sometimes than stop motion, but it is. The Megalodon only looks a few steps better than the ""pool toy"" they used in
""The Last Shark"" another 1981 joke knock off of ""Jaws"". I remember reading the book this monstrosity (no pun intended) is loosely based on some years back, and I thought it pretty awful, but its adaptation is far more painful to get through. I'd rather they concentrate on a serious documentary of Megalodon, and focus on making the fish look convincing. You just can't trust an era that likes ""Sharknado"". Lordy.",The Meg

When the trailer first dropped, I immediately realized they weren't going to follow the book and when I saw it was going to be PG-13, I knew the studio had definitely taken a different route.
That being said, going into this movie knowing those facts really helped my enjoyment of the film.
I found it to be a very good Summer ""Popcorn"" flick that reminded me of monster movies I used to watch with my Dad.
It drug a little bit in some spots but nonetheless I found it to be a fun and entertain flick.
Plus...I can always read the book again",The Meg
1304,jgloewen,Good movie,10,25 June 2020,"Probably got so many poor reviews because for once there was a multicultural cast instead of the same white actors. It was a good movie that did what a movie was supposed to do. Make you jump a bit, laugh a bit, and feel for the characters.",The Meg
1305,ccqfcdpyx,Terrible,1,19 August 2020,"This movie is a crushing disappointment for those of us that read the original book many decades ago and dreamed of how great the movie could have been. From the beginning, getting the Meg to the screen was fraught with difficulties and several productions fell through over the years. Finally it has been made, but the original product is so compromised the only thing in common is the giant shark and some of the characters. Very little of the story survived the transition and all intelligence has been filtered out, it's really dumbed down. The sets and scenarios are now similar in tone to Deep Blue Sea with a partially underwater lab which isn't really used much. The original novel seemed like Shakespeare, compared to this. The only similar adaptation of fantastic source material which let me down this much was Queen of the Damned and they have much in common.To begin with, the film is co-financed by a Chinese company, and I feel like this has introduced lots of issues. Problems around casting, script, story, editing and location. Actors from all major global cinema markets are duly cast in roles, but the fact the Chinese actors are all having to act in English, does not seem to have been properly taken into account, because they really are not convincing especially the child actor. Characters speak in Mandarin periodically, which feels like it is to play to Chinese audiences and by the end with the beach scene, the whole movie seems like it has been recalibrated to only appeal to Chinese audiences.Mind you, Jason Statham is far from convincing either. Apart from his innate ability in the water, there is little to explain why he's been cast as what was a professor in the source material. He acts like he's just come in off of the street or from the pub reading the lines for the first time, there's just no depth to his performance, and he can't carry a movie which isn't based around martial arts. The forced semi-romantic attachment between him and Bing Bing are particularly cringeworthy because they spend very little time developing the characters and the way Statham looks at her makes me uncomfortable.The script is perfunctory, any sort of story is generally avoided and characters all speak in short, easy to translate sentences with zero nuance like it's performed by AI. Another review mentioned that there is never a sense of danger or menace as the wise cracks keep coming even with characters dying bloodlessly around them, ships being destroyed and giant sharks looking to eat them all. Nobody looks scared in the movie ever, and that detachment filters through to the audience, it's like being on a tame rollercoaster. You get some jump scares, but it mostly seems to be played for laughs which I'm not sure is completely intentional. There's a semi twist, but it's hardly explained and is just confusing.The director and Jason Statham have previously alluded to the fact that the film has been messed about with in terms of being re-edited to ensure it doesn't perturb a teen audience but lack of gore is only one aspect of why the film feels wrong. The Shark is physically huge, but doesn't behave like a living creature and is therefore unrealistic and just looks like a CGI shark. Other films like Jurassic Park manage to make this work, this does not. It's not in the same league as other shark movies like Jaws, Deep Blue Sea, The Reef and The Shallows,",The Meg

It's set in the Mariana Trench which is the deepest part of the ocean which is a bonus but I expected there to be more deaths considering its about a humungous shark. I think its just a worse version of Jaws because the shark is a lot less threatening and kills a lot less.

To be honest, since watching Jaws in the theater when it first came out, I expect a good body count when watching shark movies. This one was just ok. The terror really wasn't there, the heart thumping fear wasn't there, and the body count was minimal. This shark was supposed to be HUGE and he missed many opportunity to chow down. I read the book and the only comparison between the two is the name of the protagonist and the fact that there was a megaladon. I watch this movie frequently as I have it on Vudu but.... on a good note, Jason Stratham still looks fine! The little girl is darling as well.",The Meg
1357,dankersjane,The book is amazing and the movie nearly got there.,7,12 August 2018,"I knew going in that the movie would highly differ from the book. I took it for what it was, a loose rendition of a book. The main basics were there and yes, I am very easily entertained. The original book was published 21 years ago and concepts of it have changed; if Steve Alten had written it now, would the story be more like the present book or more like the movie? The answer is unknown. I'm happy that the book has such a great following, yet my love of the book is the reason why I wanted to see the movie... I wanted to see the Megalodon come to life before my eyes. The movie did just that, and it was amazing and scary and fun to watch. My head was still reeling from seeing the Megalodon come to cinematic life.",The Meg

1362,marleyman95,Pleasantly Surprised,7,13 August 2018,"Look, if you saw the trailer, then you know what kind of movie this is. It's a B shark movie with a massive budget. The story is sound, but the plot has some holes. The acting is pretty bad in some spots.
That being said, it was a fun movie to watch. It's not an Oscar winner. It's not some thought provoking Indie masterpiece. It's a giant shark eating things. There were some great shots, a few good laughs, and a good number of jump scares. 
I've read the books and am familiar with the story. Too many things were changed for my taste. 
Again, if you're expecting a flawless, Spielberg-esque shark film, you will be disappointed. If you're expecting a B Sci-Fi Channel monster movie, you will be pleasantly surprised. The CGI was great. The acting wasn't. Death scenes were great. The action was awesome. The believability of some things, wasn't. It's a fun movie. Take it or leave it.",The Meg

1375,jsdoad,The Shark was probably the only one acting its role - Watch it at home.,4,10 August 2018,This movie was neither that funny or exciting to keep you in your seats. The acting was sub par and the casting can be related to any spaceship/alien move ever made. You have probably heard all the jokes before and Meg's expressions were more real than the cast(Jason might be the only one acting). This was just an underwater space movie knockoff with a Meg that neither felt real or fictional enough to entertain. For entertainment purposes you should either go realistic or fictional(Godzilla style). Like the cast mentioned in their interviews there is very little gore in the movie. Watching the MEG kill and eat sharks was more entraining and gory then it just swallowing people. It tries to build the hype in some scenes only to fall ocean deep.

I must say the actors must have really NEEDED to lock in their SAG-AFTRA union credits for this years dues as this cant be serious. I mean not even slap stick funny.

1394,c-lafond,Statham saves the world (and the movie),7,21 August 2018,"Take a script very reminiscent of ""Jaws"", make the shark bigger, throw in impressive CGI, and then remove all sort of character's depth and any gory scene at post-production to appeal to a larger audience, and then call on M. Statham to save the movie from going straight to video.
Overall, the movie is very watchable, with a good pace and impressive action scenes; you just need to take advantage of non action scenes to catch your breath and get ready for the next action scene.
M. Statham, as an ex champion swimmer in real life, is very believable; from beginning to end, he shows extraordinary dedication, almost abnegation, to save not the world but this movie from disaster. We can't help but sympathise with him (the actor, not his role in the movie), with his second degree humor and improbable endeavor - we're there along with him, despite obvious reluctance, to keep the action going as the movie unfolds. In a certain way, this is how we are actually drawn into this movie. Thanks, M. Statham.
And, of course, there's Ruby Rose, who, if cast in the main female role, instead of being some obscure technician, would have given the movie a more high profile, witty, glamorous lead.
Enjoy !",The Meg

The people saying it is as bad as a The Asylum movie, must not have seen a film by The Asylum on SciFi. Special effects are far better. Action is far better. And I watch as many shark movies by The Asylum as I can, expecting nothing but cheesy B movie fun. This is quite a bit better than that.

Rescue finishes within first 30 minutes of the movie and then it gets back to being Jaws rip off. Although IMAX 3D has some good shot underwater scenes but overall the movie has nothing new to offer in second half. Prehistoric Shark is supposed to be very huge but we do not get that feeling barring few scenes here and there. From acting perspective Jason Statham's character could have been played by any other actor, and other characters don't make much impact either. Story has some weak points as well like Jasons character juggling between 2 ladies in the movie at the same place with one being his ex wife. Worthwhile to watch only on IMAX 3D for cool underwater scenes that are shot brilliantly( only reason rating it as 7).",The Meg

Why would you preemptively turn away half your potential audience by taking a comical route with the trailers? It's meant to be a THRILLER not Sharknado. Why would you not give us terrifying scenes of being eaten/swallowed/pulled under, it's a SHARK movie, genre equals HORROR.

The acting is reasonable for some actors and Jason does a ""normal"" job. Most other cast is plain bad. But thats not the movies main problem.The scientist in this movie most be a collection of the dumbest ones they could find. They do nothing in a logical manner. Just a few examples (spoilers): 1. They build a solid cage for sharks, but don't take into account this shark is much much bigger. And the case has a week door. 2. They throw each other in the water. Which is filled with sharks... 3. Everyone return to the beach when the sharks come. One group just stays in the water to be eaten. For no reason. 4. A LOT more of the previous ridiculous actions.CGI was OK.

I Had some time to kill, and I thought ""The Meg"" was a movie where you could lay back and turn your mind off for a while. Boy was I wrong! So many cringe moments, that actually made forced my brain to be turn all the way on!
Jesus christ, even Sharknado looks like a decent flick compared to this pile of trash. Horrible acting (especially from the chinese actors), almost every line, and decision making makes you cringe and laugh - and overall it feels like the director didn't know if he wanted to make a comedy or an action movie. 
This is my first review ever, but I felt like i had to warn others to not even THINK about spending money on this garbage, unless Sharknado is your favorite movie of all time and you have the intelligence of a 10 year old!

I didn't let my hopes get too high, because as a lover of shark movies, I know how poorly they can be done. From the first trailer I saw, I knew I was going to love it and I was right! I was very happy with the plot, and the science side of the movie. For once it made sense for a shark to just keep going after more and more prey because of the size of it. I will say that I wish I would have been more scared when I watched this movie. But it was definitely intense, entertaining all the way through, and even had a few laughs.",The Meg
1434,mirrorballs,Cynical by the numbers corporate mess.,4,11 August 2018,"Months of anticipation had myself and friends really looking forward to this. We second guessed it'd be a B movie schlocker and were fine with that but we expected spectacle, tension and an entertaining bloodbath. What's delivered is a diluted, lacking, child-friendly, International, corporate by numbers, marketing exercise. Whoever gave Jason Stratham the direction to do his standard schtick of a lame Clint Eastwood drag impersonator just ruined the film. Didn't they view the daily rushes and say 'Hold on a minute..... this is completely off-key and out of balance to everyone else's performance in the film "". Stratham mumbles, pouts and behaves like he's in a completely different film to all around him, wooden, robotic, contrived and nowhere near convincing. He's proven with Crank, Lock Stock, Snatch even Spy he can carry an action film with smouldering sexuality, swagger, a croak in his voice and wit. Here he's out of his depth, with a B script he's as wooden as a first timer and out of synch with everyone. The first two shark attacks are reminiscent of the original Star trek Enterprise, were the actors run from one side of the tilted set to the other. When we do finally get to see Meg half an hour in, it's CGI and as convincing as the Pixar animation in Finding Nemo / A shark's tale. Ruby Rose is stylised as an animated CGI Manga character and alot of her appearances looked lake/artificial like a fake video game avatar. The music score is saccharine swooping violins cue-ing every manipulated emotional reaction. . Beach attack nowhere near the level of creativity of Jaws or even Jaws 2, which both managed genuine menace, horror, fear, shock and suspense. Here a puppy chihuahua and a chubby glutinous asian kid are the uninteresting choice of focus. The movie of course will make a mint. A fortune. Won't matter any negative word of mouth. It's just a little above step above from that dreadful sequel to the recent Piranha reboot Piranha 3DD.(2012) You can see the cynical boardroom marketing meetings of the Asian meets West blockbuster fusion as a double bubble killer box office lucrative return, in every cynical frame transparent there undisguised on the screen. It's a film 6 to 11 year olds will really love. It's made for the uncynical awe kids have at attempted spectacle. I'd have enjoyed it at that age too. But there's little involvement, character engagement, innovation or suspenseful build up of tension to be had. There's one jump scare that's well executed, to be had, a whale is outside the underwater HQ clearly visible and of some size. It's tapping on the corridor window and singing in relaxing whale song. Out of nowhere comes The Meg and chomps it in two bites and for the first and last time the audience ejects out of their seats and nervously laughs out their tension. One last thing, the interior set design of the corridors of the underwater research station look highly reminiscent of the cult 1980 SciFi movie Saturn 3 which is actually good thing and pleasing to the eye. Good choice of set design. When people start running down the corridors, you can't help but remember Farrah Fawcett and Kirk Douglas doing the same but they were in a better movie. Let the kids go see it. It was made for their summer holiday mild dose of fear treat. They'll enjoy it as pure surface without criticism and acceptance.",The Meg

The action was ok (with little nods to a certain predecessor) but the dialogue was awfully.The so called attraction between the leads was painfully non existent. If felt like the female lead was concentrating on her english so much she forgot to act like she was meant to be interested in her co-star. And then there was the obvious half naked shots of the male romantic interest. Which of course was when she found him interesting after hating his guts 5 minutes before that.

There was s good mix of humour and action that I found comparible to lake placid.But my biggest surprise was Statham, he played the role well by being a reluctant hero to begin, and I could buy into his character, he also shares some great scenes with the little girl.I know it differed a lot to book but it was still good fun, it's a film about a 90ft shark people, enjoy it fir what it is",The Meg

Where similar films of the same genre have tried either too hard or too little, The Meg plays around with obvious tropes, lampoons itself and provides a compelling plot, likable characters and impressive special effects. The pacing is pitch-perfect and the chaos escalates delightfully with the stakes raised ever higher as the story unfolds.

Somehow, I found myself gawking on a movie called ""The Meg"". At first, I thought I was on to something cool. Unfortunately, seconds into the film cute little ""Lori"" gets a nice pat on the back for having been a successful eco-terrorist. I almost turned it off right then but I was still bored. That was really dumb...uhh, whoever came up with the idea. Luckily, there was no other mention of that kind of Hollyweird stupidity. Looking back, I kinda doubt Hollywierd was all that involved. Is there one of those in China?So, honestly, there's not much more to review. Statham is what he is, and so is everyone else. There's a couple of scary big sharks (that the SE guys didn't do a very good job in keeping with scale... at all) and some almost lovey drama. I kept waiting for the typical Hollyweird nod to gayness but alas, it never happened. I mean, unless Ruby Rose WAS the typical nod to gayness but, whatever.Different strokes for different folks I guess. I'm rating a 3/10 because, well... they tried real hard. Today, I sat through an hour plus of listening to my wife laugh like a Hyena for about an hour.5. I finally went and asked what the hell was so funny and found she'd been watching ""The Meg"". I don't know her rating, and I don't think I laughed at all. I grimaced a little, and might have smirked a grin but... no laughing.

I know it's a shark film and should know what to expect, but this was so predictable I had to tell my wife to keep quiet, as she was telling me what was going to happen next,every 5 minutes and every time she was correct !
There are some scenes that are almost a Jaws clone but there is none of the suspense or shock, so brilliantly delivered in the original Spielberg offering.
The worst part of the film for me, was the poor humour and one liners, relentlessly thrown about. One minute somebody's best friend, or father is killed, next minute everyone's having a giggle about some crap shark joke, seconds before the ship they are on, is about to be attacked. Too much corny humour and not enough suspense.

Film today is at an all time low. Depressing, actually. I literally spent 40 dollars for a trip with my lady to see this. Unreal. They wonder why pirating has become such a problem.

Not only that but you don't even see the shark that much. Characters aside, the plot moves quickly, leaving gaping plot holes that are only partially filled once the movie backtracks to fill them in. The characters constantly announce things, in almost an insulting manner that implies that the audience can't figure things for themselves. Rain Wilson's performance as the semi-charismatic, greedy evil billionaire is severely lacking and leaves the audience wanting more. Speaking of wanting more, the meg's inevitable death is disappointing and one can't help but wish that a more epic end met the shark.

1483,chrismilligancem,"Biased book fan - don't skip this film, but don't be surprised if you leave a bit let down",6,10 August 2018,"I am a SUPER fan of Steve Alten's novels. I have read them multiple times, the Meg series, and I am about 3/4 through Generations currently.With that being said, I ultimately was disappointed with The Meg. And it's not just the changes from book-to-film, I understand those are bound to happen. What is most tragic to me is the sense of adventure lacking in this movie and the fact that you can tell this movie was cut to ribbons and stitched together fairly decently.I don't really know where to start, but here goes. The movie opens with a deep sea rescue mission. Statham and his team are down ""there"" trying to get people in distress out of a deep sea submersible. How did they get there? What happened to the sub? Even facts as simple as where exactly are they is lost here. On-screen text tells us we are in the Phillipine something or other, but isn't the Meg supposed to be in the Mariana Trench? I could just be misremembering but I still took issue with the lack of getting a feel for where we are and who we are supposed to care about in this opening scene. It's obvious from the jump that at least some of these people are dead meats for the sake of Statham's back story.Before I lose my train of thought completely I think Statham is great in parts and shows why he can totally carry a movie. The little girl is fantastic, she is cute, has comedic timing and is just a treat whenever she's on screen. I also enjoyed Rainn Wilson because I'm a stooge for The Office but when he makes the heel turn, it's from nowhere because up until that point we haven't seen ANY sign that he is anything other than a compassionate billionaire. There needs to be a sign of him constantly seeming disingenuous but we don't get that. Everyone else is pretty meh in my opinion, stone-faced as it were.Super spoiler - the shark they catch, the one that gives them a run for their money at first, isn't the main Meg. We don't know the lineage or if these sharks are related at all but we do get a great scene of the REAL Meg making a meal of it's smaller buddy at the expense of their boat. The reveal that there is another, bigger Meg is fine but confusing in terms of film because are we to believe that's the one that attacked in the opening or the other, smaller Meg?The thing the books have and that I can't stress enough why you should seek them out is GORE. Descriptive imagery and fascinating scientific information make you feel like you are in this world where Megalodon's are actually back atop the food chain. Alten's dialogue can be cringe-inducing at times but it's a minuscule price to pay for otherwise page-turning media.Overall, The Meg is a solid ""Dad Movie"" it's exciting but not too exciting and I think it's better than any other shark film except the original Jaws. It has humor, a medium amount of action and the CGI is effective. Statham is bad-ass and the rest of the cast is sufficient enough to help with the heavy-lifting. I almost forgot, Cliff Curtis is excellent as usual. I'd recommend it but I just can't rate it any higher because of personal bias.",The Meg

These supposedly passionate scientists make this amazing discovery; they find a prehistoric shark that was thought to be extinct for over 2 million years. They chase it out of its habitat and the movie becomes a mission to kill this rare creature. There is no compassion on the scientists' behalf, they completely disrespect its life. They call it names, and eventually kill it in cold blood. After they kill it, they cheer in triumph. No signs of remorse of their project gone wrong. Also, they put in this annoying little girl just to try to make us empathetic for the people who ultimately kill the megladon. She becomes a strangely relevant character with no substance. The Meg is a horrible money grab. It is horribly done. It doesn't even make up for it with the fun campiness of other shark movies.",The Meg

1489,jggregory-02928,Jaws remake without the quality of characters.,4,13 November 2018,"*Spoiler Alert* I have seen quite a few shark movies, and this one ranks up there with Sharknado. But, at least Sharknado never tried to be anything more than a satire. The premise being so outrageous it could not help but be a campy B-Movie, to be taken with a grain of salt and watched after a late night drinking binge. The Meg, however, attempts to be more and fails miserably. The mere fact that it steals so many plot lines from Jaws, badly I might add, is laughable. There are so many scenes that are stolen directly from the classic 70's movie that it defies logic.
Jaws Plot Point: Lets pump the shark full of lethal drugs.
The Meg: Check
Jaws: Giant shark swims under boat
The Meg: Check
Jaws: Shark Cage in the water destroyed by shark where non-Protagonist secondary character barely escapes.
The Meg: Check
The list goes on and on.... But just in case... Lets throw in three floats attached to the shark, dragging them behind him as he swims... Now where have we seen that before... I wonder... Bottom line... As movies go, it is not the worst thing I have ever watched, but, just expect a bad remake of Jaws going in. Or better yet... Just watch Jaws...You'll be better off all around...

After a phenomenal breakthrough, it was discovered that the Megalodon species isn't extinct. After a lot of deaths, his team failed multiple times to take control upon the situation, (because they are pathetic idiots) he decided to do it on his own. Dwight and his team went to hunt the monster. After his team panicked, he fell from the boat. Dwight believed in his powerful ancestry and went for a PvP with the Megalodon.

1502,ChrisMartinez_,A very forgettable summer blockbuster,5,9 August 2018,"While this film is very enjoyable; unfortunately, The Meg (2018) is a throwaway summer blockbuster and mediocre at best. The film's lack of character development, along with less than stellar performances by the majority of the cast, ultimately hindered my ability to feel any remorse or sympathy for certain characters, nor did I develop any emotional connection with characters. Not all is grim; luckily, the film's lead, Jason Statham, delivered a very pleasant performance. Statham carried the film from the opening scene, all the way through until the end credits. Statham was a charismatic badass and stole every scene in which he was physically present, and without him, the film would have failed. And besides Shuya Sophia Cai's adorable Meiying, this is where the praise for performances end. Li Bingbing's addition was an obvious attempt to appeal to the foreign audience, and the rest of the supporting cast gave forgettable performances. It was plainly obvious certain characters were written for the sole purpose of having an action scene transpire by making costly decisions or for plot convenience. From a technical standpoint, The Meg (2018) was a fest for the eyes; the CGI and special effects were very crisp and believable, except for a shot near the end of the film involving the meg itself and Statum. The sound design was great, as it really brought the extinct titanic meg to life. The final positive of the film was it's consistent pacing; there were small amounts of the extended expedition, which ultimatly hurt the film's character development, and plenty of intense shark action. In conclusion, The Meg is nothing more of a shallow plot strung together with cool shark action scenes and unnecessary, poorly written characters. I would not recommend this film, especially after considering the fact that other, more enjoyable summer films, such as Mission Impossible: Fallout or even the lighthearted Teen Titans Go to the Movies, are other options for a trip to the movies.",The Meg

We both loved it! Maybe that's why we liked it so much. We had no thoughts that this would be the next Jaws or super gory since it was rated PG13. We were greatly surprised at how much we both genuinely like it. It was fun with great lines in my opinion. Yes it was predictable but these kinds of movies usually are. Being a parent I was thankful that even though it's rated PG13 there were not curse words slathered everywhere. So it was a good family film too. Which I get why that may make people mad.

However I am keen to point out, this isn't the film of the Steve Allen book, but it's lovely based on it. If you go expecting that story you will come away disappointed. If you go, expecting a good shark film, then you'll be happy. I loved it. It's a huge prehistoric shark for heavens sake - it's like Jaws x 10. Whilst the films tone is vastly different, there are great characters and if anything I think a bit too much character development. The story is great, fast paced, with plenty of action scenes. There are some huge jump out moments and I honestly screamed out loud. It's exciting. The megalodon, the star of the piece is so well done - I'd say it's the best CGI stark to date. The movement is super realistic, with speed and grace just like a real shark. So many previous shark films were let down by crap CGI sharks, but this time it works well.

1511,billie-43124,It's a shark movie.,9,13 August 2018,"This film is a shark movie, plain and simple. Anyone walking into the theater expecting to see the new Jaws is missing the point. Jaws was iconic in its own time and is an incredible feat of hard work, there's no denying that. But it is also a movie about a shark. The Meg isn't trying to hide from the fact that it's a shark movie, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. It knows what it is and it embraces it, but it also alters it for a new audience who didn't see themselves reflected in Jaws and needs that in a film in order to feel connected. It also turned some overused and expected movie tropes on their head and it didn't feel forced to me, although I could see how some might say so. Rather, I interpreted it as ""we know what you think is going to happen, we know you're waiting for it, but we won't do it because we know you're expecting it."" It also addresses some things about sharks that I felt were worth addressing in other films but were not. The science felt almost plausible, I'm sure people have considered the science behind the film to potentially be something worth exploring. Aside from the plot itself which I've already discussed, this is the first time I've seen Jason Statham in a film and didn't actively root against him. His character was a little more witty than usual, but still felt familiar. The side character were less fleshed out but had more feeling to them and although Stathams character was not incredibly deep, he had the ability to save the others and it connected me to the character. It's unclear whether it was meant to be set up this way, but as each character is a hero in their own way at some point during the film, I would say yes it was intentional. Additionally, I was relieved to find that it wasn't uncomfortable to take my younger sibling to see the film, as there were no sexual situations, which are often added to action movies to draw eyeballs.

Let me get this straight, in this movie we have not just an ordinary shark, but a mammoth predator with millions of years of predatory instincts, and yet somehow everyone keeps managing to evade it. Some of the characters survived close calls multiple times, and I kept thinking this is getting ridiculous. It was completely unrealistic, and just flat patronizing after a while, as if the writers think we are all children and can't handle seeing anyone not make it out alive....except the older white men, of course, as the liberal progressive film makers now days always have it. And why does the dog always have to make it? Really? A 3 pound dog manages to out-swim a Megaladon shark, and is in the water at least 20 minutes or longer? I have watched pretty much every shark movie ever made and this is by far the lamest one I've ever seen. And please, what was with the romance between those two main characters?

This is a dumb shark movie with some good effects but the best bits depend on the inherent humour and repartee of the cast. Statham, in particular, is funny, sweet and sexy, all at the same time. Bingbing Li has a good presence and you feel a chemistry between them. That's true throughout the cast. The friendship of the characters are very apparent and that adds greatly to the loss. Some of the humour is brilliant. I won't spoil but the Finding Nemo quote had the cinema in hysterics. The little girl was cute but never annoying. The little visual jokes worked well and could bring me to watch it again, just to spot them. The submarines were cool, in a sort of 60s sci-fi sense. I loved the names of them, but that's just the geek in me. 
The cinematography in the early scenes, the underwater and deep sea stuff, was visually stunning. When the sub dropped the lights in the deep sea trench to reveal the multitude of weird creatures was superbly done. The twist when they caught the Meg was obvious but the way it was played for laughs made up for this, a bit.
I have to admit, I went to see this movie because I'd already seen the movies I wanted too. But it was a big surprise. Not just a dumb shark movie but a nicely crafted piece of work, carried by some rather good actors playing genuinely nice characters.",The Meg

I've watched The Meg on 3D at the local cinema. At first you see the second genre being horror. However, except for some action scenes with Jason Statham and a couple of decent jokes and acting from the other artists the movie didn't really provide anything... The parental age control is set at 12. From a non-sense ""big shark, existance from millions of years"" to a minimal and absolutely insane and unreal ""fighting with the shark"" scenes. Also the movie is not legit and not scripted very well as there are many film blunders in it. Overall, in my personal opinion, it is totally pointless to go to the cinema, spend some bucks to watch some 3D action and ""horror"" scenes, because there were not any. I would only recommend this movie to teens (14-18) and if they have any membership to watch it at home. I don't think that they are many people in a different age range that will ""like"" this movie, especially for adults.I've watched more than 2000 movies, this is one of the worst I've ever watched.

1545,ft-56750,Great fun summer movie,8,18 August 2018,"I wanted to catch a movie this weekend that was funny, adventurous and had a serious plot but not too serious...the meg hit the spot. It made me laugh, tear up and clinch my seat all in one sitting...so, an awesome flick in my book. The movie took me away from the real world and Into the depths of the ocean to an undiscovered paradise and that's where the real adventure begins...then is nonstop to the end, really what I needed. Statham is awesome as always that ""ripped SOB"" always fun to watch and the rest of the cast were really cool as well specially the charming little girl in the flick who was the cutest and smartest little person at that ocean station ;). This is the perfect adventure movie to go see if you want a fun evening with the family.",The Meg

As Chinese, I don't feel comfortable when I saw the sence that happened in Sanya. I am wondering whether American people have some misunderstandings about China?

I cant think of the reasons why they have to kill the shark since every creatures has the rights to live on earth and yet they are so proud of torturing the sharks when the ocean is where they belong to. Why human?WHY?

1550,garytan-38412,Lots Of Room For Improvement,5,20 August 2018,"I signed up to write this review, because I was ultimately disappointed in the film, and I thought a lot could be done better. CGI and the special effects were crisp and believable. The music, the sound design are all did quite nicely. But before CGI and effects were introduced into modern films, what do we all look for? Strong delivery of a story, and brilliant acting. Unfortunately, that's where it was lackingJason Statham did very well, so I won't touch on him. Li Bing Bing, gorgeous lady, but her performance was just okay, like in Resident Evil Retribution. Both roles could be a whole lot better if Directors gave a damn in their characters' development. Throughout this film, it is SAID to be, but the actors' delivery DO NOT show me that Zhang (Winston Chao) is the strict dad towards Suyin (Li Bing Bing). This is why I don't feel a strong emotional connection between them, and so I can't feel any sympathy when Zhang dies and Suyin mourns. And cut to next scene. WTH. The daughter just sits up straight on the boat. It's like her father's death is not much of a deal to her. And when she covers his face. IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS DIRECTOR. I want to see Suyin's emotional breakdown, confronting the fact that her father is really dead, and slowly, cover his face. Where's the emotional delivery? Where's the sense of loss? Hey. It's a MEGALODON. Why does it seem like NO ONE (Jonas, Suyin, Meiying) was frightful at that thing, an extinct, gigantic merciless killing machine? I know Suyin is a professional, but upon first contact with something totally unexpected and jeopardised your daughter's safety, wouldn't you have screamed, eyes wide with terror, on tenterhooks? I'm not sure whether to blame the actress' poor delivery, or the director. I know comedic elements have to be inserted somewhere, but man, I hope that's not all a black guy could be!! I don't want to see DJ (Page Kennedy), all the time, making attempts at humour or cheesy one liners! There is a time to be a joker, there are times to be serious. I want to see, his professional side. I want to know how does he contribute to the team, instead I just see a burden. And, sorry, the portrayal of the Chinese. I'm not sure if it's the Director's decision to make the Mainland Chinese look like self-centered idiots. I mean, geez, the bride's friends are in the water. Pin Pin is in the water. ""PIPPIN!! MY PIPPIN!!"". Yeah, you continue to stand there and shout. When they see the Megaladon, she STILL stands there and shouts for PinPin, not caring for her friends, not doing anything. I just want to whack her. If the Director is trying to make the audience want to slap the lady, it worked for me. In conclusion, good post production, poor character development and delivery. This is the first time in a long well I left a cinema discontented, and I do not recommend this movie unfortunately, I'm sorry.",The Meg

At moments we were quivering in our pants, others quite literally peeing in our pants, from laughter.

I just want to watch a movie that keeps me wanting to watch, one that keeps me entertained. This did the job. I enjoyed the action along with the comedic relief. I was surprised who died and didn't die. It was not predictable. It has multiple missions and I think that's the reason it was so easy to watch this almost 2 hr movie. I never felt that it dragged on.

Cute kids involved in the story as the adults deal with prehistoric monsters - check! Awesome special effects showing realistic prehistoric monsters - check! Witty dialogue with a couple awful puns and a few great one liners - check! Scary sudden monster attacks but not a lot of gore - check! And just a dash of (circumstantially unbelievable) romance sprinkled into the plotline - check!Yep! The Meg pretty much followed the Jurassic Park formula for a successful summer monster movie. And it worked just fine. I doubt it will cause anyone severe nightmares or an extreme phobia of going swimming. This is not ""Jaws"".The Meg is an exciting, well-done monster flick I would recommend (especially in 3D)!!!",The Meg
1563,muhammadrezk,"Boring story, Mediocre acting , Good graphics",3,30 August 2018,"The actors charchters are not well linked together, the story shows them getting incredibely close to eachothers in absolutely no time, also they took many deaths in the team very well, grieving for 20-30 seconds tops! And then proceed with the next scene, make some jokes around as if nothing happend (the girl's dad died, the guy from the first sub who's friend died ...etc)Then the billionaire's death... REALLY?! they just dropped him from the boat?! Its one of the worst shark movies, in my opinion its a good casting for Jason Statham (character-wise) but in the wrong movie (plot & full-cast wise).",The Meg

I mean yes he ate there friends and all, but it was there fault for intruding in the Meg's home(with the lights on), plus the doctor gave himself up for the shark. The Meg was not a threat for alllll those years, the only reason he is now... is because they bothered him and he resurfaced.

1566,jquartiano,Lame,4,31 August 2018,"The movie is filled with cheap errors that make it hard for me to ""suspend my disbelif"". Examples: when cast is in water often times the next scene will appear and the cast is no longer wet even though seconds before they were submerged into water. Example 2: The man dude (Transporter Guy) Is seen attempting to outswim The Meg and then gets pulled to saftey by and wire line. I found it hard to believe a person would be pulled to saftey while being chases by a shark. The shark would kill you. The movie was a B movie without the cast really embracing that. The charactors on many occasions ""Count their chickens before they hatch"" Many time they assume the killed the shark without actually having any proof, at one point they even blow up a whale and just assume it was the shark and wind up getting attacked. Also one character playfully jumps into the ocean after another ""Meg Death"" and I thought it was plain dumb for their not to be a single other shark species in the water with him at that time. Anyways the movie really sucked. I am a fan of ""B movies"" and cheesy horror and gore films but this one was none of what I was looking for.",The Meg
1567,lolanecesitahogar,Popcorn Movie,3,12 September 2018,"The Meg, an action and adventure movie, directed by Jon Turteltaub, and written by Dean Georgaris and Jon Hoeber, is a cliché movie in which a former expert diver, the leading actor Jason Statham, now a heavy drunkard, has to go back to action to save the world from a 21 mts long prehistoric shark. This assassin shark was accidentally released from an icy barrier of hydrogen sulphide, and now it swims freely until the always present hero comes up with the idea that will prevent people from perishing at its jaws. Jason's usual unexceptional performance is demanded, and a demanding audience could agree on his lines luck of originality. It could be said that it is nothing but a popcorn movie with some entertaining and humorous moments to enjoy. Special effects are not always credible, and most of the times are overexaggerated. So, if you do not have anything to do, and you want to waste a couple hours of your life, go to the cinema, at least this movie is not an enormous disappointment to watch.",The Meg

Wait just a small shark or a hammer shark or a white shark or..? Nope fuck it, it's Jason Statham lets make him fight a megalodon. And with what? A sub or a boat? Nope knife and spear.

1575,harrisonstrowbridge,Wow.,2,1 October 2018,"Spoiler alert! Well after hearing mixed emotions from multiple people I decided to finish off my Sunday night with a movie and popcorn. Wow was I wrong for picking this one. ""The Meg"" starts off as a moderately decent movie with good intentions but quickly loses it most ambitious plot line by not even mentioning it after the first 25 minutes of the movie. The movie could've been 2 stars better by dragging out the Mariana Trench scene and building tension and character value. Strike one. After Jason makes it down into the trench the writers decide they want to build tension by killing off a small character in the movie right off the back. This death is a bad move and could've been better played out by giving the audience something to feel bad about. All we know about this character is that he has a wife and he likes sexual jokes so that makes him important. Strike two. The characters undoubtedly have potential but that's just not what we get from this movie. The emotional bond is broken by initiating a fight scene every 5 minutes and not building an emotional bond with any character. I love a movie that you feel like a character is your friend that you've known for awhile. The Meg gives you no attachments at all and leaves you just laughing at the terrible acting and CGI put forth by this team. Im not a movie critic and I'm not going to post on every movie I watch. With that said this movie is such a waste of 2 hours of your life that you might as well just find a different movie to watch. Now if you're in the mood to make fun of a movie for its many mistakes and bad acting ""The Meg"" is your movie; but the for anyone looking for an enjoyable experience you should probably skip this one.",The Meg

1582,christianlieb-69434,A disappointment,4,6 November 2018,"Having read the books by Steve Alten I was pretty psyched, when I heard that the first book of the series would be finally turned into a movie. His books combine some interesting theories of marine biology with science fiction.What didn't I like about the movie then?The escape of the Meg from the Mariana trench - it just followed the gliders?When the Meg pursues its prey, all you see is the giant fin. Just like in Jaws.Jason Statham is great as an action movie star. However, he cannot portray the broken figure of Jonas.All the scientific nature of the books got lost.Bad dialogues all over the place.So what do we have here then? I'd say it's a slightly better version of Deep Blue Sea. At least when it comes to the animation of the shark, when you can actually see it. Which isn't that often.I understand that the Chinese market has become one of the most important markets for movies. However, letting the Meg go to Chinese shores, while some Chinese actors show some of the worst performances I have ever witnessed, it is just too much pandering to the audience.Then it's the language: When the female lead role speaks English, the pronunciation is over the top, and I can hardly listen to her without feeling put into an English lesson at school again.Overall: The whole movie makes you squirm. The action is ok. The ""romantic"" story totally unrelatable. And the Chinese tourist masses, who spend their lazy days at the overcrowded sea shores: I'd want them all to be eaten.That movie in the cinemas in 3D was acceptable popcorn cinema, but it didn't live up to the expectiation I had for that movie.

How does the dog get in to the ship that it was on the move??? At some point they used a device with the voice of a whale so they attract the shark.....The shark of course ate that device. Why didn't they use explosives on that device ????????????? Also, the shark eats only the people that are no longer useful in the movie.
